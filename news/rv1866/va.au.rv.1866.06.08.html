                    <p>When the Southern armies surrendered it was with the idea that they and their
                        people would be allowed all the rights they had in the Government prior to
                        accession. This then was the ultimatum of the northern leaders and found an
                        authentic mouth-piece in President Lincoln, who frequently declared that
                        with the laying down of arms and cessation from hostilities, the full
                        restoration to rights, &amp;c., would and should follow, Congress, on
                        several occasions, expressed in strong language, its sentiments on the
                        subject declaring that the war was waged, not for conquest, but for the
                        preservation of the Union. More than a year has elasped since the brave
                        spirits commanded by Lee and others gave up the contest and betook
                        themselves to the peaceful pursuits of life, and yet the States forming the
                        late Confederacy are admitted to no rights they formerly possessed, which
                        was frequently promised them. They are simply vouchsafed the onerous
                        privilege of paying taxes. It would seem but just that the object for which
                        the war was commenced and prosecuted to successful consummation should be
                        carried out in good faith. On the contrary, the spirit of fantastical hate
                        and vindictiveness seems to be more rampant than during the war. This is
                        plainly patent to all who have scrutinized the acts and doings of Congress
                        and shines forth conspicuously, in all the glare of violent partizanship, in
                        the report of the Reconstruction Committee. Their unjust attempt at a
                        wholesale disfranchisement of the Southern people met a just fate in the
                        Senate, by the unanimous disapproval of that particular clause in their
                        proposed Constitutional amendment, yet an equally unjust substitute was
                        offered and adopted as follows:</p>
                    <p>Section 3. That no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,
                        or Elector of President or Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or
                        military, under the United States or under any State, who, having previously
                        taken an oath as a member of any State Legislature, or as an executive or
                        judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United
                        States, has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given
                        aid and comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of
                        two-thirds of each House remove such disability.</p>
                    <p>This substitute would exclude the very best men of the South, who being men
                        of merit were forced into public positions and office, and in a great
                        measure took part in the rebellion. Aside from this it is unjust to single
                        out and cause to suffer, for a whole people, any particular class of
                        community. They are no more guilty than those of us who have thrust their
                        positions upon them. They were the mere servants of the masses and did but
                        their bidding. For the same reason we have urged the injustice of trying the
                        Southern people in the person of their late chief magistrate, Jefferson
                        Davis, who is doubly endeared to them at this day from the sufferings
                        already endured for obeying their behests.</p>
                    <p>We are unrepresented and can simply protest against such injustice but we say
                        to the implacable, disfranchise all and eternally-confiscate and
                        impoverish-send forth as homeless exiles, or behead, if the Gods fanaticism
                        can be propitiated in no other way, but for the sake of justice and right,
                        take no revenge upon any particular man or class of men for the acts of a
                        whole people.</p>

                    <p>We learn that a maimed Confederate soldier passed through this place a few
                        days since on his way to Kentucky. He was imprisoned at Camp Scott,
                        Wisconsin, which was established as a camp of retaliation, and, still on
                        crutches, has just succeeded in working his way from there this far towards
                        his destination. He states that he was not allowed to communicate with his
                        friends at home, in Virginia, and arrived there to find his mother dead and
                        buried some eight weeks before and all her property destroyed and hence is
                        trying to reach his sister in Kentucky. He says there were, when he left,
                        1800 wounded men at Camp Scott, in a very deplorable condition, to whom the
                        Government had ceased to issue rations, and not being furnished with
                        transportation, are unable to get to their homes. Not being allowed to write
                        during their imprisonment, doubtless, many of them are thought to dead by
                        their relatives and friends. It is but just to these unfortunate men that
                        they be furnished facilities for getting to their homes, and we ask our
                        northern confreres, and especially those in the North West, to inquire into
                        and make public the condition of things at Camp Scott, and aid, to the
                        extent of their ability, in having these poor, neglected Confederates

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We copy below an extract from the card of the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, lately
                        published in the National Intelligencer, in reference to the strictures of
                        Mr. Trumbull in the U. S. Senate against him, for having endeavored to get a
                        copy of the petition and signers presented from this county to the Senate by
                        Mr. Trumbull.</p>
                    <p>"I take it for granted that Mr. Trumbull has been imposed on by some
                        designing knave, for I cannot, persuade myself that he had a deliberate
                        purpose to do me wrong.-Be that as it may, I oppose to the imputation
                        contained in Mr. Trumbull's remarks an emphatic denial of its truth.</p>
                    <p>My connection with the matter of the petition was simply this: Some weeks ago
                        I learned from the newspapers that Mr. Trumbull had presented to the Senate
                        of the United States a petition purporting to be signed by 146 citizens of
                        my county, asking that Federal troops should be sent back, because loyal
                        citizens could not get justice in the civil courts, and were in constant
                        danger of personal injury.</p>
                    <p>Being a lawyer by profession, in continual intercourse with the people, and a
                        regular attendant on the courts, I knew these statements to be untrue, and
                        naturally felt indignant at such an imputation on the integrity of our
                        magistrates and the good faith of our people. I inquired of many of our
                        citizens if they knew anything, or had previously heard anything, of the
                        petition or the alleged causes of grievance. The answer was invariably in
                        the negative. I therefore concluded that a fraud had been attempted on the
                        Senate, and wrote a letter to Hon. J. M. Howard, (with whom I had formerly
                        served in Congress,) expressing doubts as to the authenticity of the paper,
                        and affirming that the allegations in the petition were untrue, and
                        requesting that he would send me a copy of the petition and of the names of
                        those who were alleged to have signed it. To this letter Mr. Howard replied
                        on the 7th instant, an dafter expressing his belief that signatures were
                        genuine, from the fact that they were attested by a notary public, he added:
                        "The document is now in possession of the Military Committee, and they
                        object to a copy being furnished."</p>
                    <p>After receiving Mr. Howard's letter, I had nothing further to do with the
                        subject. I had discharged what I believed to be my duty, as a good citizen
                        and and the representative elect to Congress from my district, and I was
                        content. If I had meditated any partisan or vindictive purpose toward "loyal
                        men" I certainly would not have sought the aid of Mr. Howard in carrying it
                        into effect.</p>
                    <p>The sequel would seem to show that my original suspicions were well founded.
                        A copy of the petition and of the names of the alleged signers have been
                        procured and published, but not through any agency of mine. Thereupon a
                        large number of the supposed petitioners have published cards, some denying
                        that they had ever signed, or authorized any one else to sign, their names
                        to any such paper. Others declare that the nature and object of the petition
                        were misrepresented to them. It further appears from these cards, that while
                        Dews, who seems to have been the active agent in getting up the petition, as
                        well as the acting notary public, swears that all the petitioners are
                        citizens of Augusta, in fact, many of them reside in Rockbridge, and others
                        in Pendleton county, West Virginia.</p>
                    <p>One of the petitioners, a baker by trade, has had the candor to acknowledge
                        that eh signed it, and that he did so because he had found the United States
                        troops profitable customers when they were here before, and he thought if
                        they were sent back they would enlarge his market for bread. Probably others
                        were influenced by motives equally patriotic and disinterested."</p>

                    <p>WE were present on Thursday evening. May 31st at St. Francis' Church, and
                        witnessed with pleasure the ceremonies of the occasion.</p>
                    <p>A number of young ladies, dressed in white, adorned with flowers and wearing
                        wreaths, were formed in procession and marched into the church, singing
                        "Mary, My Mother," where, after a solemn piece of music by the "Stonewall"
                        Band, they were addressed in a happy and appropriate manner by Rev. Father
                        Bixio. After the Litany by the choir, the ceremony set apart for the day
                        viz: the crowning of the "Blessed Virgin Mary" followed, the choir singing
                        "Memorare" and immediately thereafter the ceremony of consecrating the
                        children to the "Blessed Virgin," when the choir sang the "May Hymn."</p>
                    <p>The ceremonies in the church being concluded the procession, singing "Merry
                        May" moved out of the church to the floral throne, placed in a bower, neatly
                        constructed of evergreens and flowers, where they performed the interesting
                        ceremony of crowning "Queen of May."</p>
                    <p>After the rendition of a piece by the Band, Miss N. Collins delivered an
                        address welcoming their chosen Queen, Miss S. McMahon, who was escorted to
                        and seated on her throne by her "maids of Honor." Never did bower shelter a
                        fairer Queen, nor did Queen ever wear her newly acquired honors with more
                        becoming dignity.</p>
                    <p>Miss S. Murry delivered the Coroner's address and crownded Miss McMahon
                        "Queen of May," when the Sceptre Bearer, Miss M. O'Brien, delivered an
                        address, and transferred the floral sceptre into royal hands. The Queen
                        replied in a beautiful and touching address, delivered in excellent style,
                        and the Band followed in one of its most happy strains.</p>
                    <p>Next in order came the "Invitation to the Flowers," in which various flowers
                        were personated by the young ladies, all of whom performed their parts with
                        credit to themselves and added great interest to the occasion.</p>
                    <p>The Queen then delivered her closing address, and, after another dulcet
                        strain from the Band, was escorted other home by the participants in the
                        coronation.</p>
                    <p>Thus ended the interesting ceremony. May the lovely Queen and her fair court
                        live to participate in and enjoy many like ceremonies, so full of interest
                        and so innocent.</p>

                    <p>Wm. A. Abney was selected as foreman of the Grand Jury, and the following
                        indictments and presentiments were made:</p>
                    <p>Indictments against Robert F. Craig for grand larceny. Judge Sheffey being
                        interested as Counsel, this case was postponed until the July Special Term
                        (when Judge Watson, of Albemarle, will preside,) and Mr. Craig admitted to
                        bail in the sum of $7000 for his appearance.</p>
                    <p>Two Indictments against A. W. Greaver for grand larceny. Tried on first
                        indictment and found guilty of petit larceny and sentenced by the court to
                        imprisonment in the county jail for six months.</p>
                    <p>Indictment against Franklin Greaver for petit larceny. The trial of this case
                        was also postponed until the end of the July Special Term, on account of the
                        inability of the Judge to sit in the case.</p>
                    <p>Indictments against Henry Woodson (colored) for house-breaking &amp;c.,
                        case tried and prisoner found guilty-verdict for three years in the
                        penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>Indictment against Peter Randsom (colored) for house-breaking &amp;c.;
                        case tried and prisoner found guilty-verdict of the Jury for three years in
                        the penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>Indictment against Robert Lewis (colored) for grand larceny; case tried and
                        prisoner found guilty-verdict of Jury for three years in the penitentiary. A
                        new trial was granted in the case.</p>
                    <p>There were sever presentments for minor offences.</p>
                    <p>The civil docket is unusually large.</p>

                    <p>WE call the attention of our readers to the card of C. L. Peyton &amp;
                        Co., in this issue. Col. Peyton is well known to our people, having held the
                        position of Enrolling Officer in this Congressional District for some time
                        prior to the close of the war. However unpopular his position, yet by his
                        mild and gentlemanly deportment, he won the esteem of all with whom he was
                        brought in contact. He was a gallant soldier during the war, and although
                        losing an arm at second Manassas, which would have entitled him to an
                        honorable discharge, yet as soon as he was able he took command of his
                        regiment and led a charge at Gettysburg, where he was again wounded. He has
                        now settled amongst us to gain an honest livelihood, by opening the Virginia
                        Hotel Feed and Livery Stable and Repairing Shops. We bespeak for him the
                        patronage of a generous public, who should always take pride in rewarding a
                        gallant and unfortunate soldier.</p>
