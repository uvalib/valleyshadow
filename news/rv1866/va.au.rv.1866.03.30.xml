                    <p>The people of the South have looked with longing eyes to the acts of Congress
                        for some light to break on the darkness of their condition, but have looked
                        in vain. Compelled to give up the unequal struggle they had borne, with
                        heroic zeal, for four years, and, having yielded in good faith to the fiat
                        of the successful Northmen, they set about to show their acquiescence in the
                        settlement, forever, of the questions which had vexed the sections for so
                        long a period, and did all that was required at their hands. Under the
                        circumstances they naturally looked to the successful section for a
                        moderation, and an exhibition of liberal ideas which would again set this
                        once happy country on the high way of prosperous progress. Instead of a
                        kindness of feeling to the Southern people, which would have challenged the
                        admiration of the world, removed all the bickerings of the past and made the
                        people the most united and happy, and our country the most prosperous of
                        nations, we find in the Nation's Legislature a seeming determination to
                        irritate, rather than appease, and a desire to plunge our section into the
                        lowest deep of humiliation and despondency. Is it a wonder then that the
                        ambitious, both for fame and prosperity, should leave our sunny South to
                        seek a home in more favored localities? The wonder to us is rather that so
                        few have left the land of their nativity.</p>
                    <p>While we can not find fault with those who have thus gone from us, yet we
                        counsel the many who are still here not to despond of the future. The dark
                        clouds which now lower about us must ere long be dispelled and the foul
                        spirit of radicalism will have played its part on the political stage
                        forever. When the interest of the whole country, which will be the case at
                        no very distant day, shall compell the fostering of the South rather than
                        the discouraging of her people and the retarding of her progress, she will
                        exhibit as gigantic prosperity as she has shown in powers of recuperation
                        from the ravages and devastation of war, and will be equaled by no section
                        of this or any other country in the rapidity of her progress, her
                        productiveness and her wealth. Some of those who have gone to other States
                        from this do not find them to be Virginias, and, we learn, are about
                        returning, and we say to others, who may be discontented, profit by the
                        example of those about to return to us, remain where you are and rest
                        assured our Sunny South at no distant day will be the wealthiest section in
                        the Union, and you, instead of strangers, will be the envied possessors of
                        her sacred soil!</p>

                    rather than appease," and shows "a desire to plunge our section into the lowest
                    deep of humiliation and despondency." But the editor discourages emigration,
                    urging readers to "remain where you are and rest assured our Sunny South at no
                    distant day will be the wealthiest section in the Union."</summary>

                    <p>We have been handed the following letter from Gov. Henry A. Wise, which will
                        be read with pleasure by our people:</p>
                    <p>MANCHESTER, Va.,</p>
                    <p>March 27th, 1866 <lb/></p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN:--If practicable I will attend the Convention of Delegates, from
                        the Valley counties, at Staunton, on the 4th of April next. I will take
                        pleasure and great interest in promoting the Valley improvement which ought
                        to have been completed long ago, and I heartily congratulate you on the
                        prospect of developing the rich resources of your great Valley, needing the
                        power of getting to market with every aid of steam and telegraph.</p>
                    <p>I am, gentleman, with the warmest interests in your improvements,</p>

                    <p>Died in Staunton, on the 4th day of February last, Mrs. MARY E FREEMAN, in
                        the 43d year of her age, leaving a husband, one little daughter, a fond
                        mother, three affectionate brothers and a number of relatives and friends to
                        mourn their irreparable loss.</p>
                    <p>It was the pleasure of the writer to have known the subject of this notice in
                        early childhood, and we can bear willing testimony to the many virtues that
                        at that period adorned her character and which never forsook her in after
                        life.</p>
                    <p>She early connected herself with the church and her walk and conversation
                        through life fully sustained the reputation of a true and devout christian.</p>
                    <p>In her death she gave conclusive evidence of the purity of the religion she
                        professed, and although sorrowing to leave husband, child, mother and
                        brothers, yet as it was her Heavenly Father's will to take her to himself,
                        she was willing to go, and made her exit with the blissful hope of a
                        glorious immortality beyond the grave.</p>
                    <p>Grieve not therefore dear relatives and friends, at your loss-although her
                        body is encased within the narrow limits of the grave, her immortal spirit
                        has no doubt, ere this ascended up on high, free from sickness, pain and
                        death, in the Paradise of God.</p>
