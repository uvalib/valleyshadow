                        of a hat. It says:</p>
                    <p>The sudden abolition of slavery has suddenly forced the people of the South
                        where existed into the trial of an experiment which has never yet peacefully
                        succeeded, -- the experiment of so adjusting the laws and modifying the
                        temper, habits and bearings of Anglo-Saxons and free negroes dwelling
                        together upon terms of civil equality (social equality is out of the
                        question) in the some communities as to satisfy both and produce a condition
                        of mutual contentment. To zealots unadvised of the struggles which have
                        occurred heretofore under such or similar circumstances, it appears to be a
                        subject of no concern whatever.</p>
                    <p>To the Radicals in and out of the present Congress, judging from their
                        flippant method of treating it, it appears to be a n experiment which may be
                        resolved by the application of the dreams of Thaddeus Stevens -- an enforced
                        application of the equality doctrines of the Declaration of Independence.
                        But our best informed and most sagacious and considerate statesmen, whilst
                        impudent reformers push their notions upon and into the communities where
                        slavery has recently existed before their present wounds are [unclear], will
                        produce a war of races of a very terrible character. The reason for this
                        apprehension are too numerous for a newspaper article. They would fill a
                        volume.</p>
                    <p>The slaves of the ancients belonged to the same race s the masters. They were
                        trophies of war, and frequently, as the cases of Aesop and Terence, the
                        superiors of their masters in intellect and learning. Freedom was the only
                        distinction between them, and when this boon was conferred they came upon a
                        common level. And, although it was found that a prejudice against those who
                        had been enslaved lasted long after the period of the enfranchisement, the
                        freedmen bore so close a resemblance to the free born that it became after a
                        while impossible to distinguish one class from the other. Slavery in the
                        United States has been united with the visible badge of color. The negro has
                        been the subject of it. Doubly dishonored by color and the fact that his
                        race has been enslaved from time to time out of mind, the colored freedmen
                        is in a far worse condition for employing equal civil rights with his former
                        master than were the slaves of antiquity. This led De Tocqueville to remark
                        that "the law may abolish in form the institution of negro slavery, but God
                        alone can obliterate the traces of its existence."</p>
                    <p>In attempting to being our freedmen into harmony with the white men we have,
                        besides the fact of former servitude, three sorts of prejudices to contend
                        with -- the instinctive prejudice of color, the prejudice of the former
                        masters, and the prejudice of the race. These, separately or combined, have,
                        in all known instances of negro emancipation, been fruitful and never-ending
                        causes of discontentment and discord, so that whenever the whites have been
                        the most numerous they have found it necessary to their personal safety to
                        keep the blacks in a subordinate and servile position; and wherever the
                        negroes have been the strongest they either have, or have striven to destroy
                        the whites.</p>
                    <p>And when we remember how difficult and slow has been the process in every
                        country, inclusive of our own, of rooting out the distinctions of
                        aristocracy which we inherited from the old World, and of preventing the
                        growth of others, such as aristocracies of wealth and of sect, scarcely less
                        prejudicial to everything like equality and harmony, we are compelled to
                        acknowledge that it is not strange that no experiment of the kind we are now
                        trying has ever succeeded. There have been, and yet are, rightful we do not
                        say but actually nevertheless these intrinsic differences hitherto between
                        the two races, which statesmen, and particularly those in charge of our
                        Government, are not at liberty to disregard. It is the full knowledge of
                        these, and of the horrid massacres and wars they have heretofore produced,
                        which admonishes the President of the necessity of moving in the work of
                        reconstructing Southern society according to the altered condition of
                        things, with the utmost circumspection.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Before and during the war, the Southern master confided in hi slave and the
                        slave in turn relied upon his master for the sustenance of himself and
                        family, and protection from wrong at the hands of others. Nor need we say to
                        those who are familiar with that of which we write that this confidence on
                        the one hand and reliance on the other, was but rarely abused. Since the
                        emancipation of slaves, however, an influence has been at work to sever the
                        friendship which has so long existed between the whites and blacks of the
                        South. Those men in high places whose duty it was to have sided in restoring
                        amicable feelings between the lately hostile sections, with but few
                        exceptions, have rather endeavored to make the alienation more permanent and
                        lasting. To accomplish this more surely have their many acts of legislation
                        been passed, which, in no small degree, have tended to create distrust, want
                        of confidence, and even ill-feeling between Southern whites and blacks, who
                        are still, to a vast extent, dependent upon each other, and especially are
                        the blacks dependent upon the whites. Men have even been sent to, or are
                        found in certain communities, so depraved or lost to all principle, as to
                        instigate the colored people to deed which must redound to their future
                        disadvantage, if they do not, as in several instances already, result in the
                        death of many of them.</p>
                    <p>With the allurements held out shortly after the close of the war, it was not
                        to be wondered at that many negroes ceased to work and gave themselves up to
                        idle or vicious lives. Soon, however, their necessities or good sense,
                        together with the continued kindness of their former masters, induced the
                        vast majority to resume their work and they bid fair to become again useful
                        members of society. This did not suit those men who had arisen through
                        intestine struggle to the surface. They must needs to keep alive an internal
                        strife or sink forever. The various disturbances we hear of are the fruits
                        of their efforts, and, while advantaging neither party to the struggle,
                        serve to advance the interests of the instigators and their abettors. We
                        have not, and we are glad to see that others do not lay the blame to the
                        poor emancipated slave, who, without false tutoring, would have accommodated
                        himself to his changed condition and been useful as a laborer, as is
                        witnessed where the vile teachings of malicious agitators have not
                        insinuated themselves, and our treatment to those who conduct themselves
                        with the propriety should be just as kind as at any period of our past
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>But to those pretended friends of the poor African, who teach him to distrust
                        his early friends, the Southern whites, and incite him to open hostility
                        against them, in order that they may be advantaged thereby, too much of
                        culpability can no attach. All the blood that has been spilled by their
                        teachings in upon their heads and a fearful reckoning is in store, which
                        sooner or later must and will overtake them.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following pointed remarks occur in an editorial in the President's organ
                        of Wednesday:</p>
                    <p>It will be recollected by our reader who have kept the run of this paper,
                        that we intimated a suspicion several months ago that the Radical members of
                        Congress had entered into a conspiracy against the Constitution to shut out
                        the electoral vote n 1868 of certain southern States, and that about a month
                        ago we stated more clearly what it was. As no Senator, Representative, or
                        Radical newspaper has presumed to deny the allegation, we take it to have
                        been true.</p>
                    <p>It is a point that cannot be carried out with impunity. We do not believe it
                        can be consummated without bloodshed. At all events, if the electoral votes
                        of the States thus unlawfully excluded will elect a candidate for President
                        who shall not be elected without them, the people will find a way to have
                        them counted, by putting the proper President elect into the executive
                        office and maintaining him there, by force if necessary.</p>
                    <p>The exclusion of ten States from representation in Congress goes to the verge
                        of public forbearance. No further outrage can, in our opinion, be superadded
                        to it without breaking the public peace and exposing the country to the
                        horrors of another civil war, in which the people of the excluded States
                        would have the sympathy of the civilized world.</p>
