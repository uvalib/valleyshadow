<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have never regarded President Johnson as the especial champion of the
                        South. It is true that he has stood as a bulwark against the surges of
                        fanatical hate which would have overwhelmed our sunny land but for his
                        timely and most determined opposition, but not especially on account of the
                        South did or does he oppose the huge attempts at a central despotism. To
                        suppose him influenced thus would deprive him of the title of patriot and
                        statesman which he has so justly earned since he came into position and
                        power. On his accession to the Presidency he found the country just emerging
                        from a vast civil war, with the antagonism of the past grown into seemingly
                        unconquerable hate from the contests of the past four years, which
                        overshadowed with a threatening cloud the prospects of a speedy and much
                        desired peace. Difficulties of a monstrous character loomed up to be
                        overcome, and his path was beset at every step by obstacles real and
                        imaginary, which would have chilled the heart of any but the most undaunted.
                        With fixed and patriotic purpose in view, the preservation of the Union, he
                        looked around for the means of accomplishing it and found ready to his hands
                        the Constitution of the United States, which had been rolled up during our
                        intestine struggle, and nearly lost sight of. He calmly unrolled it, and
                        found its bright face tarnished here and there by the mould of the last few
                        years, but enough of it left to preserve his native Country and its
                        government. Scarcely found, ere the desire for a new Constitution shows
                        itself in the insatiate mania for amendments, calculated to pervert its
                        primitive intent. Backing this desire is a large and powerful body of men,
                        whose representatives hold the next promineat places in the government and
                        whose front looks bold and threatening as did the Austrian Phalanxes to the
                        brave Swiss at the ever memorable Lempach.-With serried ranks and lances
                        drawn this reckless band of men moved forward for the destruction of the
                        charter of our country's liberty. What remained for the opponents of their
                        diabolical purposes? They must made to quaid before liberty's undaunted
                        array or all is lost. In this dire extremity, counseling calmness and
                        nerving his then small but trusty band of patriots by his brave example,
                        like Arnold Winkelried of old, with the cry "make way for liberty," he
                        hurled himself upon the destroyers of his country's Constitution, receiving
                        their thrusts in his own person and causing them to hesitate, waver and
                        retreat. His act receives the commendation of the great and good of the
                        land, who desire peace and prosperity, to secure which they have risen
                        superior to the passions of an hour.</p>
                    <p>Because the preservation of the, Constitution for which Andrew Johnson has so
                        earnestly striven, would secure directly their rights to the South, leads
                        many to believe him the especial defender of our oppressed section. We would
                        call the attention of all such to the fact that the Constitution, lost sight
                        of, perverted or destroyed would be equally burdensome to every State in the
                        Union, and would utterly deprive them every right, save what might be
                        vouchsafed by an unlicensed Central Government, or, more properly speaking,
                        Consolidated Despotism. To prevent this president Johnson has thrust himself
                        forward as the defender of the Constitution, and, knowing no North, no
                        South, no East, no West, is battling to preserve the liberties of the whole
                        country. That he will succeed, the patriotic masses of the north rallying to
                        his standard give every promise, and while counseling his sympathizers in
                        the North to persevere in their course, we of the South can only wish the
                        President, and his patriot followers, "God speed" in their noble efforts to
                        preserve the Constitution and the liberties of our entire people.</p>

                        objectionable features as those spoken of by 'Teacher.' Will not our
                        confreres of the Press in the State take this subject in hand, and urge upon
                        the teachers the calling of such convention as [UNCLEAR] at an early

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:-I desire through your medium of your
                        paper to call the attention of Teachers to some facts or rather evils, which
                        ought to be corrected, if remedies can be found. All who are engaged in
                        teaching have to a greater or less degree experienced much difficulty in
                        classifying their pupils from the following cause, the great difficulty in
                        obtaining suitable text books. Not that there is a want of variety from
                        which to make a selection, on the contrary, the variety is so numerous and
                        the number of editions so multiplied that to have uniformity is impossible,
                        unless teachers require new pupils to purchase new books and these books
                        must be changed every year, to keep up with the different editions. These
                        various changes are gotten up more for the purpose of giving sale to books,
                        than from a desire to improve them: in other words it is a scheme to make
                        money. So great is the mania on this subject, i. e., to make money, that we
                        may expect that the time is not far distant, when we shall have no pure
                        Latin or Greek unless it is just published by some New England
                        speculator.-How long will the people of this State, and especially the
                        teachers, suffer themselves to be thus imposed upon? Have they examined the
                        last edition of Goodrich's History of the U. S.? If so, they can longer use
                        it in their schools; for are not the chapters it contains in regard to the
                        late war offensive and insulting, besides being false and unfair? To prevent
                        these abuses, let the teachers of the State hold a meeting, composed of
                        delegates from different sections and adopt a system of text books for the
                        State of Virginia. Then we would have uniformity of action, and the pupil
                        when he changed teachers would not have to change his books, and in this way
                        much expense would be saved the patron.-Let these books be published in the
                        State, in fine let us be independent of all New England and New England
                        influence. Believing that all teachers will concur with me, that much good
                        could be accomplished by a convention of the teachers, I think a mere
                        suggestion for it sufficient. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>THE Fire Company of Staunton made a grand turn out, by torch light, on
                        Saturday evening last, and paraded through our principal streets to the fine
                        strains of our "Stonewall" Band. They number about 100 members of whom about
                        80 turned out on the evening mentioned, and we do not hesitate, but take
                        pleasure in saying that no Fire Company anywhere surpasses ours in the
                        excellence of its material. As a citizen of Staunton we are proud-very proud
                        of this company, and we think they should be encouraged to the fullest
                        extent by our people. They need a uniform which will not only be a neat on a
                        parade, but also serviceable at a fire and as many of the members can not
                        easily spare the amount necessary to uniform themselves, and are not
                        property holders, but are willing to devote their services and labor for the
                        good of our people, we suggest to the ladies of Staunton to hold a fair for
                        the purpose of uniforming them, and, if there be a surplus, to laying the
                        foundation of a good library for the company. To the property holders, and
                        others interested, of Staunton, we propose, by a subscription of $5 each, to
                        purchase a new  and good
                         engine for this company. The only draw back to the company is the
                        want of a good  engine for this company. The only
                        draw back to the company is the want of a good 
                        engine, for there is a full sufficiency of willing hands to work one and
                        render efficient service with it in an emergency. We are satisfied that
                        every property-holder in Staunton, or other person interested in the
                        protection of property here, will willingly subscribe, and we call upon the
                        company to appoint several parties to circulate a petition among them.</p>

                        these names have been signed without authority by second parties, as we find
                        several on the list who declared to us that they never signed or authorized
                        another to sign this petition for them. We now call on those parties who did
                        not sign the petition, but whose names are found appended thereto, to notify
                        us and we will take pleasure in giving publicity to the fact. For the
                        present we merely call attention to the petition and its signers.</p>
                    <p>P. S. When the affidavit was made before W. A.
                        Burnett, it was simply to a list of names unaccompanied by any petition
                        whatever. </p>
