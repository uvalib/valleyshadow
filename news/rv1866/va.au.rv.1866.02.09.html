<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In the Vicksburg Herald  of the 11th inst., we
						find the following couplet, said to be an inscription over the grave of a
						Confederate soldier, in the Alexandria cemetery: </p>
					<p>"Unknown"-is all the epitaph can tell,</p>
					<p>If Jesus knew thee, all is well. <br></p>
					<p>Those touching and simple lines are suggestive of many sorrowful reflections.
						They bring up, from the mighty past, thronging memories of the thousands of
						noble and ardent soldiers of the South, who went forth wit flashing eyes and
						springing steps in defence of their native land, but who never more will
						return to gladden the hearts of their kindred. Some of them sealed their
						devotion to liberty with the blood of their young and gallant hearts.
						Others, toiling through the scorching rays of summer, and shivering in the
						cold blasts of winter, without food or adequate clothing, yielded to
						privation and disease, and finally perished on the terrible march, in a land
						of strangers, with no gentle hand to alleviate the agonies of death. Others,
						taken captives on the red field of battle, were immured in Northern
						dungeons, and, like caged eagles, drooped and died.</p>
					<p>All over this broad Southern land are hundreds of thousands of little mounds
						of earth, beneath which moulder the remains of our gallant defenders, with
						no stone or monument to designate the pale sleepers. We know they are
						soldiers' graves-we know nothing more. Many of the nameless dead were
						volunteers from other States; and in many cases the very mothers who nursed
						them in infancy are ignorant of their fate. Perchance even yet, at many
						distant homesteads, mothers and fathers and sisters sustained by illusive
						hope, peer through the gloom of twilight, trusting that they may bear
						returning footsteps, destined never more to be heard in the walks of men.
						The little hillocks which mark the resting place of the "unknown" soldiers
						of liberty will soon be leveled and obliterated. Over their remains the
						buzzing multitude will tread. The memory of themselves and their deeds of
						valor, and their terrible sufferings and sacrifices, will fade from all
						minds, and oblivion will add thir names to those of the innumerable
						multitude of Adam's sons who have thus perished and been forgetton. In the
						language of the epitaph which heads this article, we reverently say, <br></p>
					<p>"If Jesus knew thee, all is well."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lauds the recent decision by the state legislature to approve the
					construction of a railroad from Winchester to Strasburg, calling the decision
					"one step, and a very important one, toward the development of the Valley
					section."<br>(Names in announcement:   Baylor, Col.  Baldwin)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The bill to amend the charter of the Manassas Gap, and Winchester and Potomac
						Railroad Companies, allowing the Manassas Gap Company to construct a
						railroad from Winchester to Strasburg, passed the House Friday last, by a
						large majority, and, having previously passed the Senate, is a law. This is
						one step, and a very important one, toward the development of the Valley
						section. The bill elicited quite a discussion, in which Messrs. Baylor and
						Baldwin, delegates from Augusta, took an active part. Mr. Baylor expressed
						the sentiment of the people of the Valley, when he declared his willingness
						to vote for any charter, which did not involve an appropriation, thus
						leaving it entirely to those interested to determine whether they need a
						railroad and can construct it. This is the right view of the case. Charters
						for railroads will be asked for in different portions of the State, and the
						State is unable to aid in their construction, but, if the people of the
						sections interested desire their construction and can build them, the
						charters should be granted. By our one sided and selfish policy in the past,
						Virginia, though one of the oldest States, is now far behind many of her
						younger sisters.-Nothing will so promptly aid in the development of her
						material resources, or so certainly ensure her future prosperity, as the
						construction of her much needed channels of inter-communication.</p>
					<p>In many States, very few important points are without railroad communication,
						and these railroads do not centre at any point within their limits, but
						traverse them in every conceivable direction, and their towns are prosperous
						and these States and greatly benefited thereby.</p>
					<p>No matter if railroads do traverse our State from side to side, if we furnish
						the inducement the trade will stop within our borders. Without an inducement
						it will never benefit us, railroads or no railroads. This road is but the
						beginning, we hope, of a system of railroads in every desirable and
						available direction in the State, upon the completion of which we shall see
						Virginia, the richest State in the Union in resources, no longer a laggard
						in the race for prosperity, but boldly leading the van.</p>
					<p>In regard to the short sighted policy of Virginia in the past, we commend to
						our readers the following remarks of Col. Baldwin: <br></p>
					<p>"MR. BALDWIN vacated the chair and advocated the bill. He thought that a
						community was the best judge of what was for their interest. The gentleman
						had applied this principle the other day to private enterprises, and surely
						when applied to neighborhoods and communities it holds equally good. The
						parties presumed to know best what is their interest, the representatives of
						the Manassas Gap road, the only road to be affected by the road asked for,
						are here anxiously awaiting the passage of the bill. The gentleman from
						Richmond says Virginia has a commercial policy. Yes, she has. Hinc illae. In '36 she rejected the proposition of
						the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, which agreed for the right of way through
						her territory, to give her fifty cents per head upon all passengers, with
						the additional privilege of tapping said road at any point along its line.
						This was in pursuance of the commercial policy alluded to, which amounted
						nothing more nor less than to make the entire agricultural and mineral
						wealth of the State tributary to the city of Richmond. Next in furtherance
						of the same object, which was to keep Balti- out of her borders, she builds
						the Virginia and Tennessee and Covington and Ohio roads, and then taps them
						at more than one point. Afterwards she constructs a road from Gordonsville
						to Alexandria, and another up the valley to Harrisonburg, at all the expense
						of the State, at least to the amount of three-fifths, thus doing, at an
						immense expenditure, what the Baltimore and Ohio road had agreed to do for
						nothing. The proposition of this road, already referred to, if it had been
						accepted by the State, would have paid all the expenses of our State
						Government, and would have built every mile of railroad in Virginia. And now
						we have an appeal from the city of Richmond at a time when the State is
						financially prostrate, to continue this commercial policy, and to defeat the
						bill, because, forsooth, Baltimore is again to be kept out. While he was
						unwilling to call any town a one-horse town, he though it would be policy in
						the State to burn many of them, and pay for them, rather than that they
						should continually stand in the way of the development of the graat
						interests of the State." <br></p>
					<p>Let this short sighted policy be thrown aside, and the opportunity be give to
						develop our resources and our lands will increase in value, our towns in
						size and business, and our cities in trade and prosperity, (altogether
						impossible if our people be kept in their present greatly reduced
						circumstances, by refusing them a small modicum of aid asked, without cost
						to the State or themselves, for the impropenient of their condition.) and
						then, in the language of the Dispatch, Richmond will proceed, undismayed by
						disaster, unsubdued by misfortune, to rebuild her warehouse upon a more
						extended scale than ever, and will apply herself with renewed industry and
						enterprise to increase her commerce and manufactures." Then "she will
						triumph over all hostility, and with a more solid wealth and prosperity than
						ever, she will continue to be an ornament and pride of the old
					Commonwealth.</p>

					<p>We publish, in another column, a communication from Wm. J. Dews, intended as

<b>"That Petition."</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>William Dews responds to an article in a previous issue of the Vindicator
					which criticized his efforts to circulate a petition among the Union men of the
					county. Dews argues that it is the editors of Southern newspapers who are
					"contributing vastly to the animosity between the two sides" by continuing to
					celebrate the Confederate cause. Instead of "pandering to the bitter emotions
					which are presumed to exist with regard to the past," Dews pleads, "let us bury
					the past so deep that vilest agitator cannot exhume it."<br>(Names in announcement:  William J. Dews)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>"We understand" that the Editor of the "Vindicator" remarks, in his issue of
						last week, that "a petition is being circulated among those men, who profess
						to be, par excellence Union men in this
						community."-Does my learned friend, the Editor profess to know  that the Union men regard themselves as par excellence, or perhaps he has placed himself in
						communication with the "Falstaff" Editor of the "Metropolitan Record,"
						thereby learning the profound secret penetrating the very thoughts  of the Union men of the South? I am not
						aware of the interesting fact that they "profess to be par excellence." But if the Editor so
							decides I cheerfully give him due credit for his superior powers
						of penetration, his nice discrimination and his frank and honest
						appreciation of a class who are supposed  to be
							par excellence. </p>
					<p>I hereby publically make our most profound obeisance to the Editor for this
						frank admission, and would entreat those nervous gentlemen who have an ague
						when they hear the soothing exclamation "that petition," to refrain from
						"gobbling up" or "blotting out of existence" the worthy person of the
						Editor.</p>
					<p>The Editor further remarks of a certain class, who, "are as loyal to the
						Constitution and Government of the United States as any people in the
						Union." If such is the fact why did not the citizens of this town obey an
						order, or request from a representative of the U. S. Government with
						reference to their holding a meeting with the view of electing a
						Commissioner in the Court of Refugees Freedmen, &amp;c.?</p>
					<p>The Editor further says that "that petition" is calculated to create an
						unnecessary animosity between the Union men and a "large majority of our
						people." This is a simple assertion-we must have the evidence. I can say
						positively, however, that the "unnecessary animosity" is not, nor will it be on the side of
						the Union men, who are noted for their quiet demeanor, and who are rapidly
						forgetting their trials, their persecutions, and their sufferings because of
						their conscientious love and devotion to the "Broad Stripes and Bright
						Stars" of their whole country. </p>
					<p>Now are not the Editors, with exceptions, contributing vastly to the continuation of the animosity which may have existed between the two parties? They
						reproduce articles abounding with insult and abuse of Union men. They recall
						to memory daily the incidents of the "glorious field," on which a "just"
						cause was fought and lost. They daily point to
						the laurel crowned Confederates who have lost all but honor, and insist that they are the great and good, whose
						examples should be religiously followed.-They open the very graves of father and brother who fell in the Confederate
						cause, which again arouses the bitter feelings of the unhappy past. Editors
						of the South will you again place in jeopardy the best interest of the South
						by pandering to the bitter emotions which are presumed to exist with regard
						to the past. Let us bury the past so deep that the evilest agitator cannot exhume it. </p>
					<p>Remember that "into each life some rain must fall, some days must be dark and
						dreary." Perhaps the "Great Father" ordained that the past days should be dark so that we
						might more fully appreciate the brightness of the
							glorious future. </p>
					<p>Consider the consoling words of Leather Stocking (in Cooper's novel) to the
						disconsolate widow of Arrowhead. "Dew of June, you are not alone in your sorrow. When the Manito of the pale
						face wishes to produce good in the pale face heart, he strikes it with
						grief, for 'tis in our sorrow, June, that we learn to
							look upward." </p>

					<p>Mr. Editor: </p>
					<p>I was glad to observe, in a modest corner of your last issue, a card signed
						by a committee of the "Churchville farmer's Club," inviting a meeting of the
						farmers of the County at Churchville, on the 15th inst.</p>
					<p>It is really refreshing to hear of something which has not the odor of
						politics (surely no one will deny that there
							is an odor in the
						present political atmosphere.) and which looks like getting back again to
						business and enterprise. </p>
					<p>The "Churchville Farmers' Club" was organized Nov. 1860, and consists of
						twelve members, all practical and thrifty farmers, who are willing to adopt
						an improvement, despite the sneers of those who still believe in going to
						mill with the corn in one end of the bag and a stone in the other. The Club
						meets monthly at the house of some one of its members, taking them in
						rotation, so as to meet on each farm at least once a year; and
						notwithstanding the inconvenience of "reporting,"
						"refugeeing," &amp;c., during the war, it is said the Club missed but
						three meetings during the four years, --a fact which speaks well for the
						personal interest of the members, and for the good dinners accustomed to be
						provided form them. </p>
					<p>At their meeting they discuss subjects pertaining to agriculture, inspect the
						farm and stock of the member at whose house they met, and interchange
						opinions and suggestions. Now all this has proved both pleasant and
						profitable, demonstrating that "in union there is
						strength." </p>
					<p>Would it not be well if there were similar organizations in every
						neighborhood in the County? They would serve to stimulate and encourage that
						department of business to which we must look for real,
							solid wealth, on which every county must be ultimately dependent,
						and which now certainly (second only of course to be the immortal Sambo,)
						demands the most serious consideration. </p>
					<p>Then let every intelligent and enterprising farmer in the county attended
						this assembly if possible and give his voice and influence to whatever good
						project may be started there.</p>
					<p>SUEB.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>On Monday morning, the 5th inst., about 10 o'clock, while a freedman, in the
						employ of Col. Skinner, was in the Col's wagon house engaged in putting a
						horse to a light wagon, he was approached by a white man, who remarked to
						him that "he wanted a pair of two horse wagon springs," which were in the
						carriage house that "the Col. said he could get them," To this the negro
						man, who supposed all was right, made no objection. The white man then told
						the negro, that he wanted toe springs taken down the street in the wagon,
						which the negro was engaged in hitching up. To this also the negro agreed.
						The springs were accordingly put in the wagon, and the negro drove off
						slowly.-The white man following on foot. When the wagon reached the corner
						of the McAdamized Street on which Mr. Ben. Crawford's house stands, the
						white man told the negro that he wanted the springs put off there, as he,
						the white man, had a wagon in town in which he intended carrying the springs
						to the country. The springs were thereupon put off on the street, and the
						negro drove on. This is the last which has been heard of the springs. The
						Colonel had never authorized any one to take them, and the whole story was
						one of an artful contrivance of the thief. There is no evidence that the
						springs were taken by the fellow to the country, though such may have been
						the case. The public should be on the lookout for such cunning rogues, as
