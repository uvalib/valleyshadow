                    <p>The adoption by the Southern States of the proposal Constitutional Amendment
                        of the last Congress seems to be the important topic of discussion by many
                        of our exchanges just now. Some Northern Journals, which have leaned to a
                        conservative policy, argue that now is the time for the Southern
                        Legislatures to take fortune at its flood and by adopting said amendment
                        secure representation in Congress, not attainable in any other way, while
                        the Radical Journals insist the case of Tennessee is not to be a precedent
                        to the admission of other Southern States to representation in Congress, or,
                        in other words, that the adoption of the Constitutional amendment by the
                        Southern States is not and will not be considered a sufficient ground for
                        the readmission of said States to the Union. It occurs to us that our
                        Northern cotemporaries are wasting ink and paper in this discussion. The
                        Southern people have not the slightest idea of adopting the proposed
                        amendment. It is a question whether representation in Congress, where a
                        fanatical radical majority holds dominant sway, is desirable on our part,
                        and especially, when it is to be purchased by the acknowledgement of our own
                        degradation and ostracism of our best men, but when re-admission to the
                        Union and representation in its National Councils, is not to be obtained, as
                        asserted by the Radicals, even by the adoption of the proposed
                        Constitutional amendment, it is positively certain that the South will none
                        of it. The Southern people have fully enough to contend with in the
                        recuperation of their financial affairs, without disturbing themselves
                        greatly over unconstitutional amendments, which can only be productive of
                        future evil.</p>
                    <p>They will therefore devote their time and attention, as they have done since
                        the war, to their own private and State affairs, and can only rely upon the
                        returning sober sense of the Northern masses to accord, sooner or later,
                        without degrading conditions, their rights and privileges in the Union which
                        are now and have so long been unjustly withheld.</p>

                    <p>In these days a Convention seems to be the generally accepted plan for
                        accomplishing everything. We have had a National Union convention, a Loyal
                        Southerners (?) Convention, and two Soldiers' and Sailors' Conventions and
                        the Memphis Appeal proposes now "a Convention of the people of the South by
                        duly elected delegates, to meet at some central point, and qualified by an
                        immediate commission from the people to express their sentiments and
                        vindicate their policy and purposes from the foul aspersions heaped upon
                        them by the traveling adventurers hailing from this section, and now on a
                        pilgrimage through the Northern States awakening by their slanders and
                        falsehoods the most intense animosity against us."</p>
                    <p>We rather like this proposition, for, besides the travelling Loyalties (?)
                        from this section, we have had a set of men sent among us to dish up
                        falsehoods to suit Radical tastes, the effect of which we can more
                        effectually obliterate by one common expression from the South than in any
                        other way.</p>
                    <p>We think, therefore, that the proposed "Southern Convention" could be made a
                        good thing, in which the people of the South, through their delegates, might
                        express <emph rend="italic">candidly</emph> their views and determination,
                        not in the style of "dirt eaters," nor yet with menaces, but plainly,
                        frankly, forcibly and in language not to be misunderstood or misconstrued,
                        which, if it did not carry conviction to the Northern mind, would, at least,
                        exonerate our people from the many base and slanderous charges so frequently
                        made against them.</p>

                    <p>We publish below the particulars, kindly furnished us by a friend, of the
                        cold blooded and horrible murder of Jno. P. Eubank, of this county, which
                        occurred about the 13th of September, in the State of Ohio, near the Ohio
                        River.</p>
                    <p>Jno. T. Eubank, nephew of Col. R. Turk of this county, went to the Burning
                        Spring Oil Wells of Wirt, with a team belonging to his brother R. P. Eubank
                        and himself. He had been doing well, and as was believed, had made money.
                        Some time about the 13th ult., he was employed by a man of the name of
                        Bumbgardner to go with his team to some point in Ohio, under the pretence of
                        moving a family to the wells.--They passed down the Virginia side of the
                        Ohio to a point seven miles below Parkersburg and crossed in to that State.
                        'Tis supposed that Bumbgardner took advantage of his victim in some way, as
                        Eubank was an unusually stout and resolute man. Perhaps he attacked him
                        while asleep. His body was found some days after floating in the Ohio <emph
                            rend="italic">without the head</emph>, which so far as now know, has
                        been recovered. The fact of his being murdered was made known in this wise:
                        Capt. Elijah Bateman of this county who had gone out with a team about the
                        time Eubank did, had a suit with some one and Eubank was his witness. He,
                        not being aware of Eubank's absence, applied to his layer, a man by the name
                        of Robinson, to know the status of his law-case and was enquired of as to
                        what witnesses he had. He mentioned Eubank as one and took out a subpoena
                        for him, and on enquiring where he was, learned he had gone, as before
                        stated, with Bumbgardner. Presently the body was found and on investigation,
                        it was identified as Eubank's, and it was further ascertained, that
                        Bumbgardner had borrowed a skiff of a man of the name of Hill, perhaps near
                        the point at which they crossed the river, under the pretence of going out
                        into the river, to take a wash. Since that time Bumbgardner and the team are
                        missing.--The presumption is he murdered Eubank for what money he had and
                        his team. He has been pursued and it is hoped and believed will be brought
                        to condign punishment. Capt. Bateman with others was in pursuit. He (B)
                        first telegraphed to Capt. Peck of this place the fact of the murder, and
                        Mr. Robinson, the lawyer mentioned, since wrote to Mr. R. P. Eubank left
                        here this morning, (Tuesday) for Parkersburg. Seldom have we had to record a
                        more fiendish and cold blooded a murder.</p>
                    <p>The deceased was the second son of Mrs. Amanda Eubank -- the only daughter of
                        the late Capt. Jas. Turk. He was a good soldier, a member of the Churchville
                        Cavalry, and besides his heart-stricken mother, has left an only sister and
                        two brothers, a numerous relationship and many friends to mourn his sad
                        fate. May a merciful God soothe them in their mutual sorrow, and an avenging
                        God inflict on the vile assassin a just retribution for his crime.</p>
