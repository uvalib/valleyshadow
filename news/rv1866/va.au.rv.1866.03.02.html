<b>Great Speech of President Johnson</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of a speech given by President Johnson at Grover's Theater in
                    Washington. Johnson distinguishes himself from the Radicals by arguing that the
                    Southern states should be readmitted to the Union "when they have given
                    sufficient evidence of their loyalty and that they can be trusted, when they
                    yield obedience to the law." Johnson told the audience that "though vituperation
                    may come in its most violent character, I will be found standing by the
                    Constitution as the chief rock of our safety."<br>
