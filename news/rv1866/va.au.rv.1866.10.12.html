<b>Letter from the Hon. J. B. Baldwin</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Augusta native John Baldwin responds to frequent editorial comment from the
                    Richmond Enquirer, which has been critical of his testimony before the
                    Reconstruction Committee pertaining to secession. Baldwin argues that given the
                    current political situation of the South, unity is more important than disputing
                    theories of secession.<br>(Names in announcement:  John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To the Editors of the Enquirer:</p>
                    <p>You have several times recently made my opinions about Secession the subject
                        of adverse editorial comment, and your example has been followed by several
                        newspapers "in the rural districts." The Hon. James Lyons, too, in the
                        Enquirer of September 15, has done me the honor to make my errors of opinion
                        the text of a "two column" discourse.</p>
                    <p>Now I have not the least idea of being drawn at this late day into a
                        discussion of Secession. As a practical right, for future use, it has, by
                        universal consent, been given up and abandoned. Mr. Lyons says "it has been
                        extirpated with the sword," and that he, at least, has "bound himself by the
                        highest tie which can bind a gentleman, not to attempt by force to assert
                        the right, or aid or advise others to do it;" and you say, on the same
                        subject, "we comprehend all this and accept it as none the less imperative,
                        because the decree is of irresistible might, rather than of right. So much
                        for the future."</p>
                    <p>Nor do I intend to enter upon any defense of the soundness of my opinions on
                        the subject. They are the same I have always held and avowed, and which were
                        as well known to you and to Mr. Lyons before the war and during the war as
                        now. They are the opinion upon which I have always acted, and although you
                        may not approve them as abstract propositions, you have yourself admitted
                        that in our time of trial they brought me to a practical result becoming a
                        true Virginian. Mr. Lyons seems to think that a man of my way of thinking
                        ought to have taken no part with Virginia in the war. I did not think so,
                        and I incline to the opinion that if the defence of Virginia and the South
                        had been left exclusively to persons of Mr. Lyons' way of thinking the war
                        would have been smaller and shorter.</p>
                    <p>There is no foundation for your charge that I have gratuitously obtruded my
                        opinion on this subject upon public attention. While in Washington last
                        winter as one of the committee sent to present to President Johnson the
                        resolutions of the Virginia Legislature, I was summoned before the
                        Reconstruction Committee, and examined on oath to these subjects. I gave my
                        testimony according to my belief, and there the matter would have ended, but
                        for the newspapers -- the Enquirer among others -- which gave such
                        prominences and publicity to my testimony, as reported by the Committee, as
                        to induce a friend to call upon me to correct as mistake by which injustice
                        had been done to my opinion and feelings. The propriety of my writing a
                        letter for this purpose is shown by the statement of Mr. Lyons -- that it
                        "removes the painful impression" which my testimony as published had made
                        upon him.--If, therefore, my opinions have been unnecessarily thrust upon
                        public notice, it is plain that you and Mr. Lyons, and those concurring with
                        you in this attack upon me, are fairly responsible for it.</p>
                    <p>You fear that my opinions thus made known will be regarded in the light of "a
                        confession," calculated to bring reproach "upon the honest names of our
                        thrice honored people."</p>
                    <p>If I had at any time said a word which could be fairly interpreted as
                        implying a doubt of the justice of the cause for which our people fought so
                        gallantly and endured so nobly, or if I had in any manner professed to
                        regret or to be ashamed of having cast in my lot with "our thrice honored
                        people," I could understand why you should take
                        it upon yourself to defend their honest name
                        against me, but I confess I am not able to
                        appreciate the nervous anxiety, not to say eagerness, manifested by you to
                        avoid the imputation of Rebellion and the name of Rebel.</p>
                    <p>The English language has no name except that of a Rebel by which to designate
                        one who has fought without success for the rights of the governed against
                        the power of the government, and I have been taught to believe that it
                        furnishes no higher or nobler title than that of Rebel of a just cause.</p>
                    <p>I wonder it has not occurred to gentlemen who have so earnestly and even
                        vehemently disclaimed the rights of secession as a remedy for any possible
                        wrongs in the future, that it might be well to uphold the respectability of
                        old fashioned rebellion in case of need. The
                        right of revolution certainly has the merit of never having been abandoned
                        or surrendered by its friends, and whenever needed by an oppressed people
                        will be found as good as "bran new." In such a
                        case, I fool myself bound "by the highest tie which can bind a gentlemen,
                        again to attempt by force to assert this right and to aid and advise others
                        to do it."</p>
                    <p>You seem to regard my opinions as "dangerous admissions," tending at this
                        time to weaken the position and to endanger the safety of the States and
                        people of the South. On the contrary, I claim as the chief merit of my
                        views, that they meet the most pressing difficulties of our situation, and
                        place both States and our people under the protection of the Constitution of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Without discussing -- or at present even questioning -- the doctrine of
                        secession, I may be allowed to say that in practice it has not thus far
                        answered the expectations and prediction of its friends. It did not prove to
                        be a peaceful remedy. It did not secure us any advantage of nationality in
                        the conduct of the war -- either from the United States or from other
                        nations. It did not enable us to make terms of peace; and we occupy before
                        the world today the position of defeated and dispersed rebels, and not of
                        conquered nations.</p>
                    <p>Strangely enough, it is in this very position that we find whatever of right
                        or safety or protection we now claim.</p>
                    <p>Upon the theory of secession as stated by you, the State of Virginia became,
                        by her ordinance of secession, "a separate nation;" by the fortune of war
                        she has become a conquered nation -- and by the well established law of war
                        is at the absolute disposal of the conqueror, and bound to take such
                        institutions and laws as may be imposed by the law-making power of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lyons, who holds his theory, calls President Johnson the "Restorer of the
                        Constitution," and looks forward with confidence to the rise of the old
                        "States Rights party" with the "Resolution of '98" in hand. I hope he will
                        in the light of the those "venerated principles" and by the aid of "Blair's
                        Rhetoric an Andrew's Logic," inform us by what authority and by what
                        process, the seceded and separate nation of Virginia has been restored to
                        the Union, and how he -- a foreigner and alien enemy -- has acquired any
                        right under the Constitution or any share in the Government of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>If he would only consent to be called a rebel and to renounce the theory of
                        secession for the past as earnestly and distinctly as he has disclaimed its
                        practice for the future, we could readily understand that, being a
                        Virginian, a citizen of a State which never got out of the Union, and having
                        asked and received from the President upon the most approved States Rights
                        principles a "so-called pardon," he is ipso facto
                        reconstructed; and is re-established in all the personal and political
                        rights which by his rebellious revolutionary conduct he had placed in
                        jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>How much more comfortable he would be in such a position than he can be in a
                        seceded condition, the unnaturalized inhabitant of a conquered territory,
                        alien to the Union and a stranger to the Constitution, exposed to the fury
                        of the "Radical Congress and the Cannibal Convention," whose hope for our
                        destruction rests upon the theory "that the Southern States are not in the
                        Union," and that the Southern people are not entitled to the protection of
                        the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>There are, however, some of our people who are not included in the
                        proclamation of amnesty and who have not yet received the Presidential
                        pardon. These, I suppose, are our "imperiled countrymen" of whom you speak,
                        whose interest and safety are to be prejudiced by my "legal opinion and
                        confession."</p>
                    <p>President Davis is the only one of our friends now under arrest and threat of
                        prosecution, and as to him I take it to be clear that if he is to be
                        regarded as the defeated chief of a separate nation, the case of Napoleon
                        establishes a precedent for his life-long captivity. If, however, he is a
                        citizen of the United States, charged with "levying war against them," he is
                        entitled by the Constitution to a speedy and public trial, or in default
                        thereof to be discharged. I have already expressed the opinion that to
                        "subject a man occupying his position to the narrow rules which limit
                        judicial construction and to the mockery of a jury trial, would be an
                        outrage too gross to be anticipated of any government in in Christendom." He
                        is a prisoner of state, who, for reasons of state, ought, as a matter of
                        national magnanimity, to be discharged without a trial, and I have not yet
                        brought myself to believe that President Johnson will seek to avoid the
                        performance of this high duty by handing over such a prisoner to an inferior judicial tribunal.</p>
                    <p>The discretion to discharge a prisoner in such a case, is, in my opinion,
                        political and not legal -- Executive and not Judicial.--From which
                        department of the Government President Davis or any other Confederate has
                        most to expect, would not be difficult to determine.</p>
                    <p>From what I have said, I think it will appear that my opinions on these
                        subjects, whether right or wrong, have been formed from a Southern and
                        Virginia stand-point, and that you have done me no more than justice when
                        you said of me "his heart is with his people."</p>
                    <p>You say you cannot differ with me "in other than kindness." I take you at
                        your word, and in the same spirit I beg leave most respectfully and yet most
                        earnestly, to inquire of you and of my old friend and colleague, Mr. Lyons
                        -- from whom I always expect antagonism but never unkindness -- what
                        possible benefit you expect to follow from the public discussion to which
                        you have subjected me and my opinions?</p>
                    <p>It surely cannot be your purpose to make the doctrine of secession a
                        practical standard of orthodoxy in the future politics of Virginia -- or to
                        found upon it invidious discriminations against any one who, to use your own
                        language as applied to me, "did not take shelter behind his opposition to
                        the ordinance of secession, but made instant [unclear] and generous cause
                        with his State, and devoted to her defence his zealous exertions in the
                        field and in council." Your knowledge of Virginia politics for the last five
                        or six years must have satisfied you that the attempt to revive these dead
                        issues could only result in dissension and strife, at a time when the
                        interests and the safety of our people demand conciliation and harmony.</p>
                    <p>So far as a I am concerned, I can say with perfect truth that from the
                        passage of the Ordinance of Secession by the Virginia Convention, I have
                        known no distinction of party politics among the true men of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Whigs and Democrats, Secessionists and Rebels, have been all alike to me --
                        if engaged in what I regarded as the cause of Virginia and the South. In my
                        opinion the old issues which divided us have not only become obsolete and
                        useless, but the discussion of them in our present circumstances is of evil
                        tendency, fraught with mischief and danger.</p>
                    <p>The progress of the political canvass now going on at the North renders the
                        complete success of the Radicals a result by no means improbable. In such an
                        event the people of the South will have need of all the calm courage and
                        patient endurance that can be opposed to a dominant and overwhelming
                        majority of numbers and of wealth, bent upon our humiliation or our
                        destruction -- Against hostile legislation, the Presidential veto which on
                        several occasions has been so magnanimously interposed for our protection,
                        will no longer prove a barrier, and we must expect and be prepared for every
                        outrage upon our rights and our feelings that greed and hate can suggest.
                        There is, however, one wrong which can only be fastened upon us by our own
                        consent. The proposed Constitutional Amendment cannot be adopted if the
                        States and people of the South are true to themselves and are united and
                        firm in the determination, that come what may, they will oppose to this
                        outrage a calm and steady, and persistent negative; and will not consent
                        upon any pretext or for any purpose to amend the Constitution of the United

                    <p>If you concur, Mr. Editor, in the importance of cultivating union and harmony
                        among ourselves as the best means of advancing the interests and
                        establishing the safety of the States and people of the South, I think we
                        can, both of us, do more good upon that line than is likely to follow upon
                        the demonstration of either your theory or mine as to the right of
                        secession.</p>

                    <p>Your obedient servant,</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday the corner-stone of the colored M. E. Church at Lynchburg, Va.,
                        was laid by the Masonic fraternity. Speaking of the part thus taken by the
                        white population in the ceremonies, the Virginian remarks:</p>
                    <p>It was a significant spectacle, and puts to shame the endless cry of the
                        radical fanatics that nothing but hostility and bitterness is manifested by
                        the whites of the South towards the blacks. Here were a number of the first
                        citizens of the place, quitting their daily avocations and going forward
                        promptly and cheerfully to render a service to the colored population, who
                        had called on them so to do, thus manifesting a kindly and friendly spirit
                        towards them, instead of the ferocious one which the radicals attribute to
                        us. The opening prayer was offered by the Rev. J. D. Mitchell, D. D. of the
                        Second Presbyterian Church, and the Masonic ceremonies, under the direction
                        of John R. McDaniel, Master of Marshall Lodge, were performed, Past Master
                        R. E. Withers then delivered an exceedingly neat and appropriate address,
                        declaring, amongst other things, that "Free Masons make no distinction
                        between white men, red men, or black men, when called upon to lay the
                        foundation to a temple to be erected to the worship of Almighty God." A
                        collection was then lifted by the Masons t aid in the construction of the
                        building, whilst th stewards of the church waited on the spectators for
                        their contributions. The concluding prayer was offered by the Rev. R. E.
                        Edwards, chaplain of the lodge, and the benediction pronounced by Rev. W. H.
                        Kinckle, of the Protestant Episcopal Church. There was a large concourse of
                        persons present, including nearly all the clergy of the city, and the whole
                        affair passed off very pleasantly.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Just now the people of the Northern States are in the midst of intense
                        political excitement; on account of elections now taking place or shortly to
                        be held.</p>
                    <p>The direct cause of this prevailing excitement in the political world North
                        is the status of the late Confederate States. When such is the case, it is
                        wonderful to see the equanimity existing in the South.</p>
                    <p>We are not torn by factions as are our Northern brethren, but, knowing no
                        difference in political questions at this time, are united in one common
                        cause, the restoration of our financial condition to its former prosperity.
                        In this cause are engaged the aged and the youth of our land, who, deprived
                        of the case and affluence which surrounded them in past years, and without a
                        murmur over their misfortunes, have buckled on th armor of honest labor and
                        are exhibiting an example of modest worth unequaled by any people of any
                        age. There are no drones in Southern communities of to-day, and where all
                        are engaged in the pursuit of honest avocations, requiring their undivided
                        time and attention, there is not time or desire to engage in political
                        discussions and quibblings such as we were wont in days gone by.</p>
                    <p>It must not be supposed, however, from this seeming apathy on our part, that,
                        threatened by extremists with dire pains and penalties, should the Radicals
                        succeed, and not knowing to what extent radicalism may go in that event,
                        that our sympathies are not aroused.</p>
                    <p>An earnest desire is felt for the success of Conservatism. Should this fail
                        us now we will hope for the returning reason of the North to accord us our
                        rights, and delve the deeper into mother earth for the recuperation of our
                        pecuniary affairs.</p>
