<b>Local Items--Circuit Court</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Circuit Court still continues its session. Judge Sheffey is displaying
					a commendable diligence in clearing the docket. --Since our last, the Court has
					been exclusively occupied with civil causes, and a great amount of business
					transacted. The order made at the last term, requiring suitors, who wish a
					continuance of their causes, to show that they have used all "legal diligence,"
					in preparing for trial, is being rigidly enforced. The most important case is
					that of Brown, Lanigan, &amp; Co. vs. Forrer and others, involving property
					to the amount of $140,000. The case is a very voluminous one, and has been
					argued with a great ability by Mr. Michie for the Plaintiffs, and by Gen.
					Echols, Col. Baldwin and Mr. Menisee, of Rappahannock, for the Defendant. Mr.
					Stuart is yet to argue for the Plaintiff, and the case will then be submitted to
					the decision of the Court. A decree will be made during the term. Another case
					which has excited a good deal of interest is the injunction case of Mary A.
					Seely vs. Rachel Phelps, and Aaron Shoveler and others, (colored) Trustees of
					the M. E. Church, of the United States. The object of the injunction is to
					secure the legal title to the property, and to injoin and restrain the colored
					defendants from erecting a Church, (which was already commenced) on the lot in
					controversy. The case was argued by Mr. Fultz for the Plaintiff, and Mr. Stuart
					and Gen. Echols for the Defendants, and is now in the hands of the Court.
					Central Bank of Virginia for W. H. Tams, trustee, vs. the County of Augusta, and
					ols. and the same vs. Carson and ols. action of debt brought for money borrowed
					during the war. The defendants filed pleas alleging that these are Confederate
					transactions for money borrowed in aid of the South, and were debarred from
					paying the same by act of Congress. The cases are continued. Calvin C. Cochran's
					Adm'r vs. John C. Echard, &amp;c., action of debt. Plea--Confederate
					transactions. The case was heard by the Court. Judgement not yet rendered.
					Arehart vs. Clemmer; Ililb for &amp;c., vs. Peyton and ols.; Gilkenson vs.
					Crawn; actions of debt, brought on bonds payable in current funds, which were
					given during the war. Defendants demurred to declarations. Demurrers sustained.
					Turk vs. McComb, case submitted to Court.--Judgement in favor of Plaintiffs.
					Engleman for &amp;c., vs. Scheffer, case submitted to Court. Judgement for
					Defendants. O'Brian vs. Ham. Jury--verdict for Plaintiff. Tisdale vs.
					Timberlake, &amp;c. Jury--verdict for Defendants. A large number of cases
					involving Confederate transactions were submitted to the Court, which are still
					under consideration. Will be decided this week. A number of ordinary actions of
					debt were tried and disposed of. A large number of chancery decrees have been
					entered during the term. The Court will, in all probability, continue in session
					for some time yet.<br>(Names in announcement: Judge  Sheffey,   Brown,   Lanigan,   Forrer,   Michie, Gen.  Echols, Col.  Baldwin,   Menisee,   Stuart,  Mary A.
