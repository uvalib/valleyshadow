<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every good citizen while striving to better his pecuniary condition, desire
                        also to see his neighbors prosper. Many however lose sight of the fact that
                        if, in order to save money, they purchase articles elsewhere which can be
                        manufactured here, because they may be a few cents cheaper, they are not
                        only damaging their neighbors, but themselves as well. If every one in a
                        community spends his money elsewhere, because he can procure articles a
                        little cheaper, it takes but little reasoning power to prove that his
                        community will soon be without the means of supporting successfully any
                        business. As a general rule, the success of any business is dependent upon
                        the success of every other business in the community.</p>
                    <p>This much we premise before calling the attention of our many reader to the
                        fact that there is scarcely an article of actual necessity but what is or
                        can be manufactured here.</p>
                    <p>We have excellent mechanics and a vast spirit of improvement pervading our
                        manufacturing classes. Their wares &amp;c., are substantial, and, while
                        costing, perhaps, a little more than they may be
                        purchased at elsewhere, more than make up this difference in durability. It
                        only needs the support of our community to make our mechanics prosperous and
                        by spending money with them it is sure to return to us again, for then the
                        money of community only changes hands in the community and every one derives
                        an advantage from it. The farmer will find a ready cash market for his
                        surplus, the merchant a cash sale for his goods, and so on, due to the fact
                        that the substratum of society, the mechanics and laboring classes, find
                        their labor profitable and are prosperous. We trust that our people, so much
                        given to purchasing useless articles elsewhere, because they are cheap (?)
                        will take this matter into consideration and give preference, as far as
                        possible, to home mechanics and manufacturers. By such a course it will not
                        be long before our manufactured articles, which are now more durable, can be
                        made as neatly and for the same money, for which less valuable articles are
                        daily purchased elsewhere.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Referring to his recent appeal to increase local subscriptions for the
                    construction of the Valley Railroad, the editor expresses disappointment that
                    "we show no greater disposition to further this great work."<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We called attention, a few weeks since, to the necessity on the part of our
                        people, by material aid, to urge on the Valley Railroad to a speedy
                        completion. We have conversed very lately with several gentlemen from other
                        States, where railroads have been completed, which bring their localities
                        into direct communication with prominent markets who give it as their
                        experience that lands have largely increased in value and their communities
                        been greatly advantaged by said roads. They five it as their belief that in
                        a very few years after the completion of the Valley Railroad, the most
                        sanguine will find they have not even imagined the vast advantages of this
                        road to our section. With the experience of others to advise and with reason
                        to urge us to take hold of and complete this road, destined as it is to be
                        of incalculable advantage to our long neglected Valley, it seems wonderful
                        that we show no greater disposition to further this great work. We again
                        call attention to the liberal terms of subscription offered through the card
                        of President in another column, and suggest to all who are interested in the
                        improvement of this section, (and who is not?) to come forward and promptly
                        increase the subscription to the Valley Railroad.--Nothing can be lost by so
                        doing and much is to be gained by it. Will our people still hold back when
                        they are to be so greatly advantaged by the completion of a railway
                        throughout our Valley? We trust not. What do they say to a meeting for the
                        purpose of increasing the subscription at the August Court?</p>

                    <p>In Brownlow's Knoxville Whig of the 1st of August,

                        South to involve the country in another bloody war; and this they aim to do
                        during the next years, under the lead of Andrew Johnson.</p>
                    <p>An attempt to force southern traitors into their seats in Congress with
                        bayonets will be made the occasion for the outbreak. Let the despot now at
                        the head of the Government attempt a thing of this kind if he dare.</p>
                    <p>A million of gallant Union men will at once appear in the District of
                        Columbia, surrounding both the Capitol and white House, disposing of the
                        heads of the leading traitors after the most approved style of the age in
                        which the King of England lost his head. If another war shall be forced upon
                        the country, the loyal masses, who constitute an overwhelming majority of
                        the people of this great nation, intend it shall be no child's play. They
                        will, as they ought to do, make the entire Southern Confederacy as God found
                        the earth when he commenced the work of creation -- "without form and void."
                        They will not, and ought not, leave a rebel fence rail, out-house, or
                        dwelling, in the eleven seceded States. And as for the rebel population, let
                        them be exterminated. And when the war is wound up, which should done
                        rapidly, and with swift destruction, let the lands be resurveyed and sold
                        out to pay the expenses of the war, and settled only by a people who will
                        respect the Stars and Stripes."</p>
