                    <p>Philadelphia is becoming anxious about her waning trade, and through one of
                        her extremely Radical Journals acknowledges the fact that the want of the
                        Southern trade is doing the work. A futile remedy is suggested, unless other
                        things are done. We are down, we acknowledged the corn, but, although
                        defenceless, we don't like to be kicked and cuffed, belabored and berated,
                        and we don't intend to extend the hand of friendship to those who treat us
                        illy in our powerless condition. The best thing that Philadelphia can do is
                        to change the tone of her radical press and people, cease to call us ugly
                        names and heap imprecations on our heads, and try like "Bill Arp," and all
                        of the rest down here to "harmonize," and instead of harsh epithets and
                        blows, extend a helping hand to us in our misfortunes. Besides this if she
                        will exert her powerful influence to restore the Union as it was in the days
                        of her prosperity, she will do more to regain her lost Southern trade than
                        thousands of ships could possibly do, while she still continues cry for our
                        blood and the blood of those dearest to us.</p>

                <summary>Referring to a Philadelphia "Radical Journal" article that expressed
                    concern over the city's waning trade, the author argues that if "instead of
                    harsh epithets and blows" Philadelphia would "extend a helping hand to us in our
                    misfortunes" their economic woes would be alleviated by the prosperity that
                    harmony would engender.</summary>

                <summary>"Junius" writes from West Virginia, arguing that thousands of men in the
                    state would like to reunite with Virginia and encourages efforts in Virginia to
                    pusue that course. He argues that "slavery produced all the estrangements that
                    ever existed. Every sensible man knows this to be true, and every honest man
                    will admit it. Slavery is dead," and with slavery gone reunion should take
                    place, and "the sooner the better."</summary>
