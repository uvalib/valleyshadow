<b>Colonization</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that 1,165 "people of color" have applied to the American

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Eleven hundred and sixty-five people of color have applied to the American
                        Colonization Society for passage to Liberia this fall. They consist of
                        families of men, women, and children, "some mechanics, some farmers, most of
                        them the better class of freedmen, who can read and write, and are
                        intelligent and religious." Here then is the opportunity for the true
                        friends of the colored people in this country to show their faith by their
                        works. The American Colonization Society offers to send these people to the
                        home of their fathers, to civilize and christianize Africa, and to secure
                        their own future peace and happiness.</p>
                    <p>To furnish a comfortable passage and the customary support, house-room, land,
                        &amp;c., to these people for the first six months after landing in
                        Liberia, sixty dollars per capita, or a total of forty thousand dollars are
                        wanted. Who will help to provide for bearing these people to Africa? There
                        is a voice of Providence in the cry of the descendants of Africa for help to
                        reach their ancestral land which the friends of the colored man, to whom God
                        commits property, will not turn away without the best of reasons. He can
                        hope for but little, if anything, from those who would keep him here, for purposes of discord and mischief --but to his
                        best and truest friends --he may turn with the
                        hope that they will do all for him that they can. If the Southern people
                        were able they would be liberal in their aid to the American Colonization
                        Society.--Alex. Gazette</p>

                    recently, but blames the deaths on "neglected diarrhea," which has "some

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The trial of the Police Commissioners of Baltimore, before Gov. Swann,
                        resulted, as every one who read the evidence for and against them suppposed,
                        in deposing them and the appointment of new Police Commissioners by the
                        Governor.</p>
                    <p>The new Commissioners took the oath of office and, armed with their
                        commissions from the Governor, and a fruitless attempt to confer the with
                        the old Commissioners, and finally made a demand for the Station Houses,
                        Books, &amp;c., in writing, which was met by a refusal to deliver them.
                        The new commissioners then procured an office and commenced business by
                        issuing an order to the police force of the city not to obey the orders of
                        the old Police Commissioners, whereupon the new Commissioners and Sheriff
                        were arrested as disturbers of the peace, on a bench warrant issued by Judge
                        Bond, and, upon a refusal to give bail, were committed to jail.</p>
                    <p>A writ of habeas corpus, upon application by
                        counsel, was granted by Judge Bartol, and served upon Wardens of the City
                        Jail to produce the prisoners and show why they were detained in custody.
                        The time allowed for producing the prisoners, under the writ of habeas
                        corpus, being three days the Warden had not produced the prisoners in Court
                        at last advices and it was supposed he would exhaust the limit before he did
                        so, which would reach beyond Tuesday, the day of election, and thus secure
                        another election under the Radical Commissioners, which is all they could
                        desire. The Radicals have managed this affair with considerable skill,
                        completely outwitting the new Commissioners, their friends and the law, and
                        forcibly illustrating the statement of an eminent English Jurist, that "show
                        him any law, and he would drive a coach and four through it."</p>
