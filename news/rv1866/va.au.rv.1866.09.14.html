<b>Didn't Like Fighting</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Uses a fictionalized wartime conversation between two black men to argue
                    that "the negro had no desire to fight on either side, whether for, or against
                    his liberty." One of the black characters explains that in the conflict between
                    "de yankees and 'federates is two dogs fighten for a bone" and that "you see
                    dogs fight for a bone, but neber see de bone fight."<br>

                    <p>It was always clear to the southern mind that the negro had no desire to
                        fight on either side, whether for, or against his liberty,and this fact is
                        somewhat strikingly illustrated in the following anecdote, related by the
                        Savannah News and Herald, which was given by a faithful Virginia servant of
                        an officer in the Confederate army. Shortly after the news had reached the
                        camp in North Carolina that the Confederate Government contemplated putting
                        the blacks into the service, the subject was frequently discussed among the
                        negroes around the camp fire:</p>
                    <p>"Is you gwine to lit, Thornton?" asked a spirited darkey of a staid old
                        fellow, who had followed his master through the war.</p>
                    <p>"No," replied Thornton, "I don't want nuffin to do with fightin. Nigger got
                        no business with muskets."</p>
                    <p>But," inquired the other, who pretended to favor the idea, "ain't you willin
                        to help to lick the nasty, stinking yankess, what our folks make trabel so
                        fast. Ain't you gin em?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes I is 'posed to them, but de way to help to whip dem varmints, is for de
                        nigger to use doe hoe. He knows what to do wid dat, but don't wid de
                        musket!"</p>
                    <p>"Eh, Thornton, you don't want to fight nobody."</p>
                    <p>"Dat's de fact," said the other, "den if de home don't, he gits mighty bad chawed sometimes."</p>
                    <p>This naive conversation, simple as its is, illustrates the situation of the
                        negro more clearly than the most recherche
                        treatise we have upon this subject. Yes! the negro has been terribly "chawed" in the late conflict between the north and
                        south, the extent of which no one has any knowledge, but this present
                        condition under the fostering care of the munificent Freedmen's Bureau, is decidedly worse. Sic

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A lengthy rebuttal of the views of John B. Baldwin, as expressed in a
                    letter in another column of the Vindicator and in his testimony before the
                    Reconstruction Committee. The editor is adamant that the conflict was a civil
                    war and not a rebellion, because it "was emphatically a movement of the people .
                    . . in which the leaders were their servants."<br>(Names in announcement:  John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish in this issue the letter of the Hon. J. B. Baldwin in explanation
                        of his evidence before the Reconstruction Committee. While we desire to lay
                        before our readers the views of Mr. Baldwin, we are unwilling that they
                        shall be construed as an expression of the sentiment of this community. Some
                        may view this matter as does Mr. Baldwin, but we think that very few, here
                        or elsewhere, will agree with him in the opinion he states as a lawyer. If
                        anything is plainly laid down in the law books, it is the definition of what
                        constitutes civil war in contradistinction to
                            rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Even in cases of popular commotion, insurrection or sedition, nor rising to
                        the dignity of civil war. Vattel says, (Chap. XVIII Of Civil War, p. 421)
                        and all modern publicists agree with him, "that while every citizens should
                        even patiently endure evils which are not insupportable, rather than disturb
                        the public peace, a denial of justice on the part of the sovereign, or
                        effected delays can alone excuse the furious transport of people whose
                        patience has been exhausted and even justify them
                        if the evils be intolerable and the oppression great and manifest. That in
                        such cases the conduct of the Sovereign shall at the same time be most
                        consonant to justice and salutary to the State. Altho it be his duty to
                        repress those who unnecessarily disturb the
                        public peace, he is bound to show clemency, towards unfortunate persons, to
                        whom just causes of complaint have been given,
                        and whose sole crime consists in the attempt to do themselves justice. They
                        have been deficient in patience rather than fidelity. Subjects who rise
                        against their Prince without cause deserve punishment, yet even in this
                        cause, on account of the number of the delinquents clemency becomes a duty in the sovereign."</p>
                    <p>But the same author, when he comes to speak of civil war, says "when a party
                        is formed in a State, who no longer obey the sovereign, and are possessed of
                        sufficient strength to oppose him, or when in a Republic the nation is
                        divided into two opposite factions, and both sides take up arms, this is
                        called a civil war. Some writers confine this
                        term to a just insurrection of the subjects against their Sovereign, to
                        distinguish that lawful resistance from rebellion, which is an open and unjust resistance. But what
                        appellation will they give to a war which arises in a Republic torn by two
                        factions, or in a Monarchy between two competitors for the crown? Custom
                        appropriates the term of civil war to every war between the member of one
                        and the same political society. If it be between part of the citizens on one
                        side and the Sovereign with those who continue in obedience to him on the
                        other, provided malcontents have any reason for
                        taking up arms, nothing further is required to entitle such disturbances to
                        the name of civil war and not that of rebellion.
                        * * * The Sovereign indeed, never fails to bestow the appellation of rebels
                        on all such of his subjects as openly resist him, but when the latter have
                        acquired sufficient strength to give him effectual opposition, and to oblige
                        him to carry on the war against them according to the established rules he
                        must necessarily submit to the use of the term civil war."</p>
                    <p>"A civil war breaks the bands of society and government or at least suspends
                        their force and effect. It produces in the nation two independent parties,
                        who consider each other as enemies, and acknowledge no common judge. Those
                        two parties, therefore, must necessarily be considered, as thenceforward
                        constituting, at least for a time, two separate bodies,--two distinct
                        societies. Though one of the parties may have been to blame in breaking the
                        unity of the State and resisting the lawful authority they are not the less
                        divided in fact. Besides who shall judge them? Who shall pronounce on which
                        side the right or the wrong lies? On earth, they have no common superior.
                        They stand, therefore, in precisely the same predicament, as two nations who
                        engage in a contest, and, being unable to come to an agreement, have
                        recourse to arms. * * * They decide their quarrel by arms as two different
                        nations would do. The obligation to observe the common laws or war to each
                        other is therefore absolute -- indispensably binding on both parties, and
                        the same which the law of nature impose on all nations in transactions
                        between State and State."</p>
                    <p>The only exception which this author makes to that immunity of the citizens
                        of each contending party, which belongs to the citizens to independent
                        States, is that "when the Sovereign has subdued the opposite party and
                        reduced them to submit and sue for peace, he may
                        except from the amnesty the authors to the disturbances, the heads of the
                        party. He may bring them to a legal trial and
                        punish them if they be found guilty. He may act
                        in this manner particularly on occasion to those disturbances, in which the
                        interests of the people are not so much the object in view, as the private
                        aims of some powerful individuals and which rather deserve the appellation
                        of revolt than of civil
                        war."</p>
                    <p>This exception does not embrace th case of the Southern Confederacy, where no
                        powerful individuals intervened, but which was emphatically a movement of
                        the people, to promote the supposed interests of the people alone, in which
                        the leaders of the people were their servants. Under the light of the
                        foregoing authority, which we believe is the exponent of the views of all
                        publicists since the days when the head of Charles of England fell from the
                        block, we are at a loss to conceive how the crime of treason can be
                        attributed to the citizens of the Confederate States, in consequence of acts
                        done during the late war, when the North and South "stood in precisely the
                        same predicament, as two nations, who engage in a contest * * * two separate
                        bodies, who pretended to absolute independence and between whom there was no
                        judge. Who decided their quarrel by arms as two distinct nations would do,"
                        who of course therefore [unclear] but separate jurisdiction over their
                        citizens respectively, and the right, while the war lasted, to punish as
                        traitors those of their respective citizens, who committed acts which would
                        have rendered them punishable as such by an independent nation. The bands of
                        society and government were broken, or at least their force and effect
                        suspended, who then could any one commit treason against a government which
                        as to him no longer existed? What cruelty could compel him to fall under the
                        axe of his own party, to whom his allegiance was due, as to a separate and
                        independent State, at least for the time, or, escaping that, become a victim
                        to the restored laws of the other government? This question turns then not
                        upon the "right of secession," but upon the universal principles of
                        international law.</p>
                    <p>How any one can therefore conclude that the attempt on the part of the
                        Southern States to secure their independence was a rebellion we are at a
                        loss to conceive, and most heartily dissent from this conclusion stated by
                        Mr. Baldwin to be his legal opinion. We can not see that the "right of
                        secession" has anything whatever to do with determining the character of the
                        war, as to its being a rebellion or a civil war. Whether we had the right to
                        secede or did not have that right, the dimensions and objects of the contest
                        alone determined the character of the war and placed it, unquestionably, in
                        the category of civil wars. Hence the unwarranted conclusion of Mr. Baldwin
                        in classing it as a rebellion, and in consequence the equally unwarranted
                        conclusion that each and every one of us is guilty of treason.</p>
                    <p>In our complex system of Government, the citizens, owing allegaince to both
                        the State and Federal Governments, according to Mr. Baldwin, is liable, in
                        cases of conflict between them, to be tried and punished for treason by his
                        State for siding with the Federal Government, or by the latter for obeying
                        the laws of his State. A wonderful dilemma for the citizen, for go which way
                        he will he cannot escape, but must suffer the penalty of treason to one or
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>We disagree also in the assertion of Mr. Baldwin that every pardon sought and
                        accepted admits a doubt of the defence to be made before a court and jury.
                        We do not conceive that it admits this doubt at all.--Many person never
                        thought of the matter in the light of a jury trial. With a pardon they
                        believed they would be free from lawlessness and violence, without it they
                        feared they would not. It seemed to them a necessity they were forced to, by
                        the edict of the Chief Magistrate of the country, in order to save what
                        little of property they had left and not that they could not make good their
                        defence, for a trial for treason never entered their thoughts. As a proof of
                        this, men of property who had taken but little or no part in the struggle
                        sought and accepted pardon, while many who were active participators and
                        owned nothing have never given the subject of pardon of a second thought,
                        and are to this day unpardoned. They assign as a reason for it, that they
                        have no property to lose.</p>
                    <p>Surely life is more precious than property and if they had for a moment
                        thought they could be tried, or that they could not make good their defense,
                        they would have applied for and secured the pardon.</p>
                    <p>With his remarks concerning the continued imprisonment of Jefferson Davis we
                        cordially concur, but regret exceedingly that this letter, as a whole has
                        gone before the people of the country. It will be heralded as the legal
                        opinion of a lawyer of eminence among us, who concedes that both law and
                        right are against us, and may be productive of harm, and especially to our
                        imprisoned fellow Southron, whom he so feelingly compassionates, but can not
                        be productive of good.</p>

<b>Letter from Hon. John B. Baldwin--His Testimony Before the Reconstruction

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John Baldwin offers a clarification of his comments relating to Jefferson
                    Davis's incarceration. Baldwin said only that if Davis was tried he would
                    probably be convicted of treason, not that Davis should be tried. As long as
                    Davis is held in prison, Baldwin argues, there can be no reconciliation between

                    <p>Staunton, August 10, 1866</p>
                    <p>Nat. B. Meade, Esq.</p>
                    <p>My Dear Sir -- I have received your letter and I thank you for calling my
                        attention to a construction of my testimony about the trial of President
                        Davis, which does injustice alike to my opinion and my feelings. My
                        testimony was taken in short hand, and was not read over to me or submitted
                        for my revision. I am surprised at its general correctness; but I find that,
                        in several instances my meaning has been inaccurately stated, or wholly
                        misapprehended.</p>
                    <p>The point of my inquiry was as to the probable result of a trial of Mr. Davis
                        before a court and jury, if one should be had, and not as to the propriety
                        of subjecting him to such an ordeal.</p>
                    <p>It was my purpose to state my belief that our unsuccessful attempt at
                        revolution must be regarded as rebellion, and, if judicially considered and
                        applied to individual cases, must subject each offender to the penalties of
                        treason. Such, I presume, must be the opinion of all who believe in the
                        "right of secession," and such must, of course, be the view of the
                        Government of the United States. Every pardon granted and every amnesty
                        offered is an assertion of this principle; and every pardon sought of this
                        principle; and every pardon sought or accepted admits, at least, a doubt of
                        the defence to be made before a court and jury.</p>
                    <p>While my opinion as a lawyer is what I have stated, I do not at all intend to
                        admit the propriety of attempting to deal by judicious trials with
                        transactions whose national proportions place them beyond the proper reach
                        of court and jury. Each individual case if brought into court, must in my
                        opinion, be held to constitute treason, and be dealt with accordingly, but
                        each case is so thoroughly a representative of all, that a trial of any one,
                        would, to all intents and purposes, be subjecting the conduct of a nation to
                        the review of twelve jurors.</p>
                    <p>If this would be true of any one Confederate, who much more must it be felt
                        to be true of President Davis, who, in his prison, is this day more
                        emphatically the representative of our cause than he was when
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate army and navy.</p>
                    <p>To subject a man occupying his position to a trial by the narrow rules which
                        limit judicial construction, and to the mockery of a jury trial, would, in
                        my opinion, be an outrage too gross to be anticipated of any government in
                        Christendom.</p>
                    <p>Every day that he is kept in prison is a peremtory adjournment of all real
                        reconciliation between the North and the South. Any attempt to subject him
                        to further humiliation must be regarded as a personal wrong done to every
                        true southern man; and if he shall be permitted to die in captivity his name
                        will became the watchward of Southern hate!--It is to be regretted that the
                        Convention recently held at Philadelphia did not recognize the necessity of
                        amnesty for the past as a basis of good will for the future; but I trust
                        that this omission will be set right by President Johnson and that he will
                        be the prompt point and vitality to his recent declaration that "unless we
                        forget the past we can have no future."</p>
                    <p>Yours truly,</p>
                    <p>John B. Baldwin</p>
                <br>
