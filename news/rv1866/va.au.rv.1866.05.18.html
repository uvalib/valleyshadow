<b>Lovers and Husbands</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges husbands not to neglect their wives after doting on them while
                    courting.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Husbands, I am talking to you. Why don't you pay the same little attentions
                        to your wives after marriages as before? When you are "courting" the dear
                        little creature is an object of constant solicitude on your part. She must
                        take care of her feet on a damp evening You softly whisper in her ear that
                        she must take care of her health for your sake. What charming
                        disinterestedness! for your sake, not for hers. Then you very tenderly wrap
                        her shawl about her, and keep your arm there to prevent the little witch
                        from taking cold. Always on the alert, very thoughtful are these lovers for
                        their intended comfort; the memories are very retentive.</p>
                    <p>But husbands, can you inform me why it is that you lose your memories so soon
                        after marriage? Why is it that many of you (I will not say all) neglect to
                        pay these little attentions to your wives that are so essential to a woman's
                        happiness. Is it because she is less dear to you than of yore? Do you weary
                        of her who left home, parents, brothers and sisters, for your sake-giving
                        her happiness to a stranger's keeping? Do you weary of her you promised to
                        love and cherish till death parts you? Is this the return you make for all
                        she gave you? Those many little nameless attentions that make courtship so
                        delightful, ought not to be discontinued after marriage. They are just as
                        acceptable then as ever, and let me whisper in your ears, oh, husbands, they
                        are the cream of woman's life-the flowers of her existence: flowers whose
                        fragrance never pall on the senses.</p>
                    <p>If you want your wife to study your comfort and tastes, show that you
                        appreciate her efforts to please you, by praising her. It goes a great way
                        with women. Avoid finding fault on every occasion. Many clouds have arisen
                        in the domestic sky occasioned by fault-finding. Lovers, do not bestow all
                        your attention on your sweet-hearts, but reserve a few for your wives.</p>

<b>The Late Riots in Memphis--What They Amounted To--The Killed and the Wounded</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An account of the recent riots in Memphis, which were triggered when two
                    carts collided in a crowded street and resulted in at least 15 deaths, most of

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The riots of Tuesday and Wednesday, now that they have passed away, can be
                        referred to and conversed about by all classes in the community. The origins
                        of the riots seems destined to be buried in oblivion; for it seems
                        impossible, even four days after the occurrences, to trace the real cause of
                        the disturbance. That the riots were unpremeditated there is hardly one
                        person in the community will dare to deny. The cause was simply this: A
                        negro and a white man got into an altercation on South street on the after
                        noon of Tuesday and from words they came to blows. A couple of policemen
                        interfered to stop the disturbance, several negroes came to the assistance
                        of their comrade, and the riot became general. While the row was in
                        progress, and when the police were about to be overpowered, Henry Dunn, the
                        engineer of engine two, made his appearance on the ground. He went to the
                        assistance of the police, as it was his duty as a fireman to do, and easily
                        fell a victim.-He was shot down a few minutes after he entered the struggle;
                        and after lingering in the greatest agony for several hours he expired.
                        While the row was in progress, officers Slatterly and Stephens were also
                        wounded-the latter mortally. Faint hopes were entertained that Stephens
                        would recover, but although everything was done which medical aid could
                        suggest, he gradually sank until death put an end to his sufferings on
                        Friday evening. The medical gentlemen in attendance on Officer Slatterly and
                        a citizen named Finn, who was also seriously wounded, are sanguine they will
                        recover.</p>
                    <p>Four negroes in all were shot down during the riot on Tuesday night, all of
                        whom died from their wounds. On the morning of Wednesday that disturbances
                        were resumed near the Memphis and Charleston depot. By this time the
                        military had been called out, and acting the conjunction with the police and
                        a posse comitatus under command of Sheriff
                        Winters, the negroes were quickly dispersed after four of their number had
                        been shot down. </p>
                    <p>All the citizens were of opinion that the disturbances were now at an end, as
                        the negroes had retreated to Fort Pickering; but their hopes were not
                        realized. Shortly after 8 o'clock in the evening a bright lurid glare was to
                        be observed creeping gradually over the southern horizon, and the news soon
                        reached the city that the mob, acting under the bad counsels of their
                        leaders, had fired a school-house and several negro cabins in South Memphis.
                        The firemen turned promptly out, but owing to the great scarcity of water
                        they were unable to stay the devouring element. In the disturbance which
                        took place, four negroes and one negress were shot down and pistols and
                        knives freely used on both sides.</p>
                    <p>Fires took place during the night in various parts of the city, and the
                        greatest excitement prevailed among citizens. Before the morning's sun rose,
                        no less than three colored churches, four colored schools, and about thirty
                        cabins, had fallen prey to the devouring element.</p>
                    <p>The number killed during these unfortunate disturbances, which all good,
                        law-abiding citizens regret in the most heartfelt manner, were as follows:
                        Henry Dunn, engineer of No. 21 fire engine, and officer Stephens, of the
                        police force. Twelve negroes in all were killed during the riots. Four were
                        killed the first evening (Tuesday), four on the following morning, and four,
                        including a woman named Rachel, whiles the fires were in progress during
                        Wednesday evening.</p>
                    <p>There has been a great amount of debate relative to the origin of the riot
                        and the parties who were engaged in it. The testimony in regard to all these
                        particulars is most conflicting, but all agree on one thing-that those who
                        engaged in the riot were persons of irresponsible character, and it will be
                        unfair to charge these untoward disturbances to the good, law-abiding
                        citizens of the city of Memphis. <br></p>
                    <p>THE RADICAL STORY <br></p>
                    <p>There is no doubt but that there is a secret 
                        organization (which General Runkle knows all about) sworn to purge the city
                        of all Northern men who are not rebels , all
                        negro teachers, all Yankee enterprise, and return the city "to the good old
                        days of Southern rule and chivalry." </p>
                    <p>Night before last they did all the burning. Last night they were to have
                        killed all the teachers; but py the "treachery" of one of their own party,
                        who appears to have had a little humanity, the teachers were notified, I
                        sent my own sister home  because I was actually
                            fearful for her life. Letter to Mr. Kelley.</p>

                    <p>Thursday, the 10th inst., was a day long to be remembered in Staunton.
                        Although we called attention, on the 4th inst., to the appropriateness of
                        adopting that day, the anniversary of the death of our beloved, "Stonewall"
                        Jackson, the peerless Christian soldier, as the one on which, annually, all
                        Southern people should unite in showing their respect for and paying homage
                        to our dead fathers, brothers, husbands and sons, who fell in defence of our
                        "lost cause," yet there was no organized effort made to observe the day
                        until several days thereafter, and our anticipations of the magnitude of the
                        ceremonies was vastly more than realized.</p>
                    <p>The notice was short and many in the country were not aware that the e10th
                        would be devoted to honoring our Confederate dead, but at an early hour in
                        the morning crowds could be seen pouring in to town on every road, until
                        perhaps, a larger number of our people assembled in Staunton, than were ever
                        congregated assembled in Staunton, than were ever congregated here on any
                        previous occasion. Business was suspended in honor to the dead, and all
                        parties united in paying homage to our departed heroes.</p>
                    <p>At 10 A. M., the procession was formed by Col. C. T. O'Ferrall, Chief
                        Marshall, aided by his Assistants, Capts. Jed. Hotchkiss and Lieut. Jno. L.
                        Opie, in the following order: <br></p>
                    <p>The "Stonewall" Band.</p>
                    <p>Clergy and Press.</p>
                    <p>Speakers and Singers.</p>
                    <p>Surviving members of "Stonewall" Brigade.</p>
                    <p>Surviving soldiers of the late C. S. Army.</p>
                    <p>Ladies bearing flowers.</p>
                    <p>Sabbath Schools bearing flowers.</p>
                    <p>Schools bearing flowers.</p>
                    <p>Pupils of the D. D. &amp; B. Institute.</p>
                    <p>Citizens generally. <br></p>
                    <p>The procession moved in this order to the music of the "Stonewall" Band, down
                        Beverly Street to Augusta, up Augusta to Frederick, up Frederick to Lewis
                        and down Lewis to the Episcopal Methodist church.</p>
                    <p>The exercises in the Church were opened by an appropriate prayer by Rev. E.
                        L. Busey, and the singing of <br></p>
                    <p>"Hark to the solemn bell," <br></p>
                    <p>and consisted in addresses and vocal music in the following order: <br></p>
                    <p>Address by Col. Jas. H. Skinner.</p>
                    <p>Music-"Vacant Chair."</p>
                    <p>Address by Capt. Jas. Bumgardner.</p>
                    <p>Music-"Officer's Funeral."</p>
                    <p>Address by Howe Y. Peyton, Esq.,</p>
                    <p>Music-"Jackson's Grave."</p>
                    <p>Address by Capt. Powell Harrison.</p>
                    <p>Music.-"Cast thy burden on the Lord."</p>
                    <p>Address by Col. Bolivar Christian. <br></p>
                    <p>The addresses were necessarily short and but a short time allowed for their
                        preparation, but were exceedingly appropriate and reflected credit on the
                        orators of the occasion. The vocal music was of the kind for which our
                        mountain city is famous and the several pieces were rendered with a skill
                        reflecting great credit on the singers, and a pathos which stirred to their
                        depths the feelings of the vast auditory.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the services at the Church, the procession was formed in
                        the same order as before by the Marshals, and moved down Lewis Street to
                        Beverly and up Beverly to Thornrose Cemetery. It was the longest procession
                        we have ever witnessed in Staunton, being nearly a mile in length and
                        supposed to number 2500 persons. Arriving at the Cemetery, the ladies and
                        children bearing flowers were arranged in sections of convenient numbers for
                        strewing, simultaneously with flowers and evergreens the graves of over 2000
                        Confederate dead, when the Band struck up a dirge and, with heads uncovered,
                        the graves were decorated with wreaths, bouquets, and scattered flowers.</p>
                    <p>It was indeed a solemn and imposing spectacle. Tottering age and tender youth
                        united in a harmonious and heartfelt offering to our dead kindred and
                        friends, and not forgetting the stranger, who battled shoulder to shoulder,
                        with our loved and fallen ones, and now takes his last sleep by their side.
                        May their spirits bloom, as the flowers which deck their graves, eternal in
                        the Paradise of God, and the remembrance of their heroic deeds and
                        sacrifices be ever green in our memories.</p>
                    <p>The strewing of flowers on the graves being finished, the procession returned
                        to town and was dismissed.</p>
                    <p>That the inaugural of the 10th day of May, as the anniversary, upon which all
                        may unite in manifesting our respect for the Confederate dead, was in such
                        an eminent degree a success, is due especially to our noble ladies, who are
                        ever first in every good work. With them, originated the idea of enclosing
                        and adorning the graves of our fallen Confederates, and the selection of a
                        day to be set apart for revering their memories and commemorating their
                        noble deeds and heroic sacrifices. <br></p>

                        personally appeared before me in my said county, and made oath that he
                        signed a petition setting forth that threats were being made against the
                        lives of loyal men, that neither justice nor protection could be obtained at

                    <p>Mr. Editor:-In your last paper I notice a petition
                        purporting to be signed by a number of citizens of this County, praying the
                        return of troops &amp;c, here, together with an affidavit of one James
                        Tood, stating that the said petitioners are residents of this County, and
                        the name of John A. Harris appearing as one of the signers thereto I desire
                        to state publicly that I never signed said petition nor
                            authorized any one to do so for me. </p>
                    <p>I will further add, that I was asked to sign it and
                            positively refused to do so. </p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor:--I see in the last issue of your paper
                        a petition purporting to be signed by a number of citizens of Augusta
                        County, and an affidavit appended thereto by James Todd, in which he states
                        that the names signed to said petition are citizens of this County, and were
                        signed in his presence, and my name appearing as
                        one of the signers, I have only to say that I know nothing of said petition,
                        and never affixed my name to such a paper, in the presence of James Todd or
                        any other party. </p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor:-- as one of the signers to the
                        petition praying for the return of troops in this county, and in vindication
                        of myself I will make the following statements. </p>
                    <p>Shortly after I was appointed Postmaster at this place, in September last, I
                        signed a petition that was [UNCLEAR] but I never signed
                            or authorized anyone to sign for me, any paper or petition setting forth
                            what is contained in the petition that appears in your last
                        issue. It is evident to my mind, that those, who think their precious
                        lives and magnificent dwellings and other property is in jeopardy from the
                        rebels have resorted to under handed measures to obtain signatures to this
                        petition, that they knew well enough they could not
                            obtain in any other way. And to my certain knowledge I have not
                        seen or had any communication with Mr. Todd for the past ten years or more.
                        You will be kind enough to give a place in your next issue and oblige </p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor:--I saw my name signed to a petition
                        sent to the Congress of the U. S., from Augusta County, asking that troops
                        should be sent to Staunton, to protect the Union men of Augusta in their
                        lives and property. Now I am not a citizen of Augusta County, and when I
                        signed the petition, I was told that it was not for the purpose of asking
                        troops to be sent to Staunton or anywhere else, but the intention of it was
                        that Union men should be protected in open Court; and that they should not
                        be imposed upon by former secessionists, if they should happen to get into
                        any difficulty with any such The object of this card is to prevent the
                        public sentiment condemning me for signing a petition, the object of which I
                        was totally ignorant of. </p>
                    <p>I would further state, that I never heard that the life or property of any
                        Union man was ever threatened, or in any way endangered
                            because of his sentiments. </p>

                    <p>GOSHEN, Rockbridge Co., May 14, 1866. <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:-- In your issue of the 11th inst., I
                        observe my name attached to a petition praying a return of u. S., troops to
                        this section, on a plea that "Union men could not get justice done them in
                        Civil Courts, and that threats were made against their lives and property."
                            I was not aware that justice could not be obtained,
                            or that threats had been made, and therefore had no reason for
                        signing any such  a petition, and I most
                        emphatically deny  having done so, knowingly. I
                        signed, what I thought was a petition for Mr. W. J. Dews to be appointed
                        Notary Public, but none other. I never saw Mr. Todd but twice in my life,
                            and never signed any paper for him or in his
                            presence. Should you see fit you can give this publicity. </p>

                    <p>Waynesboro' VA., May 14th, 1866 <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:-- I see among the signers to the
                        petition you published last week the name of Saml. J. Wampler, presuming I
                        am the person meant, I desire to state that I signed a petition upon the
                        representation of others, which I supposed entirely different from this, but
                        it seems the petition you published is the one I signed. I do not agree with
                        those, if any, who signed this petition knowingly, and would not have signed
                        it had I understood its meaning. I do not think any one is in danger of
                        persecution or will fail to obtain justice through the civil courts, on
                        account of previous or present sentiments, and see no necessity whatever for
                        the return of troops to this point. </p>
                    <p>SAML. L. WAMPLER,</p>
                    <p>May 16th 1866. Christian's Creek. <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:-- I see in your last issue a petition
                        purporting to be signed by a number of citizens of Augusta County. Among
                        said signers I find the name of Samuel T. Driver, which being thought by
                        many to be my signature. I desire through the medium of your paper to state
                        that I never signed said petition, which fact I also stated on oath, a short
                        time since, as a witness in the case of A. W. Greaver. </p>

                        Justice of said County and made oath that he did not himself, neither did he
                        authorize any person else to sign his name to a petition sent from this
                        county to the Congress of the United States for troops to be returned to
                        said county, for the protection of loyal citizens. Given under my hand and

                    <p>The subject of this memorial, Mrs. ELIZA H. EDMONDSON, widow of the elate Dr.
                        John Edmondson, and daughter of the late Rev. William Calhoun, died at her
                        residence, in this place on the 1st instant.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Edmondson's disposition was gentle, affectionate, sincere, forgiving and
                        grateful; she was a true and faithful friend, a devoted wife and mother, a
                        conscientious and devotional Christian. She spoke much of the supporting
                        presence of her Savior, as she lay on her bed of weariness and languor.</p>
                    <p>Delighting greatly, as she did, in social intercourse, and especially in the
                        society of experienced christians, how must she rejoice in the heavenly
                        companionship upon which she has now entered.</p>
                    <p>Surely, even those who loved her tenderly, and who deeply mourn her loss,
                        must feel that it is far better for her, thus to have departed, that she may
                        be forever with the Lord.</p>
                    <p>A FRIEND.</p>
