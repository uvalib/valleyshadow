<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lexington Gazette and Banner</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We observe in the last issue of the Lexington Gazette and Banner that the vote taken in
                        Rockbridge County, on the 3rd inst., on the question of that County
                        subscribing $100,000 to the Valley Railroad Stock, resulted almost
                        unanimously in favor of said subscription, the vote being 497 for 36 against
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Rockbridge County was the first to lead off on the question of County
                        subscriptions to the Valley Railroad stock and well has she acted. This
                        road, which all acknowledge will vastly benefit our section, can only be
                        built by the conjoint action of the people and communities along its route.
                        If they fail to rise equal to the occasion, the Valley Railroad scheme fails
                        or lies for a time dormant. There is not in the history of railroad
                        construction an instance, we believe, in which they have not increased the
                        material prosperity of the sections and States in which they were built.
                        With the advantages, so often stated of the Valley Railroad to our section
                        and county, it seems wonderful to us that our people should allow a fear of
                        increased taxation in this great work. If a man's taxes are $50 and his
                        actual profit only $500, it would be hard indeed to double the income, but
                        if by increasing his taxes slightly, you enhance his income in a greater
                        proportion then the matter assumes a different aspect. This will be the case
                        with the Valley Railroad--once built better prices for our products, reduced
                        rates for transportation, increased value to our possessions, influx of
                        money, &amp;c., and in a short time our incomes will greatly enhanced
                        while taxation has been but slightly increased. This matter has been dwelt
                        upon and so thoroughly discussed in the papers in the past that we do not
                        desire to weary our readers by its discussion at present, but simply desire
                        them to reflect upon this subject without prejudice, and we are satisfied
                        that they will not suffer to pass by, much less voluntarily thrust aside, a
                        scheme destined evidently to benefit them so much, but eagerly await the
                        time when they can cast their votes for the county contribution, thus making
                        the great step towards the rapid recuperation of our section and return to
                        its former prosperity.</p>
