                    <p>We have frequently called the attention of our readers to the fact that every
                        nerve should be strained to secure the success of the Valley Railroad,
                        destined as it is, to be of such great advantage to the people of this
                        section. Doubtless every County interested will vote to subscribe its
                        proportionate share of stock. An application was made to the County Court on
                        Monday last to take the sense of the people, on the 4th Thursday in October
                        next, on the subject of Augusta's subscribing for her proportion of Valley
                        Railroad stock, and an order of Court was made to that effect.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the people of Augusta, as suggested in the Vindicator of the
                        17th inst., was held at the last Court, the proceedings of which will be
                        found in another column.</p>
                    <p>From the proceedings it will be seen that not only will the subject of
                        subscription by the County be canvassed by competent speakers at each
                        precinct in the County, but committees will canvass each magisterial
                        district for the purpose of increasing the private subscription to this
                        great work.</p>
                    <p>The terms of subscription given by the President in another column, to which
                        we have frequently called the attention of our readers, are most liberal,
                        and it now remains with our people whether they will come nobly up to the
                        work and make the Valley Railroads a success. If they, and the people
                        generally of the Valley, respond as they should do, the road will be put
                        under contract speedily, and not only will thousands of dollars be spent in
                        our midst, but a market at home will be insured for much of our surplus. We
                        ask our people to calmly consider the subject of subscription by the County,
                        and their own interest in increasing the private subscriptions and act to
                        their convictions. If they do this we are satisfied that the Valley Railroad
                        will be an accomplished fact in a very few years, and the words of a
                        gentleman from another State, whose immediate locality is intersected by
                        various railway lines, will be realized, viz: "that the advantage which will
                        accrue to our people and section have not even been imagined by the most
                        sanguine."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Gen. Howard, under instructions from the Secretary of War, has issued an
                        order to the officers of the Freedmen's Bureau to cease on the first of
                        October, to issue rations to the freedmen, excepting patients in regular
                        hospitals, or inmates of orphan asylum already established. The poor among
                        the freedmen are to be turned over the State authorities.</p>
                    <p>The Bureau at first fed a large number of those who were able to care for
                        themselves and hence invited the influx of negroes from the country into the
                        towns where the agencies of the Bureau were located, and consequent upon
                        this, in a great measure, was the unwillingness of the negro to betake
                        himself to useful labor. By this order, on the first of October, the last
                        hope of the indolent negro is gone. No further premium for laziness is
                        offered by the Bureau in the shape of furnishing rations to idlers. This is
                        a good step on the ration question. The only fault we find with it is, that
                        its promulgation has been deferred to the present time. It should have
                        issued long since in fast directly after the cessation of hostilities.</p>
                    <p>Before the war the poor an unfortunate negroes were provided for, for life.
                        By law the owner must take care of them. We had no colored people in our
                        poor houses, and further South very few poor houses, and in large districts
                        none at all. Now the poor negroes are proposed to be cared for by the
                        States. We agree with a cotemporary that without our consent we were
                        deprived of our property in slaves, and that the poor are the wards of the
                        nation and should not be saddled upon us. Really the Northern States should
                        bear all the burden of providing for them, as they have reaped all the
                        profits and we have sustained all the losses. But justice is something we
                        can scarcely expect these out-of-joint times.</p>

                    <p>Washington, August 25.--The Committee appointed by the Labor Convention at
                        Baltimore, waited on the President to-day, Mr. Hinchliff, the spokesman,
                        disclaimed connection with any party in a political sense, or that the
                        movement was for political power. He urged that eight hours per day labor
                        should be legalized; that the public lands should be distributed so as to be
                        reached by laborers instead of capitalists; and that the Workingmen should
                        be protected against convict labor. He asked the President's assistance to
                        accomplish these measures for Workingmen.</p>
                    <p>In reply, the President said he was opposed to the present system of convict
                        labor, on account of its unjust discrimination and degrading influences. He
                        desired to see labor elevated, and such always had been his position. His
                        whole history showed that he was opposed to a monopoly of the Public lands.
                        He was for shortcoming the hours of labor to the least number consistent
                        with the interest of all, and the laboring men could rely upon his influence
                        when it could be given in their behalf. They had his sympathy and best
                        feelings in their cause, and he hoped they would accomplish their
                    objects.</p>
