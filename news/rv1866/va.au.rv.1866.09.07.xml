                <transcript>
                    <p>On Monday evening last, we, in [unclear] with other gentlemen attended at the
                        African school room, by invitation, for the purpose of hearing an address
                        which was delivered to the freedmen by Lewis Ivey, a very intelligent men of
                        their own color, who was formerly a favorite slave of Judge George H.
                        Gilmer, of Pittsylvania county. The attendance of freedmen was quite large,
                        and we were agreeably surprised at the correct views which the speaker
                        seemed to have of the condition of the freedmen, as well as the facility
                        with which he expressed them in language which bore evidence of far more
                        mental training then is usually found among men of his class. His address
                        was delivered with an air of earnestness and truth, and marked with a degree
                        of sound common sense that commended it to earnest consideration of his
                        numerous auditors, who seemed to appreciate it.</p>
                    <p>The object of the address seemed to be to impress upon the minds of freedmen,
                        the importance of a correct understanding of their true relation to white
                        men of the South, who he represented as being their only true friends and to
                        impress upon them the importance of cultivating amicable relations with them
                        by a course of life which would entitle them to their kind consideration,
                        and make it to their interest to retain them as laborers. Their only chance
                        now was to rely upon their own industry, honesty and frugality, without the
                        proper exercise of which they must become a more deeply degraded people, and
                        would ultimately become extinct.</p>
                    <p>There were other points of interest which he discussed with a degree of
                        intelligence an force seldom evince by one of his color; and during his
                        whole address he gave utterances to no sentiment, to which any true Southern
                        man might not heartily subscribe, however, unpalatable some of them might
                        have been to those who profess to be the freedmen's only true friends, the
                        nature and object of which friendship was correctly explained and
                        ludicrously criticized.--<emph rend="italic">Danville, Va., News</emph>.</p>

                    <p>President Johnson has been received with the most unbounded enthusiasm at
                        every point on his route to Chicago. His speeches are of the same character
                        at every place expressing his fixed determination to carry out his policy
                        and secure the speedy restoration of the Union. There is scarcely a doubt
                        that Gen. Grant, who accompanies him sympathizes with and sustains his
                        policy. This seems to arouse the ire of the radicals more than the
                        President's adherence to his plan. The "defection" of Gen. Grant, as they
                        style it; the highest officer in the army, to whom the soldiers look up with
                        paternal affection, and whose lead the large majority of them are likely to
                        follow, is something the radicals can but illy brook. It haunts their
                        midnight dreams with visions of coming party defeat. The volcano of their
                        wrath can not be restricted. It bursts forth in the ebullitions of such men
                        as Banks and Butler. All they can do is to foam and fret. The ovation will
                        continue to follow the President in his trip -- Gen. Grant will receive the
                        gratitude of the people for his sympathy with conservatism, and the coming
                        elections will open the eyes of the radicals to their hitherto suicidal
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>One David Quinn, of Chicago, has just published, in pamphlet, form, a
                        memorial to Congress, advising the re-establishment of negro slavery. It
                        present the subject in a new phase, in which has probably not heretofore
                        been considered. It holds that men are divided into species and have
                        different natures; that the negro finds his civil liberty in his slavery,
                        and that the white man undergoes a change in America which makes slavery
                        essential; that the French in Canada and Spaniard in Mexico have
                        degenerated, and that the native people of the Northern United States are
                        now three inches less around the chest than Europeans. The author brings
                        forward many historical and scientific facts in support of his argument.</p>
