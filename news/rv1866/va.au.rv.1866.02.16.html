<b>The President and a Colored Deputation--Interesting Exposition of the
                    President's Views</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of a meeting between Preident Johnson and a delegation of
                    "colored representatives" led by Frederick Douglass and George Downing. Johnson
                    expresses his opposition to extending suffrage and encourages blacks to emigrate
                    from the South, suggesting that the alternative is a war between the races.
                    Douglass contends that if the black man in the South is made a voter "he will
                    raise up a party among the poor, who will rally with him."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon the delegation of colored representatives from different
                        States of the country, now in Washington to urge the interests of the
                        colored people before the Government, had an interview with the President.
                        The delegation was made up as follows: Fred. Douglas, New York; George T.
                        Downing, representing the New England States; Lewis H. Douglas (son of Fred.
                        Douglass), and William E. Matthews, of Maryland; John Jones, of Illinois;
                        John F. Cook, of the District of Columbia; A. J. Raynier, of South Carolina;
                        Jos. E. Oates, of Florida; A. W. Ross, of Mississippi; William Ripper, of
                        Pennsylvania; John M. Brown and Alexander Dunlop, of Virginia; and Calvin
                        Pepper (white), of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The President shook hands kindly with each of the delegation. ADDRESS OF
                        GEORGE T. DOWNING. <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. George T. Downing then addressed the President as follows:</p>
                    <p>We present ourselves to your Excellency to make known with pleasure the
                        respect which we are glad to cherish for you-a respect which is your due as
                        our Chief Magistrate. It is our desire for you to know that we come, feeling
                        that we are friends meeting a friend. We should, however, have manifested
                        our friendship by not coming to further tax your already much burdened and
                        valuable time; but we have another object in calling. We are in a passage to
                        equality before the law. God hat made it by opening a Red Sea. We would have
                        your assistance throug the same. We come to you in the name of the United
                        States, and are delegated to come by some who have unjustly worn iron
                        manacles on their bodies-by some whose minds have been manacled by class
                        legislation in States called free. The colored people of the States of
                        Illinois, Wisconsin, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, North
                        Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New England States,
                        and District of Columbia, have specially delegated us to come.</p>
                    <p>Our coming is a marked circumstance, noting determined hope that we are not
                        satisfied with an amendment prohibiting slavery, but that we wish it
                        enforced with appropriate legislation. This is our desire. We ask for it
                        intelligently, with the knowledge and conviction that the fathers of the
                        Revolution intended freedom for every American-that they should be protected
                        in their rights as citizens and equal before the law. We are Americans,
                        native-born Americans. We are citizens, we are glad to have it known to the
                        world, as bearing no doubtful record on this point. On his fact, and with
                        confidence in the triumph of justice, we base our hope.-We see no
                        recognition of color or race in the organic law of the eland. It knows no
                        privileged class, and therefore we cherish the hope that we may be fully
                        enfranchised, not only here in this District, but throughout the land. We
                        respectfully submit that rendering anything less than this will be rendering
                        to us less than our just due; that granting anything less than our full
                        rights will be a disregard of our just rights, of due respect of our
                        feelings. If the powers that be do so it will be used as a license, as it
                        were , or an apology for any community, or for individuals thus disposed, to
                        outrage our feelings.-It has been shown in the present war that the
                        Government may justly reach the strong arm into States and demand from them,
                        from those who owe it allegiance, their assistance and support. May it not
                        reach out a like arm to secure and protect its subjects upon whom it has a
                        claim? <br></p>
                    <p>ADDRESS OF FRED. DOUGLAS. <br></p>
                    <p>Following upon Mr. Downing, Mr. Fred. Douglass advanced and addressed the
                        President saying:</p>
                    <p>Mr. President: We are not here to enlighten you, sir, as to your duties as
                        Chief Magistrate of this Republic, but to show our respect, and to present
                        in brief the claims of our race to your favorable consideration. In the
                        order of Divine Providence you are placed in a position where you have the
                        power to save or destroy us; to bless or blast us-I mean our whole race.
                        Your noble and humane predecessor placed in our hands the sword to assist in
                        saving the nation, and we do hope that you, his able successor, will
                        favorably regard the placing in our hands the ballot with which to save
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We shall submit no argument on that point. The fact that we are the subjects
                        of Government, and subject to taxation, subject to volunteer in the service
                        of the country, subject to being drafted, subject to bear the burdens of the
                        State, makes it not improper that we should share in the privileges of this
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>I have no speech to make on this occasion. I simply submit these observations
                        as a limited expression of the views and feelings of the delegation with
                        which I have come. <br></p>
                    <p>RESPONSE OF THE PRESIDENT. <br></p>
                    <p>The President replied substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>In reply to some of your inquiries-not to make a speech upon the subject, for
                        it is always best to talk plainly and distinctly about such matters-I will
                        say, that if I have not given evidence in my former course that I am the
                        friend of humanity, and of that portion of it which constitutes the colored
                        population, I can give no evidence here. Everything that I have had, both as
                        regards life and property, has been periled in that cause, and I feel and
                        think that I understand, (not to be egotistic) what should be the true
                        direction of this question, and what course of policy would result in the
                        amelioration and ultimate elevation, not only of the colored, but of the
                        great mass of the people of the United States. I say that if I have not
                        given evidence that I am the friend of humanity, and especially the friend
                        of the colored man, in my past conduct, there is nothing that I can now do
                        that would. I repeat, all that I possessed-life, liberty and property-have
                        been risked in connection with that question, when I had every inducement
                        held out to take the other course, by adopting which I would have
                        accomplished perhaps all that the most ambitious might have desired. If I
                        know myself, and the feelings of my own heart, they have been for the
                        colored man. I have owned slaves and bought slaves, but I never sold one. I
                        might say, however, that practically, so far as my connection with slaves
                        has gone, I have been their slave instead of their being mine. Some have
                        even followrd me here, while others are occupying and enjoying my property
                        with my consent. For the colored race my means, my time, my all has been
                        periled; and now at this late day, after giving evidence that is tangible,
                        that is practical, I am free to say to you that I do not like to be
                        arraigned by some who can get up handsomely rounded periods and deal in
                        rhetoric, and talk about abstract ideas of liberty, who never periled life,
                        liberty, or property. This kind of theoretical, hollow, unpractical
                        friendship amounts to but very little. While I say that I am a friend of the
                        colored man, I do not want to adopt a policy that I believe will end in a
                        contest between the races, which if persisted in, will result in the
                        extermination of one or the other, God forbid that I should be engaged in
                        such a work!</p>
                    <p>Now, it is always best to talk about things practically, and in a common
                        sense way. I have said, and I repeat it here, that if the colored man in the
                        United States could find no other Moses, or any Moses that would be more
                        able and efficient than myself, I would be his Moses to lead him from
                        bondage to freedom; that I would pass him from a land where he lived in
                        slavery to a land (if it were in our reach) of freedom. Yes, I would be
                        willing to pass him through the Red Sea to the land of Promise-to the land
                        of liberty; but I am not willing, under either circumstance, to adopt a
                        policy which I believe will only result in the sacrifice of his life and the
                        shedding of his blood. I think I know what I say. I feel what I say; and I
                        feel well assured, that if the policy urged by some be persisted in, it will
                        result in great injury to the white as well as to the colored man.-There is
                        a great deal of talk about the sword in one hand accomplishing an end, and
                        the ballot accomplishing another.</p>
                    <p>These things all do very well, and sometimes have forcible application. We
                        talk about justice; we talk about right; we say that the white man has been
                        in the wrong in keeping the black man in slavery as long as he has. That is
                        all true. Again, we talk about the Declaration of Independence and equality
                        before the law. You understand all that, an know how to appreciate it. But
                        now, let us look each other in the face; let us go to the great mass of
                        colored men throughout the slave States; let us see the condition in which
                        they are at the present time-and it is bad enough we all know-and suppose by
                        some magic touch you could say to every one, "You shall vote to-morrow," how
                        much would that ameliorate their condition at this time?</p>
                    <p>Now, let us get closer to this subject, and talk about it. What relation have
                        the colored man and the white man heretofore occupied in the South? I
                        opposed slavery upon two grounds. First, it was a great monopoly, enabling
                        those who controlled and owned it to constitute an aristocracy; enabling the
                        few to derive great profits and rule the many with an iron rod, as it were.
                        And that is one great objection to it in a government-its being a monopoly.
                        I opposed to it secondly upon the abstract principle of slavery. Hence, in
                        getting clear of a monopoly, we were getting clear of slavery at the same
                        time. So you see there were two right ends attained in the accomplishment of
                        the one.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-Mr. President, do you wish-</p>
                    <p>The President-I am not quite through yet. Slavery has been abolished; a great
                        national guaranty has been given-one that cannot be revoked. I was getting
                        at the relation that subsisted between the white man and the colored man. A
                        very small proportion of with persons, compared with the whole number of
                        such, owned the colored people of the South. I might instance the State of
                        Tennessee in illustration. There were there twenty-seven non-slaveholders to
                        one slaveholder, and yet the slave power controlled that State. Let us talk
                        about this matter as it is. Although the colored man was in slavery there,
                        and owned as property in the sense and in the language of that locality and
                        of that community, yet, in comparing his condition and his position there
                        with the non-slaveholder, he usually estimated his importance just in
                        proportion to the number of slaves that his master owned, with the
                        non-slaveholder.</p>
                    <p>Have you ever lived upon a plantation?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-I have, your Excellency.</p>
                    <p>The President-When you would look over and see a man who had a large family,
                        struggling hard upon a poor piece of land, you thought a great deal less of
                        him than you did of your own master?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-Not I.</p>
                    <p>The President-Well, I know such was the case with a large majority of you in
                        those sections Where such is the case we know there is an enmity, we know
                        there is a hate. The poor white man, on the other hand, was opposed to the
                        slave and his master; for the colored man and his master combined and kept
                        him in slavery, by depriving him of a fair participation in the labor and
                        productions of the rich land of the country.</p>
                    <p>Don't you know that a colored man in going to hunt a master (as they call it)
                        for the next year preferred hiring to a man who owned slaves rather than to
                        one who did not? I know the fact, at all events. They did not consider it
                        quite as respectable to hire to a man who did not own negroes as to one who
                        did.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-Because he wouldn't be treated as well.</p>
                    <p>The President-Then that is another argument in favor of what I am going to
                        say. It shows that the colored man appreciated the slave-owner more highly
                        than he did the man who didn't own slaves. Hence the enmity between the
                        colored man and the non-slave holders.</p>
                    <p>The white man was permitted to vote before government was derived from him.
                        He is a part and parcel of the political machinery.</p>
                    <p>Now, by the rebellion or revolution-and when you come back to the objects of
                        this war, you find that the abolition of slavery was not one of the objects;
                        Congress and the President himself declared that it was waged on our part in
                        order to suppress the rebellion-the abolition of slavery has come as an
                        incident to the suppression of a great rebellion, and as an incident we
                        should give it the proper direction.</p>
                    <p>The colored man went into this rebellion a slave; by the operation of the
                        rebellion he came out a freeman-equal to a freeman in any other portion of
                        the country. Then there is a great deal done for him on this point. The
                        non-slaveholder who was forced into the rebellion, and was as loyal as those
                        who lived beyond the limits of the State, was carried into it, and his
                        property, and, in a number of instances, the lives of such were sacrificed,
                        and he who has survived has come of it with nothing gained, but a great deal
                        lost.</p>
                    <p>Now, upon a principle of justice, should they be placed in a condition
                        different from what they were before? On the one hand, one has gained a
                        great deal; on the other hand, one has lost a great deal, and, in a
                        political point of view, scarcely stands where he did before.</p>
                    <p>Now, we are talking about where we are going to begin. We have got at the
                        hate that existed between the two races. The query comes up, whether these
                        two races situated as they were before, without preparation, without time
                        for passion and excitement to be appeased, and without time for the
                        slightest improvement-whether the one should be turned loose upon the other,
                        and be thrown together at the ballotbox [CORRECT ballot box] with this
                        enmity and hate existing between them.-The query arises, if, there, we don't
                        commence a war of races. I think I understand this question; and especially
                        is this the case when you force it upon a people without their consent.</p>
                    <p>You have spoken about government.-Where is power derived from? We say it is
                        derived from the people- Let us take it so, and refer to the District of
                        Columbia by way of illustration. Suppose, for instance, here, in this
                        political community, which to a certain extent must have law, and putting it
                        upon the broadest basis you can-take into consideration the relation which
                        the white has heretofore borne to the colored race-is it proper to force
                        upon this community, without their consent, the elective franchise without
                        regard to color, making it universal?</p>
                    <p>Now, where do you begin? Government must have a controlling power; must have
                        lodgment. For instance, suppose Congress should pass a law authorizing an
                        election to be held at which all over twenty-one years of age, without
                        regard to color, should be allowed to vote, and a majority should decide at
                        such election that the elective franchise should not be universal: what
                        would you do? Who would settle it? Do you deny that first great principle of
                        the right of the people to govern themselves? Will you resort to arbitrary
                        power, and say a majority of this people shall receive a state of things
                        they are opposed to?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas-That was said before the war.</p>
                    <p>The President-I am now talking about a principle, not what may have been said
                        before the war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Downing-Apply what you have said Mr. President, to South Carolina, for
                        instance,</p>
                    <p>The President-Suppose you to go to South Carolina; suppose you go to
                        Ohio.-That does not change the principle at all.-The query to which I have
                        referred still presents itself when government is undergoing a fundamental
                        change. Government commenced upon this principle; it has existed upon it;
                        and you propose now to incorporate into it an element that did not exist
                        before. I say the query arises in undertaking this thing, whether we have a
                        right to make a change in regard to the elective franchise in Ohio, for
                        instance; whether we shall not let the people in that State decide the
                        matter for themselves.</p>
                    <p>Each community is better prepared to determine the depository of its
                        political power than anybody else, and it is for the Legislature, for the
                        people of Ohio to say who shall vote, and who not, for the Congress of the
                        United States. I might go down to the ballot-box to-morrow and vote directly
                        for universal suffrage, but if a great majority of the people said no, I
                        should consider it would be tyrannical in me to attempt to force such upon
                        them without their will. It is a fundamental tenet in my creed that the will
                        of the people, when fairly expressed at the ballot-box, must be obeyed. Is
                        there anything wrong and unfair in that?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas (smiling)-A great deal wrong, Mr. President, with all respect.</p>
                    <p>The President-It is the people of the States that must for themselves
                        determine this matter, I do not want to be engaged in a work that will
                        commence a war of races, I want to begin the work of reparation; and the
                        States, or the people in each community, if a man demeans himself well, and
                        shows evidence that this new state of affairs will operate, will protect him
                        in all his rights, and give him every possible advantage, when they become
                        reconciled, socially and politically, to certain changes. Then will this new
                        order of things work harmoniously; but forced upon the people before they
                        are prepared for it, it will be resisted, and work inharmoniously. I feel a
                        conviction that forcing this matter upon the people, upon the community,
                        will result in the injury of both races, and the ruin of one or the other.
                        God knows I have no desire but the good of the whole human race. I would it
                        were so that all you advocate could be done in the twinkling of an eye; but
                        it is not in the nature of things, and I do not assume or pretend to be
                        wiser than Providence, or stronger than the laws of nature.</p>
                    <p>Let u snow seek to discover the laws governing this whole subject. There is a
                        great law controlling it; let us endeavor to find out what that law is, and
                        conform our action to it. All the details will then properly adjust
                        themselves, and work out well in the end.</p>
                    <p>God knows that anything I can do I will do. In the mighty process by which
                        the great end is to be reached, anything I can do to elevate the races, to
                        soften and ameliorate their condition, I will do, and to be able to do so is
                        the sincere desire of my heart.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to to have met you, and thank you for the compliment you have paid
                        me.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-I have to return you our sincere thanks, Mr. President, for so
                        kindly granting us this interview. We did not come here expecting to argue
                        this question with your Excellency, but simply to state what were our views
                        and wishes in the premises. If we were disposed to argue the question, and
                        you would grant us permission, of course we would endeavor to controvert
                        some of the positions you have assumed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Downing-Mr. Douglass, I take it that the President, by his kind
                        expressions and his very full treatment of the subject, must have
                        contemplated some reply to the views which he has advanced, and in which we
                        certainly do not concur-and I say this with due respect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President-I thought you expected me to indicate to some extent what my
                        views were on the subjects touched upon in your statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Downing-We are very happy indeed to have heard them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-If the President will allow me. I would like to say one or two
                        words in reply.</p>
                    <p>The President-All I have done is simply to indicate what my views are, as I
                        suppose you expected me to, from your address.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-My own impression is, that the very thing that your Excellency
                        would avoid in the Southern States can only be avoided by the very measure
                        that we propose; and I would state to my brother delegates, that, because I
                        perceive the President has taken strong ground in favor of a given policy,
                        and distrusting my own ability to remove any of those impressions which he
                        has expressed. I thought we had better end the interview with the expression
                        of thanks. [Addressing the President.] But if your Excellency will be
                        pleased to hear, I would like to say a word or two in regard to that one
                        matter of the enfranchisement of the blacks as a means of preventing the
                        very thing which your Excellency appears to apprehend-that is a conflict of
                        races.</p>
                    <p>The President-I repeat, I merely wanted to indicate my views in reply to your
                        address, and not to enter into any general controversy, as I could not well
                        do so under the circumstances. Your statement was a very frank one, and I
                        thought it was due to you to meet it in the same spirit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-Thank you, sir.</p>
                    <p>The President-I think you will find, so far as the South is concerned, that
                        if you will all inculcate there the idea in connection with the one you
                        urge, that the colored people can live in advance in civilization to better
                        advantage elsewhere than crowded together in the Southern States, it would
                        be better for them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-But the masters have the making of the laws, and we cannot get
                        away from the plantations.</p>
                    <p>The President-What prevents you?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-We have not the simple right of locomotion through the Southern
                        States now.</p>
                    <p>The President-Why not? The Government furnishes you with every facility.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-There are six days in the year that the negro is free in the
                        South now, and his master then decides for him where he shall go, where he
                        shall work, how much he shall work-in fact, he is divested of all political
                        power. He is absolutely in the hands of those men.</p>
                    <p>The President-If the master now controls him in his action, would he not
                        control him in his vote?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass-Let the negro once understand he has an organic right to vote,
                        and he will raise up a party in the Southern States among the poor, who will
                        rally with him. There is this conflict that you speak of between the wealthy
                        slaveholders and the poor man.</p>
                    <p>The President-You touch right upon the point there. There is this conflict,
                        and hence I suggest emigration. If he cannot get employment in the South, he
                        has it in his power to go where he can get it.</p>
                    <p>In parting, the President said that they were both desirous of accomplishing
                        the same ends, but proposed to do so by following different roads.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass, on turning to leave, remarked to his fellw delegates: "The
                        President sends us to the people, and we will have to go and get the people
                        right."</p>
                    <p>The President-Yes, sir. I have great faith in the people. I hope this quesion
                        will be submitted to them for the final action and I have no doubt it will
                        be right.</p>
                <br>

                    <p>RECEPTION OF THE VIRGINIANS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. <br></p>
                    <p>FULL AND INTERESTING EXPOSITION OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S VIEWS. <br></p>
                    <p>The delegation from the Virginia Legislature appointed to convey to the
                        President the resolutions passed by that body endorsing his policy of
                        restoration, and declaring the loyalty of the State to the Government of the
                        United States, had a very interesting interview with President Johnson at
                        the Executive mansion on Saturday afternoon.-The delegation consisted of the
                        following gentlemen: Messrs. E. F. Keen, A. S. Gray and Carter from the
                        Senate, and Messrs. John B. Baldwin, James Marshall, [UNCLEAR] Grattan, A.
                        G. Pendleton and W. T. Joynes from the House of Delegates. <br></p>
                    <p>THEIR RECEPTION. <br></p>
                    <p>A few moments after the delegation entered, the President appeared, and was
                        addressed as follows by Mr. Baldwin: <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. President:-We are a committee of the Senate
                        and House of Delegates of the State of Virginia, sent to present you in
                        person certain resolutions which received the unanimous approval of the
                        Senate and House of Delegates. With your permission I will read them. </p>
                    <p>After reading the resolutions, Mr. Baldwin proceeded to deliver the following
                        address in behalf of the delegation: <br></p>
                    <p>ADDRESS OF MR. BALDWIN. <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. President:-We are a committee of senators and
                        Delegates sent to present to you in person certain resolutions which have
                        received the unanimous approval of the General Assembly of Virginia. </p>
                    <p>We come as representatives sent by on of the States of this Union to confer
                        with our constitutional President in regard to matters affecting the common
                        Government: and therefore of interest to all the States and all the people.
                        We come to you, Mr. President, for the reason that you recognize our common
                        interest in the Government under which we live, and because thus far we have
                        been denied the constitutional means of communication by which other States
                        and other people make known their opinions purposes, and feelings in the
                        councils of the nation.</p>
                    <p>In declaring that the people of Virginia and their representatives accept and
                        abide by the results of the late contest, and that they intend in good faith
                        to meet all the obligations thereby incurred, the General Assembly expresses
                        a sentiment and a purpose which have been uniformly recognized by our people
                        individually and in masses, and in regard to which there is no hesitation or
                        division in all Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Chief among the results thus accepted is the universal conviction that the
                        reunion of these States is an established and enduring fact, and that the
                        whole future of our people is indissolubly bound up [MISSING LINES] woe,
                        with the success or failure of the Government of the United States. We
                        recognize that Government as our Government; its Constitution is our
                        Constitution; the duties which it requires are our duties, and the rights
                        which it promises are our rights.</p>
                    <p>Another great result alike accepted by our people is the overthrow of the
                        institution of slavery. This has been completed by a constitutional
                        amendment, the binding force, of which is universally admitted; for although
                        we were not represented in the Congress by which it was proposal, the
                        failure to be so represented was of our own choice. The condition of the
                        freedmen among us, and the policy to be adopted with regard to them will be
                        recognized by you as calling for the exercise of the highest faculties of
                        the statesman and the best feelings of the Christian philanthropist. The
                        General Assembly of Virginia is engaged [UNCLEAR] in the consideration of
                        these subjects, and in anticipation of the results of their labors, we can
                        only say that whatever policy may be adopted will be addressed in good faith
                        and with kind feeling to the improvement of the physical, intellectual and
                        moral condition of our freedmen.-You can understand and will readily believe
                        that the feelings of our people toward these freedmen are those of kindness,
                        sympathy, and good will, and that to treat them with harshness or injustice
                        is opposed as much to our feelings as it is to our interests and our sense
                        of right.</p>
                    <p>The policy pursued by you, Mr. President, toward Virginia, and other States
                        in like condition, has its strong foundation in broad and comprehensive
                        views of constitutional right and of national policy, and must look for its
                        ultimate success upon the conservative sense of justice of the people of all
                        the States. It is due, however, to you and to our people to assure you that
                        when our General Assembly declare the universal approval of that policy by
                        the people of Virginia, they express what each one of this committee here
                        present knows to be a living truth. It happens that your position places you
                        between us and a threatened danger, and the General Assembly have but given
                        voice to the real feelings of our people when they tender to you the warmest
                        thanks of Virginia for the firm stand you have taken against the facility
                        with which it is proposed to change the fundamental law. We would not,
                        however, claim as the only, or even the chief merit of the course you are
                        taking, that it affords to us protection in time of trouble.</p>
                    <p>It is a defender of the general Constitution that you deserve and command the
                        confidence and support of the people of the United States, and it will be
                        hereafter remembered as your highest claim to the character of a Republican
                        statesman, that under all the trying circumstances by which you are
                        surrounded, you have not only proclaimed the Constitution of the United
                        States to be the supreme law of this land, but have defended it alike from
                        violation and from innovation. <br></p>
                    <p>RESPONSE OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON. <br></p>
                    <p>The President said:</p>
                    <p>In reply, gentlemen, to the resolutions you have just presented to be, and
                        the clear and forcible and concise remarks which you have made in
                        explanation of the position of Virginia, I shall not attempt to make a
                        formal speech, but simply enter into a plain conversation in regard to the
                        condition of things in which we stand.</p>
                    <p>As a premise to what I may say, permit me first to tender you my thanks for
                        this visit, and next to express the gratification I feel in meeting so many
                        intelligent, responsible and respectable men of Virginia, bearing to me the
                        sentiments which have been expressed in the resolutions of you r
                        Legislature, and in the remarks accompanying them.-They are, so far as they
                        refer to the Constitution of the country, the sentiments and the principles
                        embraced in that of the Government. <br></p>
                    <p>HIS RECORD. <br></p>
                    <p>The preservation of the Union has been, from my entrance into public life,
                        one of my cardinal tenets. At the very incipiency of this rebellion I set my
                        face against the dissolution of the Union of the States. I do not make this
                        allusion for the purpose of bringing up anything which may be regarded as of
                        an unkind or unpleasant character; but if believed then, as I believe now,
                        and as you have most unmistakably indicated, that the security and the
                        protection of the rights of all the people were to be found in the Union;
                        that we were certainly safer in the Union than we out of it. Upon this
                        conviction I based my opposition to the efforts which were made to destroy
                        the Union. I have continued those efforts, notwithstanding the perils
                        through which I have passed, and you are not unaware that the trial has been
                        a [UNCLEAR]. When opposition to the Government came from one section of the
                        country, and that the section in which my life had been passed, and with
                        which my interests were identified, I stood, as I stand now, contending for
                        the Union and [UNCLEAR] that the best and surest way to obtain our rights
                        and to protect our interests was to remain in the Union, under the
                        protection of the Constitution. <br></p>
                    <p>WHAT HE THINKS THE WAR HAS PROVED. <br></p>
                    <p>The ordeal through which we have passed during the last four or five years
                        demonstrates most conclusively that the opposition [UNCLEAR] was right; and
                        to-day, after the experiment has been made and has failed; after the
                        demonstration has been most conclusively afforded that this Union can not be
                        dissolved, that it was not designed to be dissolved, it is extremely
                        gratifying to me to meet gentlemen as intelligent and responsible as
                        yourselves, who are willing and anxious to accept and do except the terms
                        laid down in the Constitution and obedience to the laws made in pursuance
                        thereof. We were at one period separated; the separation was to me painful
                        in the extreme; but now, after having gone through a struggle in which the
                        power of the Government have been tried, when we have swung around to a
                        point at which we meet to agree and are willing to unite our efforts for the
                        preservation of the Government, which I believe is the best in the world, it
                        is exceedingly gratifying to me and to meet you today, standing upon common
                        ground, rallying around the Constitution and the Union of these States, the
                        preservation of which, as I conscientiously and honestly believe, will
                        result in the promotion and the advancement of this people. <br></p>
                    <p>HIS FAITH IN THE PEOPLE. <br></p>
                    <p>I repeat, I am gratified to meet you to-day, expressing the principles and
                        announcing the sentiments to which you have given utterance and I trust that
                        the occasion will long be remembered. I have no doubt that your intention in
                        to carry out and comply with every single principle laid down in the
                        resolutions you have submitted. I know that some are distrustful; but I am
                        of those who have confidence in the judgment, in the integrity in the
                        intelligence, in the virtue of the great mass of the American people; and
                        having such confidence, I am willing to trust them, and I thank God that we
                        have not yet reached that point where we have lost all confidence in each
                        other. The spirit of the Government can only be preserved, we can only be
                        preserved, we can only become prosperous and I great as a people, by mutual
                        forbearance and confidence. Upon that faith and that confidence alone can
                        the Government be successfully carried on. <br></p>
                    <p>REPRESENTATION A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT. <br></p>
                    <p>On the cardinal principle of representation to which you refer, I will make a
                        single remark. That principle is inherent: it constitutes one of the
                        fundamental elements of this Government. The representatives of the States
                        and of the people should have the qualifications prescribed by the
                        Constitution of the United States, and these qualifications [UNCLEAR] imply
                        loyalty. [UNCLEAR] prescribed by the Constitution to fit him to take a seat
                        in either of the deliberative bodies which constitute the National
                        Legislature, must necessarily, according [UNCLEAR] the Constitution, be a
                        loyal man, willing to abide by and be devoted to the Union and the
                        Constitution of the States. He cannot be for the Constitution, he cannot be
                        for the Union, he cannot acknowledge obedience to all the laws, unless he is
                        loyal. When the people send such men in good faith, they are entitled to
                        representation through them. <br></p>
                    <p>LOYALTY A SINE QUA NON. <br></p>
                    <p>In going to the recent rebellion or insurrection against the Government of
                        the United States we erred, and in returning and resuming our relations with
                        the Federal Government, I am free to say that all the responsible positions
                        and places ought to be confined distinctly and clearly to men who are loyal.
                        If there were only five thousand loyal men in a State, or a less number, but
                        sufficient to take charge of the political machinery of a State, that five
                        thousand men, or the lesser number, are entitled to it, if all the rest
                        sheuld be confined to loyal men, and I regard that as implied in the
                        doctrines, laid down in these resolutions, and in the eloquent address by
                        which they have been accompanied. I may say, furthermore, that after having
                        passed through the great struggle in which we have been engaged, we should
                        be placed upon much more acceptable ground in resuming all our relations to
                        the General Government if we presented men unmistakably and unquestionably
                        loyal to fill the places of power. This being done, I feel that the day is
                        not distant-I speak confidingly in reference to the great mass of the
                        American people-when they will determine that this Union shall be made
                        whole, and the great right of representation in the councils of the nation
                        to be acknowledged. <br></p>
                    <p>TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. <br></p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, that is a fundamental principle. "No taxation without
                        representation" was one of the principles which carried us through the
                        Revolution. This great principle will hold good yet; and if we but perform
                        our duty; if we but comply with the spirit of the resolutions presented to
                        me today, the American people will maintain and sustain the great doctrines
                        upon which the Government was inaugurated. It can be done, and it will be
                        done; and I think that if the effort be fairly and fully made, with
                        forbearance and with prudence, and with discretion and wisdom, the end is
                        not very far distant. <br></p>
                    <p>EFFECT OF RESTORATION ON OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. <br></p>
                    <p>It seems to me apparent that from every consideration the best policy which
                        could be adopted at present would be a restoration of these States and of
                        the Government upon correct principles. We have some foreign difficulties,
                        but the moment it can be announced that the Union of the States is again
                        complete, that we have resumed our career of prosperity and greatness at
                        that very instant [UNCLEAR] all our foreign difficulties will be settled,
                        for there is no power upon the earth which will care to have a controversy
                        or a rupture with the Government of the United States under such
                        circumstances. <br></p>
                    <p>EFFECT ON THE CURRENCY AND PUBLIC CREDIT. <br></p>
                    <p>If these States be fully restored, the area for the circulation of the
                        national currency which is thought by some to be inflated to a very great
                        extent, will be enlarged, the number of persons thro' whose hands it is to
                        pass will be increased, the quality of commerce in which it is to be
                        employed as a medium of exchange will be enlarged; and then it will begin to
                        approximate what we all desire, a specie standard. If all the States were
                        restored-if peace and [UNCLEAR] of peace were again resumed-the day would
                        not be far distant when we could put into the commerce of the world
                        $250,000,000 or $300,000,000 worth of cotton and tobacco, and the various
                        produce of the Southern States, which would constitute in part a basis of
                        this currency. Then instead of the cone being inverted, we should reverse
                        the position, and put the base at the bottom, as it ought to be, and the
                        currency of the country will rest on a sound and enduring basis; and surely
                        that is a result which is calculated to prompted the interests not only of
                        one section but of the whole country from one extremity to the other.-Indeed
                        I look upon the restoration of these Stats as being indispensable to all our
                        greatness. <br></p>
                    <p>THE SOUTHERN STATES NOT OUT OF THE UNION. <br></p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I know nothing further that I could say in the expression of my
                        feelings on this occasion-and they are not effected-more than to add that I
                        shall continue in the same line of policy which I have pursued from the
                        commencement of the rebellion to the present period. My efforts have been to
                        preserve the Union of the States. I never for a single moment entertained
                        the opinion that a State could withdraw from the Union of its own will. That
                        attempt was made. It has failed. I continue to pursue the same line of
                        policy which has been my constant guide. I was against dissolution.
                        Dissolution was attempted. It has failed. And now I cannot take the position
                        that a State which attempted to secede is out of the Union, when I contend
                        all the time that it could not go out, and that it never has been out. I cannot be forced into that position. Hence, when
                        the States and their people shall have complied with the requirements of the
                        Government, I shall be in favour of their resuming their former relations to
                        this Government in all respects. </p>
                    <p>I do not intend to say anything personal, but you know as well as I do that
                        at the beginning, and, indeed, before the beginning of the recent gigantic
                        struggle between the different sections of the country, there were extreme
                        men in the North. I might make use of a homely figure, (which is sometimes
                        as good as any other, even in the illustration of great and important
                        questions,) and say that it has been [UNCLEAR] at one end of the line and
                        anvil at the other; and the great Government the best the world ever saw,
                        was kept upon the anvil and hammered before the rebellion, and it has been
                        hammered since the rebellion; and there seems to be a disposition to
                        continue hammering until the Government shall be destroyed. I have opposed
                        that system always, and I oppose it now. <br></p>
                    <p>A SLAP AT THE RADICALS. <br></p>
                    <p>The Government, in the assertion of its powers and in the maintenance of the
                        principles of the Constitution, has taken hold of one extreme, and with the
                        strong arm of physical power has put down the rebellion. Now, as we swing
                        around the circle of the Union with a fixed and unalterable determination to
                        stand by it, if we find the [UNCLEAR] persons in the
                            South, [UNCLEAR] which stands in the way must
                            get out of it, and the Government must stand unshaken and unmoved
                        on its basis. The Government must be preserved. </p>
                    <p>I will only say, in conclusion, that I hope all the people of this country,
                        in good faith and in the fullness of their hearts, will upon the principles
                        which you have enunciated here to-day, of the maintenance of the
                        Constitution and the preservation of the Union, lay aside every other
                        feeling for the good of our common country, and with uplifted faces to
                        heaven swear that our gods and our altars and [UNCLEAR] shall sink in that
                        dust together rather than that this glorious Union shall not be preserved.
                        [Great applause.] I am gratified to find the loyal sentiment of the country
                        developing and manifesting itself in these expressions: and now that the
                        attempt to destroy the Government has failed at one end of the line, I trust
                        we shall go on determined to preserve the Union in its original purity
                        against all opposers. I thank you, gentlemen, for the compliment you have
                        paid me, and respond most cordially to what has been said in your
                        resolutions and address, and I trust in God the time will soon come when we
                        can meet under more favorable auspices than we do now. <br></p>
                    <p>INTRODUCTION OF THE COMMITTEE. <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin then resumed as follows:</p>
                    <p>Mr. President:--As an assurance that we represent
                        the sentiment of the State, I beg leave to introduce to you the members of
                        the committee, and to name the parts of the State from which they come, in
                        order that you may be certified that this is a fair representation of all
                        parts of Virginia. I introduce to you Mr. Keen, the Senator from
                        Pittsylvania; Mr. Joynes, the Delegate from Petersburg; Mr. Carter, Senator
                        from the county of Russell; Mr. Marshall, Delegate from the county of
                        Fauquier; Mr. Gray, Senator from the county of Rockingham; Mr. Pendleton,
                        Delegate from the county of Giles; Mr. Grattan, delegate from the city of
                        Richmond. We claim this to be a fair and equally distributed representation
                        of the people of Virginia. <br></p>
                    <p>CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW. <br></p>
                    <p>As the several members were introduced, the President took each one by the
                        hand and then added as follows, in a manner somewhat more conversantional
                        than before:</p>
                    <p>I am happy to meet you, gentlemen. As I said to another delegation the other
                        day. I have no ambition and no object beyond the restoration of this
                        Government. I feel that I am in a condition where I can afford to do right.
                        I have occupied during my career many different posts in this Government. I
                        started at one of the humblest cabins in the country, and I have passed
                        through the State Legislature, the gubernatorial chair, both Houses of
                        Congress, the Vice Presidency of the United States, to the position which I
                        now occupy before you. The climax, the acme, the summit of my ambition has
                        been fully reached, yea more than reached. If, now, I can only arrive at a
                        point at which these States are all restored, each having its representation
                        in the national councils, with the Union restored so that we can once more
                        proclaim peace and good will among the people of the United Statds, it will
                        be to me a happy day. I care not what may be said in taunt or jeer; I car
                        not what may be insinuated; but I tell you that whenever I shall have
                        reached that point, the measure of my ambition will have been filled. I have
                        no object beyond it. Oh, how proud and gratifying it would be to me to
                        retire from this place, feeling and knowing that I had been instrumental in
                        consummating this great end. The delegation then took leave and
                    withdrew.</p>
