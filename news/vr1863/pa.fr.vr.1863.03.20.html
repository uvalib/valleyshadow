                    of the conflict, the dogs have been used to track down whites "hiding in the
                    woods to escape the fierce conscription act which is now seizing about every man
                    under sixty years of age able to carry a gun."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A dreadful riot happened in Detroit last week, in consequence of a gross
                        outrage committed by a brutal negroe. For some months, however, copperheads
                        of that place have been endeavoring to incite for political effect, a mob
                        against the negroes, and were unsuccessful until the perpetration of the
                        offence stated. In place of permitting the law to take its course, which
                        would have adequately punished the offender, war was declared against all
                        the negroes of Detroit. Leaders distributed whiskey among their followers,
                        and the work of murder and arson, was commenced and prosecuted until the mob
                        desisted in consequence of sheer exhaustion. To exhibit the fiendish
                        character of this massacre of innocent persons by a drunken, frenzied mob,
                        it is related that a house containing several negroes was set on fire, and
                        according to an account in the Detroit Free
                        Press, one colored woman made her appearance at the door with a child
                        in her arms and appealed to the mob for mercy. The monstrous fact must be
                        told that her tearful appeals were met with a shower of bricks, stones and
                        clubs, driving herself and the babe in her arms back into the burning
                        building.</p>
                    <p>Men roamed the streets, besplattered with the blood of innocent victims,
                        bawling like fiends, and demanding more blood. It became necessary to call
                        the military from a distance to restore order. Surely such conduct as this
                        is only equalled by the recent Indian massacres in Minnesota, and will
                        always rest as a foul stain on the good name of Detroit. Yet this is the
                        kind of work traitors desire to see inaugurated in the North for which they
                        are working; to counteract which loyal men everywhere must labor
                        unceasingly.</p>
