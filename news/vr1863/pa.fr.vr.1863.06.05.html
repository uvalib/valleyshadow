<b>Female Character</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece alerts women to the fact that, contrary to what they might
                    believe, men want their women to be pious. Men, it maintains, know that "human
                    nature connects a religious feeling with softness and sensibility of heart."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>FEMALE CHARACTER.--Ladies are greatly deceived when they think that they
                        recommend themselves to the other sex by an indifference to religion. Every
                        man who knows human nature, connects a religious feeling with softness and
                        sensibility of heart. At least we always consider the want of it a proof of
                        that masculine spirit, which of all your faults, we dislike the most.
                        Beside, men consider your religion as the best security for that female
                        virtue in which they are most sensibly interested. Never indulge yourselves
                        in ridicule on religious subjects, nor give countenance to it in others by
                        seeming diverted with what they say. This, to people of good understanding,
                        will be a sufficient check.</p>
                    <p>Let a woman be decked with all the embellishments of art and the gifts of
                        nature, yet, if boldness is to be read in her face, it blots all the lines
                        of beauty. Modesty is not only an ornament, but also a guard to virtue. It
                        is a delicate feeling in the soul, which makes her shrink and withdraw
                        herself from the appearance of danger. It is an exquisite sensibility, that
                        warns her to shun the approach of everything brutal.</p>

<b>Free Against Servile Labor</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Categorizing it as nothing less than a mortal conflict between two
                    "distinct" and "utterly incompatible" societies, the editorial expresses the
                    belief that the outcome of the Civil War will have profound implications for
                    "the working classes not only in this but in every civilized country throughout
                    the world."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>No classes are so directly and vitally interested in the great conflict now
                        waging in the United States as the working classes, not only in this but in
                        every civilized country throughout the world. Two forces, two forms of
                        civilization, two systems of society, not only essentially distinct, but
                        utterly incompatible, are engaged in mortal conflict and the battle between
                        North and South is, and has been all along, in its first springs as well as
                        in its last issues, the battle of free industry against servile labor. In
                        the North industry is more honored than it has been in any other part of the
                        world. In the Free States of the Union labor met with its highest
                        encouragements, and reaped its greatest rewards. In the Slave States, on the
                        other hand it is more dishonored and degraded than it ever has been in any
                        other part of the world. Throughout the South, labor, as the badge of a
                        servile and despised race is branded with such infamy that no freedman dare
                        assert his alienated birthright. The industrial life which in the North
                        justly earns for the laborer a position of independence and respect, in the
                        South deprives him of all the rights of humanity, and degrades him to a
                        level with the beast. The Southern States have taken ample care there shall
                        be no mistake on this vital point. Over and over again, in official
                        documents, in speeches of their leading public men, in their chief organs of
                        opinions they have declared implacable hostility to free industry and free
                        society in every shape. Of late, however, they have become still more
                        outspoken and aggressive in their crusade against free industry and on
                        behalf of their great fundamental institution of servile labor. No longer
                        restricting their advocacy of the system to a single race, or a single
                        country, they boldly declare that slavery is the only true foundation of
                        society, in any part of the world, and that it must become the basis of
                        every powerful State, of every well-ordered social system--in word, of
                        civilization throughout the world. We lately quoted from a leading Southern
                        organ the Richmond Inquirer, the instructive
                        statement that the time had come for abandoning the defence of slavery on
                        the narrow ground of race and color, and for asserting that it was right,
                        natural and necessary irrespective of race or complexion. Another Southern
                        organ the Southside Democrat, more explicitly
                        urges that all whites in the Southern States incapable of supporting their
                        children at school should be reduced to a condition of legal bondage. This
                        is a direct challenge, and open defiance to free industry all over the
                        world. It is a gauntlet thrown down to the working men of every country. In
                        this great conflict between free and servile labor the working men
                        throughout the world have a supreme interest.--From the
                            Daily London News.</p>

                        peace, and that is by a suppression of the rebellion and a vindication of
                        law. He who represents otherwise, either deceives himself or is a dishonest

                        must either attain peace by subduing the rebels or allowing them to triumph,
                        and see ourselves cast upon a sea of anarchy, to be drifted about on that

                    </p>
                    <p>If I mistake not, I mentioned in my last, that in obedience to general orders
                        from Head Quarters, the 158th Reg. Pa. Infantry holds the defences of
                        Washington; whether on account of its superior reputation, or the skill and
                        military talents of its commander, I know not; but the honor thus conferred
                        we deeply feel, and when we perambulate the streets, "its up!" Under the immediate supervision of the Col. our men are
                        at present engaged in building a fort hard by the town on the east; and as
                        the Col. remarked, his men could finish it in two weeks, the progress they
                        have already made in five days promises the verification of his assertion.
                        Col. McKibbin is, in many respects a character;
                        he possesses that sine quanon of a great commander, which, while it binds
                        his men to him, "with hooks of steel," at the same time commands their
                        inclinations, holds at bay their desires, and keeps their wills suspended,
                        as it were, in a balance, either end of which goes down at his slightest
                        touch; it matters not what labors he requires at their hands, they go at it
                        with a will that is surprising, and so great is their confidence in his
                        judgement and military ability, that they would deem nothing impossible of
                        execution did he order it. With the possession of this remarkable gift, he
                        is profusely generous, attracting around him
                        crowds of genial convives wherever he goes, so that when he rides out to
                        visit his command, he is always attended by an escort of gallant horsemen
                        such as are seldom seen in the train of a general.</p>
                    <p>On the night of the 12th, at the head of a company of cavalry, he dashed out
                        into Rebeldom, "to see what was going on!" Through by-roads, lanes and
                        ditches, over gullies and broken bridges, he dashed ahead, often leaving his
                        company a mile behind him, as they feared to jump the gullies, before
                        examining them. About 12 miles from town they came upon rebel pickets; he
                        dashed in among them, unheeding their balls, whizzing by him, and yelling
                        the war-whoop he put them to flight! The cavalry swear "he's a hoss!"</p>
                    <p>The Rebs in this district are in a desperate condition; every man not in the
                        service, is hunted up by the agents of Conscription, and if found, is
                        immediately sent to Richmond. My orders are to allow no one to pass up the
                        river, and, hence, small boats are every day fired at and brought to, by my
                        sentinels. Sometimes these craft are laden with women and children, desiring
                        to go to Washington to escape starvation or the threatened brutal treatment
                        of Guerrillas; but more frequently by men who are fleeing from their
                        pursuers, who, being generally quandam slave-hunters or overseers, pursue
                        them with a savage perseverance, which is intensified ten-fold, when they
                        behold them fleeing toward our lines. Several companies of our regiment are
                        on Picket duty, where they receive daily visits from outsiders; they say
                        that before starting they provide themselves with scotch snuff, and the
                        means resorted to by the female rebs to obtain this, their superior luxury,
                        evidences beyond credibility, the poverty and suffering that prevails;
                        little boys and girls daily visit the picket stations to beg meat and
                        crackers, and the sadness that clouds their young brows, and gives their
                        voices a melancholy tone, cannot fail to affect every one they approach.
                        Every day, little girls, whose conversation, manners and dress give evidence
                        of having been raised by parents who could formerly, liberally and even
                        luxuriously provide for them, visit the Block House, with plates of molasses
                        candy, which they sell to the men, seeming to appreciate the necessity that
                        compels them, though the pride instilled into them, induces them to remain
                        quiet, when questioned respecting family and circumstances. Oh! how many
                        tears have I shed, how many prayers for peace have I heard,--how many tales
                        of suffering and distress have I listened to, all evincing the fact, that
                        the storm of Rebellion has swept over the South, like a siroco, consuming
                        everything desirable, estimable and worth living for; virtue has indeed
                        become a shadow, freedom a chimera, and religion entirely abandoned, in the
                        sweeping tyranny that disregards all laws human and divine; the darkness of
                        despair is settling down over town and country, as all hope of foreign
                        mediation or intervention and the promised aid of northern conspirators, is
                        despaired of; where, now, to look for the power that could terminate the
                        frightful struggle, in which hecatombs of the southern youth are monthly
                        sacrificed to Moloch, they know not; hoping against hope is neither pleasant
                        nor profitable, and hope deferred maketh the heart sick; and judging from
                        the frigid features, the pale countenance of the sable-clad ladies we meet
                        every where, we cannot doubt but that sick and sorrowing hearts pulsate in
                        every home, independent of the distress that want of the merest necessaries
                        of life, would produce. In view of these facts, you can readily believe that
                        peace is prayed for, night and morning, throughout the south, and through
                        pride, the evil demons of the people, will not allow them to seek for it,
                        yet, when the Ruler of the Universe has punished them sufficiently, has
                        humbled them to the very dust, and broken that evil spirit that brought sin
                        into the world and all its woes, they will bow before the powers ordained by
                        God, and humbly seek to be received as servants, being no longer worthy to
                        be called citizens of the highest, grandest and most benignant government
                        ever established by the "sons of God!" So mote it be!</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning the splendid steamer John Ferren, came sweeping up the
                        river, bringing Gen. Foster, on a visit of inspection, I suppose. The
                        thirty-two pounders in Fort Washington thundered forth their salutations;
                        every where officers and men were preparing to be reviewed by his critical
                        eye; in company with Col. McKibbin, he examined the fortifications, forts,
                        &amp;c., and expressing himself highly gratified with the condition of
                        things, he embarked again and set out for Plymouth; he is a live General!</p>
                    <p>MR. HENRY CURRY.</p>
                    <p>This elegant, accomplished and distinguished "col'ed geniman," made his
                        appearance at the door of our tent a few weeks ago, and desired to be
                        employed as a cook: he having been informed that we were in quest of such
                        person. Tall, lank, lean, lantern-jawed, moving like a shadow; somnolent,
                        round-headed, burnt-log complexion, but sharp-eyed, cunning, imitative, fond
                        of lasses, whiskey and women!--is Mr. Henry Curry. When presenting himself,
                        I questioned him, respecting his former employers, his old home, and lastly
                        his name. "Oh!" he replied quickly, "I answers to any name!" "Handy as snuff
                        in a kitchen!" suggested the Dr.-- Well, says I, do you have any of those
                        jolly little creatures that bite darkies on the head or under the arms and
                        things? He understood me instantly,--what darkey would not?--and replied
                        like a flash: "I don't toat dem dare!" The Dr.
                        suggested that it was within the limits of possibility that "dey toated
                        him!" but "general inspection" being held, Mr. Henry Curry was pronounced
                            regular and eligible. "Can you cook?" "Yes, I
                        cooks slap-jacks, dodgers, taters, fish, oysters and hog, and I likes 'em
                        all!"--"Well, do you like women?"--"Yes, that's a most important item,"
                        whispered the Dr.--The young gent looked at me, then at the Dr. trying to
                        ascertain whether much depended upon the answer; greatly puzzled and in deep
                        reflection he cast eyes upon the floor for a few moments, when the Dr.
                        seeing the quandry he was in, came to his relief, by replying for him, "Of
                        course he likes them! look at his bewitching features, his heavenly smile,
                        the light of Heaven in his crystalline orbs, the natural curl of his ebon
                        down, the etherial whiteness and perfection of his incisors and molars, his
                        Appollenian Corpus, his etherial, melting smile, and gritty, charcoal
                        brightness of face!--why Absalom, the beautiful, was a slop-barrel compared
                        with him!--he would have fascinated and charmed away all the wives of
                        Solomon, and set his concubines all crazy!"--Mehercule!--how the dark tore
                        his eyes open, grinned till his face was all in a twist, and had he been in
                        a collud meeting he would have shouted lustily. The boys found a copper and
                        made an ornament for him!--The mail closes in
                        five minutes so<br> Au revoir.<br> W. T. B.</p>
