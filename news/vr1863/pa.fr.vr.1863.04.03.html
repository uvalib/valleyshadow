<b>Volume Closed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A message from the editors announcing that the current issue ends the
                    sixteenth volume of the Village Record. The focus of the piece is on the
                    newspaper's claim to political impartiality, which, they admit, has been called
                    into question lately by local copperheads.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Volume Closed--This number closes the sixteenth
                        volume of the Village Record, twelve years having
                        elapsed since the establishment passed into our hands. It affords us no
                        little gratification to be able to say that through our own efforts and the
                        influence of friends the office at this time enjoys a degree of patronage
                        fully equal to the past, notwithstanding the united efforts of "copperheads"
                        for the last eighteen months to cripple our business. With this end in view
                        they have resorted to all manner of falsehood and misrepresentation, and in
                        some instances have succeeded in getting well-meaning men to proscribe us.
                        These cases have been rare however, most of those withdrawing being active
                        sympathizers with treason. Of course the paper would prove obnoxious to this
                        class, some of which have paid us, whilst others more consistent with their
                        general character for meanness than the former, have swindled us out of
                        their arrearages. One argument which these "copperheads" have been using
                        against us is that we publish a political paper. It is a high crime in their
                        estimation for a paper neutral in politics to denounce traitors of the
                        Vallandigham stripe North, and thus advocate the cause of the Union and
                            true democracy. They call this partiality,
                        abuse of the democratic party, etc. If a paragraph has ever appeared in
                        these columns casting improper reflections upon the loyal democracy of the
                        North we are not aware of it. Such a paragraph we defy the chief among Jeff
                        Davis' admirers here to produce. The paper will be continued as
                        heretofore--"Neutral in Politics and Religion"--but when it comes to treason
                        and those who sympathize with it, we purpose putting in where we can the
                        "best licks in the shop." Neutrality between political parties and
                        neutrality between loyalty and disloyalty, according to our way of thinking,
                        is quite different. Our respect for a democrat and his opinion is the same
                        now that it ever was, and those who seek to undermine our business as above
                        stated make a sham of the term "Democracy" to more effectually aid the cause
                        of treason, and at the same time escape if possible the odious appellation
                        of TRAITOR.</p>
                    <p>To those patrons who have responded to our appeal by promptly settling their
                        accounts many of them paying their subscription in advance, we acknowledge
                        our indebtedness, and hope to be able to merit their continued patronage and
                        influence. We have concluded to continue the paper at its present size
                        without increase of price, although we now pay two dollars for paper instead
                        of one dollar, the price paid three months ago. We therefore appeal to those
                        yet in arrears to call and settle their accounts. It will be impossible for
                        us to contend with present prices successfully, with the lying "copperheads"
                        resorting to every means in their power [section illegible].</p>
