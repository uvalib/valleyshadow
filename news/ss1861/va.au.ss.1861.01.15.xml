                <summary>In his address of January 7, the Governor outlined his position on the
                    current secession crisis. He affirmed his belief that the South has legitimate
                    grievances with the North in regard to the slave issue. However, he supports a
                    settlement negotiated on the basis of a convention of the states rather than
                    secession and opposes a state convention at this time.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>For some time after the propriety of holding a State Convention had begun to
                        be mooted, we were unable to bring our mind to a positive conclusion in
                        reference to it, but as soon as the evidence became very strong that it was
                        the purpose of the warmest advocates of the call of a Convention to use if
                        for the purpose of secession, we felt it to be our patriotic duty to oppose
                        it, and to raise our voice in warning that the people might be apprised of
                        the danger to be apprehended.</p>
                    <p>We felt perfectly convinced from the beginning that a Convention would be
                        called, but that did not prevent us from forming and expressing the opinion
                        that it would be unwise.--We feel that we would be unworthy the position of
                        Editor of a public journal if we did not possess the firmness to oppose
                        whatever measures we might believe to be impolitic, however popular they
                        might be. Majorities have no terror for us, and our opinions in reference to
                        any question are controlled by what we may deem its true merits, and are
                        totally unaffected by its popular or unpopularity. We know that it is easy
                        to float with the tide of popular opinion, but we think it is more manly and
                        patriotic to row against the stream when the current is running in the wrong
                        direction-to be wafted up by the stream till launched into the gulf of
                        error, requires to skill and implies no merit, but to stem the current of
                        the stream till you reach the pure and crystal fount of truth requires toil
                        and sacrifice, and implies the highest degree of merit. We have looked upon
                        the call of a Convention as a "foregone conclusion," for we fear that it
                        will prove to be this good "Old Commonwealth" what Achilles' wrath was to
                        Greece-- "the direful spring of woes unnumbered." We fear it will be a
                        "spring" from which waters more bitter than those of Marah will flow--the
                        poisonous source of a stream made saline with the tears and crimsoned with
                        the blood of our people, and which, in its destructive and desolating flood,
                        will wither the hopes and destroy the prosperity of our now blessed and
                        happy country. The mystic Convention veil, tinselled with the glittering and
                        delusive brilliants of popular rights, is made to conceal the features of
                        the monstrous "Mokanna" of secession whose diabolical office it will be to
                        victimize the "mother of States and of Statesmen"--before she will be aware
                        of the character of the "veiled prophet" to which she, "devoutly blind,"
                        will yield her faith and obedience, she will find that she has been lured
                        into an error and been betrayed to irreparable ruin. We know that the good
                        people of this county have too much sound sense to be imposed upon by the
                        shallow devices of the secessionists, and too much sterling patriotism to
                        sanction their unhallowed purposes. They have voted against a resolution
                        recommending the call of a Convention, in public meeting, and they will vote
                        against it at the polls, if the opportunity be allowed them to do so.</p>

                <summary>Reports that the Virginia legislature has called for the election of a
                    convention to respond to the secession crisis in South Carolina and to debate
                    the possible secession of Virginia. The Spectator calls for the citizens to vote
                    for representatives who support the Union because "men tainted with the
                    principles of secession would not represent the sentiment of our people."</summary>
