<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Poverty, at all times, has its virtues and advantages, but now it has such
                        special consolations that all may realize how blessed it is to be poor. The
                        tax bill passed by the Confederate Congress at Richmond exempts from taxation all heads of families whose property does
                        not amount to more than five hundred dollars in value. To those who are
                        possessed of such a small amount of this "world's gear," the stern tax
                        collector has no terrors--they can welcome his approach with a smile, as
                        they are "so well off" as to be entirely "independent" of his "horse leech"
                        demands which hoarsely and harshly cry, "give, give!"--pay your taxes or
                        your property must be sold. </p>
                    <p>Persons who own property, the value of which is more than five hundred
                        dollars, are required to pay a direct tax of fifty cents for every hundred dollars value thereof. In addition
                        they will have to pay a State tax of forty cents on every hundred dollars' value--the
                        two making the heavy direct tax of ninety cents
                        on every hundred dollars' value of property. Many of those who have too much
                        taxable property will find that they are too poor to pay
                            their taxes. The kind and generous poor will feel sympathy for
                        their wealthy neighbors who may find themselves in this embarrassing
                        predicament. </p>
                    <p>As this tax is necessary to enable us to defend all that is dear to us--our
                        rights, liberties, homes and firesides--we hope that no one will murmur or
                        complain, but that all will pay their taxes willingly and cheerfully, as
                        voluntary contributions to the common defense. Let the North see that we are
                        in earnest--that our hearts are in the cause of Southern independence--that
                        we are willing to give of our means as well as spill our blood--that there
                        is no murmuring at heavy taxation--that we pay them cheerfully as so much
                        voluntary sacrifice upon the altar of Southern Independence. The tax may
                        seem heavy and burdensome, but, like bread cast upon the waters, it will
                        return in blessings increased a hundred fold after many days.</p>
                    <p>The fourth section of the tax bill is as follows:</p>
                    <p>"That for the special purpose of paying the principle and interest of the
                        public debt, and of supporting the Government, a war tax shall be assessed
                        and levied of fifty cents upon each one hundred dollars in value of the
                        following property in the Confederate States, namely: Real estate of all
                        kinds; slaves; merchandise; bank stocks; railroad and other corporation
                        stocks; money at interest, or invested by individuals, in the purchase of
                        bills, notes, or other securities for money, except bonds of the Confederate
                        States of America, and cash on hand, or on deposit in bank or elsewhere;
                        cattle, horses and mules; gold and silver plate; pianos and pleasure
                        carriages: Provided, however, that when the
                        taxable property, herein above enumerated, of any head of family is of value
                        less than five hundred dollars, such taxable property shall be exempt from
                        taxation under this act; and provided further,
                        that the property of colleges and schools, and of charitable or religious
                        corporations or associations actually used for the purpose for which such
                        colleges, schools, corporations, or associations were created, shall be
                        exempt from taxation under this act; and provided
                            further, that all public lands and property owned by a State for
                        public purposes be exempt from taxation." </p>
                    <p>The fifth section provides that each State shall constitute a tax district,
                        over which shall be appointed by the President, to hold his office one year
                        at a salary of $2,000, a chief-collector who will divide the State into
                        convenient collection districts.</p>
                    <p>"The said chief collector shall, with the approbation of the Secretary of the
                        Treasury, appoint a tax collector for each collection district, whose duty
                        it shall be to cause an assessment to be made, on or before the first day of
                        November next, of all the taxable property in his district, included in each
                        of the above mentioned classes of property and the persons then owning or in
                        possession thereof."</p>
                    <p>The 7th section provides that, if any person shall give a false or fraudulent
                        list of his property, he shall be fined in a sum not exceeding five hundred
                        dollars, to be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>Sec. 8. "Any person who shall fail to deliver to the collector or assessor a
                        list of his taxable property at the time prescribed by him, shall be liable
                        to a double tax upon all his taxable property; the same to be assessed by
                        the collector or assessor, and to be collected in the same manner and by the
                        same process as is herein provided as to the single tax.</p>
                    <p>Sec. 9. The lists shall be made in reference to the value and situation of
                        the property on the first day of October next, and shall be made out,
                        completed and delivered into the hands of each of the tax collectors on the
                        first day of December, hear and determine all appeals from the said
                        assessments, as well as applications for the reduction of a double tax, when
                        such tax may have been incurred, to a single tax; which determination shall
                        be final.</p>
                    <p>Sec. 10. The several tax collectors shall, on or before the first day of
                        February ensuing, furnish to the chief collector of the State in which his
                        district is situated, a correct and accurate list of all the assessments
                        made upon each person in his district, and of the amount of tax to be paid
                        by such person, specifying each object of taxation; and the said chief
                        collector shall collate the same in proper form and forward the collected
                        lists to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
                    <p>Sec. 11. The said several tax collectors shall, on the first day of May next,
                        proceed to collect from every person liable for the said tax the amounts
                        severally due and owing, and he shall previously give notice for twenty days
                        in one newspaper, if any be published in his district, and by notification
                        in at least four public places in each township, ward or precinct within his
                        district, of the time and place at which he will receive the said tax; and
                        on failure to pay the same, it shall be the duty of the collector within
                        twenty days after the first day of May aforesaid, by himself or his
                        deputies, to collect the said tax by distress and sale of the goods,
                        chattels or effects of the persons delinquent.</p>
                    <p>This section forbids the sale of the tools or implements of a trade, or
                        profession, beast of the plough, and farming utensils necessary for the
                        cultivation of improved lands, arms, or such household furniture or apparel
                        as may be necessary for a family.</p>
                    <p>Sec. 12. That if the tax assessed on any real estate shall remain unpaid on
                        the first day of June next, the tax collector of the district where in the
                        same is situated, shall on the first Monday of July thereafter, proceed to
                        sell the same, or a sufficiency thereof, at public auction, to the highest
                        bidder, to pay said taxes, together with twenty per centum on the amount of
                        said taxes, and costs of sale.</p>
                    <p>Provided, that the owner or superintendent of the
                        property aforesaid, before the same shall have been actually sold, shall be
                        allowed to pay the amount of the tax thereon, with an additional of ten per
                        centum on the same; on the payment of which the sale of the said property
                        shall not take place. </p>
                    <p>Sec. 18. The compensation of the tax collectors shall be five per cent. on
                        the first ten thousand received, and two and a half per cent. on all sums
                        beyond that amount, until the compensation shall reach eight hundred
                        dollars, beyond which no farther compensation shall be paid.</p>
                    <p>The 21st section imposes a penalty of death upon
                        any person who shall, at any time during the war or within one year after
                        the ratification of a treaty of peace, forge or counterfeit, or pass, or
                        cause to be passed, any treasury note of the Confederate States, knowing the
                        same to be forged or counterfeited. </p>
                    <p>The 22nd section provides that if any person shall, at any time, falsely
                        make, forge or counterfeit, or pass or attempt to pass any forged or
                        counterfeited, or falsely alter any bond or coupon of the Confederate
                        States, that such person shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of felon by,
                        and being thereof convicted by due course of law, shall be sentenced to be
                        imprisoned and kept at hard labor for a term of not less than five years nor
                        more than ten years, and be fined in a sum not exceeding five thousand
                        dollars.</p>

                        For the Spectator.
                    </p>
                    <p>Camp Bee,</p>
                    <p>Four miles N. of Winchester,</p>
                    <p>July 8th, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Friend Mauzy:--I avail myself of the first moment of leisure to give you some
                        account of what I saw of the combat of the 2nd of July, between our
                        Regiment, (the 5th,) aided by one gun of Capt. Pendleton's battery, and the
                        Federal forces under General Patterson. We received orders to march and took
                        up our line of march toward the enemy at quarter past 7, a.m. After
                        proceeding along the road leading from Winchester to Williamsport, about
                        three miles, the column was halted, and the West Augusta Guard, Capt.
                        Waters, consulting our advance guard, were deployed, to the right of our
                        line of march, as skirmishers. They were soon supported by the Rockbridge
                        Rifles, Capt. Letcher. On our left Capt. Grinnan's Company were thrown out;
                        Capt. Avis' Company pushed forward along the road, closely followed Capt.
                        Newton's, Capt. Williams', Capt. Roberts', Capt. Antrim's and Capt. Doyle's
                        Companies. The skirmishers on the right were led and placed in order by Maj.
                        Baylor, whose coolness and skill called forth the praise of the whole
                        command; his bearing was most admirable, and would have done credit to a
                        veteran. After the deployment of our skirmishers the firing soon began. The
                        balls from the enemy flew thick and fast over our heads, and their whizzing
                        was by no means pleasant music. I saw, and also
                        did, some considerable dodging of the head, but soon became
                        accustomed to the sound. The whole Regiment pressed on rapidly, and all were
                        soon under fire. The first thing that attracted my attention was the fact
                        that the enemy's line of skirmishers outflanked us to the right and left by
                        many hundred yards; but they seemed to have but little stomach for the
                        fight, many of them breaking to the rear and throwing off their knapsacks
                        and blankets as they ran away. When I came in view of the centre of our
                        line, about 100 yards in advance, Capt. Avis was hotly engaged with the
                        enemy who had stationed themselves behind Porterfield's house and the
                        adjacent farm buildings on the left of the main road. Here the fire was very
                        heavy. Capt. Avis massed his company and ordered a charge with the bayonet,
                        which order was promptly and gallantly executed, and the enemy, in great
                        numbers, fled in wild confusion from their places of shelter. They ran
                        through an orchard in the rear of the house where they were exposed to a
                        heavy fire from Avis', Roberts', Williams', Antrim's and Doyle's Companies.
                        Great numbers of them fell, and the ground was littered with their blankets
                        thrown away in their rapid flight. Avis continued the pursuit to the left,
                        as did Grinnan still farther to the left. Newton's, Roberts', Williams',
                        Antrim's and Doyle's companies continued to advance along the main road to a
                        log barn or stable on the right of the road which building was surrounded by
                        a high post and rail and a stake and ridered fence enclosing the stable
                        yard. These last named companies were ordered to take shelter behind the
                        stable or barn. The fire from the enemy at this point was very heavy and the
                        balls were incessantly pattering upon the fence and upon the roof of the
                        stable. The men essayed to climb on the fence; Capt. Doyle ordered them to
                        desist, and stepped out of the line and opened a gate leading into the yard,
                        through which the men passed rapidly into the yard without loss. At this
                        point the battery of the enemy opened upon us with shell; the projectile
                        passed at least 100 feet over our heads. The sun shone upon it in passing
                        over, and the sound of the burning fuse resembled the escape of steam from a
                        small engine, and the smoke from the fuse in the sunlight looked like steam.
                        One of the men enquired with great earnestness, that's a "steam firing," ain't it? A second soon followed, coming still
                        nearer to the roof of the stable. It seemed the enemy were aiming at us.
                        Col. Harper ordered the companies behind the barn to file out to the right
                        to an open wheat field partly cut and shocked. Capt. Doyle led out at the
                        head of his company, and led the way, followed by the rest down a ravine so
                        as to shelter the men from the enemy's fire. At this point, one of Capt.
                        Doyle's men was mortally wounded. He was taken up by his comrades and
                        carried about 250 yards to a branch, where he was left, being quite dead. We
                        then retired to a wood on the right of the line from whence we originally
                        advanced. We had driven in the enemy's whole line of skirmishers under the
                        protection of their guns. When the enemy's battery opened upon us, our whole
                        command were within 250 yards of it. The whole force of the enemy was drawn
                        up in the order of battle. On the top of the hill at about the same distance
                        from us, (it was not until the battery opened fire that I saw the enemy
                        drawn up in position,) their number, I think, was not less than 5,000. From
                        our position in the hollow I could not see the battery, and did not get a
                        sight of it until we had ascended the hill on our side of the hollow, as we
                        fell back to our original position. The enemy's skirmishers, whom we had
                        driven in, outnumbered us in the proportion of at least three to one. After
                        our retreat to the right ground on one side of the hollow, I distinctly saw
                        the skirmishers whom we had driven from the field rallying in the rear of
                        the enemy's line of battle. They rallied in two bodies and were not less
                        than 1200 strong. There were two regiments of them, as we ascertained from a
                        prisoner taken on the field-- the 1st Wisconsin and the 11th Pennsylvania.
                        Capt. Pendleton, with one gun (a light six-pounder) covered our retreat. So
                        soon as he opened fire upon the enemy the whole fire of their battery was
                        directed at him. This doubtless saved us from heavy loss. The fire of Capt.
                        P. was most effective. I saw two shots, one ploughed through a column of
                        infantry drawn up in the rear of the enemy's line and a short distance to
                        the right of the enemy's battery. That column scattered like chaff before
                        the wind. The other shot which I saw fired struck one of the guns of the
                        enemy. The artilleries ran away from it, and that gun fired no more during
                        that action. </p>
                    <p>After the rout of his first line of skirmishers, the enemy threw out a new
                        line upon the left and threatened to outflank us in that direction, and to
                        cut off our retreat--the companies of Captains Doyle, Antrim, Williams,
                        Roberts, and Waters, (I mentioned them in the order they occupied in our new
                        line, Capt. Doyle's company being on the left of the line.) The second line
                        sent out by the enemy fared no better his first--soon retiring and leaving
                        us masters of the field. We did not pursue them as we did the first. The
                        third sent out by the enemy against us were Regulars. They came out in
                        gallant style and in splendid order, (their lines as straight as ours on
                        dress parade,) firing as they advanced. We retired gradually before them
                        (they greatly outnumbered us) until we gained a skirt of very thick wood
                        bordering a wheat field. Here we halted and opened a heavy fire upon them.
                        They nevertheless continued to advance until they reached a fence separating
                        the wheat field from the pasture field through which they had driven us.
                        Here they halted for a few minutes. The fence row was thick with bushes and
                        trees. From this point they fired heavily, but without effect. About this
                        time we were ordered to retreat to the turnpike, and accordingly the
                        companies of Captains Waters, Roberts, Williams and Antrim retired through
                        the woods in the in the direction of the turnpike, leaving Capt. Doyle's
                        company still engaged with the enemy on the extreme left. Capt. D had not
                        heard the order to retire. The enemy about the time the order to retreat was
                        given, crossed the fence into the wheat field, which stood tall and rank,
                        and advanced upon the wood which Doyle's company still occupied. That
                        gallant company pulled in upon them three or four heavy fires, the last at
                        about 100 yards, when they were ordered by their Captain to retreat, which
                        they did in double-quick. The enemy came on to fence separating the wheat
                        field from the woods from whence Doyle had just retired, and there they
                        halted and fired two or three tremendous volleys into the woods. From their
                        fire it seemed as if at least 500 hundred men constituted their force at
                        that point. When this firing was heard by the rest of the Regiment, at that
                        time half a mile distant, great fears were entertained for the safety of
                        Capt. Doyle's command, but in a few minutes Capt. Doyle brought his company
                        up, not having lost a man in the last contest.</p>
                    <p>Our Regiment mustered but 380 men on the morning of the fight. Capt. Harman's
                        fine company was not with us, being out on picket. We lost two men killed
                        and nine wounded. Providence surely watched over us and protected us. We
                        were for more than two hours engaged in an open country fighting an enemy
                        not less than 6,000 strong with six pieces of artillery. We were under fire
                        all the while from the time the firing first commenced until we left the
                        field. The sound of whizzing balls and bullets was never out of our ears.
                        The conduct of our officers, from the highest to the lowest grade, was above
                        all praise. The men battled more like veterans inured to the dangers of war
                        by long years of service 'mid scenes of blood and carnage, than of men fresh
                        from the peaceful avocations of a country home, as not one of them had ever
                        been under fire, or ever saw the waving of a hostile banner.</p>
                    <p>To our God be the glory, to him the hymns of thanksgiving and praises be sung
                        for surely he has nerved our hearts and made us to be valiant and strong in
                        the fight, and had brought discomfiture upon the enemy.</p>
                    <p>The loss of the enemy was very heavy. From reliable sources of information we
                        may safely set down his loss at 350 killed and wounded. Gen. Patterson, in
                        his note to Gen. Scott, sets down his loss as very trifling, but in the same
                        note he sets down our forces engaged with him at 6,000 or 7,000. So you see
                        the General won't stick to the truth. We halted within one and a half miles
                        of the field of battle, being there joined by the 4th and the 2nd Regiments
                        of our brigade. The enemy did not come within gunshot of us. Again, after
                        passing our camp, where we were joined by the 27th Reg't, we drew up in
                        battle array and waited for more than an hour for Major Gen. Patterson, but
                        he did not come on. We then retired very leisurely to Martinsburg, three
                        miles distant, took time there to refresh ourselves and then retreated two
                        miles, where we encamped an hour and a half before sunset and slept soundly
                        until next morning. But I must bring this rambling epistle to a close. I
                        have named things as I saw them, and being a young soldier unaccustomed to
                        scenes so exciting as present themselves on a battlefield, I doubtless have
                        failed to notice many things which would have attracted the notice of a
                        veteran soldier.</p>
                    <p>I shall, as opportunity offers, give you a few items.</p>
                    <p>Yours truly,</p>
                    <p>L.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Early Sunday we were aroused by the drum beating the long roll, and we
                        immediately formed in the line of battle. Soon the enemy commenced a heavy
                        cannonading on our right, which our accomplished Generals soon discovered to
                        be a feint made by the enemy to attract our attention in that quarter, while
                        their real attack would be made on the extreme left. We were immediately
                        ordered to take position several miles to the left. We had not been in
                        position long, before it became evident we were in a warm neighborhood. The
                        enemy's artillery, just in our front, but hid from our sight by a skirt of
                        woods and an eminence between us, thundered forth its deadly missiles, and
                        presently, too, the sharp ringing crack of the rifle was heard, showing that
                        the advance guard of skirmishers had met. Cavalry scouts could be seen,
                        galloping within the lines, when a terrible volley of muskets, immediately
                        in our front, assured us that the call had opened, and the fight had
                        commenced in right good earnest.</p>
                    <p>Between 9 and 10 o'clock A.M., the enemy in tremendous force, advanced his
                        right against our left, with the view of turning our left wing and getting
                        position in the rear of the "Junction." They were met by several South
                        Carolina regiments (including Hampton's Legion) and the Alabama 4th, our
                        regiment (the 5th Virginia) being held in reserve; but soon we were ordered
                        forward to support the 4th Alabama. On our way to take position on a hill we
                        were met by a portion of a South Carolina regiment who had been compelled to
                        fall back by an overwhelming force, and who informed us that the 4th Alabama
                        was literally being cut to pieces. Here, also, we met two pieces of the
                        Washington (La.) Artillery retiring, having expended their stock of
                        ammunition. This was by no means encouraging, but we felt the necessity for
                        greater exertion on our part, and forward we rushed to the assistance of our
                        friends. Amid a perfect shower of musketry and cannon balls the command to
                        halt and lie down was given, as it was impossible for us to return the
                        enemy's fire, or even see them our men cried out to be led forward or taken
                        back to the foot of the hill; but our gallant Col. Harper assured us that he
                        had no orders to advance, but was directed to occupy this position until the
                        enemy should make their appearance, when we were told to fire and charge
                        bayonets.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the order to advance was given, and under a perfect shower of shell
                        and shot, we arose and started up the hill. A portion of our regiment
                        misunderstanding the order, we were thrown into temporary confusion; but
                        soon rallied and gained the position on the hill behind some old houses.
                        Before we gained position, however, the Fourth Alabama Regiment had been
                        compelled to retreat, and we found ourselves face to face with a powerful
                        force of the enemy, and conspicuous among them was the famous Ellsworth
                        Zouaves. Just in our front was the Second New York Regiment. On the left of
                        them the Zouaves were stationed, while on our right, and completely flanking
                        us, was the First or Second Maine Regiment. We fired a telling volley of
                        musketry into the regiment in our front, which drove them rapidly to the
                        rear. This drew the fire of those on our left upon us, and sheltering
                        themselves by lying down behind a fence, they poured a most destructive fire
                        into our ranks, and here some of our best and bravest men fell. Here the
                        noble and brave Billy Woodward exclaimed, "I will never retreat. 'Give me
                        liberty or give me death.'" His lips had scarcely given utterance to these
                        heroic words, when a ball pierced his brave heart. It soon became evident
                        that with our single regiment it was impossible to maintain the position,
                        exposed as we were to a centre and two raking flank fires from at least four
                        times our number.</p>
                    <p>We therefore fell back to a skirt of woods some hundred yards in the rear,
                        where we were joined by a portion of the Alabama 4th, who had fought so
                        gallantly and suffered so terribly at the house on the hill before we came
                        up. A portion of a South Carolina regiment also joined in with us here, and
                        during the rest of the evening we fought side by side.</p>
                    <p>In every part of the field the contest now raged, and desperate efforts were
                        made by each party to gain some decided advantage, without apparent success,
                        though they greatly outnumbered us, and I looked on at the terrible and
                        desperate strife without being able in my own mind to determine which would
                        be victors.</p>
                    <p>Greatly to the encouragement of our brave troops, who were so heroically
                        struggling against superior numbers, several fresh batteries made their
                        appearance and took position on the eminence just to our left.</p>
                    <p>These opened upon the enemy, whose main column was sheltered behind a
                        gradually sloping hill, thickly covered by small timber, and protected by a
                        part of the celebrated Sherman Battery. A tremendous cannonading now took
                        place that far surpasses anything I ever imagined. It appeared to me as if
                        Heaven and earth were being rent asunder, so terrible was the crash and roar
                        of the monster instruments of death. Several times the enemy attempted to
                        rally for a charge on our batteries; but whenever their lines came within
                        the terrible discharges of round shot and canister from our batteries swept
                        them like chaff before the wind, their long and splendidly formed lines
                        fairly melting away. Yet the tremendous force before us seemed not to
                        diminish, and every inch of ground was contested with sullen and determined
                        force, our brave troops fighting with renewed energy and vigor. Being
                        parched with thirst and almost exhausted, I ran down to what appeared to be
                        a branch or mud hole, and drank copiously of the muddy waster, and was just
                        returning to my regiment when I met Gen. Johnston, who inquired of me to
                        what regiment I belonged. I told him. He then inquired how Gen. Jackson's
                        Brigade was getting along. I told him we were fighting bravely and well, but
                        against large odds, and needed help. He at once said, go join your regiment
                        and tell them to hold their position, and in a few moments I will send
                        reinforcements to their aid. I hurried back to my regiment with a lighter
                        heart than I left it.</p>
                    <p>On reaching the top of the hill, I could see in the direction of Manassas
                        Junction a large column of men approaching, and filing past them with the
                        swiftness of the wind, was a splendid body of cavalry, numbering probably a
                        thousand. These came rushing on like a mighty torrent, with drawn sabres
                        glittering in the evening's bright sunbeams, mounted on steeds which seemed
                        to be maddened by the contest that was being waged by man against his fellow
                        man. I soon recognized this to be the splendid body of Cavalry commanded by
                        the gallant Col. Stuart of which the excellent company from Augusta (Capt.
                        Patrick's) forms a part. In the meantime, Gen. Beauregard appeared on the
                        field in person, and approaching our regiment inquired who we were, and on
                        being informed, he addressed us in the following cheerful language: "Fight
                        on, brave Virginia boys; the day is ours everywhere else, and it must be
                        here also." He then commanded us to follow him, and, with a loud cheer, we
                        rushed forward, determined to do as commanded or die.</p>
                    <p>By this time Sherman's battery had evidently become somewhat disabled, and
                        had slackened its fire a little. Our course was turned directly in that
                        direction. We reached the top of an eminence, fired a volley and at a charge
                        bayonets rushed down upon it. We found that every horse attached to the
                        battery was either killed or disabled and not a man, except the dead and
                        wounded were left with the guns.</p>
                    <p>Almost every company in the regiment claim the credit of first reaching the
                        battery. I would not do injustice to any. But a proper regard to truth, and
                        honor to whom honor is due in this particular act, compels me to say that
                        the left of the regiment, under the command of Maj. Baylor, was the first to
                        reach the immediate vicinity of the battery, and corporals R. T. Bucher, of
                        the West Augusta Guards, Capt. Waters, and John Sutz, of the Augusta Rifles,
                        Capt. Antrim, were the first men to reach the captured guns. Col. Pucher
                        sprang astride one of the pieces and fired his musket at the retreating
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>By this time the reinforcements I referred to coming from the direction of
                        Manassas, had arrived on the ground, and, unperceived either by us or the
                        enemy, marched rapidly to our left and to the right of the Federal forces
                        under cover of a skirt of woods. These troops consisted of three Tennessee
                        and one Virginia regiments; from this position they poured into the ranks of
                        the enemy (who were partly concealed by thick undergrowth,) the most
                        terrible volley of musketry I ever witnessed; and then with a shout that
                        rent the air, they rushed in one grand sweeping charge upon them. The enemy,
                        terror stricken, broke ranks and fled in the wildest confusion over the
                        hill; the cavalry charged upon them, sending terror and dismay among their
                        already confused and broken ranks; the guns of the captured batteries were
                        turned against them; batteries were run upon eminences which commanded roads
                        along which they retreated, and which raked and crushed their disordered
                        columns dreadfully, and shout after shout rent the air from victorious
                        Southern troops.</p>
