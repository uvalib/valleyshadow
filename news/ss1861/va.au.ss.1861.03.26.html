<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article outlines constitutional amendments proposed by the State Convention
                    that would defuse the current secession crisis. These include an extension of
                    the Missouri Compromise and items ensuring that a majority of senators from
                    slaveholding states will be required to acquire territory not currently in the
                    Union. Proposed amendments would also prevent those of African heritage from

<b>Speaking on Monday</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports an animated discussion at the Court-house between the Union
                    congressional candidate, John Harris, and the secession candidate, James
                    Skinner. Also at the meeting, Robert Doyle refused a call to run for Congress
                    for fear of splitting the Union vote.<br>(Names in announcement:  John Harris,  James Skinner, Esq. Robert Doyle)</blockquote>
<b>Judge Breckenbrough's Speech</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Analyzes a speech given by Judge Breckenbrough on the front porch of the
                    Virginia hotel and criticizes it, not only for its secessionist content, but
                    also because it was "flat, stale, and unprofitable to an almost intolerable
                    degree." The Spectator reports that even the secessionists on hand found it
                    uninspiring.<br>(Names in announcement: Judge  Breckenbrough)</blockquote>
<b>Louisiana</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator defends itself against charges of Black Republicanism made by the
                    Vindicator. The Spectator charges the Vindicator with switching positions since
                    the Presidential election, when the Vindicator endorsed Douglas. The Vindicator
                    also changed its position on the question of a popular vote on the subject of
                    secession.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"States-Rights-Democracy" now means secession.--Spectator. </p>
                    <p>This is not quite so near the truth as that submission means Black
                            Republicanism.--Vindicator. </p>
                    <p>The "Vindicator," having changed the position it occupied during the
                        Presidential election in favor of the Union to that of secession and against
                        the Union, has adopted the language of the secessionists, and charges the
                        friends of the Union with being submissionists, and as it says that
                        "submission means Black Republicanism," it, in this way, by arriving at
                        "direction by indirection," charges all the friends of the Union, including
                        all good Union-loving Democrats, with being Black Republicans. On the 4th of
                        February, the editor of that very consistent
                        journal, by his vote against reference, "recorded
                        himself as fearing to trust the people in the management of their own
                        business," though "they are honest and capable and patriotic and their
                        interests were immediately concerned," and on the 22nd of March charges them
                        with being Black Republicans. This is verily "adding insult to injury." Was
                        the editor of that paper a Black Republican when he was supporting Douglas
                        with so much zeal after his response to the Norfolk questions, in which he
                        declared that the election of Lincoln would furnish no cause for secession,
                        and that, if elected President, he would enforce the laws against the
                        enemies of the Union, after the manner of Jackson? </p>

<b>Col. Baldwin's Speech</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses Col. Baldwin's speech to the Convention, in which he defended
                    slavery as a moral and good thing but challenged any man at the convention to
                    specify any other point of contention with the Federal government apart from the
                    slavery question. He furthermore challenged the Convention to point to one
                    current Federal Law that interfered with slavery in Virginia. The secessionist
