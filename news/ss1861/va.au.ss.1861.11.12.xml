                <excerpt>"Many of his warmest admirers and best friends...were influenced to vote
                    against him because they had confidence in his skill as a commander...and were
                    unwilling to exchange him for anyone else. Had they not desired to retain him as
                    their commandant the vote would have approximated unanimity."</excerpt>

                <summary>Announces that Col. Baldwin won Augusta County in his quest for a seat in
                    the Confederate Congress. The article alleges that many admirers voted against
                    him because they wanted him to remain in a military command position, which he
                    will have to relinquish if elected. The article also announces that Col. Baldwin
                    is sick with typhoid fever contracted in camp.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Clarksville Chronicle, published in Tennessee, says that it seems to be a
                        difficult matter for the people of the South to realize the heavy
                        responsibilities which the war imposes upon them, and the absolute necessity
                        for providing an abundance of those things that are indispensable for our
                        support during its continuance. It can avail them but little to make large
                        crops of cotton and tobacco with no market for either, and even if they
                        could sell all they could raise, it could advance but little the cause of
                        the South in the absence of an ample supply of meat and bread. These we can
                        obtain from no quarter if we fail to raise them, and he is a true patriot
                        who will enlarge his corn and wheat fields, and multiply his hogs, sheep and
                        cattle, with an eye to the necessities of his country. No one can foresee
                        the duration of the war, but any one can foresee the dire influence of a
                        scarcity of food upon our ability to prosecute it; and to avert such a
                        calamity, every tiller of the soil should make the amplest arrangements in
                        his power to guard against it--taking into consideration, too, the
                        probability of an unfavorable season. And whilst the farmer is doing this,
                        his wife and daughters should set in motion loom and spinning wheel,
                        remembering that every thread they spin and every yard they weave is a
                        contribution to Southern liberty and independence. The soldier who hazards
                        his life on the battle field and his health in the camp, looks to those at
                        home to supply his wants, and none but the unfeeling speculator can turn a
                        deaf ear to the voice of humanity appealing for food and raiment for our
                        country's brave defenders. To the women, this appeal is never made in vain,
                        and we trust they will labor unceasingly to infuse into the hearts of men a
                        portion, at least, of their own noble spirit and self-sacrificing devotion.
                        It is a sad commentary upon the character of some Southern men that such an
                        appeal should be needed; but the indifference of some, the thoughtlessness
                        of others, and the selfish rapacity of not a few, constantly remind us that
                        all are not patriots who profess to be Southern in feeling, and all are not
                        to be trusted who are loudest in their expressions of devotion to a cause
                        which they appreciate only to the extent that it can be made to fill their
                        pockets. It is to be hoped, however, that there are enough of the right sort
                        who will look beyond self to country, and the present to a future that will
                        repay every sacrifice in behalf of national honor and independence.</p>

                <head>An Early Advance from the Potomac Probable and Desirable</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Cincinnati <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> of the 27th ult., has the
                        following: </p>
                    <p>The New York <emph rend="italic">Times</emph>, in its issue of Monday, tells
                        us that an early advance from the Potomac, by Gen. McClellan, is now highly
                        probably. It learns that our army is now complete in all its parts--in
                        number, infantry, artillery, cavalry, in discipline, and in its
                        commissariat--all is in perfect order, and is now ready for active and
                        efficient offensive operations. </p>
                    <p>We are pleased to learn that such is the condition of the Federal Army, and
                        that there is a prospect of an early advance by it from the Potomac. Indeed,
                        it can no longer afford to be on the defensive. The continuance of its
                        present attitude would be as injurious to our Government, with foreign
                        Powers, as a defeat would be. The United States and Confederate States stand
                        before the world in very different attitudes. It is for the former to show
                        that it has power to put down the rebellion within a reasonable time. It is
                        for the Confederate States to demonstrate that they can sustain themselves.
                        It is not necessary for them to show that they can conquer the North, but to
                        show that they can prevent us from conquering them. This last they can do as
                        effectually by maintaining their position on the Potomac as by an advance.</p>
                    <p>The Confederate States, by maintaining their position on the Potomac,
                        demonstrate that they are a power with ability to preserve itself. That is
                        all they need to show to command, according to the acknowledged and
                        universal law on the subject, the recognition of their independence by
                        civilized nations, which is what they are at present striving to obtain. But
                        when, besides showing their ability to maintain themselves, they flaunt
                        their flags within sight of the Federal Capital, erect their batteries
                        within cannon shot of the President's mansion, and daily invite an attack by
                        provocation, menace and insult, foreign powers cannot but regard them as of
                        equal force with the United States and equally as capable of maintaining
                        their independence.</p>
                    <p>We consider, therefore, that our character, as the superior power, is sullied
                        by allowing the Confederate forces to occupy any longer their position near
                        Washington. We rejoice to hear that Gen. McClellan is now ready, that his
                        army is just as he desires it to be in all its departments, and that he is
                        prepared to act upon the offensive instead of the defensive. We do not want
                        him to move before he [is] ready; but move he must, before long, if he
                        expects to uphold the credit of the Government with foreign nations. It will
                        not do to allow the Confederates any longer to threaten Washington under its
                        very walls, and defy our army to move from their entrenchments. The
                        Confederates accomplish their whole purpose by keeping their position, we
                        lose our prestige and character by not being able to move forward. As
                        everything is now ready, we expect to see Beauregard driven, at least, from
                        the neighborhood of Washington.</p>
