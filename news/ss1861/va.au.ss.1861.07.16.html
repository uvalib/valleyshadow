                    <p>We have been determined to issue the "Spectator" as long as we could possibly
                        do so, whether at a profit or loss. Until we had furnished three soldiers from our office for the army, we
                        continued the publication of the paper by issuing a half sheet. We were
                        determined to continue publication, though at a loss to our own pocket, and
                        had just received a large supply of paper for that purpose when the call for
                        the services of the company to which we and the hands in our office belong
                        appeared--thus making it impossible to continue
                        its publication. We know that the good and generous subscribers of the
                        "Spectator" will not complain of us for discontinuing it's publication under
                        these circumstances. We promise them that its publication will be renewed if
                        ever we return from the field of strife. We hope that our enemies will be
                        conquered, and that our subscribers and friends will enjoy long and happy
                        lives in the free and independent Confederacy of Southern States. </p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. J.M.G. Medlock, Editor and Proprietor of the "Central Georgian," is a
                        soldier in the 1st Georgia Regiment which passed through this place a few
                        weeks since. The following is an extract from a letter of his, written at
                        Beverly, to his paper.</p>
                    <p>"The citizens of Staunton treated us very kindly. More enthusiasm I have not
                        seen anywhere. At Waynesboro, in Augusta county, Va., we found tables spread
                        with an abundance of provisions for every man on board. We all partook
                        freely of the good things set before us, and gave three hearty cheers for
                        Waynesboro--but especially the ladies--bade them farewell, and went on our
                        way rejoicing. At another station, (I regret I have forgotten the name of
                        the place) the citizens heard that our regiment was to pass up the evening
                        before, and made great preparations for giving us a supper, but they had
                        mistaken the time and were greatly disappointed. Some of the ladies of that
                        place visited our regiment after we got to Staunton, bringing baskets of
                        provisions along with them.</p>
                    <p>This is emphatically a land of milk and butter, and the milk has flown freely
                        to the weary soldier wherever it was to be had, with a few exceptions.</p>
                    <p>At Staunton we were also treated kindly. Scarcely an hour in the day passed
                        without something being sent to the camp for our comfort. The same spirit
                        that animated the hearts of our mothers in the days of '76 is still to be
                        found in Old Virginia and in other States. All my acquaintances know that I
                        have ever been a devoted friend of women, but I have now great reason to be
                        more her friend than ever before. Her hand has ever been ready to supply the
                        wants of the soldier as he passed her door, and her generous heart always
                        responsive to those ennobling virtues which render her almost divine. The
                        memory of her kindness has sunk deep into my heart of hearts, and will there
                        be cherished to the remotest period of my life. But I have not language
                        sufficient to do justice to the subject. I shall never forget a kind lady of
                        Staunton, Mrs. A. B. Cowan, who, with her own hands, prepared provisions for
                        me sufficient to last several days. Everything good that she could crowd
                        into my haversack was put in, and then a bundle placed in my hand. Her
                        kindness, and that of her family brought home more forcibly to my mind that
                        I found a tear welling up in my eye. May God bless her and her household.
                        But I have already devoted too much space to myself."</p>
