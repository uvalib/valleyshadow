<b>Col. Baldwin's Report on Federal Relations</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Col. Baldwin (of Augusta Co.) issued a statement outlining several
                    resolutions in his substitute for the majority report of the Committee on
                    Federal Relations at the State Convention (see below for the Majority Report).
                    According to Baldwin, the Convention should accept the amendments to the
                    Constitution proposed by the Peace conference as an acceptable resolution of the
                    current crisis. Second, the Convention should consult and act in concert with
                    the other Border states. Third, any attempt at armed intervention in the seceded
                    states will inevitably result in civil war, a war viewed as against the people
                    and institutions of fifteen states to which "the people of Virginia cannot be
                    inattentive or indifferent." The report makes clear that the conciliatory views
                    of Virginia will change drastically if any military force is used to enforce
                    Federal policies against the seceded states. Virginia will continue to pursue a
                    peaceful redress of grievances within the Union as the Constitution provides.<br>(Names in announcement: Col.  Baldwin)</blockquote>
<b>A Southerner on Secession</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quotes a letter from a Southern gentleman in Augusta, Georgia who says
                    that, with taxes and tariffs rising under the Confederacy and the populace
                    roaming about armed, the citizens of the South, if left alone for six months,
                    would probably seek to re-enter the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Southern gentleman who resides in Augusta, Ga., writes thus:--"If the South
                        were merely let alone for six months, we would probably try at the next
                        general election to get back. The new tariff will open both eyes and
                        pockets; 3 to 4 cents per pound on cheese, 4 to 5 cents on butter, 2 to 2
                        1/2 cents on sugar, 2 1/2 to 25 cents on tobacco, affect every one, and that
                        sensibly. Prices have advanced and are still ascending. Our regular army has
                        140 enlisted in this city, and as many in Savannah. Nine-tenths of our youth
                        go constantly armed, and the common use of deadly weapons is quite
                        disregarded. No control can be exercised over a lad after he is fourteen or
                        fifteen. He becomes MR. So-and-so, and acknowledges no master. While our
                        free trade doubles our tariff, our postal facilities will probably be raised
                        to 10 or 25 cents, and off the immediate line of railways there will
                        probably be at least one mail a week. Of course, therefore, we will like
                        secession the better as we become the better acquainted with it!"</p>

<b>Majority Report on Federal Relations</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is a copy of the Majority Report of the Convention. The report
                    of the Convention takes a more secessionist tone than the report of Col.
                    Baldwin. The report makes it clear that Virginia will not tolerate disruptions
                    in the institution of slavery and implies that compromises on the question of
                    slavery in the Territories will have to be reached in order for Virginia to
                    remain in the Union. The report also states that the Federal property in the
                    seceded states actually belongs to those states. Thus, the jurisdiction over
                    these properties rightfully reverts back to those states. The report states that
                    enforcement of the fugitive slave laws are a prerequisite to any settlement. Any
                    aggression against any seceded state will be considered an offensive against the
                    Commonwealth of Virginia and will determine her future policy.<br>

<b>Patriotic Sentiments by Stephen Douglas</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A portion of a recent speech by Stephen Douglas where he implored
                    Republicans to put aside party loyalties and vote to extend the line of the

<b>Constitution of the New Confederacy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates some of the features of the new Confederate Constitution. According
                    to this document, suffrage will be limited to those of Confederate birth and
                    state legislatures will have the right to impeach Confederate office holders. In
                    addition, the institution of slavery is acknowledged and protected everywhere.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Mr. Skinner and Ten of His Supporters</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The last issue of the "Vindicator" contained correspondence between James
                    H. Skinner and ten persons of Crab Bottom, who accused Skinner of being a
                    secessionists. The Spectator believes that Skinner did not offer them a clear
                    reply. Instead, "his amplification had the effect to obscure rather than
                    elucidate."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Secessionists Complaining</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Points out that the Secessionists, who insisted that a Convention be
                    called, are now complaining about the Convention, which was carried by
                    conservatives who did not favor disunion at this time. The secessionists "would
                    not be satisfied until a Convention was called and they are not satisfied now
                    that one has been called." The article states that the secessionist will only be
                    satisfied in the event of war, which will force the Border States out of the
                    Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Reference to the People</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator charges The Vindicator with switching positions, having
                    before the call of the Convention been opposed to holding a popular vote on the
                    subject of secession. Now that the Convention has supported unionism, the
                    Vindicator believes that the Convention's resolutions should be put to a popular
                    vote.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In an editorial article advocating the propriety of referring the question of
                        secession to the vote of the people, the last "Vindicator" says:</p>
                    <p>"This brings the question immediately before the people. We ask that they may
                        act for themselves on this important question. They are honest and capable

                        members of the Convention will vote against this resolution, and record
                        himself as fearing to trust the people in the management of their own
                        business."</p>

                        "Vindicator" voted AGAINST referring to the people. The people were as
                        "honest and capable and patriotic" then as now, and "their interests were as
                        immediately concerned". . . [text missing] . . . of the "Vindicator" voted
                        AGAINST giving them an opportunity to vote upon the action of the Convention

<b>Beware of Traps</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that, in the name of harmonizing the party, secessionist Democrats
                    are trying to lure Union Democrats to take part in meetings under the banner of
                    States-Rights Democracy. The Spectator warns Union men to beware of these
                    meetings as they are an attempt to recruit for the secessionist cause.<br>

                    Federal Relations, including the majority report, signed by fourteen of
                    twenty-one committee members. The Spectator maintains that the majority report
                    has an "awful squinting" to the right of secession and prefers the report of
