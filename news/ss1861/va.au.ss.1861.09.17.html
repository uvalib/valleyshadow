<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The expenses of this war may be almost saved by having the blockade closed;
                        that is, our people will learn habits of carefulness and economy which no
                        other means will teach them; and difficult as it may be for the liberal and
                        generous Southerner to descend to such unknown thriftiness, it is his
                        positive duty now, in the great crisis of our present troubles, not only to
                        practice such himself, but to enforce it in his children and servants. "Pick
                        up the fragments, that nothing be lost," is the teaching of Christ. "The
                        fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption," is the teaching of
                        Nature. "From the vilest poisons are extracted the most precious medicines"
                        is the teaching of chemistry. Therefore we need not pronounce it beneath our
                        pride and dignity in these momentous times to gather together whatever may
                        be in any way usable or convertible. "Save your rags," if you want your
                        daily papers. "Save your grease," it is needed for soap, which latter
                        housekeepers should turn their attention to making at home. Also starch;
                        both easy enough.</p>
                    <p>And you, our gentlemanly Micawber cousins, rouse your inventive faculties,
                        and dip into your encyclopedias for practical knowledge. "Necessity is the
                        parent of invention;" and how can you display your patriotism to better
                        purpose, if not fighting, than by contriving, suggesting and assisting to
                        establish and improve the many manufactories which have already, and must be
                        still further, put on foot to meet the demands of a nation who neither watch
                        the raising of the blockade nor wait till the war is over, before they begin
                        to become a "great and independent people." Rich.
                            Examiner.</p>
