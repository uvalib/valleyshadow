<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article ridicules the ineffectiveness of the Yankee war effort.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Whig</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Yankee States having commenced the war against the South, having avowed
                        the policy of coercion, and pledged themselves to punish "the rebels" and
                        restore the Union, have taken upon themselves the onus of aggression. It is
                        theirs to wage war, ours to resist; theirs to assail, ours to defend. We do
                        not mean to say that we think it our true policy to remain on the defensive;
                        we are not about to discuss that question but simply to remind the reader
                        that the role of aggressive and invasive war is that which the Yankees have
                        chosen for themselves, and that which they must continue, and succeed in, or
                        stand before the world defeated. Having undertaken to overrun and subjugate
                        the South, every day of inaction, every measure merely defensive, every
                        retrograde movement, is something equivalent to defeat---is a confession
                        that they have undertaken what they are not capable off accomplishing. Never
                        did a people swagger more in the outset, or thunder more in the preparation,
                        of hostilities than did they. Amid insolence and bombast and bravado, such
                        as the world never saw, they raised, equipped and organized the "Grand Army"
                        that was to quarter in the Capital of the Rebels by the 4th of July, at
                        farthest. Another Grand Army was to descend the valley of the Mississippi
                        and sweep everything before it. Huge fleets were to flock along the coast
                        and open all the cotton ports to the world. Yankeedom, in fine, was to
                        ravage unresisted and roar without reply. Such was the promise they held out
                        to the astonished world, such the menace they fulmined over our devoted
                        heads. Before this time, we were to have been severely chastised, and humbly
                        suing for peace. The Confederate States, on the other hand, promised
                        nothing, threatened nothing but simply asked to be "let alone." In their new
                        relation, they disclaimed all hostile feeling or purpose, and tendered
                        political amity and reciprocal commerce. When these were rejected and war
                        denounced, they mustered for defence. They accepted the war as something not
                        to be avoided, and to be resisted as long as it might be waged. This was
                            their role. For them, merely to escape
                        subjugation was victory. To hold the enemy at arm's length was triumph.
                        These were the respective attitudes of the parties to the war at the
                        beginning, and so they remain. Thus far the Yankee undertaking has been
                        unmitigated and ignominious failure--while the undertaking of the
                        Confederate States has been a glorious success. They have failed in
                        everything of consequence they have attempted. We have succeeded in
                        everything of consequence we have attempted. They undertook, first, to
                        frighten us by bullyism, and failed. They undertook next, in the Sumter
                        business, to over-reach us by fraud and trickery, and failed. Then they
                        undertook to raise an army before whose ponderous battalions we would quail
                        and succumb, and they failed. They undertook to surround us with the
                        Anaconda folds of their vast army and compress us into submission, and they
                        failed. They undertook by a blockade to deprive us of the necessaries of
                        life and starve us into subjection, and they failed. They undertook to push
                        their way into our dominions by the irresistible momentum of serried ranks
                        and countless hosts, and failed. They undertook to win victories, and
                        failed. They undertook to cut off all communication between us and foreign
                        countries, and failed. They solicited sympathy and co-operation from
                        European governments, and failed to obtain them. They sought to obtain the
                        services of military leaders of note from abroad, and failed. They have
                        failed in all these and other undertakings, and each of their failures has
                        been our triumph. They have succeeded in putting chains upon helpless
                        Maryland, but only for a time. Those fetters will be burst, and the star of
                        the brave little Commonwealth will yet shine resplendent in the Southern
                        heavens. They have succeeded in buying, at more than they were worth, a
                        number of traitors in Northwestern Virginia, in Kentucky and Missouri. They
                        have succeeded in throwing into their dungeons some true and good men, and a
                        few undefended women. Beyond these things, they have succeeded in alienating
                        forever the land which was the nursing mother of all their prosperity; in
                        forfeiting the respect of other nations; in destroying their constitution
                        and all the defences of liberty; in converting a free government into a
                        despotism; in demonstrating that they are unworthy of freedom, because
                        incapable of maintaining it; and in convincing the people by whom they
                        desired most of all to be thought heroic and martial, that the "military is
                        not their line." These are the results of the war, so far; and this is what
                        we conceive to be "the situation." --Rich. Whig.
