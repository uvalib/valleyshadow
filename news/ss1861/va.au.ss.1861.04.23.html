<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises the steadfast efforts of Virginia to negotiate a settlement in the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We feel proud of "Old Augusta"--her noble conduct challenges the admiration
                        of all brave and patriotic citizens. She contains sons as patriotic as ever
                        sacrificed their lives and fortunes for liberty, and as brave soldiers as
                        were ever commanded by Caesar or Napoleon. Her citizens are the sons of
                        brave and patriotic sires, and they have not degenerated. They are ready at
                        all times to respond with alacrity to the call to arms, and are animated
                        with a firm and determined spirit to strike till the last armed foe expires.
                        When their State calls they hesitate not to strike <br> For their altars
                        and their fires, <br>The green graves of their sires, <br>God and their
                        native land. <br>They in the same patriotic spirit which animated the
                        "Father of his country," cherished a cordial and habitual attachment to the
                        Union, and, with deep and heartfelt devotion, labored with all the
                        earnestness of their natures to preserve it as it had been bequeathed to
                        them by their ancestors. As long as there was a ray of hope, they stood
                        firmly as the friends of the Union and the advocates of a just, honorable
                        and peaceful settlement of all our national difficulties. When others
                        despaired, they still hoped; when others yielded, they still stood firmly.
                        They had the high moral courage to stand firmly where their convictions of
                        patriotic duty commanded, though their motives were impeached and their
                        loyalty distrusted by those who did not appreciate their noble
                        characters.--But as soon as the last ray of hope had been extinguished, as
                        soon as they had seen the President's proclamation, the herald of civil war,
                        and heard the call to arms, they sprang to their feet, donned their military
                        dress, shouldered their guns, bade their fathers and mothers, brothers and
                        sisters a hurried and affectionate farewell, and marched with speed to the
                        place of rendevous. They did not stop to consider the consequences to
                        themselves individually--they were willing to sacrifice all they
                        possessed--their lives and fortunes--in defence of their native State.--Many
                        left their families almost entirely unprovided for--there was no time to
                        consider individual interests when their State called for their services.
                        Some left sick wives and children, and some sick fathers and mothers,
                        brothers and sisters. It was almost enough to melt a heart of adamant to
                        witness such scenes as were present just before the troops left this place.
                        One would call upon his physician and say: "Doctor, my Dear wife is sick, I
                        hope you will attend her carefully." Another would say, "Doctor, I have left
                        two sick children, and request you to see them daily." Another would say,
                        "Doctor, my father is old and feeble, I fear I may never see him again, I
                        desire you to keep him alive if you can till I return." Another would say,
                        "Doctor, my dear mother is nearly heart-broken, I hope you will console her
                        as much as possible." </p>
                    <p>The same patriotic fires which glowed in the bosoms of their noble ancestors,
                        in 1776, burns brightly now upon the altars of the hearts of the brave and
                        chivalric sons of Augusta. This county, we have no doubt, will send more
                        soldiers to the field than any county in the State, though Rockingham and
                        Rockbridge will nobly do their duty. These three adjoining Union counties,
                        we venture to predict, will furnish more soldiers than any other three
                        adjoining counties in the State. We feel convinced that all three of these
                        strong Union counties will do their whole duty. We are sure that the brave
                        and patriotic Union men of these counties will forgive those who, in
                        ignorance of their true characters, charged them with being "submissionists"
                        and "sympathisers with Black Republicanism," and hope that those who did so
                        will have the candor and manliness to acknowledge that they wronged as brave
                        and loyal citizens as ever breathed the air of freedom. Let all feelings of
                        alienation and party spirit be buried, and all stand together in harmony and
                        friendship as a band of affectionate brothers.--"United we stand, divided we
                        fall." In "Union there is strength," in division there is weakness. Let all
                        stand together. We are still for Union--a Union of brave and patriotic men
                        for the defence of our State.</p>
