<b>Mr. John B. Snider Killed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Item reports the murder of John Snider by Henry J. Webster, a soldier
                    belonging to the 1st Tennessee Regiment, while Snider worked in Mr. Beck's
                    restaurant.<br>(Names in announcement:  John Snider)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday night last, at ten o'clock, Mr. Jno. B. Snider of this place was
                        killed by Henry J. Webster, of Murray county, Tennessee, a soldier belonging
                        to the 1st Tennessee Regiment, Colonel Manning commandant. Mr. Snider was
                        employed in Mr. Jno. Beck's restaurant, where he was attending to his duties
                        when Webster entered with his pistol in his hand and asked for oysters. He
                        was informed by Mr. Snider that he could not furnish them as his supply was
                        exhausted. Webster, in a very peremptory manner, demanded that he should get
                        him some. Mr. Snider told him that he did not know where any could be
                        obtained at that time. Webster swore that he should get them, aimed his
                        pistol and shot Mr. Snider in the head. The ball entered above the left eye
                        and penetrated the brain. He lived from 10 to 3 o'clock. He was a very
                        deserving young man, possessed a good character, and had a social, kind and
                        accommodating disposition. He leaves a young wife and child to mourn his sad
                        and untimely death. The jury of Inquest held over the body of the deceased
                        rendered a verdict of willful and malicious murder. The prisoner had his
                        examining trial on Thursday and was committed to the county jail. There was
                        very great excitement on the morning after the commission of the dreadful
                        deed among the friends of the victim, and a very strong disposition
                        prevailed to take the prisoner from the hands of the authorities and execute
                        him by the summary process of Lynch law.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notice of the location and services of the Staunton Artillery by a Richmond

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Bohemian," the regular correspondent of the Richmond Dispatch, writing from
                        Occoquan makes the following notice of the location and services of the
                        "Staunton Artillery," commanded by Capt. John D. Imboden:</p>
                    <p>"Close by the town, lying under 'Rose Hill,' and almost in the shadow of the
                        haunted house, is the camp of Capt. Imboden, whose battery did such good
                        service in the battle of Manassas Plains. The gallant soldier is now very
                        busy with Gen. Wigfall in examining the country around him, and in selecting
                        locations where his guns could be used should the enemy advance. I have
                        already spoken of an erroneous map of the battle field, upon which Gen.
                        Ewell has a false position. It was even worse with Capt. Imboden, for in
                        places where he fought like a tiger, and where his battery did the best
                        service, the credit is given to another corps of artillery. Frequently on
                        the 21st I saw his battery working as well as the best General could wish,
                        but until late did not know whose guns they were, or who the gallant officer
                        was who aimed them. Capt. Imboden is now under Gen. Wigfall, and will have a
                        prominent place in the fight by the Occoquan, should one occur.</p>

                    <p>A Southern contemporary denounces in terms of just but strong reprobation the
                        extensive distillation of the staff of life into one of the most prolific
                        fountains of misery and death that ever was let loose upon an unhappy race.
                        In the present condition of the South, when it is absolutely necessary that
                        all the grain we raise should be converted to its legitimate purposes, the
                        distillation into whiskey should be restricted to such limits as are
                        required for medicinal purposes, and the moderate supply which is necessary
                        for the army. Anything beyond this is a wanton, criminal, and treasonable
                        waste of articles essential to the support of our soldiers and the comfort
                        of our population.</p>
