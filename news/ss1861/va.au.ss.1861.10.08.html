<b>No Reconstruction of the Union</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article asserts that the Union is forever broken and that the installation
                    of tyranny drove the South from it.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As long as the Union was a temple of freedom, at whose shrine all the
                        devotees of Liberty might worship--as long as it was a beacon light guiding
                        the tempest lost on the sea of despotism to a haven of peace--as long as it
                        attracted the gaze and admiration of the friends of liberty throughout the
                        world, and excited the hopes of the down trodden victims of tyranny,
                        wherever found bending beneath the galling yoke--as long as it promised to
                        hand down to posterity the rich inheritance bequeathed us by our patriotic
                        ancesters [sic], we were the devoted friend of its preservation and
                        perpetuation; but when it was changed from a temple of freedom to a prison
                        for the friends of liberty--when its vast powers were used to rivet the
                        chains of despotism upon the limbs of freemen--when it was perverted to the
                        destruction of every principle of free government--when the Goddess of
                        Liberty was dethroned and the gorgon of tyranny was installed in its stead,
                        we rejoiced that the people, in the majesty of their strength, arose with
                        the might of Sampson, and razed it to the ground. They were not such blind
                        devotees as to worship the temple when the Genius of Liberty had been driven
                        from it--they did not mistake the temple for the indwelling Goddess. The
                        Southrons were people who knew their rights and dared to maintain them
                        without reference to the perils which surrounded or the vast expenditure of
                        treasure attending it. They were resolved to be free, and [when] they could
                        not be so by remaining in association with the people of the North, they
                        resolved to dissolve all the bonds binding them to that section of the
                        country. Lincoln drew the sword, seemingly ignorant of the fact that it is
                        an instrument which may cleave assunder [sic], but has no healing virtues,
                        and with it severed the bonds which bound us to the North. We would not now
                        consent at any time, or under any circumstances, to be again brought into
                        Governmental association with the people of the North. We are opposed to
                        reconstruction on any terms whatever. The silver chord has been severed, the
                        golden bowl has been broken, the Union lies in ruins and we hope it will
                        never, never, NEVER be
                            reconstructed. The following extract from the address of Robert
                        E. Scott, of Fauquier, announcing himself a candidate for Congress,
                        expresses our views much better than we could in language of our own: </p>
                    <p>"Let no one entertain a thought of re-constructing the old Union. The time
                        for re-construction has past. The people of the North have interposed
                        between us and them a wall of fire and a river of blood, so that henceforth
                        we must live as separate States both independent and free to follow its own
                        system of government and civilization, or one subject to the other. We can
                        never live together again as members of one family, associated under a
                        common government. In the name of the Union the Northern people have
                        trampled upon its most sacred rights; in the name of the Constitution they
                        have broken its strongest covenants; in the name of free speech and a free
                        press they have destroyed both; in the name of liberty they have established
                        a galling despotism, and impelled by a blind zeal, inspired by hatred to us,
                        they rejoice madly in the chains that fetter their own liberties. Such an
                        example of a civilized people, born to the inheritance of freedom, thus
                        wickedly surrendering their birthright, is without a parallel in the history
                        of the world from the remotest origin of man. People thus willing to become
                        slaves themselves are fit instruments to make slaves of others, and to this
                        end the war is prosecuted. We will meet it bravely and fight it
                        successfully. Eight millions of Confederated freemen can never be conquered.
                        Great Bethel, Manassas and Springfield will prove to be but typifications of
                        the victories hereafter to be won in the battles wherein Southern
                        Independence is to be defended.</p>
                    <p>Of the issues that formerly defined political parties among us, I shall say
                        nothing. The occasions that gave rise to them have passed, and let these
                        divisions pass with them. When all are engaged in a common cause, when every
                        man's dearest interest is at hazard, when each individual is struggling for
                        his personal liberty, when our armies are filled by men from every State and
                        politicians of every opinion, when the energy of all, the strength of all,
                        and the union of all are demanded for the common safety, I hold him to be
                        the worst enemy of the country who would recur to past political
                        diversities, and in this hour of trial stimulate afresh those domestic
                        dissensions out of which already so much injury has been wrought, and by
                        which alone our cause can now suffer shame."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We were surprised to find in the Lexington
                        Gazette, a paper usually conducted with commendable propriety and
                        discretion, a very grave charge preferred against the Surgeons in the
                        Hospital of this place, based upon no evidence justifying it. To protect the
                        soldiers, and to expose the conduct of those remiss in their duty to them,
                        is right and proper; but to prefer grave and groundless charges against
                        persons who are not only innocent, honorable and high-minded gentlemen, but
                        who are doing all that medical skill and the most assiduous attention can do
                        for the health and comfort of the soldiers is a very grave offence [sic],
                        and we are surprised that it should have been committed by our esteemed
                        contemporary of Lexington. The Editor's concern for the comfort of the
                        soldiers, has caused him to forget that justice is due to those who minister
                        to their comfort and relief. The Gazette learned
                        from a gentleman who got his information from a sick Rockbridge soldier,
                        that the surgeons in the Hospital appropriated to their own use the
                        delicacies sent to the soldiers by kind and charitable contributors. This
                        information, thus communicated to the Gazette, is wholly erroneous, as will
                        be seen by reference to the card of the chief surgeon published in this
                        issue, and to which we would call the attention of the Lexington Gazette and Richmond
                        Dispatch, as they are requested to copy it. </p>
                    <p>Since the 20th of July, the number of sick soldiers in the Hospital here has
                        averaged 475, requiring the services of seven Physicians, who have labored
                        faithfully in the discharge of their arduous duties. The excellent lady who
                        is acting as matron of the Hospital is the widow of a gentleman who was one
                        of the most eminent physicians and professors of the University of Virginia.
                        She has charge of all the Hospital stores and the contributions of the
                        charitable, and she distributes them as needed and gives personal attention
                        to the tables of those who are able to go to their meals. The public may
                        rest assured that the delicacies contributed by the charitable are consumed
                        by the soldiers and are not "devoured" by the "hyena" surgeons.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To William Frazier, Esq., of Rockbridge.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir: I take this method of addressing you upon the momentous
                        question--How can this war be brought to a successful and speedy
                        termination? It has assumed such vast proportions, and is waged under such
                        feelings of deadly hate, that all men now agree that it cannot be expected
                        to end till one or both of the parties are exhausted. On our part it is a
                        struggle for national existence--a grand and holy Revolution, like that of
                        our fathers for the maintenance of civil and religious liberty. We have
                        staked our all upon the issue. We must succeed or perish. There is no middle
                        ground we can occupy between complete success and independence on the one
                        hand, or utter, irretrievable, eternal national degradation and ruin on the
                        other. If it takes every man and every dollar in the whole South to maintain
                        our cause, the sacrifice must be made. The only important question therefore
                        is, have we the means of success within our reach, and if so how should they
                        be employed? I affirm that we have those means--more than amply
                        sufficient--of men and money. We have more than a quarter of a million of
                        the best soldiers on the globe now under arms, and led by Generals in whose
                        skill, education and bravery the whole country has unbounded confidence.
                        With such an army properly sustained almost anything is possible of
                        accomplishment.</p>
                    <p>The war will not end until the North is crushed. Even if the people there
                        wished to abandon it, they will not have the power to do it for more than
                        two years. The Executive and the Congress of the United States dare not give
                        up the contest, or they perish. The people cannot
                        reach them at the ballot box, if they would, for more than two years. Then
                        to end the war we must crush the infernal despotism at Washington. That can
                        only be accomplished by destroying their means of raising money, for without money they cannot raise men, and
                        without men they cannot carry on the war. The large cities of the North are
                        the great money centres that must be attacked. Our Government must,
                        therefore, abandon its present defensive policy,
                        and must carry the war into the enemy's country. To do this with the
                        certainty of success, it would seem that we should concentrate all our means
                        and energies for a speedy forward movement. To attempt the defence of a
                        border of 2,000 and a coast of 4,000 miles against the inroads of marauding
                        parties of thieves and pirates, is to fritter away our strength without the
                        accomplishment of any permanent good. We must let the border and the coast,
                        except at a few prominent points, take the chances of pillage and present
                        ruin. All such damages can be reimbursed hereafter. We must concentrate here
                        in Virginia 300,000 men during the fall and winter--furnish them with all
                        that is necessary to the formation of a perfect army. We have the men now in
                        the field, and it is only necessary to assemble them together. Then when
                        early spring opens, let a column of 100,000 men move from Winchester
                        northward to Harrisburg, Pa., throw another column of 100,000 men across the
                        Potomac east of the Blue Ridge to occupy Baltimore, leaving a reserve of
                        100,000 men on the southern shore of the river to menace Washington and
                        defend our own Capitol. The navigation of the Potomac will by that time be
                        cut off, a[n]d the "grand army" will be hemmed in Washington to starve at
                        leisure, or come out of their works into the field where we can always whip
                        them. If they don't come out to fight, leave them in Washington to be looked
                        after by our reserve, and push on the columns from Harrisburg and Baltimore
                        simultaneously upon Philadelphia, thence to New York and Boston. Can 300,000
                        men do all this? Who doubts it? </p>
                    <p>This winter will do more for our success in those large cities than an army
                        could do. Starvation will raise up allies for us there. The war between
                        capital and labour will break out when "bread or blood" is emblazoned, as it
                        will be, on the banners of the street mobs there. The approach of an army
                        from the South will accelerate the disintegration of society in all the
                        doomed cities of the North, and their streets will flow with blood, and
                        their dark places be lighted up with conflagrations before our cannon are
                        placed in battery on their suburbs. The millions of gold in the vaults of
                        the banks and bankers of these great commercial centres are a rich prize for
                        a frantic mob whose wives and children are perishing with wants. Let us then
                        adopt a policy that will let loose this mob--unchain this fierce rabble upon
                        the white-cravatted, black-coated hypocrites and money-changers who have
                        waxed fat upon the spoil of the sunny South through long years of unjust and
                        plundering legislation.</p>
                    <p>It may be objected that invasion is the error our
                        enemies have committed, and we should profit by their example. The cases are
                        different. They have invaded to subjugate and destroy an innocent people.
                        Our enslavement is their object, and to resist our people are all in arms.
                        We should go not to subjugate them, but to deliver ourselves. "Independence
                        and peace" would be our motto as we advanced into their country, and we
                        should not find an entire people armed against us. The despotism at
                        Washington once disarmed of its omnipotent and omnipresent power in the
                        North, public sentiment would find expression there again, and a peace party
                        would spring into existence with sense enough to see that war is their ruin,
                        and courage enough, when supported by our bayonets, to declare for peace. </p>
                    <p>We can accomplish all this if Congress is made up of the right kind of men,
                        to undertake it at once and with an energy worthy of the constituency they
                        will represent. Many of the voters of our District believe that you possess
                        the talents, the industry, the energy and courage to represent us in the
                        next Congress as we should be represented. That you comprehend the issues at
                        stake, and have the nerve to meet them we feel confident. As one of the
                        citizens of the District deeply interested in the success of our great
                        cause, and speaking what I know to be the sentiments of many others, I
                        believe a majority, I call upon you to become a candidate for Congress at
                        the ensuing election upon what I know to be the ground you and every other
                        true man now occupies--a vigorous prosecution of the war into the enemy's
                        country for the sake of peace, till they become as sick of fighting as they
                        did on the day of</p>
