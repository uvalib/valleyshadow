<b>Another Victory</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Report of a battle in western Virginia involving the 52nd Regiment, which
                    claims as members several Augusta County companies. The battle, a Confederate
                    victory according to the Spectator, will certainly be misreported by the
                    Northern press, says the Spectator.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. R.D. Lilley,   Barkins,   Welch)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have the satisfaction to announce a most brilliant victory gained by our
                        troops upon the Alleghany Mountain on Friday last.</p>
                    <p>For several days before the fight, parties of our men had been actively
                        scouting the road down to Greenbrier River. The first party under Captain
                        Watkins of the 52d Va. Regiment pursued a party of the Yankees far enough to
                        ascertain that they made most excellent time when turned toward their own
                        camp on Cheat. The next party under Captain Dabney, also of the 52d
                        Regiment, overhauled a party of the enemy and routed them--killing one,
                        wounding one, and taking two prisoners. The next party under Major Ross,
                        also of the 52d Regiment, fell in with a number of the enemy and killed some
                        fifteen or twenty of them. In all these affairs none of our men were hurt.</p>
                    <p>On Friday morning, the enemy having collected from Cheat mountain and beyond
                        some four or five thousand men attempted to surprise and capture the
                        position on the Alleghany mountain held by some fifteen hundred of our men
                        under command of Col. Edward Johnson of the 12th Georgia Regiment. In this
                        attempt, they found that they had emphatically "waked up the wrong
                        passenger." They drove in our pickets about four o'clock in the morning, and
                        made an attack upon both flanks of our position.</p>
                    <p>Having come so far for a fight, it is but just to say that they fought well
                        and obstinately; but after a sharp and severe conflict of about seven hours
                        they were driven back and completely routed.</p>
                    <p>We have not, as yet, been able to gather the details of the battle, but
                        enough is known to satisfy us that the fight was a gallant one, and well
                        sustained, and that the victory was complete.</p>
                    <p>No accurate list of the casualties attending this victory has been received
                        as yet. Our loss in killed and wounded is reported at about eighty of whom
                        near twenty were killed. Among the killed and wounded we have to mourn some
                        gallant officers--Captains Anderson and Mildraugh, and Lieutenants Thompson
                        and Moore.</p>
                    <p>The loss of the enemy was very heavy, and they left some of their killed and
                        wounded upon the field.</p>
                    <p>We have the satisfaction to announce to those having friends in the 52d
                        Regiment that, altho' bearing their part in the engagement, and behaving
                        with calm courage and spirit, not one officer or man belonging to it was
                        injured, except two members of Capt. John D. Lilley's Company, Barkins and
                        Welch, who were wounded in the legs in the picket fight which preceded the
                        battle.</p>
                    <p>We have many rumors of feats of individual gallantry and daring, which it
                        would perhaps be premature to publish; but we cannot be mistaken in saying
                        that with one accord it is agreed that Col. Johnson bore himself throughout
                        with distinguished gallantry--leading on his men in the thick of the fight
                        with a disregard of personal danger, which warmed the hearts and nerved the
                        arms of all his men.</p>
                    <p>As we give the Federals credit for consistency in misrepresentation, we expect to see in a short time, a dispatch
                        of the following character published in the Northern papers: </p>
                    <p>"The War Department at Washington has received a despatch stating that on
                        Friday, the 13th inst., the Federals on Cheat Mountain made a
                        "reconnoissance [sic] in force," took the "rebels" on the top of the
                        Alleghany mountain by surprise, killed a great many of them, with but slight
                        loss to the "loyal" force, and, having accomplished the object of the
                        reconnoisance [sic], retired in good order to their camp on Cheat
                    Mountain."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We learn from Clarke County Conservator that in
                        the counties of Clarke, Frederick, Jefferson, Berkeley; Morgan, Hampshire,
                        Shenandoah, Page, Warren, Rockingham, Augusta and Loudoun, there were
                        published before the war, twenty-three
                        newspapers. Now we know of but seven that are
                        published in these counties, only three of which are published regularly
                        every week, and all, with one exception, considerably reduced in dimensions.
                        Those entirely discontinued, are the Berryville Journal, Charlestown Spirit of Jefferson,
                        and Independent Democrat, Shepherdstown Register, Martinsburg American, Berkeley Springs Constitution,
                        Romney Intelligencer and Argus, Piedmont Independent,
                        Woodstock  Tenth Legion , Luray Review, Front Royal Gazette, Harrisonburg Citizen, Valley Democrat, Staunton Vindicator and Leesburg Mirror. The
                        balance are published occasionally. Though the times thus ruin the Press of
                        the State, and though Editors are compelled to pay three and four times as
                        much as they need to do for articles necessary to
                        publish a newspaper, yet there are some few
                        inconsiderate and unreasonable persons who complain of those who keep their
                        papers in existence by the publication of half-sheets. </p>
