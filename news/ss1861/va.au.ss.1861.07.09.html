<b>Brilliant Victory--Gallantry of the Augusta Volunteers</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises the 5th Virginia Regiment, composed of Augusta volunteers, for a
                    victory against a superior force of Union troops.<br>(Names in announcement: Col.  Harper, Lieut. Col. William Harman,  William Baylor,  George Roupe, Capt.  Doyle,  Jack Doyle,  D.A. Kennedy,  Phillip Maphis,  James Brooke,  Charley Turner)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is with very great pleasure that we announce a glorious victory achieved
                        chiefly by the heroic bravery of the Augusta boys. On Tuesday morning last,
                        a portion of the 5th Virginia Regiment, under the command of Col. Harper,
                        with the Artillery Company of Capt. Pendleton of Rockbridge and a company
                        (Continental Morgan Guard) from Winchester, numbering in all only 880 men,
                        met the enemy, supposed to be about 9000, six miles from Martinsberg in
                        Berkely county,--repulsed them three times, held
                        them in check for two hours, killed between 150 and 200 of the enemy,
                        wounded many more, and captured 54 prisoners. The loss on our side was only
                        three killed, and 8 or 9 wounded. As our brave and gallant little force was
                        so small as to be in danger of being flanked by the enemy, as they had such
                        a very large force, our men retreated slowly, firing with deadly effect all
                        the time. We have always felt satisfied that the Augusta boys would show, if
                        an opportunity presented, that they were as brave as the bravest. We have
                        not been disappointed--they have covered themselves with glory. Though
                        encountering an overwhelming force, they were unawed, and fought with the
                        calmness of veterans and the bravery of heroes. Our field officers, Col.
                        Kenton Harper, Lieut. Col. Wm. H. Harman and Maj. Wm. S. H. Baylor were all
                        in this action, and all behaved with remarkable coolness and bravery. If
                        there be any fault at all with our officers or men it consists in want of a
                        sufficient degree of that "rascally virtue--prudence," for we understood
                        that Col. Jackson, who witnessed the heroic conduct of our men, remarked
                        that it was with the greatest difficulty that they could be made to obey the
                        most peremptory order to retreat. We lost but three men in this action--Geo.
                        Rupe, of this county, a member of Capt. Doyle's company, and two--Farrish
                        and Snapp--of the Winchester "Continental Morgan Guard." </p>
                    <p>Among the wounded, there were three from this town--Jack Doyle, a son of
                        Capt. Doyle, D.A. Kennedy and Philip Maphis. Jack Doyle was wounded in the
                        neck by a fragment of an exploded shell. D.A. Kennedy was shot in the
                        breast, and Philip Maphis in the arm and side.</p>
                    <p>None of these are seriously wounded and will soon recover.</p>
                    <p>Geo. Rupe was shot in the thigh and bled to death.</p>
                    <p>Jas. Brooke, of this place, made a very narrow escape. He was at a fence
                        firing away at the enemy, when a cannon ball took off two top rails. He
                        stooped a little lower and continued to return the compliment with his
                        minnie.</p>
                    <p>Little Charley Turner, a boy about 15 years of age, insisted so strongly on
                        going with the Augusta Guards that his father finally yielded to his
                        importunities and allowed him to go. The result shows that little Charley
                        went to perform service, for he made one of the enemy bite the dust.</p>
                    <p>Our forces fell back and took position two miles from Martinsburg on the road
                        to Winchester where they have been joined by all of Gen. Johnson's
                    force.</p>

                    <p>Camp at Buckleysville</p>
                    <p>6 miles South of Martinsburg</p>
                    <p>July 4th, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Friend Mauzy:</p>
                    <p>Having a leisure moment this morning, I thought I would give you a short
                        sketch of our engagement with the enemy on Tuesday last, six miles below
                        Martinsburg. Our Regiment, the 5th, marched from our old encampment (Camp
                        Stephens) at 8 o'clock on Tuesday morning, and had advanced about 2 1/2
                        miles when the advance guard, consisting of the West Augusta Guard, Capt.
                        Waters and the Rockbridge Rifles, Capt. Letcher, came in sight of the enemy
                        only a few hundred yards from, and advancing towards us. Our advance
                        companies were under charge of Col. Baylor, who immediately deployed the
                        West Augusta Guard on the right of the main road, who were the first to open
                        fire on the enemy. Capt. Letcher's Company was deployed in the rear of the
                        West Augusta Guard. Our fire was a very hot one, and the enemy's deploying
                        column was forced to fall back to the main body. We then advanced upon them
                        from some distance--Col. Baylor in the meantime had thrown Capt. Letcher's
                        Company on the right of us, who immediately took a position behind a fence
                        parallel to and one field distant from the main road, when the enemy made
                        another advance, but fell fast from the well-aimed guns of our Companies.
                        The other Companies were now thrown into fine attacking positions, but I was
                        so busy that I am unable to give you a description of their position or
                        their effect. Our men were fighting under a heavy fire all the time, and it
                        is wonderfully remarkable that our loss was not much greater, only two
                        killed and three or four missing. The balls were whistling all around us,
                        and shells bursting over our heads all the time. We had three of the West
                        Augusta Guard slightly wounded--Jack Doyle, Kennedy and Maphis--who were
                        sent to Winchester. The boys fought like Trojans, and never fell back till
                        commanded two or three times to do so. Much of our efficiency id due to Col.
                        Baylor, under whose immediate command we (the W. A. Guard) were. He was all
                        the time in the thickest of the fight, encouraging and commanding the
                        deploying companies. We were engaged nearly two hours, but really we had no
                        idea it was more than 80 minutes. Cols. Harper and Harman, who were
                        directing the other Companies, are reported to have conducted themselves
                        very coolly and bravely. The loss of the enemy is reported to be at least
                        100, besides upwards of 50 prisoners we took from them. We expect a big
                        fight to-day at Martinsburg. I have not time to write more. All is
                        excitement and confusion in Camp, and all are eager for another fight, which
                        we will be into in a few hours I suppose.</p>
                    <p>Truly yours,</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Camp Garnett, July 2, 1861</p>
                    <p>Dear Major:--I suppose you have heard ere this time that my command was sent
                        to this point. We have in this regiment about eight hundred men--have
                        fortified ourselves in the mountain, and are preparing to meet the enemy,
                        who are reported to be advancing in numbers of from three to five thousand.
                        Our men are eager for the fight. I do believe that they will fight when the
                        enemy comes. Three hundred of us went out as far as Buchanan last week (a
                        distance of 24 miles) to procure provisions. We succeeded in loading about
                        twenty wagons with such articles as we needed. Among other things, we found
                        in the town of Buchanan about 2700 lbs. of mess pork, and other articles
                        left there by the Federal forces, which we brought away with us, giving
                        Uncle Abe credit for this and the other things taken on the Phillipa
                        account. While on this trip our scouts (the Churchville Cavalry) were fired
                        at by different parties in ambush (one numbering twice the number of our
                        scouts.) On one occasion one of our horses was wounded. No men killed on
                        either side--the enemy escaping by being in a thick wood in a position
                        entirely unapproachable by Cavalry, particularly on a dark night. Our men
                        all conduct themselves like gentlemen--men who are fighting for fighting for
                        principles dearer than life itself. The Augusta boys under my change, (Capt.
                        Lilly's and Capt. Sterrett's companies) without a single exception, have
                        endeared themselves to the officers and men of this command. Capt. Lilly is
                        one of the most willing and efficient officers in the command. Capt.
                        Sterrett's company has been badly misrepresented to your county. I never saw
                        men more willing to obey commands and occupy posts of danger than they. But
                        why particularize [illegible] I might name Capt. Curry, Moorman, Hull,
                        Adjuvant Hoover, and a host of others, both officers and privates, but
                        suffice it to say that the regiment for the time it has been in service, is
                        all that could be desired and more than could be reasonably expected, and is
                        well worthy's better command than your humble servant. We are greatly in
                        need of tents, Hospital Stores, (bandages and like articles,) shoes,
                        &amp; c. Mrs. Harman and the other ladies of Staunton, will please
                        accept the thanks of this command for their promptness in making and
                        forwarding to us about five hundred pairs of pantaloons. The ladies of Old
                        Augusta are fast winning imperishable laurels, and they well deserve to be
                        the daughters, wives and sisters of brave men from that county who are now
                        in the field to fight, and die, if needs be, in this great struggle for
                        liberty.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>J.M. Heck</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Col. Commanding.</p>
                    <p>P.S.--Gen. Garnett had the confidence of everybody. He thinks and acts with
                        promptness and decision, and withal is prudent. He is the very man for the
                        Northwest, or I am very much mistaken.</p>
