                    <p>We know that the patriotic citizens of this good old county who have already
                        done so much for the defense of the honor and rights of the South will not
                        utter a murmur of complaint when the tax gatherer calls for their proportion
                        of contributions to the defense of the South. They feel, as is well
                        expressed by the Richmond Enquirer that all we have, and all that we value,
                        and all that is dear to us, is at stake.</p>
                    <p>A people who number twenty millions have blown the war bugle, and have
                        already resolved to devote an army of half a million men and a treasure of
                        five hundred millions of dollars to our destruction. We have called upon
                        Heaven and drawn the sword, and vowed to defeat them or die. It is a vow and
                        resolution that ennoble out Confederacy, and will be recorded on one of the
                        most glowing of historic pages. It is an ennobling vow, only because it is
                        not an idle one. We have resolved to do and suffer whatever may be necessary
                        to win our success. Let this spirit, then, animate our people everywhere,
                        and in every duty. Let it not only animate our heroic soldiers--as it did on
                        the glorious fields of Bull Run, let it not only cause our planters and
                        property holders to empty their barns, and to hold their wagons and their
                        laborers at the call of our generals--as did the patriotic populations
                        around Manassas: let it not only inspire out ladies to those deeds of mercy
                        and gentleness, which are making them the praise of every camp and the
                        angels of every hospital; but there are other occasions for its exercise:
                            <emph rend="italic">Let there be no murmuring when the government asks
                            for money!</emph> Let there be no repining when the tax gatherer comes.
                        In whatever form he may appear, welcome him as one sent to receive the
                        contributions of a patriotic people to the cause of liberty and
                        independence! Contributions necessary to purchase food for the brave
                        soldiers who are fighting for us; clothing to protect them from the weather;
                        guns and weapons and munitions of war, to enable them to fight and to meet
                        our foes on equal terms. If there be a man who wants these, our noble
                        brethren and the heroes of whom we are all so proud half-starved or
                        ill-clad; or wishes to press them half-armed against the foes, let such a
                        man confess himself destitute of all patriotism and possessed of a soul as
                        mean as a miser's and as black as a fratricide's; and then let him as would
                        benefit such a character, <emph rend="italic">murmur against his war
                        taxes.</emph> But let all others prepare to bear with cheerfulness the
                        pecuniary burdens which war must inevitably impose, and to bear them in
                        whatever form the wisdom of Congress may decide that is best to take them."

                    <p>Mr. E. O. Randolph killed his wife at Middlebrook in this county on Saturday
                        night last by stabbing her in the abdomen and arm. She died on Sunday
                        morning. E.O. Randolph is the same person who was tried here some time since
                        as a spy, who a few weeks since stabbed Dr. McCheaney, and who accidently
                        shot Mr. Jacob Prubeck last week. He is either very unfortunate or a very
                        bad man.</p>

                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>With the Richmond <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph> we earnestly conjure
                        all who are not in active military service to prepare for the winter
                        campaign. God has blessed every State of the Confederacy with such abundant
                        crops that we can easily feed an army of five millions of men. All of our
                        energies must now be directed to providing sufficient, warm and comfortable
                        clothing for our soldiers. The soldier is subject to so much exposure that
                        he will need his winter clothing by the first or middle of October.
                        Blankets, comforts, flannel shirts, thick strong shoes and woolen socks,
                        overcoats, warm well-lined pantaloons, padded coats, gloves, worsted
                        protectors for the chest, and numberless other articles, will be needed in
                        immense quantities by our soldiers. Let every hand be busy and let every
                        private purse be open for the preparation and purchase of these and other
                        indispensable articles. The South is full of the raw material from which
                        these things may be fabricated. They should be made at every farm house in
                        the South. There are no fingers too delicate for this work, nor too coarse
                        and ignorant to be usefully employed. </p>
                    <p>If there are any so parsimonious as to hesitate about contributing to this
                        indispensable work, we must stimulate them to liberality by a simple
                        suggestion. <emph rend="italic"> The property of every citizen of the
                            Confederacy, who is not a traitor of the Carlile type, has been
                            confiscated by a recent act of the Yankee Congress.</emph> If we are
                        conquered, we are beggared. Lincoln's ruffians will seize every acre of our
                        lands and variety of personality which we possess. If we do not triumph we
                        lose all; whilst on the other hand success in five years will make us the
                        most prosperous and affluent people of modern times. </p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Liberality to our soldiery has become a great necessity
                            to every property holder in the Confederate States.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>Let no sane man think of money-making until every battlefield is whitened
                        with the bones of our sensual, brutal and depraved invaders. Every thought
                        about gain and self must now yield to the wants of our brave soldiery. If,
                        through our neglect and indifference, our armies become disorganized, then
                        will land, slaves, mules, horses, cattle bonds and stocks become worthless,
                        except to the rapacious Yankee invaders.</p>
                    <p>Every feeling of patriotism and every selfish consideration require us to
                        devote money, labor, indeed, everything, to the comfort of our soldiers.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>There are now about 500 sick soldiers in Staunton. They are generally from
                        Virginia, Tennessee and Georgia. Staunton is now the great Hospital for the
                        Western Army. The diseases are pneumonia, measels (sic), mumps, typhoid
                        fever and dysentery. Every possible attention is shown to the afflicted. The
                        ladies of the town (God bless them!) minister tenderly to their wants as far
                        as possible. With lavish liberality, they have emptied their larders, their
                        store rooms and their purses, to add to their comfort. But their supplies
                        are well nigh exhausted, and it would be well if their sisters of the South
                        would contribute their mites to the relief of the suffering soldiers. There
                        is no point West of Staunton where the sick can be properly cared for. Hence
                        all who are in a condition to be moved are sent to Staunton, and the number
                        of patients is rapidly augmenting. A dozen nurses could find ample and
                        useful employment in the Hospital, and jellies and other little luxuries for
                        the sick would be very acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Staunton with a population of a little over 3,000 has 335 men in the
                        field--mainly in the gallant "Stone-wall Brigade." There are few able bodied
                        men left to nurse the sick.</p>
                    <p>Augusta county, too, has had a heavy burden to bear, but she bears it out
                        cheerfully. She has about 2,230 men in the military service. One half of her
                        white agricultural labour is withdrawn from its ordinary pursuits. She has
                        also been obliged to supply a large proportion of the animal labor used in
                        the transportation of provisions and munitions to the western camps. Almost
                        every farmer has been required to surrender one or more wagons and teams,
                        and there is reason to fear that the withdrawal of so much labor, both human
                        and animal, may seriously affect the next year's crop. But all are in good
                        spirits and unalterably fixed in the determination to resist to the last
                        Yankee aggression, and never again to be in political fellowship with those
                        who have shown themselves willing to surrender the writ of <emph

                        liberty, into the hands of an arbitrary despot.--<emph rend="italic">Rich.

                <summary>Staunton has become the site of the hospital for sick soldiers from the
                    Western Army. There is no point west of Staunton where the sick can be
                    adequately cared for. Staunton and Augusta County has had a heavy burden to
                    bear, with over one-half of the county's white agricultural laborers withdrawn
                    from their normal work. About 2,230 men from the county are in the military.</summary>
