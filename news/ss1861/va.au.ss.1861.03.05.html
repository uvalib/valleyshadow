<b>Speeches of Col. Baylor</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In praise of unionism, the article calls readers' attention to the speech
                    of Col. Baylor at the Convention, in which he attacked the "fiery dragon of
                    secession."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We refer our readers to the proceedings of the Convention on Thursday and
                        Friday for the speeches made in that body by Col. Geo. Baylor. It will be
                        seen that he is "all right," and that he attacks
                        the fiery dragon of secession in such gallant style as should entitle him to
                        be canonized as "St. George, the slayer of the fiery dragon."--His speeches
                        justify the good opinion entertained of him as a sound and reliable Union
                        man. Desiring the Union sentiment of the Democracy of this county to have a
                        representative in the Convention, and knowing Col. Baylor to be a good Union
                        man, who was opposed to secession in theory as well as practice, we asked
                        him to become a candidate, and rejoiced at his triumphant election, and we
                        now rejoice that he has acquitted himself so handsomely in the Convention.
                        Those of his party who are true to the principles which they advocated in
                        the Presidential canvass, will cordially approve of the speeches of Col.
                        Baylor. Those who were governed by what they deemed policy and not
                        principle--who supported Douglas because they thought he was the stronger
                        wing of the party--who sought the majority and not principle--and who are
                        now co-operating with the secessionists-- may not endorse the position of
                        Col. Baylor, but the masses of that party who are governed by principles and
                        who supported Douglas because they endorsed his principles, will cordially
                        endorse the speeches of Col. Baylor. </p>

<b>Hunter and Mason</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that Hunter and Mason, Virginia's senators, rejected the settlement
                    proposed by the Peace Conference. The article argues that the senators
                    overlooked the desires of the state of Virginia and are co-operating to achieve
                    disunion.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The opposition of Hunter and Mason in the U. S. Senate to the Peace
                        Conference resolutions, will meet with the indignation of three-fourths of
                        the people of this State. The people will pronounce the curse anathema maranatha against them. The secessionists
                        and the worst class of Black Republicans harmoniously co-operated to
                        frustrate all efforts at settlement. Mason and Hunter paid no respect to the
                        voice of Virginia as recently expressed in thunder- tones at the polls. In
                        the language of the "Baltimore American," we ask, "what have Messrs. Mason
                        and Hunter to say in their own defence when they assume an attitude in
                        direct hostility to all the conservative men in their State?--They oppose
                        the Peace Conference resolution when it is perfectly well understood that
                        there is no remaining possibility of settlement by the present Congress, if
                        they are rejected. Moreover, they are not required to commit themselves.
                        Their opposition was a factious opposition, based upon grounds so frivolous,
                        in comparison with the momentous issues involved, that we can only wonder
                        that gentlemen of their pretensions were not ashamed to offer it." </p>
