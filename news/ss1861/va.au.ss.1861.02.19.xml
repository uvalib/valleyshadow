                <summary>Mr. Harris advocates staying in the Union, despite the injuries that the
                    South has received. He believes that a war would be fatal and that for a redress
                    of grievances the South should seek a diplomatic solution with those sections of
                    the North that have abused their rights. He argues that existing as separate and
                    hostile nations would cause more problems than already exist and war would not
                    permanently be averted. He also believes that war would disproportionately
                    damage the Border States.</summary>

                <summary>Letter to the Editor praises Augusta County for her dedication to the Union
                    as evinced by her selection of Unionists for the convention by a vast majority.
                    The writer also praises Hugh Sheffey's selflessness in dropping out of the
                    election for fear of splitting the Union ticket.</summary>

                <summary>Rejects the contention that all Union men are Black Republicans. The
                    article states that secessionists make this slanderous charge in order to
                    increase the resolve of Black Republicans, who may be apt to think they have
                    allies in the South. The Republicans thus may be less willing to compromise with
                    the South.</summary>

                    recognizes the Southern Unionists as a group that can help avert war and be a
                    conduit for compromise.</summary>

                    coerce seceding states to remain in the Union. He argues that a civil war is a
                    terrible calamity and that "disunion is a smaller evil" than war.</summary>

                    have spoken in favor of the Union, the few secessionists who were elected are
                    scrambling for offices at the Convention and have thus stricken such divisive
                    language from their vocabulary.</summary>
