                <excerpt>Now it appears to me this exactly describes the case of the Aldermen and
                    Common Councilmen of Staunton, they are so completely absorbed, and so intensely
                    occupied in the important work of digging deep cisterns in high places, and
                    building magnificent halls in low places that they can give no attention to such
                    common and every day concerns as pavements and sidewalks.</excerpt>
