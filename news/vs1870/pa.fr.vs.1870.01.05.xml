                <transcript>
                    <p>We learn, by a telegram from Washington, that the House Reconstruction
                        Committee has come to the conclusion that the Virginia Legislature had no
                        authority to proceed to the election of Senators until its members had taken
                        the test oath. Of course this conclusion is simply reached, and will be
                        voted on, to please the dissatisfied Radicals who were beaten in the
                        election in Virginia. Congress will go to the extreme of regarding that
                        election as a nullity. We should not be surprised if they would, after
                            <unclear>mature</unclear> deliberation, be inclined to declare that
                        Walker was not elected Governor and that Wells was the successful candidate.
                        After what we have seen already, we are prepared for anything.</p>
                    <p>The telegram states further that it is believed that Congress will sustain
                        this view of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoar gave his opinion as Attorney General that the taking of the test
                        oath was not necessary. General Grant agreed with him in that opinion and
                        sanctioned the idea of electing United States Senators before knocking at
                        the door of Congress. After all this, could there be an exhibition of worse
                        faith on the part of the Radicals than to "go back" on these opinions, and
                        keep Virginia in a condition of military subjection and the whole country in
                        a state of agitation, for the attainment of base political ends?</p>
                    <p>We were never so struck with the degradation of a sovereign State as we were
                        a few days ago. A fellow stole a horse in this county and was traced in
                        Virginia, where the horse was recovered, and the thief arrested and lodged
                        in jail. The District Attorney of this County procured a requisition from
                        Governor Geary on the Governor of Virginia for the delivery of the offender.
                        We saw the warrant of Gilbert C. Walker, issued in response to this
                        requisition and authorizing the delivery of the horse-thief to the agent
                        appointed to receive him, and this warrant, after having been signed by the
                        Governor, was marked "approved" and signed to the "Brevet Brigadier General,
                        commanding the First Military District of Virginia." And this in a Republic.
                        The Governor of the "Mother of Presidents" is actually so powerless and so
                        completely shorn of the dignity of his office, that he is obliged to submit
                        such an official document to a military commander before it is of any
                        binding authority within the State limits. And this almost five years after
                        the "war for the suppression of the rebellion closed!"</p>
                    <p>The people must get wakened up to the point of saying to our military Chief
                        Magistrate, and our despotic Congressional Directory, that there must be an
                        acknowledgment of "the rights, dignity, and equality of the States," or
                        another war. If they do not, encroachment will follow encroachment, acts of
                        tyranny and usurpation will follow each other in rapid succession, until all
                        State rights will be entirely swept away or ignored, and the liberty of the
                        citizen be made to depend upon the will of a man, whose arbitrary
                        disposition inclines and whose education leads him to regard and trust other
                        men as mere machines, fit only to work out his purposes. Oh, for a general
                        awakening to a proper appreciation of the sacredness of personal liberty and
                        the rights of the States before it is forever too late! Such legislation as
                        that which characterized the last Congress, and which bids fair to be
                        followed by the present Congress, is enough to damn any country, and if the
                        people fail to rebuke it, it will be no wonder if an overruling Providence
                        shall see fit to hand this nation over to the horrors of anarchy and another
                        civil war, or to the dominion of a despot who will ride rough-shod over the
                        liberties of the people.</p>

                <summary>Looks with alarm to Radical policies concerning Virginia's readmission.
                    Gives the example of an order signed by a Virginia governor having to be
                    approved by a general before becoming effective. Believes such measures signal a
                    real threat to liberty and states rights and pleads with the people to recognize
                    this and protest against it.</summary>
