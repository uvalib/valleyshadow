<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes with disgust how Cessna, one of only 24 men to do so, voted to admit
                    a man to Congress who apparently had committed a crime. Cites this act as
                    typical of Cessna, who has a record of ruling in favor of all Republicans.
                    Editor is glad Cessna was in the minority on this one.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>JOHN CESSNA was one of the twenty-four who voted to admit the carpet-bagger,
                        cadetship-broker, Whittemore, to a seat in the House of Representatives.
                        This fellow is confessedly guilty of a crime which would consign him to the
                        Penitentiary, if he were prosecuted for it. The House refused very properly
                        to admit him to a seat.</p>
                    <p>Our able contemporary, the Harrisburg Morning
                        Patriot, regards the action of the House as a gross outrage upon the
                        right of representation, but we cannot look at it in that light. It looks to
                        us as though the constitutional clause, giving each House the right to judge
                        of the qualifications of its members, covers this case. Our forefathers,
                        doubtless, would have hedged that power about with limitations, if they had
                        foreseen or even suspected the degeneration of these times. But they did
                        not. They left it very broad, and while we believe that in the majority of
                        cases it has worked to the detriment of the people, in this particular case,
                        we think it has operated for their benefit.</p>
                    <p>The re-election of this man Whittemore by an ignorant negro population, ought
                        to fill the people of this Union with disgust at this infamous
                        reconstruction policy. The disfranchisement of the intelligent men of the
                        South has rendered it possible for such scalawags to be elected to prominent
                        positions. And when elected, they can not represent the sentiment of the
                        majority of the people of their districts. Is it not
                            time for amnesty--an amnesty so broad and sweeping as to remove
                            political disabilities from every man, in every State of the Union, who
                            engaged in the rebellion? The article which we print in another
                        column from the Philadelphia Inquirer reflects
                        immense credit upon that paper.</p>
                    <p>Then, too, the vote which Cessna cast on the question of Whittemore's
                        admission ought to fill the people of the Sixteenth Congressional District
                        with disgust at their representative. He labored for months to put out that
                        upright gentleman Henry D. Foster and put into his place the "humbuggedest"
                        Covode, and he succeeded in the effort. He voted with the extremists of his
                        party on the contested election cases from Louisiana--giving seats to men
                        who had been defeated by majorities running into the thousands. But the act
                        evincing the most reckless disregard of common decency was the vote to which
                        we have referred, by which he sought to admit a man to a seat who would be
                        serving a term in a penitentiary cell, if the leaders of this "party of
                        great moral ideas" had prosecuted him as he deserved to be.</p>
                    <p>But there were only twenty-three men in the House as indifferent to their own
                        reputation and the National honor as Cessna was, and for this there is some
                        cause for thanks.</p>

                    have too many privileges. As reckless and devilish a scapegrace as this man was

<b>Chambersburg Academy Exhibition</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
