                    <p>Radical extravagance is proverbial. A comparison of the expenditures of the
                        National Government under Radical Administrations with those under the old
                        Democratic administrations, is absolutely frightful. The people have been
                        taxed to an almost intolerable degree to raise money to satisfy the greed of
                        Radical officials. In numberless ways, the people's money has been
                        squandered. This has been charged, time and again, by Democratic journals,
                        but the answer has always been that these charges originated in partisan
                        malignity.</p>
                    <p>What is true of the National Government has been equally true of the State
                        Government. The Legislature of our own State for the last ten years have not
                        hesitated to spend the people's money in the most prodigal manner. They have
                        increased the burden of State taxation without diminishing the State debt.
                        This has been done too, under lofty pretences of liquidating the
                        indebtedness of the Common wealth.</p>
                    <p>Democratic journals have attempted to enlighten the people in relation to
                        this also, but their warnings and utterances have been unheeded. Now,
                        however, a little of the truth is being developed. An acknowledgment of a
                        portion of this extravagance has been written by a Radical pen, and, of
                        course the writer must be believed.</p>
                    <p>Hon. James L. Graham,, State Senator from Allegheny County, has lately been
                        bitterly assailed at home. His record has been vehemently attacked with the
                        evident purpose to defeat him in the Radical convention. Mr. Graham has
                        written an able letter explanatory of his record, in which we find the
                        following remarkable admission: "Again, when the proposition to pay
                        twenty-seven unnecessary officers, employed without authority of law, was
                        before the Senate in the Appropriation bill, but one Republican Senator
                        stood with me to the last and voted against it, although we were surrounded
                        and importuned by Senators and offices to vote for it, until refusal to do
                        so required the highest type of moral courage." Here is a Radical Senator
                        who deliberately admits that the Radical majority in the Senate of this
                        State voted away the people's money <emph rend="italic">to pay twenty-seven
                            unnecessary officers</emph>. This was done simply to accommodate
                        politicians who insisted on having some particular friends "taken care of"
                        at the public expense.</p>
                    <p>And he not only says that these officers were "unnecessary," but that they
                        were "employed without authority of law." Was there ever an admission more
                        damaging to any party? So determined were the majority to thus swindle the
                        people, so heavy was the pressure brought upon this Senator by the
                        representatives of the "party of great moral ideas," that he declares "it
                        required the highest type of moral courage" to refuse to accede to their
                        wishes. Surely after this the Radical party needs no arraignment at the
                        hands of the Democracy. A Radical Senator, who writes that which he knows,
                        has laid bare this iniquity, and there is no room for a denial. Will not the
                        people interest themselves in these matters which concern them so
                        materially? Are they willing to submit to taxation year after year for the
                        purpose of fattening hungry office-seekers and office holders who are ever
                        ready to fill their own pockets out of the public crib, all the while
                        consoling themselves with the thought that Pennsylvania is a rich
                        Commonwealth and that her people can stand a large amount of stealing? If
                        they are tired of this system of wholesale plunder, let them turn their
                        backs on the Radical party, and aid us in electing men who will be true to
                        their constituents, and rigidly honest in the appropriation of the public
                        monies.</p>

                    corruption. This time quotes from a Republican senator disgusted at his fellow
                    Republicans for sustaining unnecessary officers on public money. Asks the people
                    how long they will submit to such theft and fraud.</summary>

                        $2000.</p>
                    <p>We have not yet heard whether these awards are satisfactory to the land
                        owners or not. We presume it likely that some of them will consider these
                        amounts inadequate and take out appeals. If so, the damages will have to be
                        settled by jury trials.</p>

                <summary>The paper reports that a large number of citizens support the editors'
                    suggestion for establishment of an omnibus line to Wilson College. Most citizens
                    believe the cost should be less, however. The paper supports lower prices, but
                    argues that it will depend upon the number of students using the omnibus.</summary>

                    <p>A good deal of strategy was <sic>practised</sic> by our Radical friends in
                        relation to their delegate elections. By dint of persuasion, eloquent and
                        monetary, they succeeded in keeping the negroes from putting in an
                        appearance at their meetings. We are informed that it was a little difficult
                        to effect this arrangement. Several of the "cullud gemmen" felt like
                        insisting upon their rights, but the manipulators swore it would not do and
                        the negroes were obliged to take back seats. They are, therefore, not
                        represented in the Convention. The white Radicals will form a ticket and
                        drive the blacks to its support like so many dumb cattle. They will vote
                        them in scores, the swearing being done by the wholesale.</p>
                    <p>We take it for granted that as the negroes agreed not to attend the delegate
                        meetings, they do not intend to insist on having any of their color
                        nominated for office at this time. This is, doubtless, with the
                        understanding that if the Radical party is successful in carrying the County
                        this Fall, the negroes are to have their share of the offices at the next
                        election. The Radical leaders will make all sorts of promises to insure
                        their success. They are in a terrible fright at the daily accessions to the
                        Democracy on account of the fanaticism about the negro, and they feared the
                        effect of intimate association with the blacks at the coming election. They
                        have, on this account, shrewdly made a bargain with the negroes to keep
                        shady, to do nothing but vote, and look forward to a better time in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>But this dodge will not avail them, or prevent an overwhelming defeat. The
                        white people are thoroughly awake, and intend to elect the whole Democratic
                        ticket.</p>

                    in the back of their conventions, speculates this was done on the assumption
                    that blacks were promised offices in the next election if Republicans won this
                    one. Says this will not happen because Democrats will win.</summary>
