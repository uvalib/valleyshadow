<b>Opposition to the Negro Senator</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Tries to show Republican hypocrisy by pointing out how some Republicans,
                    though doesn't name them, are trying to keep Revels from taking his seat because
                    he hasn't technically been a citizen for nine years. Charges that Republicans,
                    when faced with the consequences of their policies, don't follow through with
                    them.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Constitution of the United States provides as one of the qualifications
                        of a United States Senator, that he shall have been nine years a citizen of
                        the United States. Some of the Radical Senators, terrified at the idea of
                        admitting a full-blooded negro to a seat in the Senate, have raised the
                        point that Revels, the negro elected from Mississippi, has not been a
                        citizen of the United States for the period of nine years. They quote the
                        Dred Scott decision against him, and say that the negro has only been
                        clothed with citizenship since the termination of the war. They do not
                        hesitate to act contrary to their own teachings for the last ten years, when
                        by doing so, they can accomplish their purpose. All over the land, they
                        denounced the Dred Scott decision as not binding upon the people, and now
                        when they are pushed into a corner, they attempt to use it against the race
                        whose particular champions they have always claimed to be.</p>
                    <p>Those of the colored people who have sufficient intelligence to see a point,
                        will see in this action, how hollow have been the pretensions of the Radical
                        leaders. Whilst they could gain power by agitating the negro question, and
                        descanting eloquently upon his right to equality before the law, they did
                        not scruple to do it. But when they are confronted with the practical
                        consequences to which their doctrines have led, they try to crawl out of the
                        difficulty by changing front, and denying to the negro the very right which
                        they had so ostentatiously claimed for him. Let them stand up to their
                        doctrine and have the manliness to carry it out to its logical conclusion.
                        If the negro has the right to vote, the right to hold office follows as a
                        matter of course. Let Revels have his seat, and let this accursed negro
                        equality doctrine be pushed to the utmost extremity as soon as possible.</p>
