<b>The Income Tax</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports with outrage the recent defeat of another effort to abolish the
                    income tax. Blames carpet-baggers and hopes the Republicans who want the tax
                    repealed now realize the mistake of putting carpet-baggers in place. Hopes the
                    tax will be found unconstitutional in the near future.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Another effort was made to abolish the Income Tax last week. Senator Conkling
                        moved a resolution to restrain the Internal Revenue officers from collecting
                        this tax.--The point was raised, that such a resolution was not in order
                        after the former definite action of the Senate. By a vote of 27 yeas to 21
                        nays, the Senate decided to allow the resolution to be introduced. A
                        discussion then followed upon the merits of the proposition, during which
                        Senator Cameron, who had voted to admit the resolution, left the Senate
                        Chamber. A vote was reached about half past eleven o'clock at night, and the
                        resolution was lost by a tie vote, the yeas being 26 and the nays 26. Had
                        Senator Cameron been at his post, the resolution would have carried, and
                        this odious impost would have been swept away. The defeat of Senator
                        Conkling's resolution may be justly attributed to the Winnebago Chief, who
                        is suspected of having made an agreement with Senator Sherman, by which the
                        tax on gross receipts was to be stricken out, in case he allowed the Income
                        Tax to be continued. Senator Cameron is largely interested in a certain
                        railroad company, and the tax on gross receipts consequently troubled him
                        far more than the tax against which the people have uniformly set their
                        faces. What gives color to this rumored bargain, is the fact that on the
                        night the Income Tax was continued, the tax on gross receipts was abolished.</p>
                    <p>Another remarkable feature about the vote on the Income Tax is that all the
                        respectable and intellectual Senators were found arrayed against it, while
                        the carpet-baggers were rallied in solid column in its favor. The votes of
                        such men as Conkling, Fenton, Trumbull, and Sumner were set off by the votes
                        of a set of stupid carpet-baggers whose very names are not known to the
                        people of the United States. By the way, let him who reads this, set himself
                        to the work of recalling from memory the names of the Senators from the
                        Southern States, and he will discover that he cannot get far.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps there is some justice in this result so far as these leading Radical
                        Senators are concerned. They labored to impose these foreign fellows upon
                        the Southern States, and there is a certain degree of just retribution in
                        the defeat which they have met at their hands. But it is greatly to be
                        regretted that the people at large should be subjected to the oppression to
                        which the action of reckless, irresponsible, corrupt carpet-baggers subjects
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We notice with pleasure that the leading men of Philadelphia, having lost all
                        hope of relief from Congress, have recently formed an association for the
                        purpose of testing the constitutionality of the act continuing this unequal
                        and unjust tax. It is to be hoped that this movement will be pushed
                        vigorously. It is high time that this matter should be decided. The people
                        bore this tax patiently during the war, under the belief that it was a
                        military necessity, and in hope of the fulfillment of the promise that it
                        should not continue longer than 1870. It has now expired by its own
                        limitation. If it is to be reimposed, the people ought to demand the
                        authority by which it is to be done.</p>

<b>At His Old Tricks</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Cessna appeared in all his glory again in the House on Thursday last. Of
                        course there was another contested election case on hand. Cessna never
                        speaks except on a contested election case and there is no contested
                        election case up for discussion that Cessna does not speak. His whole time
                        in Congress is devoted to the manipulation of contested election cases. If a
                        Radical finds that his case is desperate and that the Democrat is likely to
                        succeed in ousting him from or keeping him out of the seat, as a last
                        resort, he is referred to Cessna, who has acquired a national celebrity as a
                        jobber in contested election cases. The usual remark is, "if Cessna can't
                        save you, the devil himself can't."</p>
                    <p>The case of Thursday was a Missouri contest between Suitzler and Dyer. Dyer
                        was the sitting member and is a Radical. The majority of the Committee on
                        Elections reported in favor of Suitzler who was shown to have been legally
                        and fairly elected. But Cessna, who never votes to admit a Democrat, made a
                        minority report declaring Dyer elected. The majority, with a reckless
                        disregard of facts, right, justice, their own consciences and their
                        accountability to God, sustained Cessna's infamous report, and the
                        smuggler-in of John Covode, and the defender of the cadetship-broker
                        Whittemore, achieved another of the victories which have given him the
                        reputation of a dexterous political prestidigitator.</p>
                    <p>He then offered a resolution to pay Mr. Suitzler five thousand dollars of the
                        people's money for contesting a seat to which the House decided he had no
                        right. Will the people of the Sixteenth Congressional District re-elect this
                        man, who, by almost every vote that he has cast, has brought disgrace upon
                        his constituency?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We take the following account of a bold operation from the Philadelphia Morning Post of Monday. Mr. Early, as our readers
                        are all, doubtless, aware, hails from Chambersburg. We are glad that he
                        caught the one scoundrel and hope that he may be successful in apprehending
                        the others. The account is as follows: "Several instances of bold attempts
                        to swindle merchants and banks in this and other cities of the Union have
                        transpired recently, but in a majority of the cases the operators have been
                        unsuccessful and fallen into the hands of the police. But on Saturday,
                        Assistant Treasurer Barnet Early, of this city, was swindled out of over
                        $2500 in gold in the following bold manner. A party appeared in the upper
                        office of the Custom House building, and presented three coupons to the
                        clerk, Mr. Noble. After calculating the interest thereon, Mr. Noble issued
                        three checks for three dollars each, in gold. The fellow then left, and by
                        some process erased the figure 3 and where the amount was written in full,
                        and filled in one check for the sum of $1200, in another $1320, and in
                        another $1230.</p>
                    <p>"The checks were then presented by different individuals-- the two former
                        following each other in a short space of time. These were paid by the paying
                        clerk. The book-keeper, in checking off discovered the fraud, and notified
                        Mr. Early, who took the position of the paying teller. Shortly after doing
                        that the third check was presented. Mr. Early, being satisfied that it was a
