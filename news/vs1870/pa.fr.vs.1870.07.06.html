<b>The Income Tax</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports with indignation the Senate's recent action to extend the life of
                    the Income Tax against the will of the people. Quotes from both Democratic and
                    Republican newspapers denouncing the move. Says the only way to reverse this
                    state of affairs is to elect Democrats who will follow the voters' wishes.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Taking advantage of a slim attendance in the Senate, on Friday night last
                        Senator Wilson procured a reconsideration of the vote by which the sections
                        of the tax-tariff bill relating to the Income Tax were stricken out. The
                        Senate then by a vote of 27 to 21 agreed to continue this tax, against which
                        the whole country has loudly protested, until 1872. This action has excited
                        a storm of indignation. The press of the country had just congratulated the
                        people on the abolition of this tax by the action of the Senate of the 24th
                        ult. Radicals and Democrats alike shouted their approvals. It is difficult
                        to understand how, at the moment when the people were saying "well done,"
                        grave Senators should deliberately resolve to run counter to the people's
                        wishes and thus draw down their denunciations. Mr. Conkling, a most
                        determined opponent of this tax, was absent, confined to his room by
                        sickness. Telegraphic dispatches state that he intended to bring the matter
                        up in the Senate on Monday again with the confident expectation that the
                        Senate, when full, will again wipe out this unpopular tax. Senator Cameron
                        seems to have been absent also.</p>
                    <p>The tax is revived at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent on all incomes exceeding two
                        thousand dollars. The Philadelphia Morning Post
                        (Radical) says of this fraud:--"This is one of the most deliberate acts of
                        injustice ever practiced by a legislative body, and those Senators who were
                        instrumental in thus outraging a unanimous public sentiment must prepare
                        themselves for the responsibility imposed by their action. The people will
                        receive this action of the Senate with surprise and indignation, the more
                        profound, because they had scarcely ceased rejoicing at the prospect of the
                        discontinuance of this oppressive system. Had all the Senators who voted to
                        strike it out been in their seats last night, it could not have been again
                        inserted. If the House agrees with the Senate the country will look with
                        hope to the President."</p>
                    <p>But there is no hope to be entertained in that quarter; the President has put
                        himself on the record in favor of this measure. In his annual message of
                        December last, he said:--"I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes
                        but at a reduced rate--say of three per cent and this tax to expire in three
                        years."</p>
                    <p>He suggests it, and of course when Congress
                        imposes the tax, he will approve it.</p>
                    <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer (Radical), which has
                        dealt some very damaging blows at this tax, thus gives vent to its views in
                        its issue of Monday:--"The revival of the Income Tax in the Senate on Friday
                        was in admirable keeping with the discreditable jugglery which has been part
                        and parcel of this unpopular levy ever since Messrs. Boutwell and Delano
                        have had it in charge. Its history is that of a bad law, passed under the
                        protest of its authors, but which they were obliged to pass owing to the
                        extreme exigencies of one of the costliest wars which a country ever bore.
                        In that view it was allowable; but when the war was over, and the expenses
                        of the Government were no longer a million a day, the tax was no longer
                        allowable and Congress so considering, on the second of June, 1867, solemnly
                        decreed that it should last until the year 1870, "and
                            now longer."</p>
                    <p>That compact has now been broken, and Congress stands toward the Nation as a
                        violator of the pledged faith. Unpopular and odious as it
                        was in itself, the unjust, absurd and arbitrary decisions of Commissioner
                        Delano, from which there was no appeal permissible, made the law taxing
                        incomes unendurable, and consequently from one end of the
                        country to the other Congress has been petitioned and solicited to keep its
                        faith with the people, and let the law expire under the limitation placed
                        upon it."</p>
                    <p>The Age (Democratic) says:--"The infamous Income
                        Tax has been endorsed by the Senate with a change from five to two and a
                        half per cent. This is the manner in which the Radicals respond to the
                        petition of the people for redress. The masses ask for a fish, the Radicals
                        give them a stone."</p>
                    <p>We might quote from other leading papers of both parties to the same effect.
                        And yet, in spite of almost universal opposition to the continuance of this
                        tax on the part of the people, the Senate persists in forcing it upon the
                        Country. When will Senators learn wisdom? The remedy for all this defiance
                        of the will of the people is to defeat the Radicals at the polls. Let men be
                        elected to Congress who will regard the wishes of those who sent them there.
                        Let us teach our representatives that they must obey--that they were not
                        elected to rule the country with a rod of iron.</p>

<b>Chinese Labor</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Denounces the importation of Chinese labor to the Eastern States. Claims
                    Republicans are in favor of it and urges all white workingmen to support the
                    Democrats in order to avoid unemployment and starvation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Chinese question has opened upon us suddenly, and loomed up with
                        tremendous front in the Eastern States. Hitherto its discussion has been
                        confined to the Pacific coast, but a shoemaker in North Adams,
                        Massachusetts, has recently imported a lot of these coolie laborers and thus
                        thrown them into competition with the white working-men of that town. The
                        intelligence has spread like wildfire and the working-men are moving
                        everywhere. Monster mass meetings have been held to protest against any
                        further importation and to join hands against this scheme to reduce the
                        wages of labor to a mere nominal figure.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese, who feed on rats, mice, dogs, cats and other equally cheap, as
                        well as luxurious articles of diet, can easily afford to work for less money
                        than white men whose stomachs revolt at such food, and who require more
                        expensive provisions.--Hence the danger that the Radical capitalists of New
                        England, who care nothing for anybody but themselves, and who will engage
                        the laborer who will work for the least amount of money, may import these
                        Chinese in large numbers, thus throwing white men out of employment and
                        reducing many of them to want and, perhaps, starvation.</p>
                    <p>It was the Radical newspapers that first advocated the importation of these
                        laborers in order to make labor cheap. The Press
                        and the Inquirer both endorsed the plan months
                        ago, and the Democracy of California and Oregon were denounced without
                        stint, on account of their opposition to it.--But now, the workingmen of the
                        North are adopting the platform of the Democracy, and are expressing their
                        dissatisfaction in no feeble terms. They have seen with perfect disgust the
                        negro elevated to political and social equality with them, and have balked
                        at this effort to degrade white labor. But they recognize in this new
                        movement, a still stronger invasion of their rights, and they are moving
                        solidly now to brand it with the condemnation that it deserves. The only
                        hope of the workingmen is in the success of the Democratic party. Let him
                        learn this at once and act upon it.</p>

                    the reins of parental government in the most generous and loving manner. Deeply
