                    <p>The publication of the bill for the payment of the losses of the border
                        counties, has called forth very favorable comments from some journals,
                        whilst it has elicited from a few others an exhibition of a spirit of the
                        utmost vindictiveness and illiberality. The latter have resorted to basest
                        means to prejudice the public mind against the border claimants.</p>
                    <p>One paper doubles, and nearly trebles, the amount of the losses, fixing it at
                            <emph rend="italic">seven</emph> million dollars, in order to secure the
                        opposition of some sordid souls whose money is their God.</p>
                    <p>Another ridicules our people as "the losers of a few potatoes and a little
                        beef," in order to create the impression that they are "thieves and robbers"
                        and "Swindlers" in asking for <emph rend="italic">three</emph> millions.</p>
                    <p>Another evidently has the idea that there are a few members of the
                        Legislature who can be influenced by the stale cry of "rebel sympathizers,"
                        and it accordingly charges them with being "luke-warm loyalists," and with
                        having "sold garden truck, and butter and eggs enough to the Union armies to
                        recompense them, three times over, for their rifled corn patches, and burned
                        snake fences," and with having "sold water to the Union soldiers in their
                        hour of need," and caps the climax by asserting that they would have "glady
                        sold the same sort of thing <emph rend="italic">for rebel scrip</emph>."</p>
                    <p>Another has the hardihood to publish a statement that the value of all the
                        real estate destroyed was <emph rend="italic">seventy-five thousand</emph>
                        dollars, and that the nature of the adjudication of the personal property is
                        shown by this specimen: "two vests, eight dollars, six bags, six dollars,
                        and three sets of furs, twelve dollars."</p>
                    <p>Such is the spirit in which a portion of the press meets the claim of the
                        people of the border counties for payment. They use no arguments. They
                        manufacture their premises and draw their own conclusions from them, and
                        ignore the real facts altogether.</p>
                    <p>We have no defence to make of the loyalty of our people. It has been tested
                        thoroughly by the severest trials through which any people could be called
                        to pass. Notwithstanding the raids to which they were constantly subjected;
                        notwithstanding the invasion which blighted the country, over which Lee's
                        troops passed, like a <unclear>simoon</unclear> blast; notwithstanding the
                        terrible conflagration which laid our beautiful town in ashes, the people of
                        the border counties never failed to send the bravest and best young men to
                        the war to fill up the depleted ranks of the Union army. Franklin county
                        sent one-half of her voting population and one-tenth of her <emph
                            rend="italic">whole</emph> population to the war. Aye, so true and loyal
                        were the people of Chambersburg, that, when the alternative was presented to
                        them on the 30th day of July, A. D. 1864, rather than contribute of their
                        money to strengthen and sustain the Rebel cause, they preferred to see their
                        homes fired by Rebel torches and burned to the ground, and their wives and
                        little ones left without a roof to shelter them. With such a record, they
                        can laugh to scorn, the taunts and sneers of these cowards who strive to
                        belittle the contributions and sacrifice made by the people of the border
                        counties.</p>
                    <p>Instead of <emph rend="italic">seventy-five thousand dollars</emph> being the
                        amount of damage done to real estate, as asserted by one of these
                        unscrupulous scribblers, the report of the last Commission fixes the amount
                        at $234,583.98, and this does not include the damage to real estate by the
                        burning of Chambersburg, for which an award was made by a special
                        Commission, to the amount of $713,294.34. Thus it will be seen that the
                        damage to real estate alone reaches almost <emph rend="italic">one
                        million</emph> dollars. These are facts which no mendacity can wipe out.</p>
                    <p>And, instead of the items quoted by the Associated Press correspondent as
                        samples of the claims for loss of personal property, it will be found that
                        the bulk of these claims is made up of horses that were stolen, grain that
                        was fed and carried away, furniture that was destroyed by fire, and articles
                        of merchandise that were either appropriated by the Rebels, or consumed by
                        the flames. The malignity that could coin such falsehoods, to misrepresent
                        and injure a people who suffered such terrible anxiety of mind, and such an
                        enormous loss of property during the rebellion, is not only unprincipled and
                        unscrupulous, but it is perfectly diabolical. There is a satisfaction in
                        knowing that it has betrayed its weakness by the glaring enormity of its
                        misrepresentations, and that its libelous articles have failed to convince
                        thinking men of the propriety of refusing to pay these losses.</p>
                    <p>The Pittsburgh <emph rend="italic">Commercial</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                            >Dispatch</emph>, and some of the Philadelphia papers have been most
                        abusive, and most unscrupulous in their statements. And this too, when the
                        fact appears by reference to the laws of the Commonwealth, that citizens of
                        Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have already been paid by the State for the
                        damages sustained by them at the hands of Union Soldiers.--When the bills
                        were pending before the Legislature to pay those claims, these journals did
                        not exhibit the virtuous indignation which now seems to control them. It
                        makes the biggest difference in the world whose ox is gored. Now the
                        principle is the same. If the Legislature of 1869 could provide for the
                        payment of damages sustained by the citizens of Philadelphia and Allegheny
                        Counties to the amount of twelve thousand dollars, why should not the
                        Legislature of 1870 pay the damages sustained by our people? We feel
                        satisfied that the justice of our claims will be recognized and that this
                        session will not be allowed to pass by, without provision being made for
                        their payment.</p>
                    <p>We have not hesitated to lay before our readers the insinuations and charges
                        which have been leveled at their heads. There is not a resident of the
                        border counties who will not repel each and all of these charges as being
                        destitute of any foundation whatever. And they can only entertain the most
                        sovereign contempt for these penny-a-liners <emph rend="italic">who are
                            printing these denunciations, in the hope that somebody will call on
                            them to pay them for desisting from these attacks.</emph> They can rest
                        assured that nobody will call for that purpose. Let them howl on. This claim
                        is just and equitable, and the Legislature will recognize it as such.</p>

                <head>The Negro Senator</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The ambition of Radicalism has been at last realized. A negro has reached the
                        position in America next highest to the Presidency. Revels has been admitted
                        to a seat in the United States Senate. The place once occupied by Jefferson
                        Davis is now filled by the huge form of a burly African, and the Radical
                        leaders are clapping their hands in ecstasy. He is a man who, if he were
                        white, would not be regarded by the people as possessed of sufficient
                        capacity to teach a village school. And yet, fanaticism has foisted him into
                        a position, which, in the better days of the Republic, was held by men of
                        giant intellect, such as Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Pinckney, Hayne and Benton.
                        Alas! how has the American Senate degenerated since then. The dignity which
                        characterized the deliberations of those men, has given place to the swagger
                        and maudlin talk of a drunken Yates, or the insensate quacking of a
                        fanatical Drake, or the miserable diatribes of a self-opinioned Sumner, or
                        the negromania of a doting Cameron. Indeed, to such an extent has the body
                        been stripped of its dignity that the negro Senator himself has been already
                        most thoroughly disgusted, and is reported as having turned his attention to
                        the study of the rules of etiquette, as well as those which were intended
                        and are supposed to govern the body of which he is a member, so that he may
                        be able, both by precept and example to instruct some of his white Radical
                        brethren as to the proper way to behave themselves. This may be a libel on
                        the white Senators, but certain it is that the news from Washington a few
                        days ago, indicated that Revels could not endure the infraction of the rules
                        of the Senate, of which so many of his Radical peers were guilty. He has
                        never moved in the best society, but he says that he has been accustomed to
                        observe the whites about him in the South, and that they are infinitely
                        superior to Sumner, and Wilson, and Drake, and Yates, in point of good
                        manners and good breeding. We may expect to see him, therefore, attempting
                        to enforce upon his Radical peers, the necessity of giving a higher tone to
                        their disputations and of exhibiting a more polite bearing towards each
                        other. If he succeeds in the effort, perhaps the people may consider that
                        some little ground for dealing more leniently with them for perpetrating the
                        outrage of admitting a negro to the United States Senate.</p>
                    <p>It is astonishing how willing these Radical Senators are to disregard the
                        Constitution to suit their purposes. The Constitution of the United States
                        makes it one of the qualifications of a United States Senator that he must
                        have been a citizen of the United States for nine years. Has the negro been
                        a citizen of the United States for nine years? Nine years carry us back to a
                        period before the war. Nobody then claimed citizenship for him. The Dred
                        Scott decision was then the latest opinion of the Supreme Court on the
                        subject, and, certainly, it did not recognize the negro as a citizen. Then
                        came the war, and with it the abolition of slavery, and then came the
                        contest for clothing the negro with citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment to
                        the Constitution was proposed and adopted, by the Radicals themselves to
                        make the negro a citizen. They have succeeded in making him an elector, and
                        putting him on a plane of perfect equality with the whites as to political
                        rights, and now they override the Constitution, under which they hold their
                        own places, in order to carry their fanatical doctrines to the farthest
                        extreme, and gratify their wish to see the negro elevated to a position of
                        superiority to the great majority of white people.</p>
                    <p>Suppose a man were to be elected to the United States Senate who was only
                        twenty-nine years of age. How quickly he would be informed that he must
                        attain the age of thirty years before he could be admitted, because that is
                        one of the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution. Why has not the
                        same rule been applied to this negro as to this other requisite
                        qualification, vis: a nine years citizenship? Surely, common prudence would
                        have dictated that the Constitution should be upheld in this particular, so
                        that the colored race, so suddenly emancipated and enfranchised, might have
                        the opportunity to prepare themselves, by a proper study of our form of
                        government, to assist in making laws for the nation. Think of a negro, who
                        never cast a vote until within the last year, elevated at once to the United
                        States Senate to legislate for a mighty Republic like ours. Could fanaticism
                        possibly go further?</p>
                    <p>In order to satisfy our readers that Revels is a fit associate for the
                        leaders of "the party of great moral ideas," it may be well for them to know
                        something of his antecedents. He was once pastor of a negro church in
                        Leavenworth, Kansas. He was charged with embezzling the Church funds, and
                        thereupon sued for libel, but the jury found his alleged libeler <emph
                            rend="italic">not guilty</emph>. Here is a card, signed by six of the
                        jury, which is decidedly interesting in this connection:</p>
                    <p>"LEAVENWORTH, AUG. 27, 1867.</p>
                    <p>"We, the undersigned, were jurymen in the case of the State of Kansas vs.
                        John H. Morris, in which one Hiram R. Revels was complaining witness. Said
                        suit was instituted by the said Revels in the form of a criminal
                        prosecution, for an alleged libel in charging the said Revels with
                        embezzling the funds of his church; with falsehood and hypocrisy, in a
                        certain pamphlet entitled: 'A humbug.'</p>
                    <p>"The defendant (Morris) took the ground that the alleged libel was true, and
                        proved to our satisfaction that the said Hiram R. Revels had embezzled
                        certain funds belonging to his church, and has been guilty of falsehood, and
                        had unnecessarily forced a quarrel on the said Morris, thus compelling him
                        to act in vindication of his own character.</p>
                    <p>"In short, we found that the alleged libel was true, and that it was
                        published for good motives and justifiable ends, all of which it was
                        necessary to prove to secure an acquittal in a suit for libel.<lb/> "E.M.

                <summary>Calls the swearing-in of Hiram Revels a symbol of the degeneracy and chaos
                    which the Senate has become under Radical leadership. Again argues that Revels
                    shouldn't be a Senator because technically he has not been a citizen for nine
                    years. Also, prints a statement from former jurymen showing how Revels embezzled
                    money from his church in Kansas a few years back.</summary>

                <summary>Miss Olive Logan will lecture in Repository Hall on March 19th. Her subject
                    will be "Girls." She comes very favorably reviewed. She is sensitive to her
                    subject but also exposes "the follies of the 'girl of the period.'"</summary>
