<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From many sources, information reaches us that a large number of persons in
                        this Borough are in very needy circumstances. The destitution that exists
                        has not been equaled during any previous winter within the memory of the
                        oldest inhabitant. Families have been visited which were found so destitute
                        as to be without a sufficient quantity of food for one meal, without fuel to
                        keep a single fire going, and without sufficient clothing to hide the
                        nakedness of the children. This ought not to be--this must not be.</p>
                    <p>The cry for relief does not come alone from such as are too lazy to work when
                        work is offered. It does not come alone from those who squander their
                        earnings in dissipation. Owing to the dullness of the times and the
                        difficulty of obtaining employment, some of our most industrious
                        day-laborers and mechanics are unable to procure the necessaries of life.</p>
                    <p>In order to adopt some mode of meeting the pressing necessities of such
                        persons, a meeting of citizens was held in the Central Presbyterian Church
                        on Monday afternoon, and after consultation, an Executive Committee was
                        appointed, consisting of Messrs. D. O. Gehr, H. B. Davison, Wm. D. Guthrie,
                        John Jeffries and James L. Black, who will receive contributions of
                        provisions, clothing, fuel and anything that will be of use. We hope that
                        our people will respond liberally to this call.</p>
                    <p>And we would appeal to our friends in the country to help in this good work.
                        In the rural districts, people do not see the penury and consequent
                        wretchedness that exist in the large towns. They can aid these poor people
                        without much inconvenience to themselves. Let them bring in loads of
                        wood--let them hunt through their houses for old clothing--let them
                        contribute of the products of their farms. This is an excellent committee,
                        and our country friends can rest assured that anything placed in their
                        hands, will be promptly and cheerfully put to the proper place. The poor we
                        have with us. The wants of the undeserving, as well as the deserving, must
                        be met. It would be a blistering shame upon our civilization and
                        Christianity to let any human being starve or freeze to death in the midst
                        of us. The greatest activity should be exhibited in this matter by those who
                        can spare anything, so that when they lay their heads upon their pillows at
                        night, they can enjoy the consolation of knowing that they have relieved the
                        urgent wants of some wretched sufferers who, otherwise, might have perished.
                        This will be a soul-satisfying reward. Try it.</p>
