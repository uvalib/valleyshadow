                <transcript>
                    <p>The subject of calling a Convention for the purpose of revising our State
                        Constitution is now being agitated. The idea seems to meet with very general
                        favor, and it is likely that the next Legislature will be forced by public
                        sentiment into providing for the assembling of such a body.</p>
                    <p>There are various reasons why such a Convention should be held. There is none
                        why it should not be held, unless perhaps, the danger that the majority
                        party, whichever it might be, might resolve to run the Convention for the
                        furtherance of its own political interests. Such a project ought to be
                        discountenanced from the beginning, and the movement ought to be an earnest
                        effort on the part of all good citizens to correct the abuses which have
                        crept into the administration of the State government.</p>
                    <p>One of the greatest evils of our day is special legislation. For the last
                        three or four years, the number of bills passed each year has exceeded
                        thirteen hundred. These have all been private bills with the exception of
                        fifty or sixty at most. What a fearful state of affairs this simple
                        statement presents! Disguise it as we may, there is little doubt that in
                        every one of these private bills, somebody had "an axe to grind" and that
                        the grinding of the instrument cost the Commonwealth far more than the axe
                        was worth to anybody save the owner.</p>
                    <p>This special legislation is the fruitful source of corruption. Whenever a
                        bill is introduced into either House, the general desire is to know "how
                        much is in it."--And the measure is "pinched" and "squeezed" to the utmost
                        that it is able to bear without being strangled to death. This is a most
                        deplorable state of affairs. No effort should be left untried to put a stop
                        to proceedings so utterly disgraceful to the State. In nine cases out of
                        ten, the Courts have jurisdiction of the matters legislated upon, but this
                        does not cause the legislators to stop the business. If a job pays well
                        enough, it is bound to go through, no matter what the consequences are.</p>
                    <p>Then, too, the subject of minority representation requires very careful
                        consideration. This matter has recently been attracting a great deal of
                        attention. It should be discussed with the greatest freedom and
                        thoroughness. For our own part we have no doubt that some such system as
                        that proposed by Mr. Buckslaw ought to be adopted. It is high time that
                        minorities should have rights which everybody would be bound to respect.</p>
                    <p>Our Judicial system also needs reorganization. It might be well to
                        re-district the State. At any rate, some important reforms ought to be
                        introduced. For our own part, we would go back to the old system of <emph
                            rend="italic">appointing</emph> judges.</p>
                    <p>There ought to be a change in the jury system. Whenever parties to a suit
                        declare to submit the matters in issue--matters of fact as well as law--to
                        the Court without the intervention of a jury, it ought to be allowed,
                        reserving, of course, the right of appeal in the Supreme Court, an account
                        of the wrongful determination of facts.</p>
                    <p>Then, too, the qualifications of an elector at the ballot box ought to be
                        distinctly prescribed both for cities and rural districts without
                        distinction. The opportunities ought to be taken away for the commission of
                        such gigantic frauds as those perpetrated in Philadelphia. The
                        qualifications of an elector ought to be the same in Philadelphia as in
                        Franklin County and no political party should have the control of the
                        election precincts by laws specially passed for its benefit.</p>
                    <p>Other matters there are which would require consideration, but we have thrown
                        these out hurriedly, as occurring to us. We hope to see the Convention
                        composed of the most intelligent and thoughtful men in the Commonwealth. We
                        would then look confidently forward to the formation of a Convention which
                        would correct many of the abuses which now reflect great discredit upon the
                        old Keystone State.</p>

                        fruit and ornamental trees sold by Plaintiff to Defendant, which Defendant

                <transcript>
                    <p>The monument to Dr. Harbaugh, a minute description of which we gave in our
                        columns some weeks ago, was unveiled on Tuesday of last week with
                        appropriate ceremonies. The Mercersburg <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph>
                        says: "A committee from the Reformed Synod, at whose instance the monument
                        was erected, was present and assisted in the ceremonies of the unveiling.
                        The services attending it were quite impressive and were conducted by the
                        Rev. Drs. Gehrhart and Higby. The occasion drew together a large audience to
                        witness the interesting ceremonies attendant upon it. We will not at this
                        time give a description of the monument. Suffice it to say that the
                        testimonial is a handsome one, and is well befitting to mark the resting
                        place of so great and good a man as the Rev. Dr. Harbaugh."</p>
                    <p>The service was as follows:</p>
                    <p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                    <p>Response--Amen.</p>
                    <p>Repetition of the creed.</p>
                    <p>The following was delivered by Dr. Gerhart:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Dearly Beloved in the Lord:</emph>--Henry Harbaugh, whose
                        body lies buried at our feet, fell asleep in Jesus on the 28th day of
                        December, in the year of our Lord 1867.</p>
                    <p>Through all his extreme sufferings, he continued unto the end firm in the
                        Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith which he had taught and defended with
                        exemplary fidelity throughout his life. Called from his many labors and
                        arduous toils, he hath gone before us into rest, and joined the holy
                        fellowship of patriarchs and prophets, apostles and martyrs, and the whole
                        glorious company of the redeemed of all ages who have died in the Lord, and
                        now live with him forevermore.</p>
                    <p>The Church, therefore, in whose service he labored, mindful of the great
                        grace and many gifts bestowed upon him by God, and rejoicing over the
                        blessed communion of Saints over which death has no power, has erected this
                        monument which we now unveil. (Here the Minister paused until the monument
                        was properly unveiled by his assistants and then proceeded as follows): And
                        now let this monument show forth, during all time to come, the gratitude of
                        the Church to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for the good example
                        of His servant whom thus she honors, and for the blessed privilege which her
                        children enjoy of having part in the glorious company of all those who have
                        gone before them in the way of Salvation; and let it serve to inspire all
                        who may look upon it, with zeal to follow the faith of those Saints who have
                        died in the Lord and now live with him forevermore.</p>
                    <p>Response--Amen.</p>
                    <p>Let us pray.</p>
                    <p>O, God, the Maker and <sic>Reedeemer</sic> of all believers, grant to all Thy
                        servants a merciful judgment at the last day, that they, in the face of all
                        creatures, may then be acknowledged as the true children through our Lord
                        Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>Response--Amen.</p>
                    <p>O, Almighty God who hast knit together Thine elect in one communion and
                        fellowship in the mystical body of Thy Son, Christ Jesus, our Lord, grant us
                        grace to follow Thy blessed saints in all virtuous and Godly living, that we
                        may come to those unspeakable joys which Thou hast prepared for them that
                        unfeignedly love Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
                    <p>Response--Amen.</p>
                    <p>Almighty God, with whom do lie the spirits of them that depart hence in the
                        Lord and with whom the souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from
                        the burden of the flesh, are in joy and felicity, we give Thee hearty thanks
                        for that it pleased Thee to deliver our dear brother out of the miseries of
                        this sinful world; beseeching Thee that it may please Thee of thy gracious
                        goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of Thine elect and to hasten thy
                        Kingdom, that we, with all those that are departed in the true faith of Thy
                        holy name, may have our perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and
                        soul, in Thy eternal and everlasting glory through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
                    <p>Response--Amen.</p>
                    <p>O, God, merciful and faithful, the aid of all that trust in Thee, keep safely
                        under the shadow of Thy wings ourselves, our kindred and friends, and all
                        believers, even Thy whole Church, that we may enjoy Thy presence
                        <sic>alway</sic>, and increase in Thy Holy Spirit more and more till we come
                        to Thine everlasting Kingdom, through our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>Response--Amen.</p>
                    <p>With Thee, O, God, is the well of life, and in Thy sight shall Thy saints see
                        light and their souls shall rest in peace</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Gloria Patri.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>After the singing of the <emph rend="italic">Gloria Patri</emph> the
                        presiding Minister led the audience in procession into the church reading,
                        as he proceeded from the grave to the altar in the church, the 35th Chant,
                        as in the order of worship. When reaching the altar all knelt at the chancel
                        and offered up the Lord's prayer, after which the regular address was
                        delivered and the services properly concluded.</p>
