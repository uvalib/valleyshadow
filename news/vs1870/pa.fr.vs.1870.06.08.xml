                    <p>As negroes are being pushed in everywhere, it could not be expected that the
                        United States Military Academy would long be spared the infliction of their
                        presence.--Accordingly, on the 30th ult., the first colored cadet reported
                        at West Point for examination. His name is Michael Howard. He was appointed
                        by Mr. Le Grand W. Perce, a carpet-bag member of Congress from Mississippi
                        upon the recommendation of the colored Doctor of Divinity, United States
                        Senator Hiram M. Revels.</p>
                    <p>The object of the radical leaders is to force the white cadets to meet, and
                        associate with, this negro lad on terms of perfect social equality. The
                        white people of the country can see what is in store for them, if this thing
                        be not stopped very soon, in the remarks of an officer at West Point made to
                        a reporter of the New York <emph rend="italic">Sun</emph> on this very
                        subject. Said he, "This question affects us differently from what it does
                        persons in political or business life. In our case it forces the social
                        aspect sharply to the front. A negro may be in Congress, or he may fill any
                        civil or political station, without the fact of his filling it compelling
                        his <emph rend="italic">confreres</emph> to meet or to take the alternative
                        of refusing to meet him socially. But with us it is different. We are often
                        isolated, and our fellow officers are the only society we have. Imagine an
                        officer, with his family, including daughters, stationed at a remote post,
                        and with subordinate colored officers. There he is, isolated, and brought
                        face to face with the social aspect of this question. He is compelled to
                        meet it. I do not mean to say that he ought not to meet it in a broad,
                        catholic, democratic spirit. But why should officers of the army be
                        compelled to meet it any more than other people? <emph rend="italic">I think
                            it is not unreasonable to say, that until a father is willing to invite
                            negroes into his own family, to associate with his own daughters, he
                            should not help to force others into a position such as I have
                        depicted</emph>."</p>
                    <p>This social problem is bound to come to us for solution. It is being pressed
                        as rapidly and strongly as it can well be. This same reporter says
                        that--"Prof. Mahan, who has been forty years in the Military Academy,
                        informed us that Gov. Alcorn, of Mississippi, sent him, by the hand of his
                        private secretary, information of the appointment of young Howard, and
                        requested him to look after the boy. Prof. Mahan sent to Buttermilk Falls
                        for Michael, and was pleased with his appearance and behavior, and knowing
                        that his comfort, so far as the cadets could affect it, would depend most on
                        the members of his own class, <emph rend="italic">he sent for a son of Gov.
                            Geary, of Pennsylvania,</emph> who is one of the new candidates. Young
                        Geary is twenty-one years old; he served with gallantry during the war; is a
                        very fine young man, and will probably have a controlling influence with his
                        class. Prof. Mahan stated young Howard's case to Mr. Geary, and <emph
                            rend="italic">that gentleman cordially volunteered to canvass the matter
                            with his classmates, and throw around the young Mississippian all the
                            protection which it is possible to secure by a social aegis</emph>."</p>
                    <p>So it seems that the son of "His Excellency, Major General John W. Geary,
                        Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania," is throwing "around the young
                        Mississippian all the protection which it is possible to secure by a social
                        aegis." The social shield is to be the negro's protection at West Point. He
                        is to mingle with the white Radical youths as an equal, and any whites who
                        demur, are to be ostracized from this <del/> social circle. The rule is to
                        be, <emph rend="italic">you must associate with the negro, or you can not
                            associate with John W. Geary's son</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Step by step, has this infamous fanaticism advanced with lies in its mouth
                        all the time. How often we have been told that <emph rend="italic"
                        >political</emph> equality does not involve, and will not lead to <emph
                            rend="italic">social</emph> equality, it is not necessary for us to say.
                        Our readers have all heard this asserted. But now, true it is that before
                        the negro has exercised the right to vote in more than one State in the
                        Union, thereby enjoying <emph rend="italic">political</emph> equality, the
                        announcement is made that the son of our Radical Governor is throwing around
                        him "all the protection which it is possible to secure by a <emph
                            rend="italic">social</emph> aegis."</p>
                    <p>White men, here is a plain, stubborn fact. You can not shut your eyes to it.
                        It is crowding upon you against your will. You must approve or reject it.
                        What will you do? Are you for negro equality, both political and social, or
                        will you join the "White Man's Party" in order to crush out this hideous
                        doctrine once and forever? Do not forget that the Radical party means to
                        force you into <emph rend="italic">social</emph> equality with the negro.
                        Grapple it to your memory with hooks of steel that the white son of your
                        white Governor is throwing all the protection around a negro cadet "which it
                        is possible to secure by a <emph rend="italic">social</emph> aegis."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>It is interesting to note the progress that the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Repository</emph> has made on the question of negro suffrage. The
                        Democracy protested against the recent ratification of the Fifteenth
                        Amendment on several grounds.--One of these was that even if adopted, it
                        could not supersede our State Constitution and wipe out the word "white."</p>
                    <p>In 1865, Col. A.K. McClure was the Editor of the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Repository</emph>. In writing of the proposed enfranchisement of the
                        freedmen, on the 28th day of June in that year, he used the following
                        language:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">The General Government</emph> can not, by any possible
                        means, lawfully secure to them the right of suffrage. To the States alone
                        belongs that power and duty; and thus far not one of the regenerated States
                        has proposed it. A national convention has been suggested, but that would
                        require the States to ratify its action, and the States would thus hold the
                        issue in their hands in any event. In Pennsylvania it could not even be
                        formally proposed for three years, and it would require five years to strike
                        the word "white" from our organic law. By the 1st section of article 3d
                        "every <emph rend="italic">white</emph> freemen of the age of twenty-one
                        years," is a voter, and article 10th provides that "no amendment or
                        amendments shall be submitted to the people oftener than once in <emph
                            rend="italic">five</emph> years." Last year the people ratified the
                        amendment enfranchising our soldiers, and no other amendment can be offered
                        before 1869, unless by calling a constitutional convention. Regardless of
                        the doubtful issue in this State on the merits of the question, Pennsylvania
                        is thus precluded from formal action on the question at present.</p>
                    <p>Thus it seems that Col. McClure at that time proclaimed the same view of the
                        power of the General Government as to this Amendment, and its effect upon
                        Pennsylvania, as the Democracy have ever held. And yet, in Pennsylvania the
                        negro is a voter, notwithstanding the fact that <emph rend="italic">no
                            action whatever has been taken in the State to amend the State
                            Constitution</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> defends this outrageous fraud upon
                        the people known as the Fifteenth Amendment. Will it explain?</p>

                    <p>Whenever some mean political sleight-of-hand trick is to be performed in
                        Congress, CESSNA is always on hand. Whenever some great measure of vital
                        interest to his constituents is under consideration, he fails to come to
                        time.</p>
                    <p>On Friday last, when the vote was taken to strike out of the Tax bill all
                        that related to the infamous Income Tax, Cessna <emph rend="italic"
                        >dodged</emph>. He was afraid to vote on it. If he voted to resurrect the
                        tax, he knew that the masses of the people would condemn him for it at the
                        polls. If he voted against the tax, he feared that the army of Internal
                        Revenue officers and their assistants, would mark him for it, refuse to
                        support him for a renomination, and possibly beat him at the polls in case
                        he should become a candidate. Thus hemmed in, he lacked the independence to
                        take either position, and <emph rend="italic">dodged</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Again: When the proposition was under consideration to tax United States
                        bonds, Cessna failed to answer to his name on a call of the yeas and nays.
                        If he voted to tax the bonds, here would be the bondholders "after him with
                        a sharp stick." If he voted against taxing the bonds, there would be a howl
                        from the masses who are taxed to death on their investments and their labor,
                        while the bondholders enjoy their high rate of interest clear of taxation.
                        Thus he reasoned, and as he reasoned, he wavered, trembled, and finally
                            <emph rend="italic">dodged</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Bah! We wouldn't give a picayune for the man who has not the brains to

                        Spring, where John D. DeGolley, Esq., delivered an oration of great force,
                        beauty and power, at the close of which he was heartily congratulated by his
                        friends on his brilliant display of oratorical powers. The Rev. Mr.
