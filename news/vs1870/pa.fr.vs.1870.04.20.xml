                    <p>Miss Anna E. Dickinson delivered her great lecture, entitled "To the Rescue"
                        on Tuesday evening of last week. The Hall was comfortably filled. A large
                        number of our ladies went, exceedingly prejudiced against her and her cause.
                        They came away delighted with the lecturer and enthusiastic in support of
                        Female Suffrage. It would be impossible to do justice to such a lecture in
                        the space to which we are limited. She gave utterance to a great many very
                        wholesome, although unpalatable truths. She speaks plainly and to the point.
                        The lecture has been prepared with great care, and she knows how to deliver
                        it. Not prepossessing in appearance--in fact, rather unprepossessing at
                        first--she leads one to dread that she may be a failure. But as she warms up
                        with her subject, her manner becomes very interesting and her matter,
                        clothed in the choicest language, can not fail to command attention. One
                        listens for an hour and a half with unflagging interest and there is no such
                        impression left upon the mind as that the woman has disgraced herself and
                        her sex by "speaking in public on the stage."</p>
                    <p>Her converts can now be reckoned by the score. We can not include ourselves
                        in the number, for we have, for a long time, held the notion that the women
                        ought to vote. When she spoke to us, therefore, she told her story to
                        willing ears.</p>
                    <p>The profits of the lecture--about $125--go to the Monumental Association. It
                        gives us pleasure to state that Miss Dickinson was gratified with her visit
                        to Chambersburg, and has consented to give us another lecture next
                    Winter.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Since the proclamation of the Secretary of State was issued, declaring the
                        Fifteenth Amendment adopted, the negroes of our town have met together
                        several times, to compare notes as to how they should best organize for the
                        proper exercise of the right of suffrage. Cessna has been writing letters to
                        them, to our certain knowledge, desiring lists of the names of the colored
                        voters to be sent to him, so that he may mail the necessary documents to
                        them to induce them to vote the Radical ticket and, particularly, for John
                        Cessna. It is intimated that he was informed as to the precise time when the
                        amendment was to be declared ratified, and that he had a congratulatory
                        letter lithographed, enclosed in envelopes and addressed beforehand, so that
                        they might reach his colored constituents at the earliest possible moment.
                        In furtherance of his wishes, a few of the colored men have furnished him
                        with such lists, and the mails will be overloaded with all the political
                        matter that he can manage to frank to the negroes between this time and the
                        adjournment of Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Radical local politicians are also moving. The editors of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Repository</emph> backed by one of the constables of the
                        Borough and, accompanied by a few others, have been attending the meetings
                        in the African Wesleyan Church for the purpose of attempting to mould the
                        opinions and shape the action of the negroes according to their wishes. They
                        regard them as "dumb, driven cattle" and they think and say that all they
                        need to do is to direct them to do so and so, and, forthwith, it will be
                        done. They believe the negroes to be like a flock of sheep which will follow
                        where-ever the bell wether leads the way. Hence they are making vigorous
                        efforts to secure the few leading men among them, thinking that the common
                        herd, as they call them, will be governed entirely by these few leaders.</p>
                    <p>They indulge in vehement denunciations of the negroes who dare to assert
                        their independence. They instruct their pupils to threaten to murder the man
                        who shows the slightest symptoms of flinching from the support of the
                        Radical party. They cried lustily in the meeting when one of the negroes
                        asked to have his name erased from the roll, "put him out," "kill him,"
                        &amp;c. They resort to entreaty and intimidation in order to effect
                        their <sic>pupose</sic>. They impose upon the credulity and seek to inflame
                        the passions of the negroes in order to secure their votes. These "leaders"
                        expect to collect their colored brethren in "squads" and march them to the
                        polls in droves. Any colored man who protests against this mode of dealing
                        with his race, even though he is honestly in favor of the Radical party, is
                        denounced as a traitor and a "Copperhead nigger." We do not doubt that this
                        same system has been adopted all over the country. To this it has come at
                        last. Can there be any doubt that Radicalism is waning when it is obliged to
                        resort to such desperate means to sustain itself?</p>

                        sentenced to pay costs.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Henry Gray. Charge of breaking into the Post Office and stealing
                        money. Verdict, guilty. Sentenced to 2 years imprisonment in the Eastern

                        Deft. bound in $100 to keep the peace and pay costs.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Wiley H. Alfred and Andrew U. Collins. Charge of breaking into the
                        store of Isaac Clugston in Doylesburg and stealing from $500 to $700 worth
                        of clothing. A true bill. The real names of these larks are Wiley A. Himes
                        and Andrew C. Unger. Himes did some tall swearing and had the case put off
                        to August Sessions. But Unger insisted on telling what he knew about the
                        matter. He claimed to have been persuaded by Himes, and gave a minute
                        account of the whole affair. The Court inclined to leniency on account of
                        his youth and candor, and sentenced him to fifteen months imprisonment in
                        Eastern Penitentiary. Himes has but recently returned from the Penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Henry Hellene. Assault and Battery. Wm. Pentz, Prosecutor. This
                        prosecution was begun before Justice Kauffman, in Greenscastle, by Henry
                        Hellene, charging Wm. Pentz with an assault and battery on him. The Justice
                        granted a hearing and concluded to change the position of the parties by
                        making Pentz the Prosecutor and Hellene the Defendant.--The result justified
                        the change, for the jury found Hellene guilty, and the Court sentenced him
                        to pay the costs.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Henry Stoner. Larceny of five turkeys from Joseph Arbegast.
                        Defendant pleaded guilty. Sentenced to two months imprisonment in county
                        jail.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Frank Elliott. Charge of selling goods at auction contrary to law.
                        H. C. Keyse, Prosecutor. The defendant is a Merchant Tailor doing business
                        on Main street, near the Diamond. For a few years past, he has carried on
                        two stores on Main street--one located near Queen street, in which he sold
                        ready-made clothing, and the other in which he now carries on the business
                        of a Merchant Tailor. From January to April, he sold off his goods in the
                        Southern store at auction and the remnant he brought to the Northern store
                        when his lease of the Southern store expired. He was indicted for selling
                        these goods at auction. In 1832 an act was passed by the Legislature
                        prohibiting the selling of goods at auction in Chambersburg under a penalty
                        of $500. In 1833 a supplement to that act was passed, fixing the penalty at
                        from $50 to $500, and providing that a person who had been in business six
                        months, and intending to decline business, might sell off at auction. In
                        1869 an act was passed providing for the appointment of an auctioneer in
                        Chambersburg for the term of three year, and in express terms, this act
                        repeals the act of 1832. Does it repeal the supplement of 1832? Defendant's
                        counsel contended that it does. Counsel for the Commonwealth contended that
                        it does not. The Court held that the supplement is still in full force, and
                        that no one can sell at auction in Chambersburg unless he intends to decline
                        business. Mr Heyser was commissioned by the Governor as Auctioneer under the
                        act of 1869.</p>
                    <p>Then came the question for the jury to decide as to whether or not the Deft.
                        intended to, and did, decline business, in closing out the one store, or
                        whether the goods were sold at auction on a mere pretence of declining
                        business. The jury was unable to agree and was discharged.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Edward Burns. Assault and Battery. Sophia Rhodes, Prosecutrix. The
                        Prosecutrix is a colored woman who lives in Norristown. On the 12th of
                        February she went to the depot of the Cumberland Valley Railroad to take
                        passage East. On approaching the first passenger car, the Deft., who is a
                        brakeman on the road, directed her to take the rear car. She went back
                        accompanied by a few colored friends, looked into the rear car, said it was
                        filthy, and there were "rough fellows" in it, stepped from the platform of
                        that car to the platform of the front car and attempted to enter it. She was
                        met by a young man from within, who she says was the Deft., and he strove to
                        keep her out. After a considerable struggle, she succeeded in getting in and
                        took her seat. She prosecuted Edward Burns for Assault and Battery. On the
                        trial the foregoing facts were developed, except that it seems as though the
                        person who met her at the door was not Burns but a young man named Cameron.
                        Burns, however, stood on the platform of the car, and, to the question,
                        shall I let her in? replied no. The District Attorney took the ground that,
                        under the act passed in 1867, prohibiting any conductor, or employee of a
                        railroad, from excluding or attempting to exclude a person from a car on
                        account of race or color, the Deft. was guilty of an Assault and Battery. He
                        took occasion to say that it was a damnable act, the product of "the
                        civilization of the Nineteenth century," which has elevated the negro, in
                        point of this privilege, above the white man, but as it is the law of the
                        State it must be obeyed and enforced. But the jury <sic>could'nt</sic> see
                        it. Their instincts revolted at the idea of standing by this work of
                        Radicalism, and they acquitted the Defendant and made him pay one-third of
                        the costs, and left the dusky Prosecutrix to shoulder the balance.</p>
                    <p>The criminal business occupied the Court all week with the exception of a few
                        hours. A jury was called in the case of John R. Stickell vs. J. Allison
                        Eyster, but was discharged and the case continued at the cost of Defendant.</p>

                <summary>Continues its coverage of cases in the County court. Describes all manner
                    of cases from larceny to assault to licenses granted for taverns and
