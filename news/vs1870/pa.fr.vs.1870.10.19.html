<b>The Victory in the County and District</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Announces with joy the total victory of the Democratic ticket in the 16th
                    District. Mocked Republican efforts to carry the election and denounces
                    Democrats who abandoned their party for bribes or favors. Predicts even greater
                    victories for Democrats in the future.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The smoke of the late political battle has cleared away, leaving a large
                        number of Radical dead and wounded upon the field. It is admitted by
                        everybody that the result is a Radical defeat and of course a Conservative
                        triumph. Never was there a greater disappointment to the Radical leaders. By
                        the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment and the consequent exercise of the
                        right of suffrage by the negroes, these leaders confidently anticipated a
                        Waterloo defeat for the Democracy.</p>
                    <p>In the Sixteenth Congressional District eleven hundred negroes were
                        registered.--Franklin County furnished six hundred and fifty of this number.
                        They voted the Radical ticket almost without exception. By the help of these
                        sable individuals, Cessna counted on getting a majority of five hundred in
                        this county alone. He undertook the brag game as is usual with him, and
                        boasted that he would beat Meyers one thousand in the District. He made a
                        canvass as vigorous as any that could have been made. Meetings were held at
                        all the cross-roads and school houses. Bands were hired at an immense
                        expenditure to attend these meetings. Prominent speakers from abroad were
                        brought into the District to bolster up the little demagogue. Hon. John
                        Allison, Register of the Treasury, undertook the difficult work of
                        convincing the people that it was their duty to reelect Cessna. He seems to
                        have been the most discerning man of all who came among us for he wrote to
                        Washington that it was impossible to save Cessna. Col. Jordan  up the
                        record which he made in 1868 against the little trickster and actually
                        advocated Cessna's election.</p>
                    <p>Nearly every man who heard him had read the address in which he had denounced
                        this man as a hypocrite and an unprincipled politician. Col. Jordan can
                        congratulate himself as peculiarly fortunate that our people laid as strong
                        a regard for his feelings as to refrain from calling him to account upon the
                        subject of that address. They knew the falsity of his utterances in his
                        speach when he said that Cessna was a war man from the very inception of the
                        rebellion. But they had that high sense of propriety which kept them quiet
                        while Col. Jordan was belittling himself in their eyes by attempting to
                        gloss over with a few glittering generalities what he had
                        written before with such striking instances of detail.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chance was plucked up from Von Amburgh's Menagerie for the purpose of
                        amusing the negroes of the district and Cessna took a few private lessons
                        from him so that he might be able to do something in the same line of
                        business.</p>
                    <p>In short, every effort was made that could be made to insure Cessna's
                        success. Mr. Meyers was pictured as a worse rebel than Longstreet, Stuart or
                        Wade Hampton.--Radical speakers could not utter his name with the slightest
                        respect. Mr. Stewart was pleased to designate him everywhere as "an
                        unmitigated and unrepentant rebel," and also to state that he would not have
                        appeared to address the people in this campaign if the Democracy had not
                        nominated a traitor.</p>
                    <p>All the talkers of the party in Chambersburg were sent out to the meetings.
                        The "hounds of Zion" were called into requisition and Rev. C.W. McKeehan
                        went upon the stump to uphold the gigantic fraud known as the Fifteenth
                        Amendment and to sustain the man who voted for the bill to enforce that
                        amendment. If McKeenhan, Hays, McGowan, Cook, Garner, Mahon, Stumbaugh and
                        Hamman had held another series of meetings, the Democratic majority would
                        have reached five or six hundred.--We bespeak their services for the next
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy have abundant reason to rejoice. They have fought the battle in
                        the face of apparently overwhelming numbers and have triumphed gloriously.
                        They have administered a severe drubbing to the renegade who was always in
                        search of office in the Democratic party, and who has been a candidate ever
                        since he went into the enemy's camp. Cessna has been rejected by a majority
                        of his constituents, and in this result all good men should rejoice.</p>
                    <p>The Democrats in all the Counties in the District have done nobly except in
                        Bedford. The Radical majority in Somerset has been reduced. Little Fulton
                        has given a larger majority than usual and Adams and Franklin,
                        notwithstanding the large negro vote within their limits, have given good
                        Democratic majorities. According to the extract from the Bedford Gazette which we publish in another column, some of the
                        Democrats in that County were bought and threw their influence in favor of
                        Cessna. The editor of the Gazette has denounced
                        this treacherous conduct in appropriate terms.</p>
                    <p>The same treachery was practised in this County to a small extent. One or two
                        dissatisfied Democrats took Cessna's money and paid it out at the rate of
                        two dollars per vote, to defeat Meyers and the Democratic Legislative
                        ticket. But Cessna, or whoever furnished the money, might have just as
                        profitably thrown it into a rat hole. Some few took the money and then voted
                        the full Democratic ticket, whilst the greater portion of the money remained
                        in the pockets of the traitorous agents who stipulated to sell out the
                        party. The animosity of these agents was chiefly leveled at Captain Skinner,
                        the Democratic candidate for Assembly from this County. It must be a source
                        of infinite satisfaction to these agents to observe that instead of running
                        behind, he is elected by a larger majority than that given to any other man
                        on the ticket. They may thus be enabled to put a proper estimate upon their
                        own secret efforts and to see the extent of their boasted influence. At such
                        a rate, it does not pay them to keep on the war-path as bushwhackers. They
                        had far better enlist under the banner of the enemy and give their important
                        services entirely to the work of crushing out the Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>It strikes us that this is a very bad time for a Democrat to desert his
                        party. For ten years that grand old organization has met with defeat. The
                        day of her victory is just being ushered in. One would think that the
                        Democrat who had suffered defeat so long would feel like sticking to his
                        party until the tide would turn. But a few--and they were very few--deceived
                        by the idea that such a large number of negro voters must give permanent
                        success to the Radicals, abandoned their old party in the belief that they
                        were about to get upon the winning side. We congratulate them upon their
                        choice, and trust that they will not attempt to crawl back into the
                        Democratic ranks, now that victory has perched upon our banner.</p>
                    <p>Let one universal shout go up from the throats of Conservative men for this
                        glorious victory in the Sixteenth District.</p>
