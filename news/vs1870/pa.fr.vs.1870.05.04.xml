                <summary>The paper accuses Forbes, who Grant appointed Philadelphia invalid pension
                    agent, of corruption in office. One of his clerks allegedly defrauded the
                    government of $2,000, and Forbes himself has grown suspiciously wealthy while in
                    office. "Such is Radicalism. It has become so accustomed to stealing from the
                    Government that it regards it no crime now to rob the men who have been maimed
                    in their country's service."</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The last Legislature was made up of a precious set of rascals in the main.
                        The idea seemed to prevail among them that they had been sent there to make
                        as much money for themselves as possible without regard to the interests or
                        wishes of their constituents. The most unblushing frauds were perpetrated.
                        Bills were passed in a manner that ought to have crimsoned the cheek of any
                        member with shame, and yet they all, innocent and guilty, preserved an
                        unblushing front and regarded these outrageous frauds as excellent jokes.</p>
                    <p>One of the boldest and biggest of these practical jokes, was that perpetrated
                        upon Senator Kerr who was a member of the committee to determine the
                        contested election between Watt and Diamond. It will be remembered that
                        Diamond was the recipient of a majority of the votes, but by altering the
                        figures and thus changing the count--an alteration palpable upon the face of
                        the record--Watt was declared elected. Being a Radical, the Radical majority
                        in the Senate decided that the <emph rend="italic">prima facie</emph> right
                        to the seat belonged to him. Then came the contest and, during the whole
                        session, it waxed hot and fierce. From all accounts, money was offered
                        freely. The Sunday Morning <emph rend="italic">Times</emph> of Philadelphia
                        of the 24th ult. gave a detailed account of this transaction which will be
                        so full of interest and novelty to our readers, that we give it at length:</p>
                    <p>The contest lasted long and weary weeks. In the beginning of it, the friends
                        of Watt seemed to think that Senator Kerr was getting weak in their cause,
                        and by some legerdemain he was approached to know what was the matter." Long
                        and confidential conferences were held, and it was proposed to give the
                        virtuous Senator a "divvy of $5000, to keep him straight," and faithful to
                        his party. The unsophisticated must not suppose that contested cases are
                            <emph rend="italic">always</emph> decided upon their merits--for this is
                        not so. The party which can "come down" the heaviest, generally carries the
                        day as Napoleon said of heavy artillery in war.</p>
                    <p>The matter was broached to the honorable Senator, and to the intense surprise
                        of the party concerned in the negotiations, it was discovered that <emph
                            rend="italic">Kerr could get ten thousand dollars from the
                        Democrats!</emph> to go for Diamond, but if his Republican friends wanted to
                        "hold him"--why they must "go two thousand better!"</p>
                    <p>After some parleying, this sum was agreed upon, as the "consideration" for
                        the Senator sticking to his party.</p>
                    <p>The honorable Senator named Alex. Leslie, Republican Representative from
                        Allegheny county as his "friend." (These "little matters, are always "fixed"
                        through "mutual friends" in the confidence of both the contracting parties,
                        so as not to compromise their principals). A meeting was arranged in a
                        private room of one of the Harrisburg hotels.</p>
                    <p>It appears that Representative Wm. M. Bunn, of the Eleventh Legislative
                        District (him of the heavy knapsack, who is a candidate for register of
                        Wills, and one of the shrewdest, sharpest, and cutest little fellows ever
                        sent to the Legislature from Philadelphia), was selected to conduct the
                        negotiations on the part of "the party of the first part," who were to
                        furnish the money to buy Kerr's vote.</p>
                    <p>The two gentlemen met. As it would not be honorable to betray confidence, we
                        can assert decidedly that neither one ever "blowed" on the other, and, as it
                        would be impossible to tell the story correctly without describing what
                        transpired in that room, we had recourse to a clairvoyant who detailed, with
                        great minuteness the "doings" inside, thusly:</p>
                    <p>First, the door was locked, and after a short chat, "without any reserve,"
                        Bunn produced a large official envelope, containing twelve $1000 greenbacks.
                        These were duly counted, to see that "everything was right." The report was,
                        telegraphically, "O.K."<lb/> "That's a pretty good rake," observed Leslie.
                        "I think I ought to have a divvy in that--don't you think so?" he remarked
                        to Bunn. "Just as you please replied Bunn. "I have performed my part in the
                        transaction, to deliver it to you, and I have nothing to say as to what
                        disposition you shall make of it."</p>
                    <p>After some "chaffering," the disinterested Leslie, believing that "a slice
                        off a cut loaf would not be missed," took one $1000 bill from the package,
                        and our clairvoyant alleges retained it for his services.</p>
                    <p>The envelope was then duly sealed--with red sealing wax--with a signet ring
                        bearing the initials "W.M.B.," and the handsome young Bunn was in the act of
                        delivering it to Leslie, when--</p>
                    <p>Rap! rap! rap! --echoed from the locked door. Instantly the careful Bunn
                        slipped the envelope into his breast pocket, and going to the door, unlocked
                        it and admitted a new comer, who poked his head in and remarked Paul-Pry
                        like--</p>
                    <p>"Ah! beg pardon, gentlemen. Hope I don't intrude or interrupt any private
                        business?--eh?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh! no--not at all," ejaculated Bunn and Leslie in the same breath. "Sit
                        down."</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I won't stay. I see you're engaged, but I hope you will pardon me
                        for the intrusion."</p>
                    <p>"Certainly--certainly," <sic>quoth</sic> Bunn and his companion
                        simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>The intruder departed, when Bunn took from his pocket an envelope, with a big
                        seal on it, and handed it to the innocent and unsuspecting Leslie, who
                        received it in joyful anticipation of another "divvy" out of the
                        contents--perhaps. The understanding was that it was to be deposited in a
                        bank in Harrisburg, subject to the order of Senator Kerr or his friend
                        Leslie, and it was stipulated that it was not to be opened till the
                        Senator's vote was given for Watt.</p>
                    <p>"This condition," drily remarked the careful Bunn, "is hardly
                            necessary--<emph rend="italic">but you know, my dear</emph> Mr. Leslie,
                            <emph rend="italic">these things are never paid for till the work is
                            done!</emph>" Sagacious Bunn!</p>
                    <p>The parting scene between the two friends was truly affecting. It deserves to
                        be immortalized on canvas, by the pencil of a Rothermel, or preserved in
                        imperishable marble, in a group by Rogers. The outstretched hands--the
                        cordial grasp--were almost too much for Bunny." He nearly wept, as choking
                        with emotion, he said to Leslie--</p>
                    <p>"Take it! It's all I could get! I wish it were twice as much"--(aside, the
                        package was not worth <emph rend="italic">two cents!</emph>) But we draw the
                        curtain upon the scene. They ordered up a bottle of Dry Verzenay, and
                        tossing off a bumper, separated.</p>
                    <p>Faithful to the bargain, the envelope with the big seal was duly deposited in
                        a highly respectable banking house in Harrisburg, to await the issue of the
                        contest,--one of the conditions of the contract being that the package was
                        to be retained by the party of the first part, in the event of the Senator
                        "going back" on them.</p>
                    <p>Our readers are aware that good faith was kept--that Kerr "voted right," and
                        that Watt was admitted--but they will be astonished when they are told that,
                        on the package being delivered to and opened by a confidential friend of the
                        Senator, it was found to be filled <emph rend="italic">with brown wrapping
                            paper!</emph></p>
                    <p>The Senator did not know who to charge with stealing the money. It is
                        reported that he waxed furious and refused to be comforted. He piled his
                        maledictions on Leslie's head, whilst the current of opinion seems to be
                        that the blooming Bunn <emph rend="italic">made the eleven thousand</emph>.
                        He is charged with having had <emph rend="italic">two</emph> envelopes
                        exactly similar, and sealed alike, and when the friend rapped at the door,
                        he slipped the one containing the money into his pocket, and when the door
                        was closed, drew the one containing the brown paper from his pocket and
                        handed it to Senator Kerr's friend. And this is a sample of the corruption
                        and knavery that exist at the State Capitol. Radicalism, with its fearful
                        sweep of power for evil, has done all this. For ten years, it has controlled
                        our State Legislature and made its very name a by-word and reproach in the
                        nation. How long will the people submit to be governed by such rascals.</p>

                    Clugston's store tried to escape by using blankets to climb over the wall. Two

                    month sentence in the Eastern Penitentiary.</summary>

                        Philip Weirich, some orders in regard to his saddle and bridle, but in such
                        insolent manner that Weirich told Streets that he had charge of the stable
                        and took care of things in his own way whereupon Streets pulled a revolver
                        and fired at Weirich, but missed him. Streets attempted the second shot, but
                        the hostler was too quick for him, and struck him on the side of <sic>the

                <transcript>
                    <p>Tuesday of last week was set apart by the Colored League for the celebration
                        of the pretended ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in this State. The
                        Chambersburg colored folks entered into the spirit of it with great zeal.
                        The Fayetteville Band, composed of white men, was hired by the negroes to
                        play all day for them. The Band headed the procession which marched through
                        the principal streets, carefully avoiding "Wolffstown." At two o'clock P.
                        M., a meeting was held at the Court House, which was addressed by Joseph R.
                        Winters (colored), William Hall (colored), Rev. Mr. M'Keehan (white) Ashford
                        T. Collins (colored), Lyman S. Clarke, Esq., (white), J. R. Winters
                        (colored), I. H. McCauley, Esq., (white) and S.R. Mendenhall (colored).</p>
                    <p>The Washington darkies, who were here as the representatives of President
                        Grant, instructed the blacks here that they hold the balance of power in
                        this County and that they should demand their share of the offices. This is
                        undoubtedly the true position. The negroes are the equals of the whites at
                        the ballot box. Let them give their white cronies, who prate so loudly of
                        their excessive love for them, to understand that they must prove their
                        faith by their works. For instance, why should not the negroes be
                        represented in the Town Council? "Wolffstown" has never been properly cared
                        for and never will be as long as white Radicals are the Borough officers.
                        Let the colored men put one of their own number into the Council and he can
                        see to it that something is done for the purification of that neighborhood
                        from the filth which is allowed to accumulate there. By all means let the
                        negroes demand that one of their number be nominated on the Radical ticket
                        next Fall for the Town Council.</p>
                    <p>And inasmuch as there are said to be about seven hundred negro voters in the
                        county, there is no reason why they should not be allowed a candidate on the
                        Radical county ticket--for instance, Jury Commissioner. He could then see to
                        it that his race would be properly represented in the jury box. Or County
                        Commissioner. He could then protect his colored friends from sentences for
                        costs which are imposed upon them by the Court for trivial offences, and for
                        which they are obliged to remain a considerable time in jail. Or Director of
                        the Poor. He could then secure admission to that establishment for many
                        needy persons of color whom Radical Stewards have heretofore refused to
                        admit.</p>
                    <p>By all means, let the <sic>Radials</sic> do their duty to these "colored
                        wards of the nation."</p>
