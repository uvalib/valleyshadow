                    <p>You were opposed to negro suffrage. You expected to get a chance to vote on
                        the question. Your leaders promised you that chance. They were false to
                        their promises. They took advantage of your confidence. They procured your
                        votes by false pretences. They packed your State Legislature. The Radical
                        majority of that Legislature ratified the Fifteenth Amendment. They did this
                        although they knew that you were opposed to it. They did this although they
                        were convinced that in Pennsylvania there was a majority of one hundred
                        thousand against it. They did this although many of them had solemnly
                        promised <emph rend="italic">not</emph> to do it. Now they deny that they
                        ever promised you a chance to vote on the question.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of this betrayal, the negro is invested with the right of
                        suffrage. He votes without your consent. He votes against your wishes. By a
                        base fraud he has been placed upon terms of political equality with you.</p>
                    <p>Fanaticism is aggressive. This negro-mania is the worst kind of fanaticism.
                        It apparently knows no restraint. By its broken pledges, negroes are voters
                        to-day. It aims at still further conquests. It seeks to break down other
                        barriers. The schools must be thrown open to negroes as well as whites. They
                        must be allowed to occupy the same seats in the cars as whites. There must
                        be no distinction on account of color in churches or cemeteries. The
                        theatres and all places of public amusement must grant them admittance. The
                        hotels must give them the same accommodations as they give to whites.
                        Negroes must sit as jurors. They must be commissioned as Justices of the
                        Peace. Already Governor Geary has appointed two of them Notaries Public.
                        They must serve as Constables. They have acted as Assistant Marshals to take
                        the census. They must go to your State Legislature to make laws for you.
                        They must be elected to Congress to represent your interests there. They
                        must receive appointments to cadetships in the Military and Naval Academies
                        in preference to your sons. They must be elevated to the high positions of
                        honor in your State. Emboldened by these privileges and honors, they will
                        demand entrance into your family <unclear>circles</unclear>. <emph

                        Radical banners.</p>
                    <p>This is the programme which Radicalism is preparing for you. Will you aid its
                        treacherous leaders in carrying out this programme? We trust not. Now is the
                        time to frustrate their plans. As white men, cast your votes with the White
                        Man's Party for the White Man's ticket.</p>

                        <emph rend="italic">Democrats of Franklin County:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>Do not fail to go to the polls. Your votes are of tremendous importance. The
                        Radicals are saying: "We can not get our vote out. If the Democrats get
                        their's out, we are beaten." Let us show them that Democrats are awake to
                        the issues of the hour and by going to the polls, and voting, let us beat
                        the Radical ticket. The negroes will be marched up to the polls and voted
                        for the Radical candidates. White Conservative Republicans will be disgusted
                        at this, and stay away, or vote the Democratic ticket.--Let us unite our
                        forces with the Conservative Republican forces, and administer an
                        overwhelming defeat to the men who rely on negroes to elect them.</p>
                    <p>Democrats: You carried this county last year by 308 majority. Six hundred
                        negroes in the county have been enfranchised since. Republicans who voted
                        against you then, are appealing to you now to cast the same vote at the
                        coming election that you did last year, and they are assuring you that they
                        will furnish the requisite number of votes to neutralize the negro vote
                        altogether. <emph rend="italic">Let no Democrat stay away</emph>. Let us
                        show the Radicals that the negroes do not hold the balance of power in
                        Franklin County.--Let every one of us devote the second Tuesday of October
                        to the work of crushing Radicalism, with its horrid negro-equality and
                        negro-superiority doctrines, out of existence. <emph rend="italic">A full
                            Democratic vote will carry the County by five hundred majority</emph>.
                        Let no Democrat fail in his duty now. The question, "shall negroes rule this
                        government?" is to be answered next Tuesday. Let every Democrat answer <emph
                            rend="italic">no</emph> by depositing his vote in the ballot box for the
                        Democratic candidates.</p>

                    <p>The facility with which some men turn their backs upon their own records, is
                        amazing. To hear Cessna parading his own loyalty, boasting of it, and
                        quoting the figures to show his standing in Bedford county in 1861 and 1862,
                        and then to listen to him ventilating the Ku-Klux record of his competitor,
                        a stranger would think that he had waded up to his knees in blood for the
                        Union or at least sacrificed the greater portion of his wealth in the great
                        cause of crushing the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Or to see him in his clownish performances for the amusement of the colored
                        folks--intonating his sweet voice so as to imitate, at one moment, the
                        shrill chorus of the Katydids and at another the sepulchral notes of the
                        "Bloody-nouns"--throwing himself into all sorts of antic postures and
                        displaying all the activity and wiriness of a gymnast on the trapeze, one in
                        ignorance of his past life would naturally suppose that he was one of the
                        original abolitionists, a Wendell Phillips agitator--that his soul and that
                        of John Brown had marched side by side--that his loyal heart had bounded
                        with ecstatic throbs when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, and that
                        he had welcomed the liberated negroes to the soil of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>And yet, strange to say, notwithstanding all his loyal bawling, <emph
                            rend="italic">he did nothing of the kind</emph>. None of his precious
                        blood was spilled upon the battle field. The nearest point he occupied to
                        the scene of carnage was Harrisburg during the battle of Gettysburg. He was
                        there seeking the "Copperhead" nomination for Governor whilst the Union boys
                        were laying down their lives as so many sacrifices upon the altar of their
                        country. Cessna was as patriotic as the late lamented Artemus Ward, who
                        expressed his willingness to sacrifice all his wife's relations to the
                        Moloch of war.</p>
                    <p>Nor did he impoverish himself by the magnitude of his contributions in money
                        to the cause of the Union. Somehow--we do not pretend to know how--he
                        managed to amass a splendid fortune, and is to-day three times richer than
                        when the first gun was fired at <sic>Sumpter</sic>.</p>
                    <p>But some one, anxious to excuse this demagogue, will say, "if he did not shed
                        his blood, or give his money, he at least had words of encouragement for the
                        poor blacks who were released from slavery." <emph rend="italic">Alas! this
                            is a mistake also</emph>. This truckler to the negroes of this
                        Congressional district would fain persuade them that he has been their fast
                        friend all through the war--that he had conscientious scruples on the
                        subject of slavery as far back as 1858--that he gloried in the movement
                        which struck the shackles from their feet, and that he has been a constant
                        and an earnest advocate of the claims of the black man for equality with
                        whites.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">But in this he is acting the hypocrite</emph>. He
                        complains in his letter of acceptance that he is charged with being a
                        "Copperhead" because he was a Democrat. Now the common meaning of the word
                        "Copperhead," during the war, was a man who opposed the Lincoln
                        Administration. What was Cessna's attitude towards the Administration? We
                        have shown heretofore that he was in the House of Representatives at
                        Harrisburg in the Winters of 1861-2 and 1862-63 <emph rend="italic">as a
                            Democrat</emph>. In January 1863, he was elected Speaker of the House
                            <emph rend="italic">by the Democrats</emph>. During the session of 1863,
                            <emph rend="italic">he drew a bill to prevent negroes from coming from
                            other States into Pennsylvania</emph>. That bill was introduced and
                        after some of its harshest features had been stricken out, it passed the
                        House by a vote of 52 yeas to 40 nays, <emph rend="italic">Cessna's name
                            being recorded among the yeas</emph>. It can be seen on page 545 of the
                        Legislative Record for the Session of 1863 and is as follows:</p>
                    <p>SECTION 1. <emph rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
                            Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly
                            met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same</emph>, That
                        from and after the passage of this act it shall not be lawful for any negro
                        or mulatto to come into this State from any other State or territory, with
                        the intention of making it their temporary or permanent place of residence,
                        and any negro or mulatto so offending shall be liable to be punished by
                        indictment and on conviction thereof be fined in any sum not exceeding one
                        hundred dollars and be imprisoned in the county jail for a period not
                        exceeding one year, or both or either, in the discretion of the court.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 2. That if any person or persons shall bring or cause to be brought
                        into this State any negro or mulatto slave, whether said slave is set free
                        or not, shall be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
                        thereof shall be fined for every such negro or mulatto in any sum not
                        exceeding five hundred dollars, and shall undergo imprisonment for a period
                        not exceeding one year, or both or either, in the discretion of the court.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 3. It is hereby made the duty of every sheriff, constable and police
                        officer of any county or city, township or borough, upon information being
                        given by any citizen or from their own personal knowledge of the presence of
                        any such negro or mulatto, to arrest him, her or them forthwith, and convey
                        them to the nearest magistrate or alderman, who shall give them a fair and
                        impartial hearing, and if upon such investigation it shall appear that they
                        have not been residents of this State prior to the passage of this act, it
                        shall be the duty of such justice of the peace or alderman to bind them over
                        to the next court of quarter sessions of the peace, and on failure of such
                        negro or mulatto to give security for their appearance to commit them to the
                        jail of the proper county: <emph rend="italic">Provided</emph>, That nothing
                        in this act contained shall be construed to apply to teamsters temporarily
                        within this State.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that in the first section, Cessna wished to impose a fine of
                        $100 and send the negro or mulatto to the county jail for a year, <emph
                            rend="italic">simply for coming into this State</emph>. This fine was
                        reduced to $20 and instead of imprisonment the offender was to be removed to
                        the State or territory from whence he came.</p>
                    <p>And now the little hypocrite is courting the negro vote.</p>
                    <p>The second section as drawn by Cessna , it will be observed, punishes any
                        person who might <emph rend="italic">innocently</emph> bring any negro or
                        mulatto into the State in violation of this proposed law. This was amended
                        so as to apply only to persons who should <emph rend="italic"
                        >knowingly</emph> bring negroes or mulattoes into the State in violation of
                        this proposed law. Cessna had no commiseration for any one who might
                        innocently offend against the statute. If he brought a negro into
                        Pennsylvania, that was enough in his judgment, to subject him to severe
                        pains and penalties.</p>
                    <p>And now the little hypocrite is courting the negro vote.</p>
                    <p>An effort was made by Mr. Cochran, of Philadelphia, to amend the third
                        section so as to protect the black men who had enlisted in the army or navy.
                        The amendment offered by him was as follows:</p>
                    <p>"<emph rend="italic">Provided</emph>, That nothing in this act shall apply to
                        any colored person in the military or naval service of the United States."</p>
                    <p>It was defeated by a vote of 37 yeas to 50 nays, and <emph rend="italic"
                            >Cessna's vote is recorded among the nays</emph>. The colored soldier
                        was an object of special hatred to him then. If the black man who had
                        enlisted under the "Banner of the Stars," either in the army or navy,
                        happened to step upon Pennsylvania soil, <emph rend="italic">Cessna desired
                            him to be flung into the nearest county prison</emph>.</p>
                    <p>And now the little hypocrite is courting the negro vote.</p>
                    <p>The two leading Republicans in the House at that time were Mr. Champneys, of
                        Lancaster, and Mr. Shannon, of Allegheny. Both were unsparing in their
                        denunciations of this bill, Mr. Shannon remarking:</p>
                    <p>"This bill is so utterly unconstitutional, and so <emph rend="italic"
                            >inhuman, barbarous and monstrous</emph> in its provisions, that I agree
                        with my friends on this side of the House that the best plan we can adopt is
                        not to enter upon its discussion. I enter my protest against the measure
                        because of its utter unconstitutionality, its inhumanity and its barbarity."</p>
                    <p>Cessna was the author of this "unconstitutional, barbarous and monstrous
                        bill."</p>
                    <p>And now the little hypocrite is courting the negro votes.</p>
                    <p>Now, let him who is inclined to believe in Cessna's loud-mouthed professions
                        of loyalty during the war, remember at what period it was that he was
                        throwing his vote and his influence against the Lincoln Administration.
                            <emph rend="italic">It was just after the issuing of the Emancipation
                            Proclamation</emph>. It will be remembered that Mr. Lincoln issued a
                        preliminary proclamation on the 22nd day of September, A. D., 1862, and the
                        Emancipation Proclamation on the 1st day of January, A. D., 1863. On the 6th
                        day of January, A. D., 1863, Cessna was elected Speaker of the House of
                        Representatives. Soon afterwards he drew the bill now under consideration
                        and had it introduced and passed in the House. <emph rend="italic">His
                            evident purpose was to thwart Mr. Lincoln's intentions in relation to
                            the negro</emph>. The President had declared the slaves free. The idea
                        was prevalent that the emancipated slaves would rush from the border States
                        into Pennsylvania as soon as they could get away from their masters.--<emph
                            rend="italic">Cessna concocted this scheme to prevent the negroes,
                            fleeing from bondage, from crossing our State line</emph>. Was he a
                        "Copperhead" or not?</p>
                    <p>And now the little hypocrite is courting the negro vote.</p>
                    <p>If the negroes could read and understand this bill, they would visit this
                        screeching, bellowing loyalist with the defeat which his hypocrisy deserves.
                        We are not writing this with a view to obtain their votes, however. Not a
                        half dozen of them will see and read this article. It will be studiously
                        kept from them. Cessna's agents here will readily see its damaging
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>But our appeal is to Conservative white men--to men who have acted with the
                        Radical party heretofore and who are now solicited to vote for Cessna on the
                        ground of his tried loyalty. To them we say Cessna's loyalty is a sham--it
                        is a monstrous fraud. We aver that in all Mr. Meyers' record, there is no
                        word, written or spoken, or no vote, which is so indicative of
                        "Copperheadism" as this bill, drawn by the now immaculately loyal Cessna, to
                        prevent negroes from coming into Pennsylvania.</p>

                    <p>The Income Tax oppresses the well-to-do business man--the man of activity and
                        energy. It falls with unequal force upon the life and enterprise of a
                        community. <emph rend="italic">This tax is one of the iniquities of Radical
                            legislation</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The Income Tax is odious to the poor man because it is inquisitorial in its
                        nature. It opens up his private business affairs to the eye of the curious
                        world. <emph rend="italic">This tax had died, but it was resurrected by a
                            Radical Congress</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The Income Tax necessitates a horde of officials, and gives a pretence for
                        saddling the people with the salaries of an equal number of <emph
                            rend="italic">unnecessary</emph> officials. All this needless
                        expenditure comes out of the pockets of the people. <emph rend="italic">The
                            people clamored for the death of this tax, but it was doctored by a
                            Radical Congress and it still lives to plague and oppress the toiling
                            millions</emph>.</p>

                    <p>We never did like this thing of "blowing hot and cold." Cessna was one of the
                        Vice Presidents, a few years ago, of the National Temperance Convention. He
                        has always busied himself in the outside work of getting up State Temperance
                        Conventions and then refused to participate openly in the proceedings <emph
                            rend="italic">for the reason that it was impolitic</emph>. Now with all
                        his pretensions in favor of Temperance and against men who are engaged in
                        the liquor business, he is spending money freely to buy whisky for the
                        colored voters. He is thus endeavoring to get the support of the
                        prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mahon is doing the same thing. Whilst he is one of the strictest members
                        of the Good Templars, he winks at and encourages those who are commissioned
                        to procure "the floating vote" by furnishing as much liquor as is needed. We
                        like to see a man practice the principles which he advocates. If he is
                        opposed to the sale of liquor altogether and in favor of the abolition of
                        the license system as Mr. Mahon is, then he ought to avow his sentiments
                        openly when he is a candidate as well as when he is not a candidate.</p>

                        disgusted with negro suffrage and intends to vote the Democratic
                        ticket--that "if he votes the Democratic ticket, he will never give him any
                        more work, or do him any more favors." As the man threatened is a <emph

                        the United States District Court at Philadelphia to be tried for his
                        offence. What a disadvantage it is to be a White man!</p>

                    <p>To the men of Franklin County who have claims for losses sustained during the
                        rebellion, we say that it is to your interest to elect the Democratic
                        candidates for the Legislature. Both Capt. Skinner and Dr. Milliken labored
                        assiduously last Winter to procure the passage of a bill indemnifying you
                        for your losses. They won an enviable reputation, even among those who
                        opposed the bill, for the zeal and ability which they displayed. It was
                        conceded by the opponents of the measure, that they did everything that
                        could be done, under the circumstances, in its favor.</p>
                    <p>Now what would be the effect of their defeat? If another bill were presented
                        next session, by Mr. Mahon, or Mr. Fosselman, the enemies of the movement
                        would say to him, "Your people are not in favor of this bill. Skinner and
                        Milliken labored with praiseworthy activity last session, doing all that men
                        could do, and their constituents have condemned their course. How can they
                        expect us to support the bill when its able advocates have been slaughtered
                        at home?"</p>
                    <p>We call the attention of the citizens of Franklin County to this view of the
                        situation. Let them think of it seriously before they throw another obstacle
                        in the way of the success of the Border Claim Bill. Your brightest prospect
                        of procuring payment for your losses, is in the re-election of Skinner and
                        Milliken.</p>

                    <p>The Radical speakers are now trying to joke at the idea of amalgamation
                        between the whites and blacks. A Mr. Chance, of Ohio, was substituted for
                        Cessna to play the clown for the negroes on Tuesday night of last week in
                        the Court House. He said, among other humorous things, that if a negro woman
                        could be found sufficiently degraded to marry a Democrat, he would sentence
                        her to read the <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph> for six months.</p>
                    <p>He is a real funny fellow. We were very much amused at him on the day that
                        Van Amburgh's Menagerie was in town. Our readers will remember the
                        individual who descanted upon the weight and beauty of the "fat woman" and
                        the extraordinary docility of the "live, livin' rattlesnakes."--This is the
                        same fellow. The Menagerie exhibited in Bedford, and Cessna, not being slow
                        to recognize the chap's power to amuse the negroes, immediately decoyed him
                        away from Van Amburgh and by "shelling out" liberally from his $100,000,
                        struck a bargain at once. The negroes are overjoyed at Cessna's happy idea.
                        They say they want the Menagerie fellow back again.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Last Thursday evening Col. Elder, Grimeson, Cook, Hays, Seiders and Mahon
                        assembled the negroes together in the "Carrstown" African Church of this
                        Borough for a little private confab. They intended to have the whole affair
                        to themselves, but neither bolts nor bars can exclude the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> reporter, and he was, of course, on hand.</p>
                    <p>It was interesting to witness the glow of fraternal affection which illumined
                        the countenances of the speakers as well as the auditors. The whites
                        endeavored to act as though they considered themselves equal to the blacks,
                        and the negroes, from their manner, condescended to allow them to think so
                        for the time. The following speakers addressed the motley assemblage, in the
                        order which we give: Joseph R. Winters, colored, Ashford Collins, colored,
                        S. Wilson Hays, white, Lyman S. Clark, white, T.M. Mahon, white, and Col.
                        F.S. Stumbaugh, white. Col. Elder was called on, but excused himself on
                        account of the lateness of the hour. Phil. Hamman responded to vociferous
                        calls by saying that he was no speaker (and if there is anything Hamman is
                        proud of it is his elocutionary power) but he would tell them a <emph
                            rend="italic">new</emph> story. He thereupon proceeded to give them
                        "Betsy and the Bear" with illustrations. By the way, Cessna would have done
                        far better to have employed Hamman to address the negroes of the District
                        than by stealing that Mr. Chance from Mr. Van Amburgh's Menagerie.</p>
                    <p>We have not space to publish all the speeches that were made. As Mr. Mahon is
                        the Radical candidate for the Legislature, and as the meeting was gotten up
                        chiefly for his benefit, we instructed our reporter to take special pains to
                        report him accurately. This he insists he has done, and alleges that his
                        report will be acknowledged, by the Radicals who were present, as strictly
                        correct. We take pleasure in laying the remarks of the Radical candidate
                        before our readers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mahon said:</p>
                    <p>I am happy--indeed I am--to be allowed to say a few words to my colored
                        friends. I was born in 1840, at Greenvillage, an abolitionist. I was cradled
                        an abolitionist.--I voted when I was twenty-one years of age. My father and
                        mother were not afraid to teach me what was right. A Christian mother taught
                        me not to be ashamed of the colored people, or to stand up for justice and
                        right. (Cries of "Amen" from the negroes and Grimeson, Seiders &amp;
                        Co.)</p>
                    <p>I have never been ashamed of the colored people, and I never will be. I am
                        not like my Democratic friends who will soon be seen coming around, with
                        their hats under their arms, trying to get the votes of colored men. They
                        are the ones who wished to keep the colored man in slavery. Now they deny
                        it. This reminds me of the story of the Irishman and the Bull. An Irishman
                        was chased by a mad Bull to a fence, over which he was hoisted by a poke in
                        his "hind-end." Picking himself up, and looking round, he saw the Bull
                        shaking his head, as much as to say, "I didn't do it." This made the
                        Irishman mad. "You lie," said he, "you murtherin haythen; yez did it on
                        purpose." Now, I wish my colored friends to follow the Irishman's example,
                        and say to the Democrats "you needn't deny it, you bloody rebel heathens,
                        you did it on purpose." (Cries of "yes, yes," "amen," &amp;c., from the
                        negroes with clapping of hands and stamping of feet for Seiders, Hamman
                        &amp; Co.) I have seen the colored men fight. (He must have meant on
                        Water Street the night of the procession--Local Rep.) I know that they did
                        it well. They performed their duty. I consider no man a true American
                        citizen who thinks otherwise. I have mingled with colored people all my life
                        and have never received any bad treatment at their hands. I intend to stand
                        up for liberty, justice, right, and equality in spite of prejudice. I am not
                        afraid to run on a ticket which some time ago everyone said would be beaten.
                        I would not be ashamed to run on a ticket with a colored man. I have always
                        trusted the colored man and I believe that they trust me. If I was as sure
                        of <emph rend="italic">every</emph> vote in the County as I am of every
                        colored vote, I could count 8599 as my majority over Skinner. And this
                        reminds me of another story. Jim and Bill went out on a "lark"--got devilish
                        full--saw a gas light in the distance. Jim said it was the sun. Bill told
                        him he lied, it was the moon. They agreed to leave it to a third party whom
                        they met, in the same condition as themselves. Third party knew nothing
                        about it, "being a stranger in the place." Jim got home and wanted some
                        milk--couldn't find it--asked his wife whether it was "laying around loose
                        or tied up in a rag."</p>
                    <p>I think that after the election, the Democrats will be so badly beaten that
                        they won't know whether they are "laying around loose, or tied up in a
                    rag."</p>
