<b>A New Scheme for Robbing the People--$300,000 of the People's Money Taken

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Radical officials always seem to be on the look-out for some mode of
                        "bleeding" the government. For ten years, they have been fattening upon the
                        rich spoils of office. In that period, more money has been stolen from the
                        National Treasury than during any ten previous years in the history of the
                        republic.</p>
                    <p>One of the latest forays made upon the treasury, is adroitly twisted into a
                        grand act of magnanimity and generosity on the part of certain
                        office-holders. We refer to what is called the New Pension Law. Prior to the
                        passage of this act by Congress last winter, the agents for paying pensions
                        received fifteen cents on each voucher. The
                        payments were semi-annual so that the agent received on each pension thirty cents per annum. This was deducted from the
                        amount allowed by the Government to the pensioner.</p>
                    <p>But the agents for paying pensioners were not satisfied with these fees,
                        although a very respectable salary was attached to their office in addition.
                        They accordingly concocted a scheme to fleece the government. They raised a
                        hue and cry against claim agents throughout the country, charging them with
                        exacting exorbitant sums from the pensioners for the preparation of their
                        papers. After the public mind was thoroughly prepared, they procured the
                        passage of the act under which pensions are paid at present. The act allows
                        the pension agent thirty cents on each voucher
                        and makes the payments quarterly. In this way he
                        gets on each pension one dollar and twenty cents
                        per annum instead of thirty cents as before.</p>
                    <p>This amount seems small when viewed in the light of a single case. But let us
                        see. On the roll of the Invalid Pension Agency at Philadelphia, there are
                        about ten thousand names. The Invalid Pension
                        Agent receives one dollar and twenty cents on each of these, making twelve thousand dollars per annum. His salary is
                            four thousand dollars in addition, so that
                        the Invalid Pension Agent's pay is sixteen
                        thousand dollars per annum--almost as much as the pay of the General of the
                        Army of the United States, perquisites included, or an amount equal to
                        two-thirds of the pay of the President of the United States, gifts excluded.</p>
                    <p>But again. On the roll of the Philadelphia Agency for paying Widows'
                        Pensions, there are about twelve thousand
                        names.--The Agent is allowed one dollar and twenty cents per year on each
                        pension making the comfortable little sum of fourteen
                            thousand four hundred dollars. Add to this the salary of the
                        office, four thousand dollars, and we have as his
                        annual income eighteen thousand four hundred
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this, it was shown during the trial of the case of the
                        Commonwealth vs. George B. Thatcher in Philadelphia, recently, that the
                        scoundrel who occupies the position of Agent for paying Invalid pensioners
                        in that city has been in the habit of advancing money to the wounded and
                        maimed veterans of the Union army at exorbitant
                        rates. By such base means, he is growing rich and at the same time is
                        trying to make himself popular with "loil" people by circulating the
                        statement that he assisted in relieving each of the poor pensioners, from
                        the payment of thirty cents per annum. True it is
                        that he has done this, but in doing it he has sunk his long fingers into the
                        National Treasury and taken out one dollar and twenty
                            cents for himself on every case on which the pensioner before
                        paid him thirty cents. Such patriotism pays.</p>
                    <p>Then, it must be remembered, that the Philadelphia Agency is not the only one
                        in the country. There are scores of these agencies. We do not know how
                        many.--But we can approximate the sum that this patriotic change costs the
                        government. In 1869 there were about 135,000 Widows' Pension cases on the
                        records in the Pension office. Allowing $1.20 on each case, we have the sum
                        of one hundred and sixty-two thousand dollars
                        paid annually to the Agents for paying Widows' pensions, under this new act
                        which was framed, as these Agents would have us believe, out of motives of
                        pure patriotism. Taking the same number of Invalid Pension cases (and we
                        presume the number of them is greater,) we have upwards of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars paid
                        annually by the government to these officials who prate about their loyalty.
                        And all this is done under the economical
                        administration of President Grant. This is a nut for the hard-working
                        tax-payers to crack.</p>
                    <p>It would have been well enough for Congress to relieve the pensioners from
                        the payment of all fees. But would not a salary of four thousand dollars
                        been ample to compensate the Agents for the work they have to perform? There
                        are thousands of competent gentlemen in the country who would gladly accept
                        these positions at that figure! Then why must this immense sum go out of the
                        National Treasury annually to enrich these greedy office-holders? The truth
                        is, that under the pretence of doing a generous act to the widows of our
                        dead soldiers and the maimed survivors of the war, these "loil" cormorants
                        have discovered an excellent mode of lining their pockets with "greenbacks"
                        at the expense of the people.</p>
                    <p>Now whilst the change had "bled" the government to this enormous extent, and
                        is enriching the pension agents, has it benefited the pensioner? We think
                        not. And we feel sure that before a year passes around, the pensioners will
                        say not. The old system was simple, prompt, and satisfactory. How is it with
                        the act of July 8th, 1870? First, it takes from the pensioner the right to
                        choose by whom, and in what manner, he or she will have the pension
                        collected.--There is no option. The voucher for the quarterly pension sent
                        out by the agent must be executed, and "none
                        other." In every county in this State, pensioners have entrusted
                        their business to Attorneys, in whom they confide implicitly. They have no
                        desire to dispense with their services and the majority of them will not do
                        it. They will consequently pay the same fees to their attorneys as before,
                        for the reason that they desire to have their vouchers filled properly.</p>
                    <p>Second, constant change of address will prevent pensioners receiving their
                        vouchers from the agents, and as they cannot get vouchers from any other
                        source, there must be considerable delay in receiving their money.</p>
                    <p>Third, the mode of payment is necessarily slow, inasmuch as a check must be
                        sent to each pensioner, and if the person receiving it lives at some
                        distance from a bank, he must get it cashed (perhaps at a discount) or must
                        go to the bank and take some responsible person along to identify him before
                        it will be paid.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, the pensioner must await the agent's pleasure, no one being allowed
                        to inquire into the case, or assist where errors have occurred.</p>
                    <p>Thus it will be seen that the pensioner is not benefited by this act, because
                        he must either employ some one to prepare his voucher carefully, or be
                        subjected to constant annoyance by having it returned on account of
                        imperfect execution.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the passage of this act, the amount was collected and paid without
                        trouble. The system was thorough, cheap and expeditious. Now, it is
                        difficult, expensive to the government, and full of delays.</p>
                    <p>But what matters it? The loyal scoundrels who have been robbing the
                        government for ten years, have only found another ingenious way of doing it
                        handsomely, and the people are expected to pay their taxes without a murmur
                        and shut their eyes so that they may not see where their money goes. Of all
                        the harpies that prey upon the government, the fellows who make loud
                        professions of patriotism are the meanest. These men whom we have thus
                        exposed are creatures of Grant's administration, and a Radical Congress has
                        thus authorized them to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. How
                        long, O Lord, how long will they be permitted to abuse our patience?</p>

<b>Not a Party Question</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims the Border Claims issue is not a party question, and praises local
                    Republicans for their support. However, the paper has nothing but contempt for

                    Democratic candidate Meyers did everything he could. Mainly an attack on Cessna
                    and not the Republicans as a whole.<br>(Names in announcement:  I. H. McCauley, Col. F. S. Stumbaugh,  John Cessna)</blockquote>

                    <p>We wish it to be distinctly understood that we are not making the Border
                        Claims question a party question. We
                        unequivocally deny that we are doing anything of the kind.</p>
                    <p>To I.H. McCauley Esq. and Col. F.S. Stumbaugh, gentlemen identified with the
                        Republican party, we give proper credit for their services in behalf of the
                        movement last Winter to procure the passage of a bill for the payment of our
                        people.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Repository, for the able
                        articles in its columns, and his personal efforts at Harrisburg and
                        Philadelphia, we render our tribute of commendation.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of Public Opinion, for his constant
                        fidelity to the cause, and his indefatigable zeal and well-timed comments,
                        we make our handsomest acknowledgments.</p>
                    <p>To the Republican citizens of Chambersburg, for their confidence in the
                        Committee and their approval of its actions, we feel profoundly grateful.</p>
                    <p>But to John Cessna, we owe no thanks, and we, therefore,
                            tender him none. He does not deserve any at the hands of the people of
                            Chambersburg, or Franklin county. Throughout the entire session
                        of the Legislature, whilst this bill was the important item of legislation
                        from this Congressional district, he contented himself with disposing of the
                        office to his own satisfaction (and, perhaps profit) and allowed the
                        Committee to struggle on without his powerful aid. He imagined that the best
                        way to carry this Congressional district in 1870 was to get fellows into all
                        the fat berths who would realize their indebtedness to him, and labor with
                        all their might to keep him in power. He is most supremely selfish, and, by
                        this short-sighted policy, he thought he was doing most to advance the
                        interests of John Cessna. We give him credit for "looking out for Number
                        One," but he has done nothing for the border claimants and he shall have no
                        credit for his indifference and inaction.</p>
                    <p>But whilst he was preparing the way for re-election to Congress, thinking of
                        nobody's interests but his own, Mr. Meyers, feeling that interest in the
                        movement that any resident of the 16th Congressional District, ought to have
                        felt, openly espoused our cause, and, in the columns of his
                        widely-circulated journal, and by word of mouth wherever and whenever
                        opportunity offered, ably advocated the justice of our claim for payment.
                        Call you this a party question? No. The conduct of the one is the
                        indifference of a politician who ought to have been shrewd enough (but was
                        not) to see that his chances of re-election, to some extent, depended upon
                        the assistance he would render, or at least tender, to this movement. The action of the other was prompted by an
                        earnest desire to render whatever service lay in his power to the plundered
                        people of the district of which he was a resident. Let us hear no more of
                        this being a party question. Cessna did nothing, and deserves nothing.</p>

                    <p>Part of Cessna's $100,000 has lodged in "Wolffstown." We heard of one of our
                        sable fellow citizens on Saturday evening who said he had just got fifteen dollars as his share of the corruption
                        fund. Fifteen dollars is a small sum to offer to
                        one of the leading darkies for his influence. The "colored troops" are very
                        foolish if they don't make these loyal patriots "shell out" liberally. They
                        have got the money. Let them distribute it.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday night last, a colored man, William Plowden, attacked a white man
                        named William Pomeroy, on Water street, without any provocation. He struck
                        him across the back with a stick as he was passing along the street, and
                        when Pomeroy inquired what that was for, the only reply he received was a
                        blow just above the left eye with a stone, which knocked him senseless.
                        Pomeroy lay there until some colored woman assisted him to rise and procured
                        medical assistance for him. His head was badly cut, but no serious results
                        are apprehended. Plowden has left the neighborhood.</p>
