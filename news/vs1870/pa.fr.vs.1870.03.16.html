<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, at
                        Harrisburg, have amended the bill for the payment of the border losses. Or
                        rather, they have substituted a new bill for the one that was originally
                        introduced by Mr. Dill, of Adams. That bill, it will be remembered, proposed
                        to take all the money out of the State Treasury at certain fixed dates,
                        without making provision in any way for supplying the requisite amount to
                        the Treasury. This bill is based upon a different principle. There is very
                        little money to be paid out of the Treasury immediately, under its
                        provisions, Certificates of indebtedness are to be issued to each claimant
                        for the full amount of his, or her claim, bearing five per cent, interest,
                        clear of all taxation, except that imposed under the laws of the United
                        States. And in order that these certificates may be redeemed by the State, a
                        separate Fund is established, into which shall flow all the revenues from
                        the counties named in the bill, and whenever the sum of one hundred thousand
                        dollars is realized from these sources, over and above the amount necessary
                        to pay the interest, it shall be applied to the purchase of certificates to
                        that amount, at whatever price they can be obtained, but they shall not be
                        redeemed at a price above their par value.</p>
                    <p>All the money that will come directly out of the Treasury will be as much as
                        is required to pay the claims under one hundred dollars, and the fractional
                        parts less than one hundred dollars of all claims exceeding one hundred
                        dollars. It is not apprehended that this amount will exceed one hundred
                        thousand dollars.</p>
                    <p>The State becomes the owner of these claims at once, and will, no doubt, make
                        an effort to collect the amount from the General Government. Whatever sum it
                        succeeds in collecting, is to be applied to the Fund created by this act.</p>
                    <p>As there has been such a terrible hue and cry about these claims having been
                        bought up by speculators at mere nominal figures, and being pressed by "a
                        powerful lobby" in the interest of these speculators, it may be well for
                        those who circulate and those who believe such statements, to turn their
                        attention to that portion of the bill which relates to assigned claims. The
                        permission is clear and distinct that the Assignees of such claims shall
                        only receive the amount which they paid for the same, and, on failure to
                        show how much was actually paid, the claims are to be
                            rejected altogether. This ought to shut the mouths of all the
                        hired libelers who have abused our people without stint, and sought to
                        prevent the recognition of the justice of these claims by the State, on the
                        grounds that they are in the hands of a few men who will grow immensely rich
                        if the Legislature should pass this bill. There is nothing more untrue. We
                        have again and again made the statement that not a
                            single claim in Franklin county has been assigned.
                        Notwithstanding this fact, several journals, both daily and weekly, have not
                        only refused to correct their gross misstatements, but, on the contrary,
                        have repeated them with greater emphasis and virulence. They have sinned
                        against us in the face of light, and knowledge. To such organs, there is
                        little use in appealing for justice. Yet, we are bound, in duty to our
                        people, to make another denial of these false charges. There has been no assignment of any claims. The truth of this
                        ought to be seen at a glance. The perfect cheerfulness with which everybody
                        receives this provision in the new bill in relation to assigned claims,
                        ought to convince any one, that the persons who are to receive payment, are
                        those who suffered the losses. If it were not so, a universal howl would go
                        up from the throats of the "speculators" and "thieves and robbers," who
                        would thus find their immense profits completely cut off.</p>
                    <p>Our people are not tanaceous about the particular features
                        of any bill. Of course, they would prefer to have the money paid down to
                        them at once. It would enable them to pay off their debts and relieve
                        themselves forthwith from the terrible anxiety of years. It would roll an
                        immense burden immediately from their shoulders. But they see the
                        difficulties which lie in the way of prompt and full payment in money, and
                        they do not ask the State to attempt an impossibility. And now, that the
                        Committee of Ways and Means have seen fit to substitute a new bill, by which
                        payment is to be made in certificates, they acquiesce heartily. They accept
                        it at once, and ask for its passage as speedily as possible.</p>
                    <p>There is, on the part of our people, a voluntary surrender of a large amount
                        that is justly due to them. We refer to the interest on these losses. Since
                        the last of them were incurred, almost six years have elapsed. The man who
                        lost five thousand dollars in 1864, has lost, in addition eighteen hundred
                        dollars in interests, calculating it at only six per cent. The people of
                        this Borough to whom there is an unpaid balance due of twelve hundred
                        thousand dollars, has lost in interest, four hundred and thirty-two thousand
                        dollars. Some of the losses were incurred seven years, and some, nearly
                        eight years ago. For this there is no claim being made. They are simply
                        asking for the principal. And yet who does not know that if they had had the
                        amount which they lost, they might have realized an average of eight per
                        cent on their money during these six years?</p>
                    <p>It seems to us that the State ought not to ask of us any longer sacrifice
                        than this. The trouble is that when a claim of any kind is made on the State
                        for payment, the parsimonious creatures, who delight in being called the
                        watch-dogs of the Treasury, array themselves against it without regard to
                        its merit, just as though the State is not as liable to contract debts as an
                        individual. We would be far from taking the position that every claim made
                        against the State should be paid. On the contrary we believe that all claims
                        should be scrutinized closely. For this reason, we have invited the
                        strictest and closest investigation into the character of these claims, and
                        we do not fear any inquiry honestly conducted. But we do not call calumny,
                        investigation. We do not call sneers, arguments. We do not call invective,
                        logic. The calm, dispassionate inquiry, that disdains unworthy means, and
                        seeks only for the truth, is what we are not afraid of. We do not indulge in
                        acrimonious retorts and bitter taunts, against which those who hurl their
                        poisoned shafts at us might not be proof. If any editor will advance a
                        single argument why these claims should not be paid, we will meet it, and
                        try to refute it. Thus far we have looked in vain for any fact which should
                        be an obstacle in the way of our success. The means resorted to have failed
                        entirely in their purpose. There is an uncharitableness about them which
                        does not commend itself to the minds of legislators. The guerilla style of
                        warfare has been adopted by our enemies, instead of that which we have
                        taken. We have presented a bold open front all the time, challenging inquiry
                        to the fullest extent. Pursuing such a course, and being thrice armed
                        because our quarrel is just, we have the utmost confidence in our
                    success.</p>
