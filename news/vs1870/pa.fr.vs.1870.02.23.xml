                <transcript>
                    <p>On Monday night of last week, a bill was introduced in the House of
                        Representatives at Harrisburg, providing for the payment of the losses
                        sustained by the people of the border counties. It was referred to the
                        Committee of Ways and Means, and will, no doubt, soon be brought before the
                        House again for its consideration. Hardly had the fact of the introduction
                        of this bill been flashed across the telegraphic wires throughout the State,
                        before a few editors seized their pens and wrote vehement articles against
                        the proposition. Misrepresenting the nature of the bill, and willfully
                        coining the most unmitigated falsehoods in regard to our people, they sought
                        to excite the public mind in relation to this measure, and convince it that
                        one of the greatest outrages in the history of Pennsylvania legislation was
                        about to be committed. Never was a more complete misrepresentation of facts
                        given to the people.</p>
                    <p>The men who ask for payment of their losses are stigmatized as "thieves and
                        robbers" and the bill itself is characterized as "a swindle." Our readers
                        can examine the provisions of the bill, as published in another column, for
                        themselves. It is a proposition as candid and fair as any ever made in a
                        legislative body. There is no "snake" in it. The several adjudications, made
                        by men who received their appointments from persons high in authority and of
                        honorable repute, are on file, and may be examined by any one who desires
                            <sic>so to do</sic>. There is no desire for, and no attempt at
                        concealment. The claim of the people of these counties for payment has too
                        much intrinsic merit to cause us to resort to any subterfuges, or chicanery,
                        to secure its recognition by the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>But it is charged that these "claims for several years have been objects of
                        speculation in the border counties, and have gradually drifted into the
                        hands of a few speculators at a nominal price, or at a valuation contingent
                        on the passage of the bill." <emph rend="italic">This is simply not true.
                            There is not even a grain of truth in it. There has been no speculation
                            in these claims. There has not been an assignment of a single claim in
                            Franklin county, and Franklin county sustained two-thirds of all the
                            losses of the border counties. We desire to nail this lie right here and
                            now. We defy the author of this libelous article, or any other enemy of
                            the bill, to point out one person in this county who has assigned, or
                            sold his claim.</emph></p>
                    <p>No, the men whose property was taken by impressment, or carried away by the
                        hands of military robbers, or destroyed by the torch of the rebel
                        incendiary, still bear upon their own shoulders the burden of their heavy
                        losses.</p>
                    <p>The farmers whose horses were stolen, and whose granaries were emptied of
                        their precious stores, are in a state of despondency on account of the debts
                        that are pressing on them for payment. Many of the citizens of Chambersburg,
                        who saw the flames consume all that they owned in the world except the
                        clothing which they wore, are deep down in the slough of despair, on account
                        of the difficulty of providing even the necessaries of life for themselves
                        and families. Bankrupt in property, some of them have been compelled to eat
                        the bitter bread of charity. Sitting by their firesides, memory recalls the
                        dear face of a beloved son whom they sent forth with their blessing to
                        support the starry flag of their country, but alas! their desolation is the
                        more heart-rending, and the cloud which lowers upon their home the blacker,
                        because the fortune of war struck down their darling and their pride. And
                        this is not a supposititious, nor yet a single case. The inquiring mind can
                        find that such cases are stern realities in our midst and that they are
                        many. Our people gave their fathers, brethren and sons to the war. Many of
                        them went down amid the smoke of the battle, or died in the camp, and whilst
                        they were rallying around and dying beneath the flag, their loved ones at
                        home were given over to the ravages of the enemy. <emph rend="italic">And
                            they are the "thieves and robbers" who are asking a rich Commonwealth to
                            reimburse them for their losses</emph>. This proposition to shift the
                        burden of these great losses from the few of the border, upon whom it is
                        resting with such crushing force, to the many citizens of the State whose
                        property was saved from spoliation and destruction by the very sacrifices
                        which these few made, and losses which they incurred--this it is which is
                        denounced as "the greatest swindle of the year." Surely, no <emph
                            rend="italic">honest</emph> man can thus add insult to the injury which
                        our people have suffered.</p>
                    <p>Our own eloquent townsman, J. McDowell Sharpe, Esq., in a speech in the
                        Legislature, on the 24th day of February A. D. <unclear>1864</unclear>, on
                        this very subject, pressed this point in the following glowing
                        language:--"Is there still some gentleman upon this floor whose heart
                        prompts him to ask why do your constituents demand this relief? I answer
                        because there is no reason founded in either justice or right, <emph
                            rend="italic">why they should be compelled to carry heavier burdens than
                            other portions of the State, more fortunately located</emph>. Look at
                        this question, Mr. Speaker, in a spirit of candor and fair dealing. We are
                        all sons of Pennsylvania alike. The <unclear>aegis</unclear> of the same
                        Constitution protects us all alike. We have a common heritage of State glory
                        and renown, we have a common duty of allegiance to bear toward our
                        government, we have common burdens to bear, and common aspirations and
                        common hopes. The golden thread that links us in a common state brotherhood,
                        begins on the shores of Lake Erie, and runs over mountains, through valleys
                        and across rivers, until it gathers within its links, us who dwell near the
                        banks of the Potomac. If all things else be common, why should our
                        misfortunes be peculiar? If we have a joint tenancy of everything else, why
                        should we suffer the fortunes of war in severalty? There can be no answer
                        adverse to my cause, unless it be spoken by the voice of that selfish
                        parsimony, which, wrapping itself in the mantle of its own affluence and
                        contentment, can shut its heart against the pleadings of justice, and turn a
                        deaf ear to the tale of sorrow. There is no use in mincing words about this
                        matter. Cold, calculating selfishness can alone deny the provisions of this
                        bill. No higher impulse will, or can have aught to say, in making such a
                        decision."</p>
                    <p>It is said, too, that the Commissioners, provided in the bill, will not
                        "audit the claims according to any settled principles of law," and that, "in
                        their adjudication, they will be governed by the rule that whatever helps
                        Number Two will be a good thing for Number One." It is apparent that the
                        writer of this stuff, either did not read the bill, or, if he did, resolved
                        deliberately to misrepresent the facts so as to excite the hostility of his
                        readers towards the measure. These claims were adjudicated, as we have
                        already said, by persons appointed by authority of the Legislature, and
                        these persons were not residents of the border counties and had no interest,
                        direct or indirect, in the claims. The people of the border counties might
                        have asked for payment of these claims according to the valuation fixed by
                        these Commissioners. They preferred, however, to ask for nothing by what was
                        justly due to them. And, inasmuch as there were three different Boards of
                        Commissioners which adjudicated these claims, and in some instances, the
                        same claims were presented before, and allowed by, more than one Board of
                        Commissioners, it became necessary, <emph rend="italic">as an act of justice
                            to the Commonwealth, that measures should be taken to prevent these
                            claims from being duplicated in payment</emph>. For this purpose, it is
                        provided in the bill, that two gentlemen in each county, of respectability
                        and integrity, should examine these claims, and further power is given them
                        to diminish, <emph rend="italic">but not to increase</emph>, any claim as it
                        now stands adjudicated. How does this give the claimant an opportunity to
                        "walk into the Treasury and help himself?" What becomes of the principle, in
                        the light of these facts, that "whatever helps Number Two will be a good
                        thing for Number One?" If the men who have hastily attacked this bill, were
                        moved by the candor and sense of justice that have prompted the action of
                        the sufferers who are asking for relief, they would, at least, have
                        refrained from indulging in reckless misstatements and fabricating gross
                        falsehoods.</p>
                    <p>But it is said that the amount is large. Is that any reason why these claims
                        should not be paid? Is it not rather a stronger reason why they should be
                        paid? Mr. Lincoln said, "it is easier to pay a small debt than a large one,"
                        and he might have added, that it is easiest for many people to pay a large
                        debt than for a few to pay it. The magnitude of the losses makes the
                        injustice of compelling the people of a few counties to bear them, more
                        enormous and apparent.</p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary to say that this claim is based upon the strongest
                        foundations. It springs from the elementary principles on which all
                        government must rest. The citizen owes allegiance to the State, and the
                        State in return owes protection to the citizen. Their duties are reciprocal.
                        When the citizen acts in good faith, pays the taxes imposed by the State,
                        answers the call of the State for men to defend her borders, or fight her
                        battles, and is always ready to discharge the duties devolving upon him by
                        reason of his citizenship, the State in turn must protect him, or, failing
                        to protect, must make good the losses which he incurs by reason of that
                        failure. We throw down the gauntlet, and challenge our enemies to give a
                        single instance in which the people of the border counties have failed to
                        discharge their whole duty to the State; nay, more, we dare them to point to
                        a single instance in which they ever faltered, or hesitated, in the
                        performance of their duty. On the clear, broad ground of <emph rend="italic"
                            >right</emph>, the Legislature owes it to our people to pass this bill</p>
                    <p>And, although, editors may write abusive articles, and try to terrify honest
                        men from the performance of this plain duty, the members of the Legislature
                        should laugh them to scorn and reply, '<emph rend="italic">we dare to do
                            right</emph>, and we trust to the sense of justice of our respective
                        constituencies to approve our action.' To cast a vote for the payment of
                        these losses, thus relieving the pressing necessities of a people who have
                        borne their terrible sufferings without a murmur, is an act that the Gods
                        might envy. And the storm of indignation that a few sordid souls, in their
                        selfish parsimony, are raising, will be turned upon their own heads as a
                        perfect whirlwind of wrath, when the real facts about this business become
                        generally known. The people of this great Commonwealth will yet come to
                        think it due to the maintenance of her own dignity, and proud and honorable
                        position in the Union, that the damages sustained and the losses incurred by
                        her own citizens in the late war, in which she bore such a distinguished
                        part, should be paid to the uttermost farthing.</p>
                    <p>In view of all these facts, instead of the taunts, and sneers, and
                        misrepresentations, and threats, to which certain mean scribblers have
                        resorted to defeat this measure, they ought rather to address their
                        representatives in language like that in which Mr. Sharpe closed the model
                        speech to which we have before referred, and which reads as follows: "Mr.
                        Speaker, and gentlemen representatives, go home to your constituents if you
                        can. Go home if you dare and tell them you voted against this bill. Go home
                        to your constituents if you can, go home to them if you dare, and tell them
                        that Pennsylvania, the brightest star in the galaxy of States, the cradle of
                        American freedom, the nursing mother of the Declaration of Independence,
                        rich in the hallowed memories of Valley Forge and Germantown, having within
                        its limits the birth-place of our nation, and the grave of treason close by
                        the consecrated sepulchres of Gettysburg's heroes--an empire of three
                        millions of people, whose mountains milk the clouds, and whose valleys run
                        with fatness, having within her bowels coal enough to warm all her friends,
                        and iron enough to cool all her foes--a Commonwealth abounding in
                        prosperity, intelligence and civilization unknown elsewhere--tell your
                        constituents, I repeat it, that this State, such as I have described it,
                        through you as her representatives on this floor, has refused to be <emph
                            rend="italic">just</emph> to her citizens, and has declared herself
                            <emph rend="italic">to be too weak and poor</emph> to protect them."</p>
                    <p>If the present Legislature passes this bill now before them, its members may
                        congratulate themselves that they have performed an act of justice which
                        former Legislatures have refused to do--an act of justice, not only to the
                        people who are praying for its passage, but to the people of the State also,
                        who desire to preserve the fair fame of the Commonwealth for discharging its
                        just obligations.</p>
