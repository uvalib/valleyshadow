                    <p>On the 25th inst., at McConnellsburg, Hon. B.F. Meyers was nominated as the
                        Democratic candidate for Congress in the Sixteenth Congressional District.
                        Mr. Meyers is a resident of Bedford, a lawyer by profession, but more widely
                        known to the people of the district and state as one of the editors and
                        proprietors of the Bedford <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> and also as
                        one of the editors and proprietors of the Harrisburg <emph rend="italic"
                            >Morning Patriot</emph>. In the capacity of a journalist he has won an
                        enviable reputation throughout the State. The <emph rend="italic"
                        >Patriot</emph>, under its present management, has become the leading
                        Democratic daily paper in the Commonwealth. Repeated attempts had been made
                        to publish a Democratic paper at the State Capital, but each attempt proved
                        to be a failure until the present proprietors took charge of the office.
                        Since that time, it has grown in popular favor. Enterprise is giving the
                        public the latest news from all parts of the world and men of talent are
                        discussing in its columns the live political issues of the day. Its
                        patronage has increased wonderfully and it is now established upon a solid
                        foundation. A large amount of this success is due to the ability and zeal of
                        Mr. Meyers, and the Conservative people of the State owe him a debt of
                        gratitude for the manner in which this journal has been conducted.</p>
                    <p>The people of this Congressional District are peculiarly indebted to Mr.
                        Meyers.--With devotion that has never wavered, with boldness that has never
                        flinched and with zeal that has never flagged, he has advocated the payment
                        of the losses sustained by the people of the border counties. Whilst other
                        journals were silent, or, if they uttered any sound at all, were busy in
                        defaming our citizens and deriding their claims, the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Patriot</emph> was constant in its advocacy of our cause. So much
                        enlisted in behalf of this class of sufferers was Mr. Meyers that he went to
                        members in the Capitol and personally solicited their votes for the Border
                        Claims Bill. Ought such devotion to pass unrewarded? Ought our citizens to
                        fail to do justice to the man who espoused their cause when that cause was
                        the subject of the <unclear>animadversion</unclear> of almost all the city
                        dailies? We feel sure that all that is needed is to let the service of Mr.
                        Meyers be known and they alone will commend him to the people of Franklin
                        County.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Meyers served one term in the House of Representatives at Harrisburg and
                        bore a good reputation for integrity and ability.--He is a man of large
                        acquaintance with the public men of the State and of extensive experience in
                        political affairs. He is the uncompromising foe of negro suffrage and
                        believes in the doctrine that white men ought to govern this country. He is
                        the enemy of that policy which seeks to give the South over to a set of
                        carpet-baggers who expect to grow rich by piling up a huge debt for the
                        Southern people to pay, without allowing them any voice in the selection of
                        their rulers, or any representation in Congress. In short he is for the
                        whole Union with the "rights, dignity and equality of the several States
                        unimpaired."</p>
                    <p>We shall refer frequently during the campaign to the record of our candidate,
                        and we hope to satisfy our readers that at this election, the man for whom
                        they should cast their votes is the candidate of the Democracy.</p>

                <head>President Grant Nominated for a Second Term</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>General Hiram Walbridge is bidding high for a fat office. He has nominated
                        President Grant for a second term. He has written a letter, almost two
                        columns in length, to the New York <emph rend="italic">Standard</emph>, for
                        the purpose of announcing publicly his ardent admiration of the present
                        administration. He pretends to believe that "General Grant has, to an
                        eminent degree, carried out the wishes of the people, and at the same time
                        justified the hopes of the most earnest Republicans." It is impossible for a
                        man of General Walbridge's years and experience to be so blind to the truth.
                        The fact is that General Grant has neither carried out the wishes of the
                        people, nor satisfied his own political friends.</p>
                    <p>He started his administration with the declaration that "the will of the
                        people is the law of the land." The pretence was that he intended to consult
                        the will of the people in everything that he would do. How has he done in
                        this particular? Let the manner in which the infamous Fifteenth Amendment
                        was ratified answer. The President knew, when he was pressing negro suffrage
                        upon the country, that it was distasteful to the people. He knows it now.
                        And yet he joined with the corrupt leaders of his party to force this
                        measure in defiance of the popular feeling. He saw that the ratification
                        could be procured by dexterous manipulation and he lent his aid to the
                        sleight of hand tricks by which it was done.</p>
                    <p>Neither has his reconstruction policy satisfied the people. When he accepted
                        the nomination at the hands of the Radical Convention, he threw out a
                        sentence in order to catch voters--"let us have peace." But he has failed to
                        give us peace. The South is not entirely represented in Congress yet,
                        although five years have elapsed since the war closed. In North Carolina,
                        Governor Holden attempted to intimidate voters but the wave of popular
                        feeling swept Radicalism almost out of existence in that State at the late
                        election. And this, too, notwithstanding the fact that it was given out that
                        the President approved of Holden's arbitrary and lawless course. Now, all
                        over the country, there is an earnest desire for a cordial union of hearts
                        and hands once more among the people of the several States. But there is a
                        general belief that the administration of President Grant wishes to keep
                        tinkering indefinitely at this reconstruction policy so as to prevent this
                        cordial union and keep alive the fires of sectional hatred in order to
                        furnish an excuse for high handed proceedings to perpetuate the rule of the
                        Radical party. In this President Grant is <emph rend="italic">not</emph>
                        "carrying out the wishes of the people."</p>
                    <p>The President has <emph rend="italic">not</emph> "justified the hopes of the
                        most earnest Republicans." From the beginning of his term to the present
                        time, he has <emph rend="italic">disappointed</emph> the most earnest
                        Republicans in regard to his selection of Cabinet officers. He has made most
                        shameful blunders in appointing men who were ineligible. He has thrown
                        himself open constantly to the charge of being influenced in his
                        appointments by large gifts from the men to whom he gave lucrative
                        positions. Some of "the most earnest Republicans" are astounded at the
                        wonderful capacity which the President exhibits as a receiver of good gifts
                        from men who are aspirants for office.</p>
                    <p>There are ugly rumors about the private habits of the President which are far
                        from "justifying the hopes" of his party friends. His frequent and large
                        potations on fishing excursions, and the severe indisposition which almost
                        invariably attacks him during his "swingings around the circle" have given
                        rise to great uneasiness.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, it is decidedly refreshing to read the following
                        sentences from the pen of General Walbridge: "We have a <emph rend="italic"
                            >pure</emph> administration. No American need be ashamed of his
                        President. The air has no suspicion of corruption and debauchery." From this
                        the writer concludes that "the renomination of General Grant is a political
                        and national necessity."</p>
                    <p>While General Walbridge "has his hand in" at proposing candidates, he
                        nominates the Editor of the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> as the
                        Radical candidate for Governor of New York. He says there are two issues for
                        the canvass. The one is "the financial results of Grant's administration,"
                        and the other is "whether under our present State Government there is any
                        hope of having a fair and free election." "All other issues," he says, "must
                        be postponed. Our friends differ on questions of revenue tariff and
                        taxation." And because there are differences of opinion in the Radical
                        party--differences so strong and bitter that a discussion of these would
                        split that organization into fragments--the cry is for a postponement. It
                        matters not that these questions of revenue, tariff and taxation are of the
                        most vital importance to the people. Because they are important and have
                        given rise to differences of opinion, they must be ignored. Surely the
                        people have had enough of this political wire-pulling.</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">purity of the franchise</emph>, about which General
                        Walbridge writes a great deal is troubling the Radical party wonderfully
                        now. It never gave them any uneasiness as long as, by the practice of the
                        most shameless frauds, they were able to elect their candidates. But now,
                        when these frauds do not avail to keep Democrats from being
                        elected,--because the reaction against the Radical party has become so
                        tremendous--they are beginning to prate about frauds and the necessity for
                        purifying the elective franchise. Why did not the necessity for this occur
                        to them when they were <emph rend="italic">counting out</emph> Democrats in
                        Philadelphia, who have been elected by very large majorities? Why did it not
                        occur to them when they were <emph rend="italic">counting</emph> in Geary
                        after he had been defeated by the people of Pennsylvania? The fact that
                        Geary was <emph rend="italic">counted in</emph> fraudulently was stated on
                        the floor of the House of representatives by Hon. Elisha Davis, last Winter.
                        In a moment of anger at the Governor, he "let the cat out of the bag." For
                        ten years, the Republican party has retained power by proceedings of very
                        questionable morality. And yet they have the hardihood now to attempt to
                        turn the public attention from themselves by a loud denunciation of
                        corruption in the Democracy. It is the old dodge of the thief crying "Stop
                        thief."</p>
                    <p>General Walbridge announces himself for Mr. Greeley because he will be a
                        National candidate. He wants him because he thinks that he would be able to
                        bamboozle foreigners into the support of the Radical ticket. He gives the
                        Radicals of New York his opinion that their candidate must be Mr. Greeley or
                        they will be defeated, for, in closing his letter, he says: "I can think of
                        no other candidate with whom they would not have a desperate and almost
                        hopeless struggle."</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to notice the differences of opinion between the Radicals
                        of New York in this contest, for whilst General Walbridge is urging
                        allegiance to Grant's administration as the sure way to success, the New
                        York <emph rend="italic">Sun</emph>, edited by the Radical Charles A. Dana,
                        who was Stanton's Assistant Secretary of war, says: "<emph rend="italic">If
                            the Republicans want to make any headway in the coming election in this
                            State, they must cut all connection with Grant's
                    Administration.</emph>"</p>
