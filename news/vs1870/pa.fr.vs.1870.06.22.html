<b>Preference for Negro Labor</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper takes issue with the Franklin Repository for attempting to
                    "fasten opprobrium upon the Democrats for preferring the labor of negroes to
                    that of white men." The charges stem from pre-war Democratic support for slavery
                    and its extension. The editors charge that after the war, however, it is
                    Republicans that favor African Americans at the expense of white men. "Negro
                    labor, under a Radical Administration, is fast taking the place of white labor.
                    Colored men fill offices in Washington City which white men would be glad to
                    occupy. They act not as messengers and doorkeepers. They are above that. A negro
                    Revels in the chair of a United States Senator."<br>

<b>Radical Colored Delegates</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals of Philadelphia have recognized fully the right, and proclaimed
                        publicly the justice, of negroes holding seats in their political
                        conventions.</p>
                    <p>In the Convention which nominated a candidate for Sheriff at National Hall,
                        in that city, on Wednesday last, there were six colored delegates.</p>
                    <p>In the Convention held at the County Court House, on the same day, which
                        nominated a candidate for Judge of the District Court and two for Judges of
                        the Court of Common Pleas, there were three
                        colored delegates. Hon. Isaac Hazlehurst, who was a candidate for Governor
                        in 1857, was a delegate in this Convention and was elected one of the Vice
                        Presidents. The point was made that he was not regularly elected and that
                        another man had the credentials. Rather than have a contest, Mr. Hazlehurst
                        withdrew. This caused a vacancy in one of the Vice Presidential chairs, and
                        Ira D. Cliff, a colored delegate, was immediately
                        elected Vice President of this Judicial Convention.</p>
                    <p>In the Convention to nominate a candidate for Congress in the Second
                        Congressional District, there were two colored
                        delegates.</p>
                    <p>Will the colored men of Franklin County slumber any longer on their rights?
                        They ought to demand the same privileges that have been accorded to their
                        brethren in Philadelphia. They ought to go to the delegate elections and
                        demand that their claims to representation be not ignored. We know that John
                        Cessna's runners are buttonholing the leaders of the negroes and advising
                        them not to go into the Conventions, but it would be folly for the colored
                        men to listen to such counsel. Now is the time for the negroes to put the
                        Radicals of Franklin County and the other Counties of this Congressional
                        District to the test. Let them ascertain whether John Cessna is willing to
                        take a nomination from Conventions in which they sit as the equals of
                        whites. They are very foolish if they let such a chance to test his
                        sincerity slip by. Let them try it and they will find him squirming, and
                        wriggling and dodging, and finally, if they persist, praying them to desist from such an undertaking for fear of the
                        consequences to his precious self. The colored men ought to be represented
                        in the Convention.</p>

                    <p>ANTRIM TOWNSHIP, June 18, 1870.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--Your Radical neighbor, whose
                        weekly duty it is to dose out political dish water from the negro swill tub,
                        for the comfort of his "mixed" readers, has doubtless in his own opinion
                        triumphantly succeeded in establishing the superiority of the negroes over
                        the whites in general and White Man in particular. So far as White Man is
                        concerned, it being no doubt the sentiment of three-fourths of the white
                        people of the country, the Radicals may "advance" the negroes to any
                        imaginable elevations "above" them if they will only forever keep them from
                        coming into social or political contact with them. We don't "fear" the
                        "coming man" on account of the superior intelligence claimed, or the many
                        great advantages in contemplation to be secured, for him. Our hand would be
                        in them all, but for the unnatural and wicked scheme of bringing us into
                        each other's society whether we desire it or not. This is such a tyranny as
                        high heaven frowns on. The question is not whether the whites or the blacks
                        are the more highly favored by nature's gifts, or which may win in the "race
                        for supremacy," so prominently set forth by the Radicals for the trial of
                        our respective merits, but on what method of reasoning can the unbiased mind
                        be reconciled to the abominable idea that two races of people, so complete
                        in all the characteristics which nature has so abundantly furnished to
                        distinguish one from the other, shall be thrown into a political and social
                        mass, on the miserable and unholy plea that "Christian benevolence" demands
                        it? Cannot the negroes of our country be reached without mixing them in our
                        politics and society? Visit them as the "heathen of Europe, Asia and Africa"
                        are visited, from motives of "Christian benevolence" instead of foisting
                        them on us as our social and political equals, and there will be more money
                        presented for their melioration than true philanthropy will know what to do
                        with. No matter how much the negroes may be our "equal" or "surpass" us, the
                        "great God" who created "everything for its kind" never intended him for our
                        associate, and the man who can see, and perhaps smell no "difference" between him and a man in a "white epidermis"
                        is too much the slave of political fanaticism to speak for honest people of
                        any color. The Radicals have controlled the political world until their
                        ambition sees nothing more to achieve in it worthy of its lofty aspirations.
                        They are now attacking the "irrevocable" laws of nature. A change in the
                        physical world next claims their attention, and if they are as successful in
                        "running" the latter as they have been in the former, one of the first and
                        most important steps will be to confine what we now call the natural
                        increase of the country, entirely to the white and negro Radicals. This
                        would effectually choke off the White Man's party in a comparatively few
                        years, and by "splitting" the difference, still seen by some folks, between
                        the "trooly loyal" whites and the blacks, who are all supposed to
                        be "trooly loyal," some of your neighbor's prophecies may be
                        fulfilled soon enough.<br> WHITE MAN.</p>
