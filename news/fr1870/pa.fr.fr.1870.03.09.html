<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The transition of an unwilling subject from even a lower condition to a
                        higher one, is often marked with strange ebulitions of temper which to the eye of the beholder are seen in
                        their true character, weakness, absurdity and pitiable childishness. Take
                        for example a modern Democrat, one who through all the vicissitudes of our
                        country's struggle to free itself of the incubus of slavery, has held fast
                        to his political "Diana," whom he supposed "all Asia and the world
                        worshipped." Every effort of our glorious country to rise to a level with
                        the Declaration of Independence, is still viewed by our modern Democrat as a
                        thrust at his political faith. He has had a tear of sympathy to shed for
                        every pang which his idol felt, a deep drawn sigh to swell his bosom for
                        every symptom of dissolution which indicated the death of the "beast," at
                        whose shrine he knelt. The final triumph of the government over the enemy
                        that was grappling it by the throat, is still viewed by the fogy Democrat as
                        a calamity. The "Fifteenth Amendment" is alike odious to their vision as the
                        "Declaration of Independence." Now, like the rebellious Israelites after
                        their emancipation from Egyptian bondage, they are wont to look back to the
                        "leeks and onions" which they left in Egypt; they manifest their discontent
                        by grumbling at the beneficent changes which have followed in the wake of
                        our country's march to its higher destiny. A down trodden people whose
                        loyalty and devotion to our government have been demonstrated by their
                        patience under the most flagrant wrongs, and their enthusiastic efforts to
                        assimilate themselves with those who were their oppressors, in the grand
                        march to national greatness and national glory. Revels, now a U.S. Senator,
                        is a "thorn in their flesh." The modern Democrat is grieved to the heart
                        that Jefferson Davis, J. C. Calhoun and other dignitaries who were men
                        "after his own heart," have been succeeded by one of the hated colored race.
                        What an infraction of the Constitution to have Saulsbury and Garrett Davis
                        disgraced by the presence of Revels of Mississippi?</p>

                    <p>Our neighbor of the Spirit is a fair specimen of
                        one of these transition unfortunates. The character and dignity of the
                        Senate of the United States, has sadly deteriorated in his eyes. He looks
                        back with a mourful interest to the glorious
                        past when Democracy in the person of Brooks was engaged in the dignified
                        duty of purifying the Senate from the contaminating influence of a Sumner; a
                        Keit and Barksdale were endeavoring to give dignity to the House in their
                        courteous encounter with Grow of Pennsylvania, or a Pryor was wont to
                        admonish Potter that the free discussion of public measures must not be
                        tolerated, by sending his a challenge to mortal combat. Oh, how unlike the
                        good old times, to him, is the heresy of the "equality of citizens before
                        the law," compared with that glorious period when an anti-slavery lecturer
                        was pelted with rotten eggs, or even that constitutional era, when a Northern citizen could be tarred and
                        feathered or hanged by the neck till he was dead on suspicion of being an
                        abolitionist if caught in a Southern State. Nay, it must needs make our
                        modern Democrat draw a sigh of relief, in his retrospect of our country, to
                        know that there was a period in our country's history when the Constitution
                        guaranteed the right to a mob to murder Lovejoy and destroy his printing
                        press. And the blood-hounds of the South in
                        full communion with the biped blood-hounds of
                        the North could chase the trembling slave, fleeing from bondage, within
                        sight of the proud banners of his native land. But we must have patience
                        with the Democrat in his transition state. He has had severe trials. He has
                        seen his proud, dominant party disintegrate, large numbers of which went to
                        swell the columns of the hated Republican party. He too from force of
                        circumstances will soon find it convenient to turn his eyes on the future;
                        his last look on these pleasant visions of the past will be an epoch to be
                        remembered as the "last sigh of the Moor."</p>
