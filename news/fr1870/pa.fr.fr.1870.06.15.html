<b>Wanted (To Be) A Democratic Candidate for Congress</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial mocks the Democrats for attempting to nominate someone who
                    meets the "Jeffersonian standard" for Congress. The author argues that no such
                    person exists in the local Democratic party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>We proposed to suggest a candidate for the Democracy for Congress from the
                        Sixteenth District, when our eye fell upon the qualifications prescribed by
                        the Fulton Democrat, and we gave up in despair.
                        "He" (the candidate) "must be up to the Jeffersonian standard of honesty and
                        capability, and for this attainment," (for such a candidate, we presume)
                        "individual Democrats will lay aside their personal preferences." It is
                        absolutely impassible, gentlemen, if such conditions are imposed, to furnish
                        a candidate. Besides, what is the use of putting such impossible barriers in
                        the way of the large and interesting body of aspirants for Congressional
                        honors that we were about to exhibit to the public? Why don't some judicious
                        person take care of the Fulton Democrat until we
                        get through with this nominating business? If it were only reasonable in its
                        demands we wouldn't care. If it asked for a candidate no more than that he
                        should know enough about the Constitution to declare everything except the
                        rebellion unconstitutional, that he should pronounce himself in favor of the
                        "white men's party" and such other trifles, it would be well enough; we
                        could furnish scores of such candidates in this district. But when it
                        demands an exponent of the broad and universal principles of Justice and
                        Equality, as understood and defined by Jefferson, great heavens, how can we
                        be expected to find him in the ranks of the Democracy.
                        We know no way of satisfying the Democrat unless
                        it come over to the Republican party, where we are sure it can be done.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the other counties of the district are not so high-toned as Fulton,
                        and may be contented with a candidate whose qualifications are less god-like
                        and more Democratic than the article she is in search of. If they are not,
                        let them take our word for it there is no such a Democrat in the district
                        and if they want the entertainment to go on they must accept such material
                        as they can get. In that event we can give them the chance of a dozen, more
                        or less. To begin at the beginning; there is Brevet Brigadier General
                        Alexander Hamilton Coffroth, ex-Congressman, a famous constitutional lawyer,
                        an orator of portentous mien and stentorian lungs who loves himself and all
                        his fellow men, except Judge Kimmell, who always happens to be a rival
                        candidate when it does not suit the aforesaid B. B. G. He breathes the
                        Somerset air and thrives on it. He would consent to be a candidate for the
                        Democracy on any reasonable platform but he can't stand the "Jeffersonian
                        standard." He hates "niggers" because they vote the Republican ticket and
                        would greatly prefer that they be doomed to forever consignment amid the
                        cohorts of destruction." But in spite of this formidable threat he is by no
                        means a blood thirsty man, and we seriously recommend him to the Democracy
                        as their candidate.</p>

                    <p>Then there is B. F. Myers, Esq. of Bedford. We do
                        not think that his military rank is above that of Major, but he is a
                        wonderful hero on paper, newspaper. He owns two newspapers, the Harrisonburg
                            Patriot and the Bedford Gazette. It is in the columns of the latter that he has achieved
                        his greatest triumphs. Here he displays his fiercest epithets. Here, with
                        the high altitude of Bedford as a vantage ground, he sends forth his most
                        dazzling flashes of lightning, and along its mountains reverberate his
                        loudest thunders. The Democracy of Bedford have long gazed in wonder at his
                        brilliant pyrotechnics, and profoundly listened to his loud detonations.
                        They propose to show their appreciation and gratitude by sending him to
                        Congress. They think this is due him because they are a selfish and
                        exclusive set of people. They have immense beds of iron ore and coal in
                        their county, to which other counties want to make railroads so that they
                        may dig up their beds of ore and coal and carry them away, and build
                        furnaces and factories to consume their produce and make things lively
                        generally. To build these railroads and carry away from the people of
                        Bedford county these native treasures, and consume their products these
                        other counties importune Congress to help them by giving them a protective
                        tariff. This protective tariff Mr. B. F. Myers has
                        always bitterly opposed, and hence the Democracy of Bedford county
                        gratefully wish to make him their Congressman. He also always strenuously
                        protected his people from the arrogance and selfishness of the negroes, in
                        the columns of his newspaper, and for this, which they have keenly felt and
                        appreciated they wish to honor him. But though he is a very clever Democrat
                        he wouldn't answer for the "Jeffersonian standard."</p>

                    <p>We had proposed to deal fairly with the several counties and give the
                        Democracy the choice of a candidate from each, but as Fulton don't seem to
                        want any possibly because she can't comply with the demand of the
                        "Jeffersonian standard," we are half tempted to pass her by. The Democrat says:</p>

                    <p>Fulton county, too, has a claim for the honor which must not be overlooked,
                        and if she presents a candicate of integrity
                        and ability, we will be in duty bound to support him as far as practicable
                        without compromising the great end in view.</p>

                    <p>Well, if she has a claim, why throw it away on Bedford. Geo. Smith, Esq., is
                        neither a military man, nor has he a newspaper but he was a candidate two
                        years ago, and withdrew after a solemn promise that he should receive the
                        nomination the next time. We won't pledge him good for the "Jeffersonian
                        standard," but we'll warrant him to come quite as near it as any of the
                        others named. So we take the liberty of announcing him, even though the
                        Fulton Democrat does show him a bit of coldness,
                        and falls down and worships Myers. Why should
                            Myers have so much? Smith may not hold as good
                        a hand; he has no newspapers, and can't thunder; but he has a quiet way with
                        him that may carry him further than all the machinery of the other.</p>

                    <p>"Franklin county will scarcely lack a candidate for Congress while Kimmell
                        stays," we heard a Democrat say the other day. That Democrat's head was very
                        level as far as it went, but it didn't go far enough. There are two
                        candidates, one is Judge Kimmell and one is W. S. Stenger, Esq., our
                        neighbor of the Spirit. Both have merit. Kimmell
                        has some military fame, we don't dare to name his rank, and Stenger, though
                        he has never been honored in that way, has done enough ten times over for
                        the party to entitle him to a commission.</p>

                    <p>We don't intend to press either of these gentlemen, however, we only suggest
                        them as among those who stand at the door and knock. They both hate the
                        "blasted nigger," but neither of them possesses the merit of Myers, who hates him equally as bad as they, and
                            can discount them both in opposition to the
                        protective tariff. It doesn't suit the people of Franklin county to oppose
                        the tariff very bitterly. These two gentlemen managed to get themselves
                        involved in certain promises and pledges to some of the other candidates in
                        a way which might seriously impede their efforts to secure a nomination. We
                        mention it here because we fear they are in danger of forgetting them. Mr.
                        Stenger pledged Franklin county to Myers last
                        winter and Myers accepted the pledge and condition
                        on which it was based in good faith. Judge Kimmel pledged himself, two years
                        ago, in consideration of Smith withdrawing from the contest then, not to be
                        a candidate now. We merely remind these gentlemen, of these facts, besides
                        expressing our grave doubts of their coming up to the "Jeffersonian
                        standard."</p>

                    <p>If there were no better reason than our desire to treat all alike fairly we
                        could not stop until we name a candidate for Adams county. There is a better
                        one, however. Wm. McSherry, Esq., has been honored by Adams county in his
                        nomination and election to the State Senate, and in the discharge of his
                        Senatorial duties he did not fail to reflect credit on those who sent him
                        there. The Democracy of Adams wish to send him to Congress, and though that
                        is carrying the joke a little too far, because the Democracy of this
                        district have not the power to elect a man over the Republican nominee, if
                        they could, they would fail to find a better man among their prominent
                        politicians than the choice of Adams. He would not come up to the
                        "Jeffersonian standard," since if he did he would cease to be a Democrat.
                        Now, gentlemen, having paid your money you can take your choice. You are not
                        in earnest, of course. Hon. John Cessna will be re-elected to Congress, and as this nominating Democratic
                        candidates is just a joke anyhow; why not nominate Judge Kimmell again?</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository defends Republican John Cessna's
                    absences from Congress and mocks the Spirit for
                    attacking him.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>THE Spirit fears John Cessna and hasn't
                        shrewdness enough to conceal it. Every week it manifests the wholesome fear
                        it feels, in something it says and does. Last week it discovered that Cessna
                        hadn't voted on the question to amend or strike out the Income tax bill, and
                        at once it went to yelping and howling.</p>

                    <p>Of course, said the Spirit, Cessna was afraid to
                        vote for an Income tax bill, because the people would condemn him at the
                        polls if he did. And he dare not vote against it because he fears the army
                        of Internal Revenue Officers and their assistants. Hence he dodged.</p>

                    <p>Alas! gentlemen of the Sixteenth Congressional District, you are in a very
                        great strait. You are burdened with an army of Internal Revenue officers and
                        their Assistants. Miserable Cessna, between two such conflicting interests.
                        Unfortunate people weighed down by an army of Revenue officials. But Cessna
                        dodged twice, says the Spirit. He failed to
                        record his vote when the question to tax the United States bonds came up.
                        And this too is accounted for. He couldn't vote to tax them lest the
                        bondholders would be "after him with a sharp stick." He did not dare to vote
                        against taxing them lest the masses would give him "Hail Columbia."</p>

                    <p>Perhaps no poor devil was ever in a worse dilemma than was John Cessna, or
                        would have been if there was a word of truth in the Spirit, and he had not been attending Court in Bedford and
                        trying important causes during the week when attending Court in Bedford and
                        trying important causes during the week when these questions came up in
                        Congress. Why don't Cessna send the Spirit word
                        when he must be absent from Congress and save it from the terrible fury into
                        which it lashes itself when it fails to see his "aye" or "no" when any
                        question is voted on? If he has any humanity in his nature he will see to it
                        hereafter that his absence from the halls of Congress be duly chronicled for
                        the benefit of the Spirit. If he fails we will
                        not be responsible for its actions. Madness comes with the dog days, and the
                            Spirit's symptoms are already alarming.</p>

                    <p>The sale of the Wilson College lots advertised in our columns, came off on
                        Saturday afternoon. The sale was held on the ground, there was quite a large
                        attendance of the citizens of the town, the bidding was brisk and the sales
                        were made at good figures. None of the large tracts advertised were put up,
                        nor were all the acre lots sold, owing to want of time. The sale was
                        continued to Friday next at one oclock, when the
                        balance still unsold will be disposed of.</p>

                    <p>There were twenty-eight lots of an acre or more in size sold, at prices
                        ranging from $250 to $500 per acre. Four lots fronting on the turnpike were
                        sold at $500 each, and all the lots lying on each side of Broad street, with
                        one or two exceptions, were sold , at the following prices:</p>

                        offered. They consist of six splendid acre lots fronting on the turnpike
                        eleven pasture lots lying in the rear of those fronting on the east side of
                        Broad street, sold on Saturday, and fronting on an alley, a seven acre, lot
                        lying along the railroad, the Grapery lot of 7 acres and 143 perches on the
                        west side of the turnpike, a very valuable and beautifully located piece of
                        ground, with good improvements; and a lot of 7 acres and 14 perches lying
                        between the last described and the College buildings, also well improved.
                        The most desirable lots are among those still unsold, and judging from the
                        liveliness with which the others were taken, it is not likely that these
                        will lack purchasers.</p>

                    <p>The close proximity of these grounds to the College, which we are assured
                        will be opened up to scholars this fall under very favorable circumstances,
                        makes them desirable as places for future residences. The town is growing in
                        that direction, and these lots cannot fail to increase in value.</p>
