<b>The Greatest Scheme of Plunder Yet</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository rebuts the arguments that the
                    Pittsburgh Commercial uses to attack border damage
                    claims.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The above is the title of an article in the Pittsburg
                        Commercial of Wednesday last, in which that
                        journal undertakes to show that the "bill authorizing the payment of damages
                        sustained by citizens of Pennsylvania during the war of the rebellion and
                        providing means therefore" is a scheme got up for the purpose of plundering
                        the State. It is not too much to expect that a newspaper so able and
                        influential as the Commercial would do at least
                        one of two things in attempting to oppose this bill, or both; first show by
                        argument that the State is not bound to make compensation for the war losses
                        of the citizens of the border counties, or failing in that, it should
                        produce such a state of facts, as being established, would put these
                        claimants outside of the sphere of reciprocal rights and duties which
                        pertain between the Commonwealth and her citizens. It does neither the one
                        nor the other, but ingeniously waives the question of the duty of the State,
                        and asserts that the claimants must look to the General Government for
                        reimbursement.</p>

                    <p>With all due deference to the lofty disdain with which this is done, we claim
                        that the State is bound to protect the property of her citizens, and failing
                        in that to make compensation for their losses, so long as they do not fail
                        in the performance of the duties which they owe to her. This principle is
                        embraced in the idea of a State, and is acknowledged in the history and
                        legislation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a thousand ways. It is
                        admitted in her legislation again and again, and only last winter by
                        repeated appropriations of the Legislature of 1869, for the payment of
                        damages done by troops to her citizens.</p>

                    <p>Nor is this all. The act of the fifteenth day of May, 1861, to create a loan
                        of three millions, and to provide for arming the State, acknowledges a legal obligation to protect her citizens from the
                        ravages of war, and, on failure to do so, to reimburse them for their losses
                        resulting from such failure. This act provided for a loan of three million
                        dollars for the purpose of organizing a force to be called the "Reserve
                        Volunteer Corps of the Commonwealth," to consist of fifteen regiments -
                        thirteen of infantry, one of cavalry and one of artillery. The regiments
                        were to be composed of companies of like number, and to be armed, equipped,
                        clothed, disciplined, governed and officered as similar troops in the
                        service of the United States, and to be enlisted in the service of the State
                        for a period not exceeding three years or for the war, unless sooner
                        discharged, and to be liable to be called into the service of this State at
                        such times as the commander-in-chief may deem their services necessary, for
                        the purpose of suppressing insurrections or to repel invasions, and further
                        to be liable to be mustered into the service of the United States at such
                        times so requisition may be made by the President of the United States. Here
                        then the highest authority of the State, the Legislature, acknowledges its
                        obligations to protect its citizens for insurrections and invasions, by
                        organizing a large army for that special purpose, and produces the means for
                        putting them in the field. This measure was concurred in by all the members
                        from the border counties, and from that portion of the State as much as from
                        any other part must be drawn the resources to pay the loan by means of which
                        the troops were put into the field. If, as promised, this force was
                        organized to repel invasion, where was it contemplated the necessity to use
                        it would arise? Most assuredly in the southern border of the State. If not,
                        why then was the force organized and equipped at all? Certainly it was not
                        contemplated that they would be needed at Philadelphia, or at Pittsburg, or on the northern line of the State,
                        but on the southern border, in that portion daily threatened and often
                        actually invaded by the rebels.</p>

                    <p>That the troops were, after organization mustered into the service of the
                        United State, in an extreme emergency, and allowed to remain there, by no
                        means changes or alters the attitude of the State towards her citizens. The
                        act itself clearly implies that if these troops were to be used by the
                        General Government, it was only to be for a limited time, or while an
                        emergency lasted, just as other State troops were afterwards used and
                        controlled, but not to be merged into the Army of the United States. It
                        declares the Corps "to be liable to be mustered into service of the United
                        States, at such times as requisitions may be made by the President of the
                        United States." If the intention of the then Legislature and Executive of
                        the State, in organizing this Corps, had been adhered to, the citizens of
                        Southern Pennsylvania would not now be beggared through the ravages of the
                        rebellion, nor be beseeching the Legislature of a rich and powerful
                        Commonwealth to make some paltry amends for the sacrifice which they made to
                        the common enemy that the State might be saved; now would they need to
                        endure the slander and contumely and falshoods
                        which those, whom the various fortunes of the war have bloated with wealth
                        and pride, now pour upon their heads.</p>

                    <p>We submit to the candid, unbiased judgment of the people of the State if the
                        citizens of the border counties have not a just claim upon the State for
                        reimbursement,</p>

                    <p>The next argument used by the Commercial is, we
                        regret to say, not peculiar to that journal: It calls the claimants
                        "robbers." To this we have little to say, except that thieves have from time
                        immemorial sought to direct attention from their own pilferings by calling
                        those from whom they were stealing, thieves and robbers. It is not hard to
                        understand that a journal which finds it to its interest to advocate the
                        stealing three or four millions out of the public treasury to enlarge a
                        worthless canal, which would benefit no person except those who now hold its
                        valueless stock, and such as are to be compensated for aiding to consummate
                        the theft, should try to direct pubic attention from their nefarious
                        purposes. We have already adverted in another article to the false charge
                        that these claims are in the hands of speculators. There is no truth in it,
                        and those who are using it to damage the bill know it. If it were possible
                        to buy up the claims, he would be a fool who did so if he counted on the
                        gratitude and sense of justice of such journalists as the editor of the
                            Commercial, to constrain them to urge the
                        Legislature to do so just and righteous an act. The claims are all in the
                        hands of those who lost the property for which they now ask payment, and
                        whatever sum is appropriated, if any, will find its way into the hands of
                        the bona fide claimants. As to the private
                        letter which the editor claims to have received from Harrisburg from a
                        gentleman of "reliability and experience" whom he makes to say:</p>

                    <p>"The greatest swindle of the year is to be offered in the House to-night. Bribery is now at work to set it up, and
                        members are approached with the imprudence of the devil, with offers of
                        money to vote for it. It is the bill to pay for damages two millions of dollars for raids on our borders during the
                        rebellion. It is a perfect swindle, and I firmly believe if it passes
                        one-half will never go to the people interested. This is no place for these
                        claims. If the Government should pay at all, they should go to the United
                        States Government. It is her own business."</p>

                    <p>We feel tempted to ask: If private why did he make it public? If he made it
                        public, why did he withhold the "reliable and experienced" gentleman's name?
                        As he has made it public and failed to give the name, though we doubt the
                        reliability we have no reason to doubt the experience. And when journals publish a tissue of falsehoods like
                        that contained in the "private letter," we can do no more than denominate
                        them such, and let the "reliable and experienced" gentleman come out of his
                        privacy and assume the responsibility which is claimed for him, but which is
                        no where apparent. Such miserable tricks as this letter are too trifling to
                        be noticed.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Nebraska was the last of the States to give her vote on the Fifteenth
                        Amendment, and she has voted to ratify it. Her vote makes the thirtieth
                        State for ratification, including Indiana and New York, the twenty-eighth if
                        these two are counted against it. We believe that both will and ought to be
                        counted for it, but as to the result, that is secured whether for or
                        against. The colored males are now voters under the constitution, and a
                        proclamation will doubtless be issued shortly by the Executive Department
                        announcing the fact.</p>

                    <p>The effect of allowing them to exercise the right of suffrage in any and
                        every State will be greatest in the States which did not participate in the
                        rebellion, or more strictly speaking, in those States which held slaves
                        before the war, and up to this time excluded them from the ballot box. By
                        means of the amendment Delaware will be Republican by a decided majority,
                        and the large rebel vote of Maryland and of Kentucky, hitherto cast solid
                        for the Democracy, will be balanced, and it may be that both these States
                        may be carried for the Republicans. New Jersey will also array herself on
                        the Republican side, and the Republican majority of Pennsylvania will be
                        increased by twelve to fifteen thousand votes.</p>

                    <p>As a rule the Democratic journals of the country have accept the changed
                        situation, and are adjusting themselves with a view to securing their share
                        of the colored votes. None but the most obstinate and stupid any longer
                        attempt to fight it, or persist in saying anything which will tend to
                        inflame the colored population, and make it more bitterly opposed to the
                        Democracy than it now is. It is apparent to the thoughtful that long before
                        the fall elections a very general and united effort will be made to seduce
                        the too confident and trusting negroes into their ranks, though we do not
                        believe that it will meet with success. The time may come when the colored
                        vote will be divided between the two great parties of the country, but this
                        cannot be until the memory of Democratic hatred and ingratitude to the
                        colored men, and sympathy and submissiveness to the will of slaveholders
                        have died out. In the meantime we would advise the negroes by their conduct
                        and deportment to prove their fitness as well as their right to exercise the
                        boasted privilege of American citizens.</p>

                        Commercial in their desire to defeat the bill
