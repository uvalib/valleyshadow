<b>Inaugural Address of Gov. John W. Geary, Delivered at Harrisburg, Tuesday,
                    January 18, 1870</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints Gov. Geary's inaugural address. He promises to bring
                    honesty to government, expresses support for protectionism, and reflects on the
                    outcome of the war. "The settlement of the vexed questions growing out of the
                    armed conflict with treason, devolves a mighty responsibility on the loyal men
                    of the land. Armed rebellion was signally crushed by the force of armed loyalty,
                    and the Government has triumphantly established its ability successfully to
                    suppress domestic insurrection, however gigantic. The war itself has served to
                    stimulate our people to fresh energies, and to the development of new
                    enterprises. Our manufactories have multipled, plenty has smiled upon our
                    fields, and blessed the labors of the husbandman. Peace has restored our people
                    to their homes, and cheered our firesides. The rates of taxation have been
                    reduced, and are entirely abolished upon real estate for the use of the
                    Commonwealth. Our State debt is being steadily and surely liquidated. Immense
                    sums have been paid for pensions and other charities. The cause of education has
                    advanced, and the institutions for the support and tuition of the soldiers'
                    orphans have been liberally supplied. Railroads have been constructed, and new
                    material resources developed. And thus our State and nation are rapidly
                    progressing in the attainment of those elements of greatness."<br>

                    <p>Report of the Grand Jury in relation to our County Institutions:</p>

                    <p>To the Honorable the Judges of the several Courts of
                            Franklin County: We, the Grand Jurors of the January session of
                        1870, would respectfully report that after acting on all the bills handed us
                        by the District Attorney, we visited the Alms House, and that we found
                        everything in good order; the buildings being neat and clean. We believe the
                        paupers are well cared for. We would, however, recommend that some change be
                        made in the hospital with regard to ventilation. We would also report that
                        we believe that it would be to the interest of the county, to sell all the
                        land belonging to the Alms House farm, except from thirty to forty acres of
                        that lying nearest to the buildings. We would also recommend to the
                        Directors of the Poor to allow nothing to out-door paupers, unless well
                        satisfied that they are worthy subjects. We would further report that we
                        visited the Prison, and that everything is neat and clean, and we well
                        arranged as can be in the present building. We would recommend that
                        arrangements be made to put all prisoners therein confined at labor of some
                        kind, for the benefit of the county. P. M. SHOEMAKER, Foreman.</p>

                    <p>SECOND WEEK. - W. S. Fletcher. vs. Peter Brough, Daniel Trostle and C. C.
                        Foltz. - Summons in Assumpsit. Defendants abandon their case and confess
                        judgment in favor of plaintiff for $632,72.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A very large and appreciative audience was assembled on Thursday evening
                        last, in Repository Hall, to listen to this wonderful prodigy. If any still
                        doubted that he really was what has been claimed for him, they could
                        scarcely be in doubt after hearing him on the evening referred to. What
                        seeming contradictions meet us in this homliest specimen of the pure African
                        race. An idiot and yet a musical genius of a high
                        order, possessing a mastery over the piano truly wonderful. No matter how
                        difficult the piece of music, or how long, one
                        hearing is sufficient for him to re-produce it note for note, chords
                        and discords, without a slur, false register, or omission. The writer has
                        heard him elsewhere, where an expert performer improvised a long and difficult piece, which Tom reproduced
                        perfectly. Also, eight bars of Mendelsohn's "Song without Words," (very
                        peculiar and difficult), and a part of Back's Fugue, No. 17, the theme of
                        which, as well as parts of the answer, he imitated correctly. When waiting
                        for some one else to play, and while listening to a performance which is to
                        be re-produced, he throws himself into all sorts of clownish
                        positions--poising himself on one leg, sawing the air with his arms,
                        whistling through his teeth, &amp;c., but as soon as he is led to the
                        piano he appears "all right," and with a half maniac laugh will sometimes
                        ejaculate: "that's just's easy es nothin'!" His manager will perhaps call on
                        some one in the audience to hold up anything they please, and if there is,
                        for instance, a fan raised, the manager will strike a few notes, and Tom,
                        with his back turned to the audience, will spell out the right word. Or he
                        will analyze any number of notes--chords or discords--struck at random on
                        the piano, and will with wonderful celerity name every note. Or he will play
                        one piece with his right hand, another with his left hand, and will sing a
                        third piece on another key!</p>
                    <p>Then as to his style and manner of playing no one who heard him render such a piece as
                        Gottschalk's "Last Hope," or the "Fantasia" by Liszt, or his "Imitation of a
                        Musical Box" or his own "Battle of Manassas," if he has any musical
                        apprehensions at all, but must have been thrilled with delight or solemnized
                        as if in an act of devotion.</p>
                    <p>Indeed the sweetness and delicacy of touch, or, when he choses the brilliancy
                        and overpowering grandeur with which he seems to inspire the dumb
                        instrument, may well constrain, as it did, the great Moschelles--the
                        instructor of Thalburg and Mendelsohn--to say, that Tom's gifts were
                        "marvellous," beyond his comprehension entirely.</p>
                    <p>Whence has this demented son of Africa this gift--this wonderful attainment?
                        How can such skill--artistic skill of the highest order--dwell in such a
                        being? Or put in another form. How can art and scientific knowledge proceed
                        from what seems the very embodiment of ignorance and stupidity? Our
                        philosophies are here at fault. It is a deep question for the psychologist
                        to unravel. Man can only wonder, adore and feel, that a higher power is at
                        work here. Does not God here also "move in a mysterious way?" bringing light
                        out of darkness--yea, the bright corruscations of light in thick, Egyptian
                        darkness? How others were impressed, I do not know, but to me the
                        performance of that evening was more than gratification of the taste or
                        sense--and the morality of even that innocent gratification has its limits
                        at some point--to me it seemed designed to raise our thoughts and
                        contemplations upward, even to him the primal
                        source and fountain of all art and science, of all good and ennabling gifts
                        and blessings. It is a theme worthy to think of--worthy of calm thought and
                        reflection.</p>
