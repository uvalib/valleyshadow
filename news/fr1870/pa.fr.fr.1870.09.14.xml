                    <p>"<emph rend="italics">General - or rather - President - Grant has no policy,
                            and without a policy what can a party effect?</emph>" So, anxiously
                        inquires the Harrisburg <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph> and
                        unconsciously evidences its party leaning in the question. It is in the
                        first place a confession, by our neighbor, that President Grant has
                        faithfully kept his promise, made when he became the executive - that he
                        would have no policy of his own, distinct from or counter to the apparent
                        will of the people. We thank the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph> for
                        this tribute to the President's consistency. Aside from consistency,
                        however, or rather beneath the fact, lies the primal question - is it right
                        or wrong that the chief executive of the nation should have no policy? So
                        thus there are perhaps more than two answers, according as the querist
                        clothes the question in his own mind. Our neighbor evidently thinks the
                        President wrong in living and acting "without a policy." The Republican
                        party has applauded Gen. Grant for his declaration and his conduct in
                        accordance with it. Perhaps if the qualification - that no policy would be
                        enforced by the use of Presidential influence against the wishes of the
                        people - were fairly added to the President's declaration, as he himself
                        added it, the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph> and the Republican party
                        might agree that Gen. Grant is right. We say <emph rend="italics"
                        >perhaps</emph> they might agree. They certainly ought to agree, for we
                        think that the assumption by an executive officer of the right of shaping
                        the policy of a country like our own in accordance with his own conceptions
                        only, is an outrage upon his fellow citizens which nothing can excuse. The
                        spirit of our institutions is bitterly hostile to such assumptions. It is
                        true, in times happily past - in the weary years before the war, that deluge
                        of fire and slaughter which purified the land as only fire and blood can -
                        that Presidents did, by the use of patronage and by force of party drill,
                        compel obedience to their personal decrees and ruled for the period of their
                        terms with an absolutism which the Czar or the Sultan might emulate. But the
                        same war which elevated to the Presidency the man who announced his purpose
                        to forego any such attempts made it his thought so to do by sweeping away
                        the only real cause or occasion of such assumptions. Slavery the source of
                        all our other evils was the fruitful mother of engulfed the parent. Coming
                        out of the struggle for life freed from the system which had usurped all our
                        national powers, which debauching all our pliant leaders of party and of
                        thought, had engrossed all of our governmental sympathies, it was possible
                        for the Executive, uncontrolled and unperverted, to devote, himself to the
                        real duties of his station. No longer the slave of prejudice, of passion of
                        party necessity, Gen. Grant is able to do what James Buchanan was not
                        permitted to comprehend, or comprehending to execute; namely, to carry out
                        the will of the whole people as they express it in the laws, and this
                        without any preference, expressed or implied, for the interests of any party
                        or section, and still better without any overmastering inclination for
                        personal opinions on any subject.</p>

                    <p>That this is being done - that the President has no <emph rend="italics"
                            >policy</emph>, as the term was once so offensively used, - we take the
                            <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>'s admission as full proof. The
                        Democratic party, everywhere, charges it, as a fault, on the Republican
                        party, that its Executive has announced no plan of conduct. Now Democrats
                        must mean that General Grant should have a policy of his own contriving, and
                        should enforce it, and that he acts wrongly in following the lead of the
                        Congress and the written and spoken thought of the country. Else, where the
                        point of the reproach? The President is not acting aimlessly - drifting like
                        a shatterd bark, with the waves, hither and thither; but, even the <emph
                            rend="italics">Patriot</emph> must confess, has been following the
                        country's lead. In reconstruction, and in the management of the finances,
                        the two controlling questions of our internal policy, he has, undoubtedly,
                        administered the will of the people.</p>

                    <p>Time and again the voters of the land have registered at the ballot-box their
                        determination to restore the national authority over the misguided people
                        who rose in rebellion, to the end that quiet, order and prosperity might
                        mark those sections as they never have before; a dozen of times the people
                        have declared with equal emphasis, that they meant to pay the honestly
                        contracted debt of the war, and restore the credit of the country. To these
                        two great ends, accordingly, the government has addressed itself, and, as in
                        duty bound, has enforced the laws enacted for them. Reconstruction is well
                        nigh accomplished - the debt is giving way before the assaults of the
                        paymaster as the rebel horde did under the hammering of the Army of the
                        Potomac. In dealing with these subjects, wherein would the President have
                        done better had he evolved plans in the Executive brain and coerced the
                        Congress as a Corps Legislatif to embody them in laws that he might then
                        enforce them on the people? Would they, probably, have been as well devised
                        the plans of the Congress, composed as that body is, of the representative
                        minds of the country, and its members aided by the thoughts of all their
                        constituents - would they have received the ready co operation of the
                        people, without which, in a republic, no laws or policies can be long
                        enforced, or long endure? To state the alternatives in this manner is to
                        condemn the autocratic plan. Besides, had it been an even question at the
                        start, whether the President or the Congress should initiate a policy for
                        the term of 1869-73, the success of the people's plans are now an ample
                        justification of the President's course. We must praise the bridge that
                        carries us safely over, and the policy of the Congress, suggested by the
                        people, in their primary assemblies, has carried us safely over the yawning
                        chasms of anarchy and of debt. Our feet are on the firm ground of order and
                        of solvency, and we may thank the wisdom of the people that they are, and
                        the common sense and freedom from arrogance of Gen. Grant, that they have
                        reached the ground so speedily. The case, seems all around, consequently, to
                        be in favor of Gen. Grant. His policy has been to faithfully execute the
                        policy of the people. For that, surely, the people will not quarrel with
                        him, and the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>'s question - what can be
                        effected without a policy - may be left to the same people to answer.</p>

                    <p>It is, rather it was until ten years ago, a curious inquiry why the so-called
                        Democratic party should have so closely allied itself with the only
                        aristocratic element of our country; why men who pride themselves in their
                        love of unbridled freedom should devote themselves with even fanatic zeal to
                        the defence of slaveholding. The union of freedom-shirkers with man-stealers
                        seemed inexplicable, and the inquirer was forced to conclude that either
                        their Democratic pretences were a sham, or that interest was the powerful
                        medium whose common affinity brought the oil and water of the mixture to
                        unite, or that there is something inherent in radicalism, such as the
                        Democratic party profess, that makes Democracy like theirs closely akin to
                        or dependent on despotism for continued life.</p>

                    <p>There is much, we are inclined to think, in all of these reasons. The
                        Democratic masses doubtless are as honest in their instincts as any other
                        masses, that is to say, they honestly desire their own welfare and believe
                        that freedom from all restraint is the condition for its attainment. Not so
                        with the leaders: they, we imagine, have always been a calculating set,
                        dexterous, cunning, unprincipled, ready to turn with every shifting of the
                        wind, apt to be all things to all men, and advocates of license because they
                        fancy that in a general way license is coveted by the majority. It was true,
                        besides that the combination of the negro-breeders of the South and the Red
                        Radicals of the North was brought about by their common desire to rule and
                        to perpetuate their rule. But, we strongly suspect now that the South is no
                        longer a unit in support of its institution and no longer the powerful and
                        mercenary ally whose help insured victory, that the utterance of such
                        complaints as this of the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>'s, discloses,
                        as we have said, either an affinity for or a necessary dependence on
                        absolutism somehow and somewhere. If not, why this clamor for a personal
                        government? A personal government is when a President, using all the powers
                        which official station gives him, dragoons an unwilling Congress to pass the
                        laws he has <orig reg="drafted">draughted</orig> and as much meaner and more
                        objectionable a form of personal government it is than that just ended at
                        Sedan, as an elective monarchy changed every four years, is meaner than one
                        by Divine right or for life. A colossal central figure seems to be a
                        necessity in <del/> government <del/>
                        <unclear>power</unclear>
                        <del/> of government, and then are driven to deposit what they have taken
                        away. Robbing the members they are forced to heap upon the head; the
                        circumference, to accumulate at the centre - for they are constrained by the
                        need of government and the necessity for a sufficiency of power, lodged and
                        exercisable somewhere. The nation must live; it must, somehow, be governed.
                        Having no faith in man, they have none in his works: they withhold
                        confidence, everywhere, until compulsion ends their hesitation and then they
                        make the hasty choice of an unlimited President or a Dictator.</p>

                    <p>From Cincinnatus to Trochu the inclination of mobs has been to
                        centralization. Our Democratic party is a mob held in check by peace and the
                        presence beside them of orderly Republicans. How rapidly the Democratic
                        party tended towards that anarchy, which is the forerunner of despotism, the
                        moment our civil dissensions began! They denied our right to live as a
                        nation, and had they had their will would have led us through a weak peace
                        to dissension and an empire. They may not have wished this, but their
                        ignorance of the path they would have <orig reg="traveled">travelled</orig>
                        proves their unfitness for statesmanship. Being at peace, <orig reg="today"
                            >to-day</orig>, the best they can do, is to howl wildly at the Executive
                        and bay the Republican moon. Their disorganizing and centralizing theories
                        are the growth of the age which fostered ignorance in church and state, and
                        ought to perish from the minds of our generation. When slavery and polygamy,
                        "twin relics of barbarism," are vanishing from the earth, distrust in man
                        and in his capacity to govern himself ought also to be banished, and the way
                        be made ready for the Republic of the World.</p>

                <summary>When the Harrisburg <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph> accuses General
                    Grant of having no policy of his own, the Repository defends the president. The
                    editorial points out that, prior to the war, chief executives had used patronage
                    to command obedience. Grant, therefore, was a truly democratic leader who acted
                    with Congress rather than dictating policy himself. In short, the president was
                    carrying out the will of the people. The author then points to the
                    administration's successes in reducing the national debt and reconstructing the
                    South. Furthermore, the <emph rend="italics">Repository</emph> calls Democratic
                    leaders unprincipled and derides them for having supported slaveholders and the
                    Confederacy.</summary>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph>, last week asked. "<emph
                            rend="italics">What has Cessna done for the Border Claimants?</emph>"
                        and added "<emph rend="italics">that some weeks ago the</emph> REPOSITORY
                            <emph rend="italics">had promised a little light upon the subject for

                            rend="italics">had watched and waited in vain</emph>." On our profound
                        faith in holy writ we base our conviction that the <emph rend="italics"
                            >Spirit</emph>, in spite of its assertion, does not want light, because
                        there we are told such as it hate the light because their deeds are evil.
                        But it shall have what we promised. The Editor of the <emph rend="italics"
                            >Spirit</emph> has looked in vain to find some weak spot in Cessna's
                        armor where it might assault him with at least a hope of success, and
                        finding none has desperately turned to the subject of the Border Damages.
                        When counseled by wiser heads of the Democratic party than his own to
                        abstain from the further attempt, with mimic rage he shouted that on this
                        question "he would drive Cessna to the wall," and lo! in last week's <emph
                            rend="italics">Spirit</emph> behold his attempt at driving.</p>

                    <p>Thus far we have religiously abstained from subjecting the interests of the
                        border damage claimants to the dangers and difficulties incident to a heated
                        and exciting political campaign, and we had received strong reasons to hope
                        that our neighbor would do the same. Our conviction has long been that in no
                        respect could the dragging them into politics better the chances of their
                        payment but that they must necessarily be endangered and rendered more
                        hazardous thereby. We were sure that this was the sentiment of the entire
                        community, whether Democratic or Republican, and felt that not only their
                        sentiments but their interests should be consulted. The interests of both
                        parties are identical in this matter; the claims are held by both, and both
                        are equally just; the candidates of both parties are alike in favor of their
                        payment, and whether a Republican Congressman or Republican Assemblyman
                        would be able to effect more than a Democratic Congressman or Democratic
                        Assemblyman in these bodies, having large Republican majorities, or not,
                        this is certain, be they one or the other they will do all in their power
                        for the relief of the border people.</p>

                    <p>But the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> has seen fit to make this
                        important question the ground of its assaults upon Hon. John Cessna and thus
                            <orig reg="jeopardize">jeopard</orig> the interests of a large number of
                        the people of this Congressional district, and we have no alternative but to
                        accept its challenge.</p>

                    <p>We have already shown, in another article, that whatever Mr. Meyers did,
                        through the columns of the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>, to aid the
                        border people in this matter he did by virtue of a pledge made by Mr.
                        Stenger and other Democrats to support him for the nomination for Congress,
                        which pledge Mr. Stenger and they did not feel bound to fulfill. Mr. Meyers,
                        it seems, then, worked for pay and not for the love for the people, and if
                        those who pledged it refused payment they cannot ask the people to make it
                        good. But aside from the consideration, Mr. Cessna was as earnest for the
                        payment of the border claims as Mr. Meyers. It is true he did not attempt
                        the folly of asking Congress to make compensation, because, however just our
                        claims, he knew that it would be fruitless for a single member of <orig
                            reg="Congress">Congrsss</orig> to undertake the task. In this respect he
                        held views similar to those of Mr. Stenger himself, likewise, Mr. Meyers,
                        Capt. G. W. Skinner, and indeed our whole community. He thought that the
                        State should liquidate these claims, and that then with a solid delegation
                        of Congressmen she might demand and receive repayment from the general
                        government. With this view he came to Harrisburg, while Congress was in
                        session, and labored with the Legislature for the passage of a bill for the
                        payment of the claims. He also visited the Governor and endeavored,
                        unavailingly we know, to remove his objections against the payment of these
                        claims. Could he do more? What more did Mr. Meyers do save that he was at
                        the head of a paper, and the influence of his paper was secured by means of
                        promises of payment in political preferment.</p>

                    <p>That Mr. Meyers believed that the only means the border people had to secure
                        compensation was by application to the State and not the general government
                        is fully proved by his own paper. In February last the <emph rend="italics"
                            >Patriot</emph> said editorially:</p>

                    <p>A large portion of these expenses have been paid at Washington, as these
                        claims should be and doubtless will be when paid by the State and properly
                        presented. But when the State fails to provide sufficient means of defense,
                        or permits the general government to draw off her natural protectors to far
                        off fields of war, she is primarily responsible, although she may have a
                        just demand against the government at Washington. The obligations of the
                        Commonwealth to protect her citizens are immediate, and cannot be avoided
                        under the plea that these damages should be paid at Washington. The citizens
                        of the border have fulfilled all their obligations recompensed for their
                        losses in the war. It is cruelty to bandy them about from Harrisburg to
                        Washington from year to year, with the prospect of relief ever lessening.</p>

                    <p>A week later, in another editorial, the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>
                        eloquently said:</p>

                    <p>The appeal is made to the State herself, for that relief which the plainest
                        principles of justice demand; not on the ground that the State is solely
                        responsible, or solely bound in honor and good conscience to make good the
                        losses occasioned by rebel invasion, but on the other and certain ground
                        that the State, is an entire and single community, a social association with
                        common interests and duties, and that an injury to a part of the inhabitants
                        by external force, is an injury to the whole, and should be borne by the
                        whole. The citizens of the border were not separately insulted when the
                        torch was applied to Chambersburg, and when the armed and insolent foe swept
                        over their fields. This State was insulted and smitten. Her honor was
                        offended, her dignity assailed, and her whole people outraged. Is it just,
                        is it reasonable, is it according to that equity which should characterize
                        the conduct of States, that the actual loss should be borne by a few,
                        instead of being borne by the whole? The ultimate liability of the Federal
                        government is beside our question, which is a primary one, and not one of
                        secondary consideration. Shall not losses in a common cause be accepted as a
                        common burden? Shall not the principle of equal contribution according to
                        means, which is the principle of all just taxation, be applied to the
                        question in hand? Is it according to sound social morals that a few members
                        of the community should sustain the entire loss incurred by them as members
                        of the political society? The whole question is stated in the proposition
                        that it is the duty of the State to defend her citizen whenever the ability
                        to do so exists, and that when she fails in performing this duty she shall
                        indemnify those who suffer by her default.</p>

                    <p>That <orig reg="similar">smilar</orig> views were held by Capt. Skinner, we
                        quote from his eloquent speech delivered in the House of Representatives the
                        30th of last March:</p>

                    <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, it is folly for men to argue thus. How are we going to
                        approach the General Government? We can only command the influence and
                        support of a single member in Congress, while the State, if she were to
                        assume the payment of these claims, could instruct her Congressional
                        delegation to demand payment of the General Government. This delegation
                        being a powerful at Washington could easily secure such payment. I hope this
                        to be the proper method for the State to adopt.</p>

                    <p>The State can pay these claims and then very properly ask the General
                        Government to reimburse her.</p>

                    <p>We have only to add that Mr. Cessna is by this showing as fully identified
                        with the advocates of the Border Damage Claimants as Mr. Meyers, and has
                        this advantage beside, that what he could do he did without the promise or
                        hope of reward. We submit the issue to the people since the <emph
                            rend="italics">Spirit</emph> has called it forth and are willing, as we
                        know Mr. Cessna is, that they shall judge between them.</p>

                <summary>After a Democratic newspaper attacks Republican congressman, John Cessna,
                    on the issue of border damage claims, the <emph rend="italics">Repository</emph>
                    offers a rebuttal. Arguing that the very act of bringing up the topic hinders
                    the chances of getting compensation, the writer condemns the Democrats for
                    politicizing a sensitive issue. The editorial defends Cessna's actions and notes
                    that claimants would have a better chance of getting reparations if they elected

                    <p>Our neighbor, the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph>, has certainly exercised
                        commendable moderation in its announcement of the Democratic nominee for
                        Congress for this district, and yet, considering that the subject is very
                        unpromising, it is surprising how much it did find to say. The difficulty is
                        not that Mr. Meyers' political life is so barren of fruits, but that they
                        are like Dead Sea apples. They may do well enough to look at, but to the
                        taste they are bitter ashes. It was prudent of the <emph rend="italics"
                            >Spirit</emph> not to bring these prominently before the voters. With
                        much skill it evaded mentioning in its advocacy of Meyers, a single
                        Democratic qualification, and with one exception, only mentioned those
                        things which might as truthfully be said of a Republican, as of a Democrat.
                        See what his claims for an election to Congress are as set forth by the
                            <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph>. First, his enterprise as a
                        journalist. Second, his advocacy of the payment of the border claims by the
                        State, and third, very mildly introduced, his opposition to negro suffrage
                        and carpet-baggers in the South. How Mr. Meyers must warm with gratitude
                        toward the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> for its enthusiastic and able
                        advocacy of his claims, and its forcible portrayal of his doughty Democratic
                        deeds in the past? But then if Mr. Meyers has reason to feel disappointed
                        something deserves to be said in behalf of the <emph rend="italics"
                        >Spirit</emph> too. Its situation was peculiar. It was known to be bitterly
                        opposed to the nomination of Meyers, for both personal and political
                            reasons<sic>,</sic> The <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> is politic
                        and its editor both able and ambitious. Meyers' record, though not
                        personally objectionable, is politically most damnable. He was the worst of
                        anti-war Democrats in the district, and worked and wrote against the Union
                        cause. He pronounced the draft unconstitutional and tyrannical, and openly
                        invited resistance to it, and is even believed to have incited riot and
                        bloodshed by his course. He is an acknowledged and dangerous free trader,
                        acknowledged because he avows it, and dangerous because he is at the head of
                        a widely circulated journal, and daily promulgates his free trade fallacies.
                        Both of these reasons must render Meyers unpopular in this district, and aid
                        in making his defeat certain, and thereby weaken the Democratic party. The
                        editor of the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> is himself an aspirant for
                        Congressional fame, and critically watches every circumstances which would
                        widen the distance between himself and the capital. Meyers' defeat would
                        acomplish the defeat of the Democracy in the district for years, and
                        therefore the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> was unwilling to see him
                        made the candidate, and therefore it labored so zealously to prevent his
                        nomination.</p>

                    <p>Now come the claims which the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph>, since
                        Meyers is nominated, sets up in his behalf. "He is an enterprising
                        journalist." This, we do not deny, is commendable, but certainly not
                        distinctively Democratic. One should hardly be sent to Congress because his
                        enterprise enters the field of journalism. Mr. Cessna is quite as
                        enterprising as Meyers, but his enterprise turns to the law. Is he for that
                        reason less worthy to be sent to Congress?</p>

                    <p>But, says the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph>, "He urged the payment of
                        the border losses by the State." So he did. But last of all should the <emph
                            rend="italics">Spirit</emph> urge this as a ground for his election to
                        Congress. The editor of the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> was
                        instrumental in securing the support of the <emph rend="italics"
                        >Patriot</emph> for that measure, last winter, by promising Mr. Meyers his
                        aid, and that of his friends, in securing the nomination for Congress. That
                        was the consideration for the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>'s support
                        of the border claims bill. But the editor of the <emph rend="italics"
                        >Spirit</emph> did not deem this promise binding when the nomination came to
                        be made, and opposed Mr. Meyers with all his skill and ability. If he did
                        not consider the latter's efforts in behalf of the border damage bill such
                        as to require him to support him for the nomination, even after a solemn
                        pledge to do so, how can he ask the voters of Franklin county to do it? He
                        certainly does not do so with any sincerity. He does not mean it, but,
                        Meyers being nominated, he must make some show of supporting him.</p>

                    <p>As a further reason, Mr. Meyers is said <del/>
                        <del/>
                        <del/>
                        <unclear>to</unclear> negro suffrage and to perfect right to be, we are
                        sure, but why should these send him to Congress<sic>.</sic> The people of
                        the Sixteenth district want a member whose labor will be devoted to
                        interests a little nearer home than the carpet-baggers of the South, or
                        negro suffrage which is beyond the control of even a Democratic Congress.
                        The bitterest opposition to these things will not, in the least, make them
                        useful to his constituents. On the contrary, as Congress is likely to be
                        constituted, it would weaken his influence, and render him less useful than
                        he otherwise would be.</p>

                    <p>But if the <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph> really desired to inform its
                        readers concerning Mr. Meyers, why did it not frankly state his war record,
                        and give his views on the tariff; why did it not tell them that he devoted
                        columns of the <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>, last winter, to the
                        advocacy of the "Nine Million Loan Bill," whereby it was attempted to
                        defraud the State out of the money belonging to the Sinking Fund? These are

                    <p>THE Harrisburg <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph>, of the 8th inst., in an
                        editorial under the caption of FALSE PRETENSES, says:</p>

                    <p>There is a law upon the statute books of this State which consigns to the
                        penitentiary any one who obtains money or goods under false pretense. How
                        much better are those Republican politicians who attempt to secure their
                        hold on power by deceiving the people with false professions? And yet the
                        whole Republican press of the State do this. They pretend to be
                        protectionists, and yet they supported a tariff which reduces the duty on
                        pig metal and scrap iron, two articles of commerce which enter largely into
                        the manufactures of the country, and in which Pennsylvania industry finds
                        its largest interest. Among the papers which are loudest in support of a
                        tariff for the native against foreign pauper labor is the Chambersburg
                        REPOSITORY; and yet this paper supports the very tariff which reduced the
                        duties on the two articles we have mentioned. We are not, in any sense,
                        "protectionists," as the term is understood in the country, and therefore we
                        do not object to the reduction on pig metal and scrap iron; but we cannot
                        conceive how the REPOSITORY or any other honest Republican paper, pretending
                        to favor American industry by protective duties can support a tariff which
                        greatly reduces those duties on two articles of prime importance. In our
                        judgment it is an attempt to retain political power by false pretenses, and
                        if justice were equally administered would be punished as severely as the
                        law punishes those who obtain goods or money in the same manner.</p>

                    <p>Further on the same article takes occasion to define the position of the
                        editor more specifically still on the tariff, as follows:</p>

                    <p>We ourselves are in favor of the freest trade we can have in every branch of
                        industry consistent with the purposes of revenue as the theory most
                        beneficial to the general interests of the whole.</p>

                    <p>This editorial is evidently intended by Mr. Meyers, who is both editor of the
                            <emph rend="italics">Patriot</emph> and the Democratic candidate for
                        Congress in this district, as a reply to a recent article in the REPOSITORY
                        animadverting upon his tariff and war record. The two ideas prominently put
                        forward are, first, that REPOSITORY is false in its advocacy of a protective
                        tariff on pig iron and scrap iron; and second that Mr. B. F. Meyers is in
                        favor of the utmost free trade, only to be invaded by the necessities of
                        revenue. The first we deny. The second we cheerfully admit.</p>

                    <p>As to the inconsistency of the REPOSITORY in claiming to be in favor of a
                        protective tariff and yet supporting a tariff which reduced the duty on pig
                        metal and scrap iron, two of the main elements of production, we have this
                        to say.</p>

                    <p>Gen. Schenck, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a general
                        tariff bill on the 1st of February, and on the 3rd of March, the House went
                        into Committee of the Whole to debate it. This bill, as Mr. Meyers will
                        perceive if he will take the trouble to refer to it, made no reduction in
                        pig metal and scrap iron, and was supported by the friends of protection
                        throughout a period of nearly three months, during which time it was delayed
                        by the tactics of the opponents of protection to those interests, and it was
                        finally postponed for want of time, after it was manifest that it would have
                        been defeated by the free traders aided by the tactics of the Free Trade
                        League working in the interest of British manufacturers. About the 1st of
                        May, an attempt was made by these hostile interests to bring up a revenue
                        tariff, which was only defeated by the skillful management and courage of
                        the friends of protection, and on the 17th Gen. Schenck reported the
                        Internal tax bill, to which, after it had gone through under the rules, he
                        attached his short tariff bill as an amendment. Thus amended it passed on
                        the 7th of June, by a vote of 153 yeas to 35 nays. It was not such a bill as
                        Pennsylvania's industry demanded and was entitled to, but it had become
                        clearly manifest that it was the best that could be had at that time, and
                        that if it were not accepted, there was great danger that her iron interests
                        might fare still worse at the hands of the Democratic and Republican free
                        traders of the House.</p>

                    <p>The REPOSITORY believes that if a duty of $9 on pig metal could not be
                        retained, it would be better for the interests of Pennsylvania to secure $7
                        than less, or nothing; just as a creditor is willing to accept 50 cents on a
                        dollar, of his claim, from a bad debtor, rather than to get nothing at all,
                        though by so doing he does not admit that he is not honestly entitled to the
                        whole amount of his claims.</p>

                    <p>We are in favor of a duty on iron just high enough to enable the iron
                        producers of Pennsylvania and other States to compete with British
                        producers, and thus furnish employment to our laboring masses at fair wages
                        and a reasonable compensation to the employers. If it does not do the latter
                        the iron manufacture must cease, and one of the largest sources of labor
                        supply must be cut off, and many thousands must be thrown out of employ. We
                        believe that the present tariff is scarcely enough to do this, though under
                        the circumstances, and with the hopes of a change soon which will aid the
                        labor of our own country instead of that of Europe, iron manufacturers can
                        do better by continuing than by ceasing to produce.</p>

                    <p>We have at no time expressed approbation at the late reduction of duties on
                        pig metal and scrap iron, but if we have accepted the tariff as the best
                        that could be had because there were too many men of like mind with Mr.
                        Meyers in Congress, we fail to perceive wherin we have deceived the people
                        with false professions.</p>

                    <p>Is it not to be feared that the sophistical argument of Mr. Meyers convicts
                        him of the crime of political false pretenses, and that if the offence were
                        indictable and <unclear>cape</unclear>.</p>

                        campaign:</p>

                    <p>We hope and expect to beat Mr. Meyers on the ground that he is the
                        representative of a party that was devoted to slavery, justified and
                        defended secession, sympathized with the rebellion, contended against
                        universal suffrage, opposed and still opposes reconstruction, favored
                        repudiation, is adverse to the reduction of the public debt and the
                        reduction of taxation, and committed to and the advocate of Free Trade, and
                        the consequent reduction of the wages of labor; and we confidently expect to
                        elect Mr. Cessna because he is put forth as the representative of the party
                        that abolished slavery, established universal suffrage, gave liberty to and
                        protected the civil rights of our people, defeated rebellion and
                        repudiation, built the Pacific railroad, secured pensions to Union soldiers,
                        their wives and children, reduced the National debt one hundred and
                        forty-six millions in sixteen months, reduced taxation eighty millions is
                        one bill, and passed a revenue tariff with full incidental protection to
                        American labor.</p>

                    <p>Surely here are issues broad, and deep, and distinctive, and of absorbing
                        interest sufficient to enlist the intelligent action of the people, without
                        descending into the cesspool of personal detraction and abuse.</p>
