<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>We give the annual message of Governor Geary, in full, in our columns. Its
                        great length compels us to sacrifice other interesting matter, still we
                        prefer that our readers shall have it just as it was submitted to the
                        Legislature. It will be regarded as a fair, mediocre document, we believe,
                        full of interesting statements, spread out rather thin, and covering more
                        surface than is necessary, but up to the average of such documents. The
                        exhibit of State finances shows that we are gradually but surely approaching
                        the time when there will be no State debt. During the three years of Geary's
                        first term the State debt was reduced nearly five millions. At its
                        commencement the debt was $37,704,409,95. On the 30th day of last November
                        it amounted to $33,286,947,13. During this time also the real estate of the
                        Commonwealth was relieved from taxation, which shows that to pay off the
                        indebtedness of the State it is not necessary to burden the taxpayers. We
                        claim that this prosperous condition of the State finances is due to the
                        Republican party.</p>

                    <p>As the Chief of the Commonwealth should do, the Governor gives great
                        prominence to the education of her youth. The common schools, the schools
                        for soldiers' orphans and the Agricultural College all receive his
                        attention. Good schools are a cure and preventive of nearly all vices, for
                        nearly all vices grow out of ignorance. On the whole, the statement of the
                        Executive on this interesting subject is encouraging.</p>

                    <p>The office of State Treasurer has been the fertile source of bitter fights,
                        and of serious divisions in the ranks of the party for several years. At the
                        opening of each session of Legislature everything else has been swallowed up
                        in the contest to secure the Treasurership. Yet the salary is but $1,700 a
                        year. Neither the salary nor dignity of the office are enough to justify the
                        eagerness with which it is sought. The responsibility of the State Treasurer
                        is immense and the unexpended balance in his hands is rarely less than a
                        million dollars. It is this large fund which sends the vultures after the
                        prey. Common rumor says that the office of Treasurer is worth $100,000 a
                        year. If true, it can only become so by an improper use of the funds. To
                        remedy this evil the Governor recommends that the salary of the Treasurer be
                        increased to $5,000 a year, and the laws be so amended as to prevent the use
                        of the State funds for the benefit of the Treasurer. It is the best and most
                        vital recommendation contained in the message, and we are glad to see that a
                        bill has already been framed in the Legislature to carry in effect the
                        suggestions.</p>

                    <p>Having taken a prominent and honorable part in the war to subdue the
                        rebellion, Geary devotes a large part of the message to the present militia
                        law of the commonwealth, and recommends the publication of the military
                        history. We don't believe that a large outlay in support of the military
                        spirit of morale of the State would be justified by the people, and the
                        publication of the military history has already been discountenanced by
                        them.</p>

                    <p>The paper concluded with a history of the pardon business of the Governor.
                        This is well enough. During the last canvass Governor Geary was bitterly
                        denounced by the Democracy for exercising the pardoning power entrusted to
                        him in an unwarrantable manner. This statement is a complete vindication of
                        his exercise of this power.</p>

                    <p>A portion of the message is devoted to National affairs. Governors nearly all
                        dream of the Presidency, and in their messages nibble at national politics.
                        Though few of them are likely to be Presidents, and our excellent Governor
                        as little likely as any of them, he must play his little game along with
                        Hoffman and the others.</p>

                    <p>On the whole the message is creditable.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>On Monday afternoon last, in accordance with an announcement made from the
                        pulpits on Sunday, a considerable number of persons met in the Central

                        appoint an Executive Committee of five, who were authorized to appoint sub

                        thankfully received. These articles are much needed and will be judiciously
