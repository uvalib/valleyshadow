                    <p>By Hon. Schuyler Colfax.</p>

                    <p>No one can shut his eyes to the fact that the Democratic leaders enter upon
                        the contest just opening for the control of the next House of
                        Representatives with more confidently expressed hopes of victory than for
                        many years past; and it is timely at the moment to examine into the grounds
                        of these sanguine expectations. They can be summed up as follows:</p>

                    <p>They have dwarfed, if not ignored, the differences existing in their own
                        ranks on funding the debt and how it should be paid, its taxation, etc, on
                        which so many prominent Eastern Democrats disagree so radically with their
                        brethren in the West.</p>

                    <p>They have hopes that, reconstructive legislation have been virtually
                        completed, the new issues as to the finances, the tariff, internal taxation,
                        and foreign policy many tend to disintegrate, and thus render powerless the
                        hitherto compact and invincible Republican phalanx.</p>

                    <p>They draw encouragement, too from disaffections as to patronage; and the fact
                        that victory for ten consecutive years, embracing three presidential
                        contests, tends to weaken a party so long in power giving its opponents more
                        opportunities for attack.</p>

                    <p>But their highest hopes is in the severe and sweeping criticisms of Congress,
                        during the recent session, by prominent and influential Republican papers,
                        editors and correspondents permanently alienating tens of thousands, as they
                        trust, and thus, if their theory is correct, converting the Republican
                        majority of the past into a minority, ready to be overthrown by the united
                        forces of the Democracy, energized now by their long exile from power and
                        animated by the zeal and confidence with which they are preparing for the
                        contest.</p>

                    <p>It needs, however, only thorough unity, an energy worthy of their principles
                        and a zeal akin to that which has given them so many brilliant victories, to
                        enable the Republicans to baffle all these hopes, as they have baffled them
                        before, and to place their flag again in triumph on the Capitol. Contests in
                        which our opponents opened more hopefully than now have resulted in their
                        defeat. Even the Congressional contest of 1862, when the Democracy carried
                        every Northern State from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, was saved for the
                        right by unexpected victories in the Border States of the South. And the
                        greater contest of 1864, when after the nomination of President Lincoln,
                        disaffections in our ranks led to a rival national convention and
                        nominations and up to August defeat seemed possible, was, by the energy and
                        unity of the succeeding months, converted at last into the most magnificent
                        political and national victory ever won in this country.</p>

                    <p>It is easy to criticise Congress - nay, it is
                        popular to do so. The dangers to the land and the institutions when Mr.
                        Johnson was president caused these criticisms to be suspended, after the
                        issue was clearly manifest to the people; for they realized then, as never
                        before, the value and the power of that Congress. But with that danger
                        removed, it became easy again, with the tendency to criticism so marked
                        amongst our independent thinkers, and never to be deprecated except when
                        carried to excess, to review sharply and complainingly the action or non
                        action of those in power. Let us look calmly at some of these complaints.</p>

                    <p>All through the session there was fault-finding at the differences in
                        Congress as to financial plans and their failure to agree till near the
                        period of adjournment. But in these differences, be it remembered, the
                        Republican majority exactly represented the people behind them. Take one
                        hundred of the leading Republican papers of the nation, from Maine to
                        California, last winter and spring, and you will find precisely the same
                        conflict of opinions. Nay, more assemble at that time one hundred of the
                        leading Republicans of any State, and insist that they should agree on a
                        specific plan, and you would have found the same divergence in their views.
                        What was finally agreed on, after months of debate and comparison of plans,
                        I will briefly allude to hereafter.</p>

                    <p>While the appropriation bills were passing through the two branches of
                        Congress, the people were almost to believe that the Senate especially were
                        loading them down with almost innumerable and indefensible, if not
                        profligate amendments. The two hundred and fifty-six amendments of that body
                        to the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill were specially
                        and severely criticised, as all will remember.
                            What were they? A half dozen, on which there
                        were no party divisions in the Senate, and which were finally abandoned at
                        the demand of the House, embraced such items as the extension of the capital
                        grounds, a new State Department, which is how occupying a former orphan
                        asylum, not fire proof, and the increase of the salaries of the United
                        States Judges - the Supreme Judges receiving now $2000 per year less than
                        the Cabinet, and $4,000 per year less than the police justice of New York
                        city. Nearly all the remainder of these multitudinous amendments about "the
                        pilling on of which by the Senate" so much has been said, related to the
                        clerical forces in the departments, the sub treasuries, custom-houses,
                        &amp;c. The House had retrenched in all of them severely. The Senate
                        preferred to follow the estimate of the Administration. And as nearly every
                        paragraph in the bill contained one or more items of this kind, the number
                        of Senate amendments needed to bring up the curtailed House bill to the
                        official estimates seemed extraordinary. I may add that in the conference
                        committee an average of the views of the two houses was settled on - perhaps
                        more wisely than the extreme views of either. Many similar charges could be
                        easily explained.</p>

                    <p>From these criticisms, also, vast numbers of the people doubtless inferred
                        that lobbyists for subsidies, etc, were triumphant as never before - When
                        Congress adjourned, however, it was found that neither
                            the Senate nor the House had voted a single dollar out of the Treasury
                            for subsidies to steamboat lines to the Mississippi levees to
                        railroads or to private or public companies of any character. With a river
                        and lake commerce estimated at fifteen hundred millions of dollars per year,
                        a river and harbor improvement bill of four millions (less than one-third of
                        one per cent.) had passed; but this had been usual under all administration.
                        And landgrant bills which had passed the
                        Senate all failed, in the House except two - the supplemental North Pacific,
                        and one through a country mountainous and mainly unsettled, from Portland,
                        Oregon, to Astoria, at the mouth of the Columbia river.</p>

                    <p>Let us turn from this brief review of the strictures to which I have alluded,
                        to an equally abbreviated statement of what has been done by the Republican
                        administration and Congress for which it deserves well of the country</p>

                    <p>1. Reconstruction. When Congress convened, last
                        December, four of the insurrectionary States were still unrestored "to their
                        practical relations to the government." When it adjourned, in July, they
                        were all restored, and every star on our banner symbolized a State.</p>

                    <p>2. The 15th Amendment. Not only was this
                        irreversible guarantee of equal rights and self-protection enshrined in our
                        National Constitution but Congress enacted legislation, against the
                        bitterest opposition, to enforce the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments against
                        all who would seek to nullify or violate them.</p>

                    <p>3. The National Revenues. The fidelity of the
                        administration in collecting the revenues is signally illustrated by a
                        comparison whose figures are more impressive and conclusive than the most
                        potential argument. General Grant, in his sixteen months of service (from
                        March 4, 1869, to July 1, 1870,) collected $32,006,735 more internal revenue
                        than was collected in the last sixteen months of Mr. Johnson's service (from
                        November 1, 1867 to March 4, 1869,) no taxes having been increased during
                        General Grant's term, and having the same country to collect from all the
                        same laws to collect under. During the same sixteen months General Grant's
                        officers collected $19,401,193 of duties under the tariff more than Mr.
                        Johnson's officers collected during his closing
                        sixteen months. When the gain of fifty-one millions is cited, the answer is
                        sometimes given that the assessors and collectors had to be confirmed by a
                        Republican Senate under Johnson's administration. The reply to this is
                        obvious. Saying nothing of the officers who changed their politics with him,
                        and who, being already in office, were beyond the power of the Senate, that
                        body cannot nominate any one, and often had to except the best they could
                        get from him and that, besides, the inspectors, weighers, gaugers, etc. were
                        not within their control at all.</p>

                    <p>4. The Debt. The few millions of the national
                        debt paid during the last sixteen months of Mr. Johnson's term will be
                        remembered, and the contrast between that exhibition and the $140,000,000
                        paid by President Grant during his first sixteen months rejoices all who
                        hold that the national debt, as the cost of our national existence, must be
                        paid to the uttermost farthing. Not so rapidly, it may be hoped, in the
                        future but that each year shall see its volume and its burdens materially
                        reduced.</p>

                    <p>5. Retrenchment. In every department there has
                        been retrenchments. The clerical force at Washington has been reduced by the
                        thousand, every year finding it smaller. The large force of civilians in the
                        employ of the quartermaster's bureau has been steadily curtailed, devolving
                        their work, as far as possible, on soldiers. The army has been ordered to be
                        reduced, and the large surplus of officers are to be mustered out. The
                        grades of general and lieutenant-general, created by the war, are to cease
                        when vacancies occur in them. The major-generals are to be reduced to three,
                        and the brigadiers to six, as vacancies occur. And, after this year, four
                        millions per annum will be saved by the various retrenchments of the army
                        bill, without impairing its efficiency Thus, with honest collections, the
                        destruction of the whisky rings, (relieving the honest taxpayer from bearing
                        his own burdens and the burdens of the dishonest besides,) with economy in
                        expenses, with retrenchments in every branch, with the appropriation bills
                        for the future below the estimates, with the national credit maintained, and
                        with the national debt steadily diminishing, Republicans have no cause to
                        fear an appeal against them to the country.</p>

                    <p>6. Reduction in Tariff and Taxes. With all this
                        healthy financial result, the Republicans in Congress were able to pass a
                        bill, for which the Democracy refused to vote, reducing the burdens of
                        internal and external taxation in the aggregate about eighty millions per
                        year. In changing the duty on Bessemer steel rails from ad valorem to specific (that is from a per cent on value to a
                        fixed amount) a slight apparent increase has caused them to be denounced.
                        Without arguing the point, for I have desired to state facts rather than to
                        argue them, a word of explanation may not be amiss. Ad
                            valorem duties give high duties when not needed. Specific duties
                        enable all, consumers as well as producers, to know precisely how much
                        duties are to be paid, irrespective of fluctuations in cost. When Bessemer
                        steel rails, then a new invention, were taxed 45 per cent. ad valorem, under the tariff, their cost was about
                        $150 per ton. The duties then amounted to over $60 per ton. Increased
                        production and competion on both sides of the
                        ocean brought the price down to $100, $80, $60, and finally about $50 per
                        ton. The last Congress made the duty on them hereafter specific, (as it is
                        on tea, coffee, sugar, etc.) and fixed it at one and a quarter cents per
                        pound, or twenty-eight dollars per ton. This would be less than twenty per
                        cent on their price when first introduced into use, and would, if they rose
                        to over $60 per ton, be a less rate than the fluctuating ad valorem duty which it supersedes. But, without
                        claiming that every feature of this bill is exactly and absolutely correct,
                        (for no tax bill in all its details ever fully satisfied all who voted for
                        it or support it,) its great leading objects commend it to all who feel the
                        burdens of taxation.</p>

                    <p>7. Funding. Congress also passed, over the
                        opposition of the Democratic members, a bill for funding the national debt,
                        on which six per cent interest is now paid, into bonds to run 30, 25, and 10
                        years respectively at 4, 4 1/2, and 5 per cent interest; saving if all are
                        funded, twenty six millions of interest per year. The rise in gold
                        occasioned by the war may retard this desired consummation; but if our
                        opponents regard the new rates of interest as too high and too liberal,
                        their capitalists have an excellent opportunity now to avail themselves of
                        them.</p>

                    <p>8. Increased Banking Circulation. Without
                        inflating the currency, but at the same time saving nearly a million and a
                        half of interest per year to the Treasury on forty-five millions of three
                        per cent, certificates, Congress authorized seventy nine millions of
                        additional circulation to the South and West; which had now less than their
                        share of national circulation.</p>

                    <p>9. Pensioners. A much-desired change was effected
                        by Congress in providing for the payment to all pensioners quarterly
                        hereafter, instead of semi-annually, and in checks sent to their homes: the
                        Government paying all the expenses of the necessary vouchers, instead of
                        deducting it from their pensions, as has been the practice hitherto in all
                        our history. And, as the artificial  supplied to our crippled soldiers
                        wear out, on an average, in five years, or the money value thereof if they
                        are unable to use them.</p>

                    <p>10. Peace. Despite our strong and undisguised
                        sympathy with all who struggle for liberty and self-government, we have been
                        fortunately preserved from any embroilments abroad, from war or entangling
                        alliances, as well as from the threatened Indian war on the Plains; leaving
                        our work of development to progress unchecked; our national wealth to
                        increase; our national sinew and muscle to handle the plow, rather than the
                        rifle; our debt to diminish; and, till European war disturbed the money
                        markets of the world, gold to steadily settle downward till within nearly
                        ten per cent of par.</p>

                    <p>I must not trespass further on your space. The pictures thus imperfectly
                        presented is one of which none need be ashamed. The Republican party
                        represents the power, growth, progresss,
                        development, and humane and liberal ideas of the American people. Every
                        lover of liberty and human rights throughout the world sympathizes with it.
                        Millions at home as well as abroad rejoice over its triumphs or are saddened
                        over its reverses. Unity in its ranks guarantees the one; disaffections and
                        divisions hazard the other. Grave will be the responsibility in any whose
                        course should bring to it defeat instead of victory.</p>

                    <p> The Bucks County Mirror, one of those waspish
                        little Democratic sheets which amount to nothing if they do not lie and
                        slander; and next to nothing if they do, undertook to inform its readers
                        last week that the Franklin County Court had before it a two week's criminal
                        trial list, "all the parties being colored and living in Wolfstown." There
                        was but one week of Court instead of two, and though there had been two
                        weeks ordered the second was exclusively assigned to civil causes.</p>

                    <p>We suppose however that the Spirit will be
                        received as good authority on the question of white and black criminals in
                        our court, and from its report of the criminal court last week we take the
                        following:</p>

                    <p>Samuel Rohrer (white) convicted of assault and battery, with intent to
                        ravish. Sentenced to three years imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary.</p>

                    <p>Mordecai M'Mahon (white) charged with stealing a horse. Acquitted on the
                        ground that he was laboring under an attack of delerium
                            tremcus when he took the horse.</p>

                    <p>John Swingler (colored). Surety of the peace. Case dismissed.</p>

                    <p>Samuel Stumbaugh (white). Surety of the peace. Complaint dismissed</p>

                    <p>Rebecca Lane, Sarah Ramsey, Ida Carroll and Charles Stevenson (all colored).
                        Sureties of the peace. Cases dismissed at cost of complainant.</p>

                    <p>Mary Jane Lotsbough (white). Two indictments, procuring goods by false
                        pretense. Defendant plead guilt in both. Sentenced to county jail for three
                        months.</p>

                    <p>John Kimple (white) charged with forging the orders passed by Mary Jane
                        Lotsbough. Case abandoned by District Attorney and a verdict of not guilty
                        rendered.</p>

                    <p>Samuel Stokes (white). Larceny. Charged with stealing a $20 U. S. Government
                        bill from a letter. The bill was stolen but proved to be counterfeit and a
                        verdict of not guilty was rendered.</p>

                    <p>Hugh Larman (white). Assault and battery. Defendant plead guilty. Fined one
                        dollar and costs.</p>

                    <p>Abraham Seidenstricker (white). Surety of the peace. Sentenced to pay the

                    <p>Emanuel Hess (white). Assault and battery. Defendant plead guilty and
                        sentenced to pay fine of $10 and costs.</p>

                    <p>Joseph Knepper (white). Fornication and bastardy. Defendant plead guilt.
                        Sentenced to pay $15, lying in expences and 75
                        cents per week for seven years.</p>

                    <p>Robert Palmer (white). Surety of the peace. Defendant held in $100 to keep
                        peace and sentenced to pay costs.</p>

                    <p>John Smith (white). larceny. Sentenced to three months imprisonment in county
                        jail.</p>

                    <p>William Davis (white). Rape. Defendant was charged with having violated the
                        person of Mary Snyder, in January, 1866, she being then only nine years of age. She is a sister of the criminal's wife.</p>

                    <p>The facts were horrible and proved the man a fiend. He was cutting wood in
                        the woods. The little girl going an errand passed through the woods, when
                        she was seized by this beast and outraged. She told her sister, and when
                        taken home shortly afterward told her mother. Shortly after this Davis left
                        the State and participated in the robery of an
                        Express office in Maryland, for which he had to flee. Since then he has been
                        flitting between Virginia, Maryland, and this State. Recently he was arested and tried. the facts were clearly proved
                        and he was sentenced to twelve years in the
                        Eastern Penitentiary.</p>

                    <p>Michael Miller (white). Selling liquor on Sunday. Guilty. Sentenced to pay
                        $10 fine and costs, and be imprisoned ten days in county jail. These were
                        all the cases that were tried during the term of court.</p>

                    <p>We have nothing to say against the whites nor in favor of the blacks. Too
                        many of each color find their way into the criminal courts for violating the
                        laws, and it is only a fool or an ass, like the editor of the sheet we have
                        mentioned, that would make such wholesale and ridiculous charges as he did
                        for political effect.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>We learn that the survivors of the old 77th Regiment intend holding a reunion
                        in this place, on the 13th day of October next. Col. F. S. Stumbaugh, the
                        first commander of the regiment, is president of the association. There are
                        besides a large number of gentlemen residing in this and adjoining counties
                        who were members of the regiment, either as privates or officers, and a full
                        attendance of them may be looked for on the occasion of the reunion. Col.
                        Pifer, of Lancaster, will deliver the annual oration, and Capt. G. W.
                        Skipper has been chosen to deliver the address of welcome. We have not been
                        informed of the particulars of the occasion, but we have no doubt that the
                        reunion will be full of interest both to the gallant survivors of the old
                        77th and to the citizens of Chambersburg, who have always had a specially
                        warm feeling for the regiment. The last, and we believe the only reunion of
                        the regiment, was held in Pittsburg, last October, when the people of that
                        hospitable city strove to make the occasion pleasant and interesting to the
                        gallant soldiers. We believe that the citizens of Chambersburg will take
                        great pleasure in doing the same thing when they meet at this place.</p>
