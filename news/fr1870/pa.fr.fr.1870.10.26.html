<b>Constitutional Reform</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository suggests that the citizens of
                    Pennsylvania are concerned with corruption and favor constitutional reform. The
                    article argues that the "power to legislate upon private, special and personal
                    matters must be removed," the "State Treasurer must be made elective, the salary
                    fixed by law and the use by him of the public funds prohibited," and the "number

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Since the election the subject of greatest public interest to the people of
                        Pennsylvania is Constitutional Reform. All classes and parties admit a
                        fearful degree  corruption and profligacy in that department
                        of public affairs popularity called politics. Especially in our Legislature
                        have dishonesty and fraud developed themselves. The Constitution of the
                        State, imperfect in many particulars and wholly inadequate to the wants and
                        the condition of a people as great in population and material wealth as many
                        European Empires, needs to be amended. It is the organic law, and though it
                        may be sufficient to protect us and our rights from the unlicensed law
                        breakers, painful experience abundantly proves that it affords no protection
                        against a horde of lawless law makers. When in
                        1838, the present Constitution was framed and adopted, our fathers in the
                        simplicity of their lives had not learned to know and fear the dangers to be
                        apprehended from the latter class. In that early day the power of wealth,
                        the power of patronage, and the grasping and mercenary motives of both, had
                        not been taught them by bitter experience as we have been taught, and they
                        framed the constitution in the belief that the people selected and elected
                        their law makers from the wisest and best of
                        their number. Instead of that the people often have least to do with the
                        choice of their public servants. Powerful corporations, and exalted
                        political position aided by the corrupt use of government patronage and
                        money often forecast the Legislature months before the election, and
                        deliberately secure the election of such persons as are pledged to barter
                        away the best rights and interests of the people. This experience is so
                        common as to be generally admitted. Every Legislature for at least half a
                        dozen years past has proved it, and very often the members who were most
                        zealous in debauching themselves, and paraded their shame most publicly were
                        the first to be re-elected to the places they
                        had disgraced.</p>

                    <p>The people have one way of escape from these misrules. It is in
                        constitutional reform. The power of the legislative body must be limited to
                        legitimate fields of legislation. The power to legislate upon private,
                        special and personal matters must be removed and then there will be no
                        farther occasion for the exercise of the influences which corrupt
                        legislatures. The State Treasurer must be made elective, the salary fixed by
                        law and the use by him of the public funds prohibited. The number of members
                        of both Houses should be largely increased. It would be a barrier against
                        the flood of corruption. And best of all, if these be done, the dupes and
                        tools, the knaves and villains who have disgraced our Legislature will find
                        their occupation gone; there will be no further inducements for them to
                        infest the places of better men. These are some of the most needed reforms.</p>

                    <p>The Union League of Philadelphia has wisely taken the lead in this matter,
                        though nearly all of the best journals of the State, of both political
                        parties, have been urging it. The resolutions which the League adopted
                        favoring the project will be found in another column. Strong, stirring
                        speeches were made, and a committee organized with a view to direct public
                        attention to the subject. The project is fairly on foot, the best men of
                        both parties endorse it, the respectable journals of both parties favor it,
                        it is the only hope the people have to rescue the State from the incubus of
                        dishonesty which has sat boldly in its high places for years, and if they
                        exert themselves, whether the Legislature will or not, it will be
                        constrained to call a constitutional convention. When this is done, let it
                        be filled by the soundest heads and purest hearts in the Commonwealth, not
                        by politicians, and, our word for it, the good old State will be rescued.</p>

<b>Wisdom in Chunks</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository responds to the Bedford County
                    Press after that paper commented on why the Republicans did poorly in the
                    previous election.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>AFTER a political party loses an election, there is no fool in the land who
                        cannot state the specific cause of defeat. It is always safe to attribute
                        such an event to a scarcity of votes, but there are few wiseacres who do not
                        discover a more subtle cause than this.</p>

                    <p>For the defeat of Mr. Cessna in the Sixteenth district, the very profound and
                        astute editor of the Bedford County Press,
                        published in the little village of Bloody Run, informs us that the
                        Republicans of Franklin county are responsible, and then, with praiseworthy
                        energy, and bountiful lack of sense, proceeds to unfold his ignorance to his
                        handful of readers in the mountains. He tells them that Franklin county
                        Republicans defeated Cessna, and mainly because somebody whom he calls
                        "leaders" promised a majority of 300, and the returns show a majority of 186
                        for Meyers. Who made the promise we are not informed, except that they were
                        leaders, and that they promised this fabulous majority.</p>

                    <p>Now it is possible that a Democratic majority of 186 in the late election
                        might be accounted for, especially as the same party had a majority of 308
                        in the Gubernatorial election of last year, but all chance to do so is
                        denied by our heroic Bloody Runner who, cruelly we think, admits of but one
                        of two ways to explain it. Says he:</p>

                    <p>To be plain, it was brought about either by treachery or
                            incompetency on the part of those who manage the party there. And
                        to be plainer, we are inclined to think that the disgrace is attributable to
                        both these means."</p>

                    <p>No doubt after being tried and convicted in the peremptory manner by our
                        mountain editor, those whom he calls leaders would be glad to escape and
                        hide themselves from his terrible wrath, but the mind which is sharp to
                        discern is also quick to execute, and he at once pronounces sentence upon
                        the culprits. "Her Republican leaders deserve to be shorn of their
                        authority, her appointed offices to be given to men of influence, her post
                        offices distributed among reliable men from one of the other countries, and
                        the county itself placed under confederate rule." From which one of the
                        other counties should, reliable men be brought to take possession of our
                        post offices, pray tell us? Don't be modest, now, we beseech you. Modesty as
                        a marketable commodity don't pay.</p>

                    <p>For ineffable coolness, coolness that chills to the marrow under a July sun,
                        we would recommend the gentleman who sacrifices the mightiness of his
                        intellect to the drudgery of editing an influential journal up in Bloody
                        Run, if the quality were not spoiled by the alarming ignorance and stupidity
                        that accompanies it. We are pained to write this, because we had been led to
                        think rather well of the Bedford County Press.
                        We always do admire the taste of those editors who do us the honor to
                        publish our articles in their editorial columns. Our satisfaction is a
                        little marred when we find them surmounted by a strange head, and standing
                        upon feet which were never shaped by our pen, as we generally did find them
                        in the Press; still it was gratifying to know
                        that so far as our articles were left unmutilated the paper had something
                        readable, which it never had when the editor relied upon himself. Judging
                        from the number before us, we would still advise him not to grow vain and
                        set up housekeeping for himself, but rely upon the brains of his brother
                        editors. On the whole where there is a total paucity of ideas and no capital
                        whatever save stupid malignity arrayed in exceedingly bad grammar, we deem
                        it rather creditable than otherwise to steal. The only terms we would wish
                        to impose in our own case would be that there be no mutilation. Think of an
                        article being stolen and then such horrid contempt for pure and undefiled
                        English displayed in disfiguring it as the following:</p>

                    <p>"We believe that other counties in the district done the best they could. Bedford certainly done nobly."</p>

                    <p>Only no more of that and we care not for aught else.</p>

                    <p>AT Mercersburg, on Tuesday of last week, the monument erected by the Reformed
                        Church to the memory of Dr. Harbough, was unveiled. The ceremonies attending
                        it are reported to have been highly interesting and affecting. A committee
                        of the Reformed Synod were present. Rev. Drs. Gehrhart and Higby conducted
                        the services. Dr. Harbaugh, though still comparatively a young man when he
                        died, was distinguished as one of the first men in the Reformed Church and
                        occupied a Professorship in the Theological Seminary at Mercersburg. To the
                        public he was perhaps better known in the department of literature than in
                        the field of theology. He was an extensive writer and his works are noted
                        for great beauty of style. As a poet he won a wide reputation as the author
                        of a series of poems written in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect, in which he
                        caught not only the fugitive dialect, but the spirit and feeling of the
                        quaint and old fashioned folks who spoke it. He needs no marble to preserve
                        his memory so long as a type of the Pennsylvania Dutch remains.</p>
