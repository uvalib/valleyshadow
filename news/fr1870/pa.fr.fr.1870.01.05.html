<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This issue of the Franklin Repository opens the paper's 77th volume. The
                    editors write a review of the many important events that occurred in those

                    to the consummation of the great end of laying up forever in the fundamental law
                    the principle of the final equality of men." The paper celebrates the
                    "Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments" that will "be seen to be the
                    noblest achievement of this busy and advancing age."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>A long time has elapsed since we deemed it our duty as journalists to correct
                        every false statement, or every misrepresentation of fact which our
                        political adversaries may make. Experience has convinced us that if such a
                        task were undertaken there would be no time left for anything else, and as
                        errors can repeat themselves in a thousand ways, our work would never be
                        finished. Sometimes, however, an unusually gross fraud upon the credulity of
                        the people still whips us into this kind of work. such an instance is the
                        present one, in which we are tempted to correct a notorious false statement
                        of the Spirit in regard to the action of
                        Congress toward the State of Georgia. This State has been remanded by
                        Congress back under temporary military rule for the purpose of enforcing her
                        reconstruction under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and
                        according to the reconstruction act of the 2d of March, 1867, strict
                        compliance with which were made the conditions of her admission to
                        representation in the Union.</p>

                    <p>Section 5 of the said reconstruction act provided, that when the people of
                        any of the rebel States formed a constitution in conformity with the
                        constitution of the United States, framed by a convention elected by the
                        male citizens of said State, of twenty-one years old and upwards, of
                        whatever race, color, or previous condition, who were residents of said
                        State for one year previous to the day of election, except such as were
                        disfranchised for participation in the rebellion, or for felony at common
                        law; and when such constitution shall provide that the elective franchise
                        shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications herein
                        stated for electors of delegates, and when said constitution shall be
                        ratified by a majority of those voting who are qualified as electors for
                        delegates, and when such constitution shall have been submitted to Congress
                        for approval and shall have been approved by Congress, and when said State
                        shall have adopted the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution by a vote of
                        its Legislature elected under such State constitution, and when said
                        Amendment shall have become a part of the constitution of the United States,
                        said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress: Provided, That no person excluded from the
                        privilege of holding office by said proposed Amendment to the constitution
                        shall be eligible as a member of the convention to frame a constitution, nor
                        shall any such person vote for members of such convention.</p>

                    <p>Section 4 of the Fourteenth amendment, the adoption of which by said State
                        was made a condition of representation in Congress, provides that no person
                        shall be a Senator or Representative of Congress, or hold any office, civil
                        or military under the United States or under any State, who having
                        previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as any office of the
                        United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an executive
                        or judicial officer of any State, to support the constitution of the United
                        States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or
                        given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.</p>

                    <p>The condition of admission to representation in Congress, then seem to have
                        been, in brief, the right of suffrage to all citizens; the exclusion of
                        those who having held civil or military positions in the General Government
                        or States which required the taking of an oath to support the constitution
                        of the United States, had engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the
                        same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; and the adoption of
                        the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

                    <p>In pursuance of the provisions of the above reconstruction act, Georgia held
                        a convention, framed a constitution, elected a Legislature, and by popular
                        voice ratified the constitution, which gave, in general terms the right of
                        suffrage, to every male person born in the United States, and every
                        naturalized person, of the age of twenty-one years or upward.</p>

                    <p>But no sooner had the Legislature assembled, than a number of negroes who had
                        been elected by lawful voters as members of that body, were declared
                        ineligible under an old State law, were thrust out of the Legislature, and
                        their opponents, rebels who were disqualified under the Fourteenth Amendment
                        and the reconstruction acts, were declared to be entitled to the places thus
                        made vacant. Here then, were two acts in violation of the reconstruction act
                        and the Fourteenth Amendment, first the denial of the right of suffrage to
                        negroes, and, second, the election of persons, ineligible to office, and
                        deprived of the right of suffrage, to seats in the Legislature. And incited
                        by the success of these unlawful acts, Georgia has ever since been in
                        practical hostility to the general government, and well nigh in a condition
                        of anarchy in her State government.</p>

                    <p>As to the condition of Georgia, General Terry gives the following testimony:</p>

                    <p>"I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the situation here demands
                        the interposition of the National Government, in order that life and
                        property may be protected, freedom of speech and political action secured,
                        and the rights and liberties of freedmen maintained. In many parts of the
                        State there is practically no government. The worst of crimes are committed,
                        and no attempt is made to punish those who commit them. Murders have been
                        and are frequent; the abuse in various ways of the blacks is too common to
                        excite notice. If the most worthless vagabond in the country were charged
                        with a crime against a negro or a Republican no man would dare to testify
                        against him or to refuse to give bail for him. Most of the outrages on the
                        blacks result from hatred of their race. In civil cases, too, negroes are
                        without redress for injuries. Magistrates dare not do them justice; cannot
                        even save them for violence always while in their own presence."</p>

                    <p>It is not surprising that the Spirit should join
                        in the melancholy refrain which comes from the principal Democratic journals
                        at the action of Congress. If it is not their nature to do so, they at least
                        seem to have nothing else to do, and it would have been wholly unprecedented
                        if they had accepted the condition imposed on Georgia, without childish
                        complaint. Nevertheless if it is the duty of Congress to guarantee a
                        republican form of government to the States, which even Democrats do not
                        deny, and if Georgia has openly and outrageously violated that clause of the
                        Fourteenth Amendment which provides that "Congress shall have power to
                        enforce this article by appropriate legislation," this alone is not only a
                        sufficient warranty for what Congress has done, but it makes it their duty.
                        Hence Congress declared that the State of Georgia must fulfill the
                        conditions required of her, must obey the laws, do justice to her own
                        citizens, and purge herself of her crimes before she can be admitted to
                        representation in Congress. She has accordingly been placed under military
                        government, the Governor is directed to convene the original Legislature, to
                        exclude there from those deprived by their rebellious acts from being
                        members, to undo what she has wrongly done, and by way of punishment, to
                        ratify the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>

                    <p>After this statement, we are willing that the following statement of the
                            Spirit should accompany it:</p>

                    <p>"The adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was secured by notifying Georgia
                        and other Southern States that they could not be admitted to representation
                        in Congress until they would ratify it. Next came the Fifteenth Amendment,
                        willing to ratify if so as to make it a part of constitution, Congress has
                        had recourse to the novel and shameful expedient of excluding Georgia until
                        she agrees to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment also.</p>
