                    political parties in the antebellum era, as failures. The Republican party, on
                    the other hand, has successfully rid the nation of slavery's threat and has also
                    spread freedom and civil rights. The article attacks the post-war Democratic

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>In view of the weighty responsibility resting on every citizen to sustain the
                        interests of the country, it were well to retrospect the past in order to
                        determine what the true interests of the country are. We claim to be an
                        enlightened nation. We have facilities for obtaining the true history of the
                        past enjoyed by no former period in our national existence, and much that
                        pertains to the data from which we must form our convictions of political
                        duty is within the memory of a majority of our voters. We cannot, therefore,
                        shut our eyes to the importance of acting well our part, not through the
                        promptings of prejudice and passion, but from a thorough conviction of what
                        will be most for the true interests of the country in the future. If we go
                        back to the campaign of 1852, we find the two dominant parties, the Whig and
                        Democratic, arrayed against each other simply on the question of who shall
                        have the offices, each striving to embrace within its platform anything and
                        everything that would engage the support of the greatest number of voters.
                        They were, however, not alike successful in their efforts to present a
                        consistent record in regard to the slavery question. The Democracy - i. e.
                        the leaders - were able to adapt their platform to the masses in their
                        party, while the Whig party made up to a great extend of the anti-slavery element, only exposed itself to contempt
                        by its resolution endorsing the fugitive slave law, the consequence was a
                        half-hearted support to its candidate, Gen. Scott, who though personally
                        unexceptionable, was willing to take his chances of success on such a base
                        concession to the great slave power. The experiment of that party, to do
                        homage to the demi-god slavery as a means of success, was disastrous, and
                        Gen. Pierce, running on a consistent, though equally crouching policy to the
                        South, was elected. Now mark the consequence. "Whom the gods intend to
                        destroy they first make mad." The Democracy, during that and the succeeding
                        administration, served the South with a zeal that wrought the dissolution of
                        the party. The results have demonstrated that any and all parties that cater
                        to the base and wicked policies of their times must in this enlighted nation go down by their own weight.</p>

                    <p>Who now, would counsel either of the great parties to endorse, so wicked and
                        heartless a business as catching the slave, fleeting from the cruel bondage
                        of the Southern nabob? All parties, that is a majority of the members of all
                        parties, stand aghast at the base "bowing of the knee to the dark spirit of
                        slavery." The Whig party went down deservedly on account of this servile
                        truckling to prejudice and passion; and the Democratic party, more
                        consistent to the bitter end, met with a more terrible overthrow. The
                        Republican party sprang into power as if by magic. It was the effort of the
                        nation to disenthrall itself from sycophancy to the moloch of the South. It was not the Whig party reformed, but was
                        made up largely from the ranks of the Democratic party. It girded itself to
                        the task, and from force of a series of succeeding crises, in ten years has
                        accomplished far beyond what its most zealous and sanguine members hoped
                        for. Now what do we see. Instead of slavery threatening its encroachments on
                        the then free teritory of the nation, we see
                        the manacles struck from every slave on the nation's domain. We see the
                        civil rights of all protected by uniform and equal laws, nay we see the
                        former slave and the down trodden colored man, enfranchised as a means of
                        the protection of their rights, and we see prejudice and bigotry on account
                        of color receding from the country, so that the black man can walk our
                        streets on his business or in a procession without molestation or hindrance.
                        All this has been accomplished by means of the Republican party. Thanks to
                        the honest Democrats and Whigs who disgusted at the low, mean, degraded
                        policies of the heartless leaders of their respective parties, came out
                        nobly and separated themselves to the glorious mission of disenthralling the
                        nation from caste by establishing the Republican party. But, as every good
                        work has its foe, so we see collected together a party under the guise of
                        Democracy, and under the delusion that prejudice, bigotry and caste are
                        still means of success basely adopting the cognomen of the White Men's party
                        in order to get into places of power. Their small souls cannot comprehend
                        the great principles of right and justice which should govern a nation, but,
                        deluded with the idea that prejudice leads to success, they deem the masses,
                        still its subjects, and parade their weak and silly appeals in their
                        speeches and their press before the people. We know what the Republican
                        party has done; what has the "White Men's party" done? It could not if it
                        would, revive the putrid carcass of slavery, which it once embraced as the
                        highest form of government and society; but it would if it could steal into
                        power and attempt to administer a great government, the principles of which
                        it neither respects or comprehends.</p>

<b>The Great Issue</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When the Democrats portray the granting of civil rights to blacks as a
                    negative, the Repository announces its faith that
                    "Americans are not afraid to do right." The paper is convinced that citizens
                    will not vote for the Democrats' racist and unfair platform. The article also
                    claims that the Democratic candidates support Free Trade and are "all secretly
                    arrayed against the laboring classes." This, they argue is the reason why they

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>With us, and in a few other Congressional districts in Pennsylvania, the
                        Democratic leaders are working hard to deceive the people by representing
                        that they oppose the Republican administration because it has given suffrage
                        to all classes and conditions of men. They apparently array themselves
                        against us on the issue of prejudice and bigotry, and pronounce themselves
                        in favor of limiting the comprehensive terms of the grand old Declaration of
                        Independence to apply only to white men and not to mankind. They call upon
                        the white voters of Pennsylvania - five hundred thousand in number - to make
                        haste and secure the citadel of their liberty from the attacks of the
                        colored voters - fifteen thousand in number - else they will soon be
                        powerless in their grasp and become the slaves of those whom a few years ago
                        they so haughtily lorded over and degraded. We wish they were sincere in
                        this. We would be glad to know that they proposed to make fight with the
                        loyal party of the land on a question of prejudice and not of principle. We
                        sincerely wish that their cry of "White Men's Party" inspired the Democracy
                        wherever its members are found, and were not limited to a few Congressional
                        districts in Pennsylvania. For we know that a groundless prejudice however
                        bitter cannot last, and must give way before the grand principle of equal
                        justice and equal rights to all classes and conditions of men. American
                        history, if it proves anything proves that Americans are not afraid to do
                        right, and that they make steady progress in the pathway of enlightened
                        civilization, and have never taken a step backward yet. But the Democracy
                        are not ignorant that the battle of liberty in the United States has already
                        been fought and won, and that henceforth opposition based on bigotry and
                        class pride must steadily fall back. Knowing this so well, the "White Men's
                        Party" dodge finds no resting place except in a few Northern or Middle
                        States where the Democracy are themselves divided on the real issue and the
                        leaders dare not take a stand upon it.</p>

                    <p>Nothing is better settled than that the Democracy are in favor of Free Trade,
                        and are to-day striving for the election of
                        Representatives pledged to that heresy. Their united action in Congress to
                        defeat the tariff bill proves it. Their nominations in the Fifteenth and
                        Sixteenth districts prove their devotion to it. In these districts both the
                        Democrats and Republicans are strongly in favor of protection and yet in
                        each have the Democratic leaders nominated notorious Free Traders for
                        Congress. Yet so unpopular is Free Trade in both these districts that the
                        party leaders dare not avow and advocate it. Their platforms are silent upon
                        the subject; their newspapers fear to advocate it, and their candidates when
                        brought face to face with an earnest and indignant people weakly seek to
                        escape the odium of their Free Trade principles. To throw dust in the eyes
                        of the people, these candidates and the public speakers and writers of the
                        party, all secretly arrayed against the laboring classes, raise a great cry
                        against the Fifteenth Amendment, and call upon the voters to stand by the
                        White Men's party. Was ever anything more contemptible? There is no White
                        Men's party. The Democracy everywhere, except in Pennsylvania and a few
                        other places, are openly working to secure the colored vote, as they have a
                        perfect right to do. They would do the same thing here if there was the
                        slightest chance of securing any reasonable part of it. But there is not. If
                        they were strong enough to elect Free Traders to Congress by openly
                        advocating Free Trade they would not waste their time upon a miserable
                        prejudice against the colored voters. As it is they are driven to it in
                        order to delude the people into the support of men whose principles are
                        obnoxious to the best interests of this section of the State.</p>

                    <p>Let no man be deceived by this trick. Meyers is sought to be elected because
                        he is a Free Trader. The election of a man with such principles from the
                        Sixteenth district would be regarded by the free traders as a greater
                        triumph than the election of half a dozen Free Traders from some other
                        States. The enemies of a protective tariff would hail the defeat of Mr.
                        Cessna by such a man as a vindication of their wicked doctrine by the
                        people. And they would be justified in so doing if he were elected on a free
                        trade issue. Mr. Cessna has given his best efforts in Congress to securing
                        protection to the industries of his district, and of the whole State, and
                        Mr. Meyers would be the first to claim that the voters of this district was
                        in favor of British free trade if he were elected, although he now professes
                        to stand upon the platform constructed by the White Men's party.</p>

<b>Meyers' War Record--Chapter 2</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    aimed at discrediting the Democratic nominee for Congress, Benjamin F. Meyers.
                    To prove that they were not slanderous in calling Meyers disloyal, the editors
                    have republished Meyers's wartime writings. This, they argue is "to let people

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>When immediately after Mr. Meyers' nomination we charged him with disloyalty
                        during the war, he retorted by saying that we had been guilty of a
                        "malignant slander." We replied last week that if we failed to make our
                        declaration good, from his own record, we were
                        willing to be branded as a malignant slanderer,
                        and acknowledged that he was a patriot during the war. In pursuance of our
                        determination to let the people judge who is truthful in this matter, Mr.
                        Meyers, or ourselves, we publish Chapter No. 2 of his War Record.</p>

                    <p>Early in 1863 was a period of gloom and despondency which pervaded the whole
                        loyal North. Our armies had met with repeated disasters and had lost
                        heavily, the gallant soldiers at the front were entreating the government to
                        send them reinforcements; but disasters had brought discouragement and men
                        enlisted reluctantly. The finances of the country were likewise embarrassed,
                        and gold was climbing up rapidly. It was apparent to the President and
                        Congress, that unless the armies were filled up, and that speedily, the
                        rebellion would prove triumphant, and that the only possible way to raise
                        troops was by a general conscription act. However unpleasant it might be to
                        raise troops in this way, it was the only alternative, and not a loyal man
                        in the whole country failed to approve the wisdom and courage of Congress in
                        passing the Conscription Act.</p>

                    <p>The Bedford Gazette of the 13th of March, 1863,
                        tells in Mr. Meyers' own peculiar way how he approved it:</p>

                    <p>"The Conscription Bill recently passed by Congress, authorizes the
                        appointment by the President of a Provost Marshal for every Congressional
                        district, 'as fixed by law next preceding the enrollment.' This officer is
                        to be a kind of general agent for the President, (or rather the Military
                        Dictator) and is to arrest deserters from the army, to detect, seize and
                        confine spies, and to obey all lawful orders of and regulations of the
                        Provost Marshal General. In short he is to be the ruler, owner and keeper of
                        the people within the limits of his district, a petty tyrant, uniting in his
                        person the powers of a civil magistrate, the authority of a military
                        commander and the functions of a police detective. When the President shall
                        see fit to undertake an enforcement of the conscription, we shall look with
                        some anxiety and more curiosity for the name of the wretch who will not
                        scruple to disgrace himself and the community in which he lives by accepting
                        this odious office. Let the man, whoever he may be, make up his mind that he
                        cannot live a peaceful life, nor die an honorable death. Let him remember
                        that he makes himself the hireling of usurped power, the minion of the enemy
                        of popular liberty, the tool of a disgraced and doomed administration. Let
                        him remember that he becomes a voluntary instrument for the destruction of
                        the Constitution, and, therefore, that the very discharge of his official
                        duties makes him a perjurer and a traitor. And let him be warned that the
                        people will not suffer him nor his master to wrest from them the rights
                        guaranteed them by the blood bought institutions of their fathers. The name
                        of the man who accepts the office will be a stench in the nostrils of every
                        true friend of human liberty forever and forever! The finger of scorn will
                        be pointed at him as a second Arnold, who would barter the citadel of his
                        country's freedom for the gratification of his own avarice and ambition. The
                        people will brand him with shame, for to do so is their own defence against
                        the usurpations of power. They will put a scorpion's sting into every power
                        of his body. Men will turn from him in loathing and disgust, shunning the
                        contaminating touch of his political leprosy. The lash of popular
                        indignation will pursue him through the world, his effigy hanging in every
                        town and his name a bye word among the people and eking out a miserable
                        existence, his will go down to the grave, unwept by friends and unhonored
                        even by partizans."</p>

                    <p>Were we mistaken when we pronounced Mr. Meyers a friend of the Confederacy,
                        and one of that degraded class who fought the Union armies in the rear?</p>

                    <p>When the Democracy, North and South, were defeated by the re-election of Mr. Lincoln in the fall of 1864,
                        Mr. Meyers in the Gazette of the 9th of December
                        following wrote:</p>

                    <p>"THE DRAFT - Lincoln's elected, the war is 'over' but still Grant and Sherman
                        must have more men. (Mem. We presume they want them only to look on at the
                        rebels disbanding.) Bedford County has again been called on by Father
                        Abraham, and this time the following persons have been invited to be present
                        at his balls at Richmond and in Tennessee."</p>

                    <p>While Richmond fell and unusual rejoicing pervaded the loyal North, and the
                        heroic deeds and courage our brave soldiers displayed in assaulting and
                        capturing the rebel fortifications which surrounded the capitol of the
                        rebellion were on every tongue, Mr. Meyers showed chagrin and regret at the
                        rebel defeat by publishing in the Gazette of the
                        7th April, 1865, the astounding intelligence that -</p>

                    <p>"Richmond and Petersburg were evacuated by Gen.
                        Lee; they were not taken by assault, though five days hard fighting preceded
                        the evacuation. Lee has doubtless moved into North Carolina, for the purpose
                        of uniting his army with Johnson's."</p>

                    <p>At last when the crowning triump came, when under
                        the steady pounding of Grant, and his brave troops the
                        confederacy broke into fragments, when the shattered and broken
                        columns of Lee's retreating troops were cut off by Sheridan's fleet riders,
                        and Lee and Johnson threw down their arms and surrendered
                        unconditionally and when Jeff Davis was fleeing, a disguised fugitive, from
                        avenging justice, even then Meyers would not surrender, and in his Bedford
                            Gazette announced:</p>

                    <p>"A COMPROMISE AT LAST - The Democratic party has always contended for compromise as the basis of the settlement of our
                        national troubles. The cry of our political apponents, on the other hand, has always been, 'No compromise with
                        traitors!' Now, it has at last come to this that Gen. Lee, the mightiest of
                        all 'traitors,' and Gen. Grant, the representative of the Federal
                        Government, have made a compromise. Grant proposing the terms and Lee
                        accepting them. Had there been no such compromise there would have been
                        another bloody battle, or perhaps several battles, thousands of lives would
                        have been lost, many families clad in mourning and the war no nearer at an
                        end than it is now, through this compromise. What has become of the old
                        motto of the jacobins, 'No compromise with
                        Traitors?' Ah! its authors have had to swallow it at last."</p>

                    <p>This ends the second chapter of the war record of Benjamin F. Meyers, the
                        Democratic patriot of Bedford county, and now Democratic candidate for
                        Congress in the 16th district.</p>

<b>The Truth Appearing</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When the Spirit attacks Republican congressman,
                    John Cessna, on the issue of border claims, the Repository rises to defend him.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>It was bold and reckless on the part of the Spirit to charge that Hon. John Cessna had failed in his duty toward
                        the border raid sufferers, and showed the desperate condition of the
                        Democracy. Time after time were we challenged to show what part Mr. Cessna
                        took towards securing compensation for our losses, until we were forced to
                        break through our reluctance to submit to political agitation the question
                        which has no political character at all, and show the dishonesty of the
                            Spirit by informing the people just what Mr.
                        Cessna had done: or at least what we knew he had done. Unlike the Democracy,
                        Mr. Cessna is not given to heralding his own acts and deeds and we did not
                        know all. While the Spirit was charging that
                        Cessna took no interest in securing payment for our losses, all for the
                        purpose of aiding Meyers and Skinner in the campaign, the latter knew that
                        the charges were false; because it is to Mr. Cessna that he was indebted for
                        his appointment on the Committee of Ways and Means last winter, the
                        Committee before which any measure for our relief must originate. Yet Mr.
                        Skinner, though aware of what Mr. Cessna did, and witnessing the Spirit's attacks upon him, preserved a strange and
                        unaccountable silence though pretending to deprecate the agitation of the
                        border damage losses. Since the fact has been made known and Mr. Skinner can
                        no longer deny it he weakly admits the truth of it.</p>

                    <p>It seems that Mr. Cessna, whom the Editor of the Spirit was bound "to drive to the wall" on the Border Damage
                        question, has a better record upon it than Mr. Meyers. He secured the
                        appointment of Capt. Skinner on the Committee of Ways and Means, something
                        which all the Democrats in the State could not have done, and thus put him
                        in the only position wherein it was possible for him to be of use to the
                        Border people, and in addition left his seat while Congress was in session
                        and came to Harrisburg and labored personally with the members and with the
                        Governor to secure the passage of a bill. Now if the Spirit can show that Mr. Cessna was offered any promise of
                        reward or compensation for his services, as Mr. Meyers was, then we will
                        candidly admit that he ought to be "driven to the wall" just as Mr. Meyers
                        has been.</p>

                    <p>As for Mr. Skinner, who received the benefit of Mr. Cessna's influence with
                        the Speaker of the House, and was thus appointed on the committee, and
                        afterward quietly stood by and saw his party organ misrepresent and falsify
                        him, it is for him to explain his sinister and equivocal conduct as best he
                        can.</p>

                    <p>A legitimate conclusion from this exposure is this: If Mr. Skinner, being a
                        Democrat, was powerless to aid the Border people in a Republican Legislature
                        without the intercession and influence of Republicans, would it not be wise
                        to learn the lesson which it teaches, and in the coming election send
                        Republican members to that body.</p>

<b>Meyers and Skinner</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository points out that the two
                    Democratic candidates, Meyers for Congress and Skinner for Assembly, were on
                    opposite sides of the war. While Meyers was a "Copperhead," Skinner was actually
                    a soldier. Arguing that there remains bad blood between the two, the editorial
                    hopes that the veterans will, on voting day, "use their ballots as effectively .
                    . . as they did their bullets against the armed rebels in the South."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Meyers glories in his Copperhead record during the war. Not one line of it
                        will he have blotted out, not one word that he uttered against the Union
                        will he take back. Capt. Skinner, the Democratic candidate for Assembly, was
                        a soldier when Meyers was a Copperhead. Skinner belonged to the class that
                        Meyers called "Lincoln hirelings." His record as a soldier so far as we know
                        was good. He knows as well as any one else that during the fearful peril of
                        this nation he and Meyers occupied opposite positions on the great question
                        of saving the Union. Skinner now apologizes for ever wearing 'the blue' by
                        taking a subordinate place on the same ticket with the most outspoken
                        advocate of Jefferson Davis in this Congressional District. He thinks that
                        the grand victories of the Western Army, to which he belonged, were
                        compromises, and that the Rebels never retreated nor were put to rout, but
                        that they evacuated the strongholds they could no longer keep. For instance,
                        Pemberton evacuated Vicksburg and Lee Gettysburg in those memorable days in
                        July, 1863. Meyers says so, and is not Skinner running on the same ticket
                        with Meyers, and were they not both nominated by the Democratic party? It is
                        true that Skinner did not want Meyers nominated for Congress, and circulated
                        a remonstrance to defeat him, but his efforts were unavailing. The only
                        course for Skinner then to have pursued would have been to withdraw from the
                        ticket. This would have been to his credit and would have made him hosts of
                        friends. He thought differently, and forgetting the memories of his soldier
                        days, he is now devoting himself earnestly to secure Meyers' election. The
                        truth of the matter is Skinner endorses Meyers, but Meyers still regards
                        Skinner as having played the part of a vandal, although he has hopes that he
                        will wash out that disgrace by supporting a rebel for Congress. The soldiers
                        of this county than whom none know better what the course of such men as
                        Meyers cost the Government in treasure and in blood, will use their ballots
                        as effectively on the second Tuesday of October against Meyers, the traitor,
                        and Skinner his friend, as they did their bullets against the armed rebels
                        in the South.</p>
