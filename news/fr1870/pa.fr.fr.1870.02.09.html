<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the last issue of your paper you materially misstate the proceedings of
                        the Pennsylvania Annual Conference of the United Brethren in Christ,
                        respecting myself and Rev. J. P. Bishop. The facts in the case are simply as
                        follows:</p>

                    <p>After our views respecting the "future everlasting punishment of the wicked"
                        had been overhauled by an inquisitorial committee, and the Conference had
                        passed a paper expressing its "sense" in the
                        case, and most emphatically condemning our views, and demanding of us a
                        promise of entire silence in regard to then, after they themselves had published them, we felt we could no longer remain
                        in connection with the Conference and respect ourselves. We therefore
                        proposed to the Conference that, if they had any law for their proceedings they should expel us. This, for good
                        reason, no doubt, they declined to do. In order, therefore, to end the
                        matter, we proposed to withdraw on condition that we should receive a
                        certificate of good moral character, and that the withdrawal was occasioned
                        by our belief that "the wicked would have no conscious living existence
                        after this life," which proposition was promptly accepted by the Conference.
                        Then, after we had publicly withdrawn from the
                            conference and the Church, they gave us an exhibition of their
                        good faith in the matter, by passing a paper requesting that we surrender
                        our certificates of license and ordination. I claim no authority to act
                        under those certificates as a United Brethren preacher; but they are my own
                        individual property; nor have I ever done anything to render them void so
                        far as the duties of an ordained minister are concerned. The case might be different had
                        they expelled us; but for this we did, and do yet claim they had no law.
                        Respectfully J. G. SCHAFF.<br> CHAMBERSBURG, Feb. 3, 1870.</p>

                    <p>The statement alluded to was taken from what was believed to be a correct
                        report of the proceedings of the Conference. - EDITOR.</p>
