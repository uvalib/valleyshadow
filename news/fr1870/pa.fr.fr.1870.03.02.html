<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>It is scarcely to be expected that the people of the border counties will
                        escape the slanderers tongue when they ask
                        the Legislature to make them some amends for the extraordinary and
                        overwhelming loss of property which the rebellion brought upon them. Still
                        less can it be expected that all the silly and irresponsible newspapers
                        which make up their vapid columns by slobbering over the leading articles of
                        the half-dozen "leading journals" should receive their notice. Human animals
                        are not so much superior to brute beasts, despite their intellect, as many
                        of the favored race assume to be, and the brute instinct crops out in their
                        actions quite as often as the godlike. Close observers of the nature and
                        habits of wild beasts tell us that when one of their number becomes wounded,
                        or disabled, the others turn upon him and with cruel ferocity stamp and rend
                        him to death. Still closer observation, or the same observation, applied to
                        human animals will discover a trace of the same trait in all, and, in some,
                        developed into a living principle. Those whose brute instincts tempt them to
                        turn on their unfortunate and helpless neighbor, and, because he is already
                        down, trample him still deeper in the pit of woe and misfortune, are in
                        every community; and, like the herd of wild beasts, they but want a buffalo
                        bull or a bell wether to lead them on. Hence
                        no sooner had the citizens of the border counties applied to the Legislature
                        at Harrisburg for relief, and a few of the newspapers at Pittsburg and Philadelphia, which live chiefly
                        by piracy and buccaneering, had threatened to raise their oft repeated roar
                        unless their insatiate appetite for plunder were speedily appeased, than the
                        herd of imitators turned on them, and such a din, clash and clatter as they
                        made even devils would respect and admire. The sound animals rushed upon the
                        disabled ones, and with terrific roars and bellowings, and pawing of dirt,
                        they trampled them under their hoods and, at least, tried their best to
                        exterminate them.</p>

                    <p>This may be deemed figurative, and to some extent it is, but it is scarcely a
                        figure of speech to say that much which appeared in some of the country
                        journals last week, on the subject we treat of, could only have received its
                        inspiration from the heart of a human beast. And by "inspiration" we desire
                        carefully to exclude the impression that we mean the ideas, but only the
                        spirit, that which moved them. The ideas, as we remarked before, they are
                        not responsible for, and indeed this class of journals is only remarkable
                        for its plentiful lack of ideas. If they had anything to advance which would
                        satisfy a reasonable mind that the State of Pennsylvania ought not to make
                        compensation for the losses of property which the border people suffered
                        from the rebellion, or if they but undertook to do this and failed, their
                        efforts would be entitled to respectful consideration, and we have no doubt
                        would receive it. But if they entirely ignore legitimate discussion, and
                        devote their columns and their talents (?) in inhuman abuse, and wilful and notorious falsehood; if they
                        misrepresent the well known facts of history, and insult a large and
                        intelligent population, which, in addition to the pecuniary embarrassments
                        which the war brought to them alone of all the people of Pennsylvania,
                        fulfilled all the requirements of the government, made up all her quotas of
                        troops, paid all her taxes and bounties, and put a larger proportion of her
                        native born population into the Union army than almost any other part of the
                        State, it is themselves, and not we, who construct an argument of no
                        trifling weight in favor of the payment of the border damages. For it is a
                        well known fact that they who can find no argument to sustain their cause
                        always fly into personal abuse and slander of their opponents. It is a
                        concession that they have no better argument to make. We take it also to be
                        conceded, that if any exceptions to the payment of these claims by the
                        State, are based wholly on the repugnant position of the border counties,
                        during the war, which some of these newspapers charge, they admit the
                        principle of the correlative rights and duties of the State and her
                        citizens, admit the principle that the State is bound to protect, and on
                        failure, to make good the losses resulting from that failure. If then these
                        charges are false not only are their objections removed, but so far as those
                        making them are concerned, they become advocates for the payment of the
                        losses.</p>

                    <p>That we may not be charged with unfairness, let us see what some of these
                        journals say. This from one far enough away from the border not to have been
                        vexed with rebel raids during the war:</p>

                    <p>
                        While we have genuine sympathy with the loyal people of
                            the border counties who suffered in the loss of property during the war,
                            we cannot agree that the State of Pennsylvania is in any way bound to
                            reimburse them. Nor are we even satisfied that the General Government is
                            at all responsible for the payment of their claims. It was to be
                            expected when we went to war that disaster and loss, to a greater or
                            less degree, would be the inevitable sequel. If those losses have proved
                            unequal it was a result which could not be avoided. If the inhabitants
                            of the border counties have been compelled to bear more than their share
                            - as is alleged by them - it was their misfortune and the lot of war,
                            and while we may sympathize with them we cannot feel bound to make their
                            losses good. It is impossible now to equalize the burden, if for no
                            other reason than that it is impossible to estimate the losses. The
                            people of the southern tier of counties may have suffered greatly in the
                            destruction of their property, but what is this in comparison with the
                            agony of those who lost what was infinitely more dear to them than
                            houses or lands or any other earthly possession! The great loss of the
                            war can neither be estimated or indemnified. We cannot pay the wife for
                            her husband, the mother for her son, or the orphan for his father. All
                            the wealth in the State and National Treasuries would be insufficient
                            for the reimbursement of one stricken household robbed of the father,
                            son or husband. No legislation that can be enacted will ever be the
                            weight of a feather in the scale against the suffering and sorrow, the
                            pain and anguish of the bereaved hearts throbbing by the lonely
                            hearthstones in ten thousand Pennsylvania inhabitations. What are the
                            border damage claims as compared with these! Of what accounts is the
                            pitiful loss of horses and cattle contrasted with sundering of
                            heart-strings, the desolation of homes, and the agony and anguish which
                            shall endure until the grave closes over them!
                    </p>

                    <p>There is much in this which we must pass over without comment, lest our
                        remarks grow too lengthy, but though the writer in a general way protests
                        against payment of the claims the reader will perceive that he wholly fails
                        to find a reason for his protests. What he does say is so silly that no sane
                        man who reads it can fail to detect it. Who but a fool would say "it was to
                        be expected, when we went into the war, that disaster and loss, to a greater
                        or less degree, would be the inevitable result." We of the North never went
                        into the war. The war went into us and brought
                        this disaster and loss. The rebellion was the war, and the South, nor the
                        North made the rebellion. It was this which we put down. Admit, if the
                        losses were unequal, that it was a result which could not be avoided, as the
                        writer says. But can it not be mended? Now that the war is over and the rest
                        of the State has escaped, shall not this inequality be repaired? If not, by
                        what rule of justice and right, pray let the writer tell us, does the State
                        relieve itself from this obligation? His conclusion, that our misfortunes
                        were the lot of war, but that he does not feel bound to make our losses
                        good, coupled with the hypocritical whine of sympathy, is magnificently
                        Pecksniffian. It means translated, "Gentlemen, by your sacrifices and
                        sufferings you saved our property, but that is done and can't be undone, and
                        we'll take deuced good care, while we feel immensely for you, that our
                        feelings don't influence our pocket nerve. That would be carrying the joke a
                        little too far."</p>

                    <p>Here follows a suggestion we are glad the writer made. He says, admitting the
                        destruction of property, &amp;c., of the border counties, "what is it
                        all in comparison with the agony of those who lost what was infinitely more
                        dear, to them than houses or lands or any other earthly possession! We
                        cannot pay the wife for her husband, the mother for her son, or the orphan
                        for his father." No truer words could have been uttered, though they do come
                        from a fool. Not a word can be uttered on the question of the awful human
                        sacrifice of the war, and of the veil of sorrow, which fell upon the land
                        never to be lifted during the life of the present generation, but it applies
                        with as much force to the border counties as to any other part of the entire
                        North. There is scarcely a household in them all but mediately or
                        immediately mourns the loss of some dear member, often the one who was its
                        main support. These losses are mourned as inscrutable dispensations of
                        Providence, beyond the reach of human aid or remedy, and though they bow to
                        His will they do not complain. But while their support was taken they were
                        left, and unlike those who mourn in other sections of the North, their
                        property, their means of livlihood was taken
                        also. The State cannot give them back their dead, but it can restore to them
                        their stolen and destroyed property, and enable them to make a livlihood once more, and then they will be no
                        better off than the others who have been bereaved by the war. Yes, we thank
                        the writer for his suggestion.</p>

                    <p>But let us hasten on to what he evidently regarded as the most forcible point
                        in his very strong article. There are, in general terms, about a hundred
                        thousand persons outside the border counties who from personal experience
                        can pronounce them unmitigated lies:</p>

                    <p>Nor have we forgotten, either, the position occupied by a large majority of
                        the people of these identical counties while the war was going on. It is
                        safe to say that many of them, if they had spoken the earnest wish of their
                        hearts, desired the success of the rebellion. Not a few of them ever
                        publicly expressed the hope that the rebels would enter Pennsylvania. It is
                        a historical fact that at least on one occasion they were piloted into the
                        State by a citizen of one of the counties now claiming damages. Among the
                        men assailing the State for compensation are some, at least, who invited the
                        enemies of the Government to visit their localities. The man who first
                        introduced the bill for reimbursement, sent for the rebels to come to his
                        dwelling during one of their raids, saluted them as his friends, and feted
                        them in his house in the most lavish spirit of hospitality. That his
                        "friends" on departing stripped him of everything valuable was the occasion
                        of his earnest advocacy of the bill in question. We remember also that in
                        all these counties a most bitter hatred was manifested toward the Union
                        troops, even though they went there to drive out the rebel invaders. It is
                        upon record that water was sold by the citizens
                        to the parched and thirsty soldiers, and that every species of extortion was
                        resorted to in the sale of provisions to them. While the rebels on their
                        first appearance were cheered loudly and supplied with everything freely and
                        without price, our soldiers were met with black looks and treachery, and
                        would have been compelled to starve had the citizens possessed the power. It
                        is utterly useless for the border people to profess their loyality. The proof is too plain that the aggregate
                        were warm sympathizers with the rebellion; and it would not be difficult to
                        establish the fact that very many of them met their losses in consequence of
                        their disloyal attachments.</p>

                    <p>Even here, as everywhere, there is a grain of wheat in the load of chaff, and
                        we must qualify our declaration as to the lies. There is some truth in the
                        statement. The rebels were piloted towards the county of Franklin, not into
                        it, by the county of Franklin, not into it, by one who had been a citizen of
                        the county and was a traitor. Can Washington county, Pa., boast that of her
                        citizens there was but one traitor?</p>

                    <p>Let us dismiss the disgusting recital without commenting on each infamous
                        falsehood. Each distinct statement is a lie, and we have little doubt that
                        the writer knew it. We feel, however, like excepting that one, in which he
                        says, the man who first introduced the bill for reimbursement invited the
                        rebel raiders to his dwelling and defeated them, &amp;c., from the lot,
                        and admitting it to be true. It is possible that some human being may
                        believe even the writer, whom we have quoted, to be his friend; and how
                        infinitely more would he be deceived than was the man, if it were true, who
                        believed the rebels to be his friends.</p>

                    <p>We have said that about a hundred thousand non-residents of the border
                        counties, could testify that all the allegations we have quoted, are false.
                        During the first few months of the war many thousands of soldiers were
                        stationed in and about Chambersburg, all of whom can, and we doubt not would
                        if called upon, testify to the uniform hospitality of the citizens of both
                        the town and surrounding country. Loads of provisions were brought to their
                        camps and gratuitously distributed, and the citizens seemed to vie with each
                        other in their kind attentions. During the whole period of the war hospitals
                        were located in the same place, and thousands of sick and wounded soldiers
                        were in their charge. Many of them were taken to their houses and cared for
                        by the citizens without charge upon the government or to the soldiers, and
                        since the war many grateful hearts have taken occasion to express in warm
                        and hearty terms the gratitude they felt for the true hospitalities extended
                        to them while in the service of the government.</p>

                    <p>Having been tempted to say this much we will add a few extracts from papers
                        similar in tone and sentiment to that we have quoted, and close. The Indiana
                            Progress says:</p>

                    <p>The claim is based upon damages done by Union troops when called to the
                        defence of the border and by the rebels when invading Pennsylvania. While
                        the people damaged are entitled to our sympathies, by no law or reason can
                        the Commonwealth be called on to pay them for their losses. A mistake was
                        made when, in 1866 the Legislature gave to the citizens of Chambersburg
                        $500,000. This appropriation was made merely out of sympathy, and it was
                        predicted by Gen. White, we believe, who made a speech against it, if that
                        bill passed, it would be a precedent for other claims of a similar nature.</p>

                    <p>The Greensburg Herald thinks:</p>

                    <p>
                        If the Legislature is going in this way to establish
                            the rule to pay everybody in the State who were incommoded or injured by
                            the war, we may as well at once give up all hope of this generation, or
                            any succeeding one being able to fully pay off our State indebtedness.
                            We opine there are thousands of persons who never lived in either of the
                            counties above named, who, in the matter of losses and sufferings a
                            consequence of the war would most willingly have changed placed with
                            these well-to-do farmers, who propose to be reimbursed by the bill above
                            referred to. We suppose quite a number of thousands of widows and orphan
                            children, whose husbands, and fathers were shot down by Rebels, and they
                            consequently left without protection and support, who might come in and
                            ask, with still greater force, that the Legislature make them donation
                            for losses sustained by the war. The loss of fences, or barns, and
                            crops, by generally well-to-do farmers, don't weight a feather when
                            compared to the loss of a husband and father to a family without,
                            perhaps, any thing else in the world on which to lean for
                        support.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Altoona Sun calls it a big feast for the
                        buzzards, and says:</p>

                    <p>
                        One of the fattest jobs ever before the legislature of
                            Pennsylvania is the bill just presented in the House to reimburse the
                            owners of the property destroyed in the rebel raid of 1863. These claims
                            have been before each of the last four or five sessions, and a
                            commission was appointed to ascertain and report the amount of claims.
                            The claimants reside in the counties of Adams, Franklin, Fulton,
                            Bedford, Cumberland and York, and the aggregate claim, as allowed by the
                            commission, was but little less than two millions of dollars. Since then
                            these claims have been bought up for a mere song by speculators, as none
                            others had any idea they would ever be paid. Should their claims be
                            allowed it will not be difficult for the shrewd speculators to double
                            their claims, and instead of the taxpayers getting off with about two
                            millions they will be lucky if they escape with five millions.
                    </p>

                    <p>And the fun of it is, it is expected to pass. What a glorious feast for the
                        buzzard is here promised. Only think of it! Five millions of dollars! - over
                        thirty thousand dollars for each Senator and Representative, with a fair
                        margin for the lobby. But as the great majority of the peoples'
                        representatives are honest men, and would scorn to touch such ill gotten
                        gains, and as the number of venal members does not perhaps exceed a dozen
                        all told, what a splendid harvest is in prospect for them! All former fat
                        jobs sink into insignificance compared to this.</p>

                    <p>The Erie Gazette had potent objections. If the
                        hog did not stray, if the cow were not lean, or the rooster a crowing one,
                        perhaps the claim would be more just:</p>

                    <p>Soon after the close of the war the Legislature appropriated $500,000 for the
                        relief of the people in and about Chambersburg. This was regarded as a
                        questionable measure, and was voted for without much opposition. But now,
                        four years later, a bold proposition comes up to make a donation of six
                        times that amount mainly for the benefit of farmers who lost perhaps a stray
                        hog, or lean cow, or crowing rooster, or a few fence rails. If our
                        Legislators do their duty, they will vote down the scheme without discussion
                        or ceremony.</p>

                    <p>It should be noticed that the places from which these papers come were
                        eminently safe during the war.</p>

<b>The Commercial on the Border Claims</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

                    Pittsburgh Commercial of opposing border claims because of his own vested

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Pittsburg
                        Commercial still finds itself vexed on the
                        subject of the border damages, and at least two leading editorials have
                        appeared in its columns since our last issue. But the suggestions we then
                        made and the questions we raised it scrupulously avoids touching upon, but
                        so far as it can hope to bring reproach upon the border damage bill, by
                        covert insinuations and false statements, both as insinuations and false
                        statements, both as to the people of the border counties themselves, and the
                        genuineness of their claims, it does not cease to employ them both. Though
                        we complain of the spirit which inspires these articles, as lacking candor,
                        honor and honesty, we are by no means prepared to say that the articles do
                        not do far more to strengthen the border damage bill in the Legislature than
                        would the Commercial's advocacy of it.</p>

                    <p>Much that this journal has said on the subject carries its contradiction on
                        its face. This of course can damage no one but the author, for it renders
                        uncertain any other statements he may make which the general reader has not
                        the means at hand either to disprove or verify. Further than this there are
                        reasons why the editor of the Commercial should
                        take the stand he does. He is notoriously in the new Treasury "ring." He and
                        the ring have just won in a bitter contest for the control of the Treasury,
                        and they mean to have the spoils. Hence the treasury ring, and its champion,
                        the editor of the Commercial, oppose the border
                        damage bill. If it should pass "in its present shape," as he wisely says,
                        where would be the surplus funds for the ring to manipulate? Why the fight
                        for the Treasury would have been made in vain. They would hold the shell but
                        the meat would all be gone. Is this opposition hard to understand? But the
                            Commercial has another pet project which
                        this border damage bill would, if successful, spoil. It, and other Pittsburg papers, have been secured - we all
                        know what that means - to urge on the Legislature the Erie canal project,
                        the most corrupt job that has been brought to Harrisburg for years. It
                        proposes to appropriate several millions of the bonds held by the sinking
                        fund of the State to the enlargement of the canal.</p>

                    <p>The whole concern is now in the hands of a few capitalists, who hold stock
                        representing several millions, but whose real value is not above a hundred
                        thousand dollars or so. If the Legislature could be brought to swindle the
                        sinking fund in this way this worthless stock would come up to its
                        representative value, but the State would be a loser by as much as it put
                        into it. The Commercial is the chief advocate of
                        this swindle? But if the border damage bill became a law there would be
                        scarcely a ghost of a chance for its success, and the Commercial would lose a fat thing. After all it is not very
                        surprising that it should not approve the border damage bill.</p>

                    <p>Now let us see briefly what it has to say. First of all is the general charge
                        of bribery to put through the bill, for which "advices from Harrisburg" are
                        made responsible. The same allegation is made by the Commercial about every measure which it finds profitable to
                        oppose. That it is fighting the bill is perhaps stronger evidence against
                        the charge of bribery, than anything else which could be offered. If corrupt
                        means had been employed to pass the bill it is fair to say that the Commercial would either be quiet or be favoring
                        it. Its delay of several weeks in attacking it, and then its premonitory
                        growl are among the doubtful circumstances to say the least.</p>

                    <p>The next objection is made to the bill in these words. "The bill is so drawn
                        as to make certain the most enormous frauds. It invites the commission of
                        all sorts of rascality. No safeguards to protect the taxpayers and the
                        Treasury of the Commonwealth. The doors are flung wide open, and whoever can
                        muster the ingenuity to concoct a bogus claim, and the unscrupulousness to
                        back it with a lying affidavit is invited to help himself." This statement
                        is perhaps also one of the "advices from Harrisburg," but that is no excuse
                        for publishing barefaced lies when the bill itself has been before the
                        public for two weeks. If the editor has read it he cannot fail to know that
                        his statement is false. If he has not he is not prepared to make any
                        comments on it, much less those which he has made. Instead of there being no
                        safeguards to protect taxpayers and the Treasury, and inviting to frauds and
                        rascality, and flinging the doors open to bogus claims and lying affidavits,
                        provision is made to guard fully against all of them. No claims can be paid
                        except those which have been adjudicated and filed in Harrisburg by
                        commissions appointed by former Legislatures, and consisting of persons, not
                        residents of the border counties, not in any manner interested in the
                        claims. And these must again be supervised by commissioners who have
                        authority to reduce them but not to enlarge them, and to reject them
                        altogether if any are found to be unjust. But no claims which were not
                        adjudicated and allowed as long ago as the commission of the summer of 1868
                        can be admitted. An examination of the bill cannot fail to satisfy anyone of
                        these facts. Then why were these false statements made when the writer knew
                        them to be false? The story of speculators having bought up the claims is
                        again reiterated. We have already challenged the Commercial to produce the fact of one purchased claim, and
                        promised to oppose the bill if he did. If they are in the hands of
                        speculators, that would not be hard to do. Instead of that it repeats the
                        falsehood. "It further appears," says this reliable journal, "that the whole
                        amount claimed by the county committees heretofore appointed to appraise
                        damages, does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars, yet the "raiders"
                        assume the damages to amount to something between two and five millions of
                        dollars,' &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>Please notice the authority for this statement. "It further appears." If it
                        be a fact why not say so? or if it appears, why not
                        tell where and how? So far from the truth is this that it does not possess
                        even the appearance which the writer claims. There never were any county
                        committees. The appraisements were made by committees appointed by the
                        Executive by authority from the Legislature, and their aggregate amount
                        could have been ascertained at Harrisburg by any one who sought to know for
                        the last year and half. In the statement published a few weeks ago,
                        embracing the then several appraisements, the gross amount is a little over
                        two millions nine hundred thousand dollars. Doubtless, then, this statement
                        of the Commercial must also have been known to be false. Another objection
                        is raised against these claims. Before they are paid, says the Commercial,
                        the citizens of Western Pennsylvania should be paid for their losses in
                        business during the war, &amp;c. This the State could well afford to do
                        if in turn the western part of the State would agree to pay into the
                        Treasury the enormous wealth which mowed into it our of the war. Pittsburg was fatted with wealth by the war.
                        Every avenue of trade and manufacture was made to prosper by it, and
                        millions were added to her material wealth. But if it were true that she
                        suffered losses instead of receiving immense gains, the border counties can
                        say "I more." The destruction of their property has been by no means their
                        greatest loss, nor if this were restore to them would they receive more than
                        a moiety of their losses. The loss is business since the burning of
                        Chambersburg in 1864 cannot be estimated, nor will it cease to be felt for
                        years to come. Let the Legislature agree to pay our extraordinary losses of
                        property, and then the people of Pittsburg
                        will be in a condition to talk to us about their losses in trade by the war.</p>

                        fire in 1844. That the policies of insurance were not invalidated by the
                        fire. That the Legislature of 1845 appropriated $50,000 to the sufferers,
                        and remitted all taxes for three years from those whose property had been
                        destroyed. That when the news of the conflagration reached Chambersburg, a
                        meeting was promptly called, and $500 were raised and sent to the aid of
                        those who had lost their property.</p>

                    <p>THINGS WHICH SHOULD BE KNOWN.</p>

                    <p>That Chambersburg was almost entirely destroyed by rebels in 1864, the actual
                        loss being fully two millions of dollars. That the loss on the real estate
                        alone was about eight hundred thousand dollars. That the entire amount of
                        insurance on said property, both real and personal, was invalidated because
                        the loss was occasioned by a public enemy. That the high prices of labor and
                        materials created by the war caused an outlay of twice as much as the real
                        estate was appraised at to replace it; for example, a house that had been
                        replaced at three thousand dollars cost six thousand to replace it. That the
                        citizens of Pittsburg contributed $31 to the
                        Chambersburg sufferers. That this magnanimous gift was contributed in this
                        way. A clergyman of the U. P. church happened here a few days after the
                        fire, and seeing the desolate town and the suffering people his heart was
                        sorely troubled, and on his return to Pittsburg he called his congregation together for the purpose of
                        raising something for the members of the U. P. church at this place. The
                        meeting responded liberally to his request, but chiefly in abuse and
                        vilification of the citizens of Chambersburg. However $31 were raised and
                        forwarded, $30, it is said, by the clergyman, and $1 by the congregation.
                        There is some doubt, however, as to the proportion. Some of the recipients
                        of this magnificent charity persist in it that the preacher contributed
                        everything but the scoldings. How it is we don't know. We thought it would
                        be well, however, to give the history of it at this time, just to show that
                        the Pittsburg papers are not alone in their
                        hostility to Chambersburg.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>George Miller better known to this community as "Kitty" Miller, died, a few
                        days ago, at the Almshouse, after a lingering illness. He had long been one
                        of the "characters about town," and will be remembered after many more
                        prominent citizens are forgotten. George was a veteran of two wars, having
                        served in the little affair with Mexico and in the rebellion. In the latter,
                        he was a member of Col. Maulsby's Maryland Home Brigade, and saw some active
                        service at Front Royal and Gettysburg. We cannot say that he distinguished
                        himself as a military man.</p>

                    <p>Poor "Kitty" belonged to that class which takes no thought of the morrow, and
                        illustrates the assertion that "man wants but little here below." His loud
                        laugh, (which would fill a square with its volume and make the vault of a
                        circus canvas swell with its concussions) and his oddities of speech and
                        gesture, made him a favorite of the boys of several generations. But we will
                        not</p>

                    <p>"Further seek his merits to disclose.<br> Nor drag his frailties from their
                        dead abode."</p>

                    <p>It gives us pleasure to know that he was ministered to in his last moments by
                        Father Fields, and we have the right to hope that after a long, weary,
                        wandering, friendless, and misguided life, he sleeps in peace.</p>
