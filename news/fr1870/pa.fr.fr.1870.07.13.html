<b>The Income Tax Again</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that a modified version of the income tax has passed the
                    Senate. Even though it affects only the very wealthy, the editors marvel at the
                    widespread public opposition to the tax, and speculate on the reasons for it.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We stated a short time ago that the Senate had struck the Income tax section
                        of the Tax Bill now before Congress, and every person believed that it would
                        stay struck out. Last week, however, the vote striking it out was
                        reconsidered, and the result was to reinstate the tax in modified form. It
                        now goes back to the House with the chances in favor of its being concurred
                        in there. This will establish a tax, of two and a half per cent on incomes
                        over $2000, until the end of the year 1872. Hitherto there was a tax of five
                        per cent on incomes over $1000. After the last change made by the Senate an
                        attempt was made to defeat it by a resolution to prevent its collection
                        until ordered by Congress. This was defeated by a tie vote, Senator Cameron
                        failing to vote.</p>
                    <p>So far as this Congressional district is concerned the modification made by
                        the Senate is a practical abolition of the tax. A very limited number of
                        persons will be liable to a tax laid on the excess of two thousand dollars
                        on incomes, and the same thing is true everywhere, except in the principal
                        cities. In its present shape the tax is not burdensome or onerous. Only such
                        as are prosperous and wealthy will be liable, and yet it is the most odious
                        tax imposed by Congress. All classes of people condemn it, even those who
                        never have and never will pay it. A member of Congress, to satisfy his
                        constituency, must oppose the tax, though only an insignificant portion of
                        them are liable. What is the cause of this sentiment? People say because it
                        offends by invading our private and personal affairs, and by encouraging
                        perjury. We doubt whether that is the real or the whole reason. It is a tax
                        upon the rich and influential. It discriminates against them, and their
                        wealth and position enable them to educate public opinion in their cause. By
                        retaining the Income tax, other taxes which oppress the laboring classes may
                        be removed at once; by striking it off they are sure to be retained. Which
                        ought to be done? Yet the people say the Income tax must cease, and Congress
                        ought to hearken to the will of the people.</p>
