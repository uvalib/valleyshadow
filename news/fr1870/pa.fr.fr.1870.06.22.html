<b>Sales of the Wilson College Property Last Week</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This report notes the success of recent land sales and encourages people to
                    support Wilson College.<br>(Names in announcement: Dr.  Senseny, Rev.  Roth,  F. Henninger,  Jacob Zook,  John Weaver)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The property remaining unsold at the close of the sale of the previous week
                        was mainly disposed of during last week at private sale, so that when
                        Friday, the day fixed for the adjourned sale, arrived there were only a few
                        lots left unsold. Among the purchasers at private sale are Dr. Senseny who
                        bought Numbers 11 and 12 along the turnpike for $900. Rev. Roth, lot No. 46
                        about an acre and a half, at $200 per acre. The two tracks along the
                        turnpike, about 15 acres, including the Grapery and other improvements were
                        purchased by Jacob Zook for $4500. Lots No. 13 and 14 on the turnpike and
                        running back to the C. V. R. R., containing between 19 and 20 acres, were
                        sold to John Weaver for $4500.</p>

                    <p>There still remain two lots in front and one in the rear unsold, but offers
                        have been made for them which will very likely be taken. this is in all
                        respects a very satisfactory sale of ground, and its success is greatly
                        owing to the skill and judgment of those who had it in charge. About 67
                        acres were disposed of, realizing in the aggregate $18,000. The three lots
                        still to sell will bring it above $19,000. This transaction solves the
                        question of the Wilson College. The trustees intend to begin the erection of
                        an additional building for the use of pupils at once, and propose to open
                        the college for pupils the 1st of October next. This is a matter of great
                        importance to Chambersburg, and her citizens should give all the
                        encouragement and assistance in their power. This section of the State needs
                        a first class college for young ladies, our citizens need it for their
                        children, and the town needs it for its own prosperity and for the
                        improvement it will bring in general intelligence and morals. Let us all
                        strive to make it a success.</p>
