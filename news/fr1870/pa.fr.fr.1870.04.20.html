<b>Still Another Lie</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor acknowledges the Republican Party's failure to provide border
                    counties with compensation but denies the Pittsburgh Commercial's accusation that the passage of the Border Raid Bill
                    would financially benefit party leaders.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Pittsburg
                        Commercial, of the 16th inst., contains the
                        following paragraph:</p>

                    <p>The most corrupt and shameless bill before the Legislature was the Border
                        Raid Bill. The paternity of the measure should be known. It was concocted
                        and owned by the Mackey leaders, who, if the bill went through, were to
                        receive great benefits. This is perfectly well known. With them it was the
                        bill of the session. On its success they relied to mend their fortunes,
                        which had become seriously impaired in the Treasurer contest. It would not
                        be difficult to give such details of the plans which failed as would silence
                        all doubt and place these gentlemen in a light before the public anything
                        but enviable.</p>

                    <p>The people of the border counties cannot permit the responsibility of the
                        Border Damage Bill, whether the same be odious or popular, to be shifted
                        from themselves on to the shoulders of either real or fictitious characters.
                        They have resolved upon compensation for their losses, and they mean to get
                        it from the State. They possess the power to enforce the law makers of the State to do this, and they mean
                        to use it relentlessly. The aspirants in the Republican party for the
                        gubernatorial and other State offices, and they are not few in number, will
                        do well to mark the feeling which pervades the border counties before they
                        stake their political future upon a contest so uncertain as Pennsylvania
                        elections, and be sure that the influence of the three hundred thousand
                        people who occupy them are not against them. We warn any coxcomb who may
                        have fancied that he was doing an immensely popular thing by opposing this
                        measure before the Legislature, and who with his flippant tongue insulted
                        the suffering people of the border, that by so doing he was industriously
                        digging his own political grave. This, let it be understood, is the settled
                        determination of the Republicans of the border, slowly but surely reached,
                        after five years of contemptuous and insulting neglect. It is not an
                        ebullition of passion to die in a day or a week; it is a conviction whose
                        strength can readily be ascertained whenever the Republican party again
                        undertakes to ignore it.</p>

                    <p>The people of the border counties are not easily moved or excited. Every year
                        since the war they have asked the Legislature to do them a simple act of
                        justice, and every year they have been turned coldly away from the doors of
                        the capital. During this time the entire administration of the State has
                        been in the hands of the Republican party, and whether we will it or not the
                        Republican party is made responsible for this treatment. No matter whether
                        the Democratic party would have done as little for us as did the Republican,
                        they were not in power, and thus escape the odium. That they were not held
                        responsible, and that the Republicans were, is demonstrated by the results
                        of the elections in these counties for the last four years. Hereafter no man
                        can be elected to a political office in the State unless he pledges himself
                        to the payment of the border damages, be he Republican or Democrat.</p>

                    <p>As to what the Commercial fabricates. We do not
                        profess to know who the "Mackey leaders" are, or what such an expression
                        means. But we do know that the Border Bill was got up by the border people
                        for the border people, and that every statement made by the Commercial is false, as almost every statement it
                        made concerning the Border Bill and the people of the border during the
                        session of the Legislature was false. The editor of the Commercial, as every one knows, has no love for Mr. Mackay nor
                        any of his friends, and never hesitates to publish anything which he thinks
                        will damage them. If he were able then to make anything but b ld
                        assertions in this matter, if he could pin the Border Bill on Mackey and his
                        friends, and particularly if he could show that there was something rotten
                        in it, or, as he says, "that the success of the bill was to mend their
                        fortunes," he would not be long in giving the "details." We call for the
                        "details."</p>

<b>Relief for the Widow of Ex-President Lincoln</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article supports providing public financial help to Mary Todd Lincoln
                    and chastizes Congress for moving slowly on the issue. "There has been strange,
                    it seems to us, almost unpardonable indifference exercised by Congress in the
                    matter of the relief of the widow of the martyr Lincoln, and the treatment she
                    has received is a reproach to the whole American people."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When a rival newspaper admits that the Democratic party cannot gain black
                    votes, the Repository's editor agrees, stating that
                    any Democratic move to court black voter support would ultimately fail because
                    of that party's past association with slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Harrisburg Patriot gives up the colored vote
                        to the Republicans, declaring that "if Democratic principles cannot gain
                        them, electioneering among them will not succeed." The conclusion is true,
                        and at the same time much higher praise of the good sense and discrimination
                        of the negro than Democratic journals are apt to bestow. It is an admission
                        that the blacks are shrewd enough to know that the Democratic principles are
                        the principles of their old masters and cannot be made to look other than
                        repulsive and odious. To electioneer among them to support such principles
                        would be worse than folly.</p>

                    <p>We must differ from the Patriot, however, as to
                        what the Democracy mean to try to do with the colored vote. Their present
                        attitude toward the blacks is so full of danger to themselves, and they have
                        so much confidence in their power to beguile, that before the next election
                        they are bound to try their seductive arts on their colored brethren. We are
                        anxious to see them try it on the race that they enslaved, and whose slavery
                        they sought to perpetuate at the sacrifice of the Union.</p>
