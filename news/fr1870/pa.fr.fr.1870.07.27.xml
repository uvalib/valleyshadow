                    <p>We take great pleasure in announcing to the Democrats of the 16th
                        Congressional District, that Wm. M'Lellan, Esq., will be the next Democratic
                        candidate for Congress, and we congratulate them upon having determined to
                            <orig reg="choose">chose</orig> such a very excellent gentleman. There
                        is nothing which degrades a political campaign so much in the estimation of
                        Republicans as to have their candidates to office opposed by persons who do
                        not represent any but the worst class of the Democracy. In Mr. M'Lellan the
                        Republican candidate, Hon. John Cessna, will have a courteous, high toned,
                        dignified gentleman for an opponent, and so far as he is concerned we may
                        expect to see the campaign conducted with dignity and fairness. We think
                        that Mr. M'Lellan's nomination will be a thorough guarantee of this.</p>

                    <p>That he will be nominated we can have no manner of doubt since "Observer's"
                        second communication, in the <emph rend="italics">Valley Spirit</emph> of
                        last week. "Observer" with remarkable consistency and penetration, some time
                        ago advocated the nomination of Mr. McLellan as the person to defeat Mr.
                        Cessna, because the latter was a renegade. We frankly admit the force of the
                        reason. Last week he proved the wisdom of his first judgment by telling us
                        that when he read the announcement of Mr. McLellan's name as a candidate to
                        a group of five Republicans they all immediately declared that they would
                        vote for him, and he adds that he was once a Republican himself, and that he
                        would vote for him.</p>

                    <p>He might perhaps fool some persons with the story, but scarcely Mr. M'Lellan
                        himself, who tried being a Democratic candidate, and relying on the chances
                        of Republican votes for his election, and his success was not encouraging.
                        We might set our evidence against that of "Observer's," in the matter of
                        Republican votes. We also read the announcement, recommending Mr. M'Lellan
                        for Congress, to several groups of Democrats, but we couldn't get them to
                        say that they would support him. They seemed to fear that there was a trick
                        somewhere, and now, that Republicans are volunteering to support him they
                        are doubtless confirmed in their fears. M'Lellan was a renegade you know,
                        and renegades cannot be trusted.</p>

                    <p>An important railroad contract was concluded at the Girard House, in this
                        city, yesterday, by A. K. M'Clure, counsel for the Central Improvement
                        Company, with the Shenandoah Valley railroad company. The Improvement
                        Company have contracted to construct the Shenandoah Valley railroad,
                        including superstructure, stations, and everything ready for the equipment
                        from the Potomac river, at or near Shepardstown, by way of Charlestown,
                        Front Royal, Luray, Fishersville, Lexington and Buchanan, to the Virginia
                        and Tennessee Railroad, near Salem, a distance of 233 miles, and to complete
                        the same within two years.</p>

                    <p>The contracting party is made up of strong railroad men, and they will be
                        able to prosecute this important enterprise with the utmost vigor. The
                        Cumberland Valley railroad will be promptly extended from Hagerstown to
                        Shepardstown, a distance of but thirteen miles, and thus connect the
                        Shenandoah Valley road with the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania Central.
                        It is the purpose of the managers of the Shenandoah Valley to extend their
                        road as speedily as possible through the Clinch and Halston Valleys, through
                        a country of boundless mineral resources, to Knoxville, and connect with the
                        network of railroads radiating from that point, and also extending their
                        line from the Clinch Valley, through Pond Gap, to connect with the Kentucky
                        system of railroads, thereby making almost an air-line from Memphis to
                        Philadelphia and New York. - <emph rend="italics">Philada. Inquirer, July

                <transcript>

                    <p>Andrew S. Monn, Esq, of Quincy township, last week left at our office several
                        very fine specimens of iron ore taken from the surface of the ground on his
                        land, about three quarters of a mile East of the thriving village of Quincy.
                        Though surface ore, it is of a good quality, one of the pieces being very
                        pure and rich. He informed us that the ore lies upon farming land, a mile or
                        nearly so this side of the mountain, that a space of twenty acres or more is
                        covered with it, and that a well defined ledge of the ore passes through it.</p>

                    <p>The mere fact that Mr. Monn has valuable veins of iron ore upon his land is
                        perhaps scarcely worthy of note, as there is hardly a farmer along the base
                        of the South mountain from Fayetteville to Quincy and even beyond Quincy, a
                        distance of eight or ten miles, who cannot say the same thing. And the same
                        thing may as truly be said for as many miles along the base of the mountain
                        bordering the Western side of the county. But the presence of these
                        specimens before us suggests the enormous mineral wealth lying dormant in
                        the county, and the superior advantages the great fertility of our lands
                        offer for its successful development, and for building up manufacturing and
                        productive industry, in our midst. We doubt not that the time will come when
                        Franklin county will be among the wealthiest in the State, and will contain
                        and support a population devoted to productive industry such as the most
                        sanguine does not dream of now. Though the past history of our county is not
                        such as to warrant the prediction of rapid development in the future, there
                        are circumstances now working which have not existed heretofore and which
                        cannot fail to operate favorably upon the development of our mineral and
                        material wealth. The high position taken by Franklin county in agriculture
                        gave the impression that she could excel only in agriculture. She has always
                        been among the first in the State for wheat, and naturally her people were
                        devoted to farming. They did not lack enterprise but they were satisfied
                        with the prosperity which their fertile fields brought them, though by no
                        means ignorant of the wealth which lay beneath. But these good old jogtrot
                        days cannot last much longer. The work of the farmer must be subordinated to
                        greater enterprises, though by so doing it will be made more important and
                        more profitable than before. Our farmers will not always ship away their
                        products to feed the workers in other branches of industry when the workers
                        and industry can be placed side by side with themselves. The unusual
                        advantages of Franklin county for furnaces and factories cannot much longer
                        be overlooked. We have water power all over the county running waste which
                        must turn busy wheels. We have a soil of unexampled fertility which can
                        sustain a population of half a million. We have exhaustless beds of iron ore
                        which have been waiting for ages upon us, and have been passed over for
                        places less advantageous. We have railroads now in progress which will
                        connect our county with cheap coal and lumber, and thus place us ahead of
                        all other places in the State in manufacturing advantages. The extension of
                        the Cumberland Valley railroad to the Potomac river gives us access to the
                        Cumberland bituminous coal fields, and the Southern Pennsylvania railroad in
                        progress from the Cumberland Valley, at Marion, to Mercersburg and Loudon,
                        will before long be extended through Fulton county until it reaches the
                        Broadtop coal fields, and thus our county will have opportunities for cheap
                        coal unsurpassed by any. At the same time the Mount Alto Iron company are
                        building a road from their works, in Quincy township, to the Cumberland
                        Valley road about three miles East of Chambersburg, which will open one of
                        the best iron regions in the county, and will reach within three miles of
                        the ore veins mentioned at the beginning of the article.</p>

                    <p>We predict that famous as Franklin county has been for her fertility and
                        agricultural wealth, it will be as nothing in comparison with the importance
                        of her manufacturing and productive industry in the not distant future, and
                        we can assure our farmers, so contested with their lot, that when that day
                        comes it will more than double the value of their farms, and will bring them
                        better prices for all their commodities than ever before.</p>

                <summary>A large crowd gathered in Chambersburg to witness the latest balloon
                    ascension from the Diamond. Franklin's "intrepid little aeronaut" stayed aloft
                    for fifteen or twenty minutes before landing safely six miles from town. "We
                    regret to say that the order in Chambersburg, during the day, was not as good as
                    it should have been. There was a great deal of drunkenness, some quarrels and
                    fights, and some arrests. Such exhibitions, while they are entertaining, are
                    productive of no permanent good, and the motive for getting them up can hardly
                    be commended. Merchants, hotel and saloon keepers, it is true, drive a brisk
                    trade on such days, and they chiefly raise the funds needed to get up such
                    exhibitions."</summary>

                <summary>The paper pleads for the town of Chambersburg to purchase a good fire
                    engine. The census marshals estimate that the population of the town has grown
                    to 7,500 persons, and the downtown contains "many splendid buildings." A fire
                    would devestate the area. The editors point out that many smaller towns in the
                    vicinity have invested in the proper fire-fighting equipment.</summary>

                <summary>The town council served notice to the residents of North Front Street that
                    they must construct pavements on their street. If they do not, the town will do
                    it and tax the residents of the street to pay the costs. The paper stresses the
                    importance of complying, since the busy street will get even more traffic when
                    Wilson College opens. To make matters worse, the proposed pavements have been
                    graded and filled with clay that would turn into a muddy disaster in the event
                    of rain.</summary>

                <summary>Samuel Stokes was arrested and brought before Justice Hyssong on charges
                    brought by Mr. Smith. Stokes is accused of forging a $50 note upon the late John
                    Smith, Sr., the complainants father. He also allegedly received change from
                    Daniel Hawbecker for a forged $20 note. Justice Hyssong set bail at $1000.</summary>

                    Bonds of the Sunbury and Lewistown railroad company. The paper endorses it as a
                    safe investment, especially when government-bond interest rates are falling. The
                    editors assert that the road runs through a prosperous region, carries large
                    amounts of coal, and will be operated by the reliable managers of the
                    Pennsylvania Railroad company.</summary>

                    his death is thought to be caused by a combination of alchohol use and the
                    intense heat of the day. Meredith was a war veteran who had belonged to Capt.
