                    <p>The Tennessee constitutional convention, which has been at work constructing
                        a constitution for several weeks, is at variance on the question of negro
                        suffrage. Some <orig reg="antedeluvians">antideluvians</orig> have drifted
                        into the convention, and, apparently ignorant of what has been done during
                        the last ten years, bitterly resist colored suffrage. The reasons which they
                        offer for their opposition are note worthy, as being the same which
                        exercised the southern, and we may add Democratic, heart before the
                        rebellion. They complain that with the right of suffrage must come, as a
                        necessary consequence, the right to sit on juries, to hold office and the
                        right to intermarry. No one can doubt that these conclusions are eminently
                        logical, the only cause of wonder is, that, being admitted, the question
                        should excite opposition. Why should not negroes sit on juries, if they be
                        mentally and morally qualified? Why should they not hold office if elected
                        by the people? We may also ask why should they not intermarry with whites,
                        if there be any whites silly enough to wish to marry them, providing always
                        that the negroes themselves are willing to do so? This intermarrying notion
                        takes us back to the time when the slavery advocates and their friends
                        filled the land with the cry of miscegenation, which they said must surely
                        follow the abolition of slavery. The want of confidence in the moral
                        strength of the whites, and the irresistible fascinations of the negroes,
                        which this position of the slaveocracy admitted, were freely commented on
                        and ridiculed at the time, and were thought to have been pretty thoroughly
                        killed. But we see it revived in the minority report of the committee on the
                        suffrage question. And hence we infer that these members conveniently fell
                        asleep at the beginning of the rebellion, and have just awaked. Like Rip Van
                        Winkle, when he was aroused from his slumber of a quarter of a century, they
                        cannot yet appreciate that old things have passed away, and are unable to
                        adjust themselves to the new condition of things. They still doubt the
                        strength of the whites to resist the insidious charms of the negroes, and
                        fear, if universal suffrage become a fundamental law, that the two races
                        will at once intermarry. Their fellow members should hasten to inform them
                        that slavery has not existed now for a period of seven years, and that in
                        most of the southern states negro suffrage has been in practical operation
                        for half that period, without developing the disgusting condition of society
                        which they fear. Unless, by industrious coaching, they can be brought up to
                        the condition of the times they had better resign in place of others who
                        have had their eyes and ears open, and whose deliberations may be of some
                        use to the State.</p>

                    <p>After all, we fail to see that the question of limiting or enlarging the
                        right of suffrage can be of practical moment to the Tennessee constitutional
                        convention. In fact we cannot see that it is a question at all. There is but
                        one thing to do, a higher law will soon declare suffrage universal, and all
                        that all of the States can do is to adjust itself in harmony with the
                        Constitution as amended by Fifteenth Amendment. But one more State is needed
                        to perfect the Amendment, and there are three which will in a short time
                        ratify it. Those members of the convention who have slept so long had as
                        well take another nap.</p>

                <summary>The <emph rend="italics">Repository</emph> reports with disgust that
                    several people at the Tennessee constitutional convention continue to resist
                    "negro suffrage." Opponents fear that suffrage would make it possible for blacks
                    to serve on juries, become public officials, and marry whites. The <emph
                        rend="italics">Repository</emph> agrees that these could happen, including
                    marriage "if there be any whites silly enough to wish to marry them," but sees
                    them as moral necessities along with suffrage.</summary>
