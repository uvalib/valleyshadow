<b>General Amnesty</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository supports returning rights to the former
     rebels, arguing that "As long as some are under the political ban there are those among them
     who . . . would persist in uttering sentiments of bitterness and enmity towards the Union." The

     "Let amnesty be liberal," the article concludes.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

     <p>This has been the important topic of discussion in Congress since its last session began,
      and in the Senate last week it was made the occasion by the Missouri Senators for the
      discussion of the Gratz Brown and Carl Schurz bolt in the last election. The amnesty question,
      whose importance all must admit, should be thoroughly discussed in all its bearings, but ought
      not to be submerged for two whole days in the Senate in the personal fight of Senator Schurz
      and Senator Drake. Schurz was for some reason not satisfied with President Grant, and in the
      election joined with the Democrats of Missouri to elect a combination candidate, B. Gratz
      Brown, Governor. Having accomplished his work, he comes to the Senate to explain, and to
      insult the party which made him what he now is, a United States Senator from the State of
      Missouri. That he saw fit to do this hardly makes it worth while to consume so much valuable
      time belonging to public interests. But the amnesty bill is important. We doubt if in this
      last month of the year 1870 there is a single man of position or influence in the South who
      was a rebel during the war that would be willing to do anything to create anyther conflict in the country after all disabilities were removed. As long as some
      are under the political ban there are those among them who, rather than seem to beg to be
      restored, would persist in uttering sentiments of bitterness and enmity towards the Union. In
      spite of much prejudice and many drawbacks the South has made such marvelous progress in
      material development since the war that none but a confirmed bigot or a brainless ass would be
      willing to jeopard, this prosperity by arraying any of the
      Southern States against the General Government. The surest way to disarm the remaining few is
      to remove their disabilities. Until these States were restored to all their former relations
      to the Government, and until the rights of all parties in them were secured against violence,
      it was doubtless wise to discriminate against those who had always been and those who had not
      always been friends of the Government. But the work of reconstruction is done. None of the
      arguments then legitimate now. Beside this, much strength is lost to the friends of the
      Government by withholding from them their rights. Jeff. Davis was never so completely shorn of
      his power as when he was turned loose as a traitor neither to be feared or dreaded. From that
      day the man, his acts, words, and movements have scarcely excited a comment or a thought, and
      the experience in his case furnishes a key to solve the question of amnesty. Try the same rule
      with those who are still barred from participation in the affairs of the Government. Not many
      of them are likely to be called to high and responsible positions when to do so will afford no
      opportunity to know that they are still unrelenting rebels. This pointing the finger of the
       Governmens at them gives them a fictitious importance in their
      respective communities, and in that respect if in no other works harm. We do not believe that
      Zebulon B. Vance would have been chosen Senator from North Carolina if he had not been the
      vilest rebel of them all, and that the Republican State government was indiscreet enough to
      keep that fact uppermost.</p>

     <p>There is a great force also in the idea advanced by the Tribune
      a short time ago, that if the Republican party wishes to make the rebel element a source of
      strength to itself, the best thing to do is to allow some of the worst of them to hold seats
      in Congress. If they wish to give utterance to their treasonable sentiments let them do it
      Congress and it will do more to damage the Democracy and sustain the supremacy of the
      Republican party than a thousand years of persecution. Let amnesty be liberal.</p>

<b>Whose Property Shall be Restored?</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When a rival newspaper addresses the issue of loyal Southerners' property claims, the

     <p>While the Senate was being regaled with the suggestion of the Democratic leader of the
      South, Senator M'Creery, of Kentucky, to restore Arlington to the family of Robert E. Lee, and
      to dig up the bones of the Union dead, did the republican
      Senators think that was exactly the moment to consider the claims of loyal men of the South
      who were driven from house and home by rebel marauders, and who were despoiled even by the
      Union armies? These citizens have been begging for relief in vain at the doors of Congress for
      the last five years. - Press.</p>

     <p>JUST here we cannot abstain from allowing the Press to preach a
      short but forcible sermon, and we wish it understood that the Press and not we furnish the text, the discourse and the argument. We fully admit that
      the occasion of Senator McCreery's unpatriotic and insulting speech to the Senate to restore
      Arlington to the family of Robert E. Lee and to dig up the bones of the Union dead was just
      the moment to consider the claims of the loyal men of the South who were driven from house and
      home by rebel marauders, and were despoiled even by the Union armies, and who have been
      begging for the last five years in vain for relief at the doors of Congress. But we fail to
      see how Col. Forney can consistently make such a suggestion. We fail to perceive that "loyal
      men of the South" who lost house and home by rebel marauders and were despoiled by Union
      armies, are entitled to more consideration than loyal people of the North who suffered in like
      manner. Indeed if there be any distinction it should be made in favor of those who lived in
      the North and about whom locality can raise no suspicion. But our memory is not so short nor
      our feelings so dull as to have allowed us to forget how fiercely Col. Forney assailed the
      citizens of the border counties of his own State with all sorts of reproachful epithets when
      they asked redress for similar wrongs and injuries committed by both Rebel and Union troops,
      cases wherein whole communities were ravaged and quite a large town reduced to ashes. When
      they asked for only partial relief from these losses they were denounced by the Press as "thieves" and "robbers," "border raiders" who were raiding
      upon the State Treasury with "trumped up" claims for losses of "chickens rail fences,"
      &amp;c. In view of this experience, and the extract above quoted we cannot forgo the
      temptation to say to Col. Forney "Thou art the man," and to the public that it ill becomes him
      to preach cheap philanthropy to the Senate of the United States as to the sufferings of Union
      men South so long as he has proved himself to have no sympathy, and not even a temperate or
      truthful word to speak concerning the far greater wrongs and outrages committed upon the
      people of his own State.</p>

     <p>The world, however, is just about full of that sort of cheap stuff, and one need not go
      about with a lantern to find it. It may be though that we do the Press injustice, and that what it says of the necessity for doing justice to the
      suffering loyalists of the South is evidence that it desires to see the class of persons
      relieved. If so it cannot but urge that those who belong to its own State should be first
      heard and their wants first attended to.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

     <p>The first annual re-union of the surviving members of the 126th
      Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, was held in Chambersburg, on Tuesday, December 13th, 1870.
      Some two hundred officers and men of the regiment were present, besides invited guests from
      other regiments. The committee of a arrangements consisted of the following persons: T. M.
      Mahon, Chairman; Sergt. John A. Seiders, Lieut, G. F. Platt, Lieut. Josiah W. Fletcher, Lieut.
      George W. Welsh and Sergt. Harry Strickler. For its well arranged programme, and the able and successful manner in which all the proceedings were
      conducted, this committee deserves great credit.</p>

     <p>According to the programme, the regiment first assembled in the
      Court House, at 1 1/2 o'clock, P. M., where the address of welcome and annual oration were
      delivered. The meeting was called to order by T. M. Mahon, and the exercises opened with
      prayer by Rev. John Ault. He returned thanks to Him who had permitted the meeting of the day.
      Though many had been called to lay down their lives on the field of battle, or die a lingering
      death in the damp tent or loathsome hospital, a goodly number were spared to meet in peace
      when the fires of rebellion were quenched and the honor of the government sustained. He prayed
      for the President, the government, all public councils, that they
      might rule in the fear of God; for the nation in its sin, that repenting it might become an
      example of righteousness to all the world; that He would bless these returned soldiers in all
      their pursuits; when duty called they buckled on the sword of Liberty, might they now gird on
      that of the Spirit, and as they fought under the "banner of the stars" for the preservation of
      the Union, might they now also go forth and battle under the banner of Christ for the gaining
      of His kingdom.</p>

     <p>The following officers were then elected:</p>

     <p>President - Col. James G. Elder.</p>

     <p>Vice President - Capt. Wm. H. Davidson, Sergt. John A. Seiders.</p>

     <p>Secretary - Lieut. W. H. Mackey.</p>

     <p>Treasurer - Sergt. McClellan.</p>

     <p>Col. Elder on taking the chair said: Ladies and Gentlemen, It affords me great pleasure to
      meet you here to-day. Comrades of the 126th , I greet you, who have
      come to-day to this re-union. We meet to
      mourn for our comrades slain and rejoice with those living. I bid you all welcome.</p>

     <p>Col. Elder was followed by Lieut. Col. Rowe, in his address of welcome.</p>

     <p>In order that the members of the regiment and its many friends who were unable to be
      present, may have an opportunity to peruse the address of welcome, delivered by Col. Rowe, and
      the annual oration by Adjutant John Stewart, we propose to publish them in full next week, and
      therefore make no further mention of them here than to say that both were able and eloquent
      addresses and were listened to with marked pleasure by a very large and highly pleased
      audience.</p>

     <p>At the conclusion of the address, a recess of ten minutes was voted, for the purpose of
      affording the members an opportunity to welcome Gen. E. B. Tyler. They crowded around their
      old leader, who no doubt felt a welcome truer than words could express, in the hearty grasp of
      each soldier's hand.</p>

     <p>The recess over, the following business was transacted.</p>

     <p>The report of the committee on constitution, &amp;c., accepted, and the following
      constitution and by-laws adopted:</p>

     <p>CONSTITUTION</p>

     <p>The object of this organization is to promote and encourage among the survivors of the 126th
      Regiment P. V., the feelings of friendship and sympathy which grew up among its members during
      their service in the war of the Rebellion, and to perpetuate the memory of their deceased
      comrades and of the scenes and incidents which they saw and experienced.</p>

     <p>I. This organization shall consist of the officers and privates of the 126th Regiment who
      subscribe their names to the constitution, and pay the annual dues prescribed by the by laws.</p>

     <p>II. The officers shall consist of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Corresponding
      Secretary and Treasurer, to be elected by a vote of the members at the annual meeting.</p>

     <p>III. The regular annual meeting shall be held on the 13th day of December in each year, at a
      place to be designated at the regular meeting of the preceding year.</p>

     <p>BY LAWS</p>

     <p>I. Each member of the organization shall be required to pay into the treasury the sum of
      fifty cents annually.</p>

     <p>II. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to report at each annual meeting the financial
      condition of the organization.</p>

     <p>The report of the committee on officers for the ensuing year was accepted, viz:</p>

     <p>President - Major Robert S. Brownson.</p>

     <p>Vice President - Capt. John H. Walker.</p>

     <p>Secretary - Lieut. George W. Welsh.</p>

     <p>Treasurer - Sergt. Harry Strickler.</p>

     <p>The report of the committee on speakers accepted:</p>

     <p>Orator - William Kennedy.</p>

     <p>Address of Welcome - Thad. M. Mahon.</p>

     <p>Greencastle was determined upon as the place of next meeting, December 13th, 1871.</p>

     <p>Adjutant John Stewart then delivered the annual oration.</p>

     <p>The following resolutions were presented and adopted:</p>

     <p>Resolved, That we tender our thanks to the editors of the Valley Spirit, Franklin Repository, Public Opinion, Valley Echo, Village
       Record, Mercersburg Journal, Fulton Democrat, Valley Sentinel, Shippensburg News, Carlisle
       Volunteer, Carlisle Herald, State Journal, Patriot and Union, Juniata Democrat and Register
       and Juniata Republican, for their kindness in publishing the notices of our re-union, sent to them by the committee of arrangements.</p>

     <p>Resolved, That a copy of the above resolution be sent to the
      editors of said papers.</p>

     <p>Adjourned till 5 o'clock, P. M.</p>

     <p>BANQUET.</p>

     <p>At 5 1/2 o'clock, P.M., the regiment re-assembled in
      Repository Hall. Here the taste and good judgment of the committee of arrangements were well
      displayed in the beautiful manner in which the hall was decorated and in the convenience of
      all the arrangements. Three tables were spread with an abundant supply of those "good things"
      which delight the inner man, which had been prepared by Mr. E. S. Shank, the genial proprietor
      of the Montgomery House, who knows how, if any one does, to tempt the palate and spoil
      digestion. To prevent confusion, the middle table was reserved for the ladies and other
      invited guests. Whilst the "old boys" of the 126th, after Rev. John Ault had asked a blessing,
      "did good service on the flanks."</p>

     <p>After supper the guests were provided with seats, and the members of the regiment gathered
      around the middle table and pledged in cold water the following toasts, proposed by Col. Rowe:</p>

     <p>First - "The Union."</p>

     <p>Lieut. Jere. Cook responded briefly to the sentiment - "The Union" - by saying that so much
      has already been well spoken during the progress of the day's exercises that he felt they
      would thank him for being brief, and he was as willing to confer that favor as they were to
      receive it. He was the more willing to be brief because the toast announced presented an
      exhaustless subject. After a few pointed remarks as to the origin of the Union, and the
      central idea about which it was framed, the principle that all men were created equal, he
      stated that the antagonism which existed on that subject led to the rebellion. War was
      accepted by the Government to preserve the Union.</p>

     <p>"That," continued Mr. Cook, "is why it seems to me fit and proper that this sentiment should
      be entertained by us. But for the war we would not be assembled in the capacity we are; and as
      we fought in defence of the Union, at our first re-union to recall
      the memory of those terrible scenes of war and bloodshed now almost overgrown with the
      luxuriant growth of the fruits of peace, we naturally rejoice that the Union is safe.</p>

     <p>"It seems to me that this sentiment ought to convey something more to our minds than the
      idea of the integrity of the nation. It is true there are no states missing in the restored
      Union, but this is not all that is required to constitute a perfect Union. We all rejoice
      heartily that our armies were able to hold the rebellious states in the Union in spite of the
      madness of secession, but we rejoice far more at the unmistakable signs of returning reason to
      the people of those states, and the evidences of their growing love for the old flag and
      government. All these satisfy us that the end has justified the war. Let us recognize in this
      sentiment the facts, that our re-union has no sectional feeling in
      it, and no sentiment of hostility toward those who were arrayed in arms against the Union, but
      have returned to her in good faith and sincerity; that this is a Union of people of the United
      States, as well as the several States, that ours is a homogeneous government, that we are one
      people. Let us give special expression to the thought that whatever of rejoicing we feel and
      express here, some of it, at least, is due to the recognition of the fact that the Union which
      was preserved through war has brought unnumbered blessings to those who in their madness
      fought against it with arms in their hands, as well as to those who were triumphant in the
      war, and that the blessed fruits of peace are to-day acknowledged and
      prized by them as they are by us.</p>

     <p>Second - "The patriotic women of America."</p>

     <p>Responded to by Wm. Kennedy. You do well to propose a toast to women, for in our own idea of
      this world's happiness, woman and toast are inseparably connected. I appreciate the feelings
      of gratitude which prompted the committee to make this toast an essential part of this programme. For without women I would like to know where any of us would
      be to-night, and more, there is not one of us would have a button
      on his shirt "Woman," said the great Toodles, in a Herculean effort to vent the feelings that
      swelled in his bosom, "woman, lovely woman, you're a trump." With women on our side we win the
      battle of life. Some one has said, "woman is like ivy, the greater the ruin the closer she
      clings," and he was a sour old bachelor who perverted it into the "closer she clings the
      greater the ruin." Woman, it is the necessity of our being; the great Creator saw it was not
      good for man to be alone, so He gave him woman to increase his joys and double his expenses.
      But we are to talk of the patriotic women of America. They, like the Spartan mother, never
      nursed a coward. She told her son, when she sent him forth to do battle. "Come back with your
      shield or on it," but how much higher, nobler, is her character who gave her son and left the
      issue with the God of battles. It is my duty on this occasion to speak of those women who
      through the weary night hours watched by the bedside of the suffering, binding up wounds,
      administering the cooling draught, whispering words of comfort, closing the eyes in death and
      bearing the last message to loved ones at home. If it be true that dropping a single tear is
      greater than shedding rivers of gore, then we must yield the palm to woman. My comrades, it
      does require some courage to stand in battle, but you will agree that not upon man, but woman,
      the sorrow must fall.</p>

     <p>Third - "To our dead comrades."</p>

     <p>Drank in silence.</p>

     <p>Fourth- "The army."</p>

     <p>Response by Gen. E. B. Tyler. In responding to the sentiment which has just been announced,
      I feel as if it would have been better if you had selected some one who belonged to the
      regiment, rather than me to respond, and the more so since it is not my forte to make speeches
      - in other words, I'm not a "speechist." Looking back, we find that the first organization of
      armies was among the Egyptians. Several thousand men were arranged in what they called the
      army. The army was divided into two divisions; the men were armed with pikes and swords -
      there were no cannon and muskets in those days. But this is history, and I'll leave it and
      come down to our army, which raised its hat to the "stars and stripes," the army which forms
      the nucleus around which the citizens of our government rally to protect it in time of danger.
      Its dead, its living heroes, we all know, and it would be fully for me to stand here and try
      to portray them. It is due to-night that I should repeat what I
      made a part of the official history of the war, that it is a pleasure for me to be surrounded
      by those men who performed their duty as soldiers honorably and well. What can I say more. It
      seems to me that that covers the ground. I will say that I always felt honored by this
      alacrity with which you performed my commands, and shall carry the feeling to my grave. It
      must, it should be gratifying to the pride of every one to know that their record is without
      spot. Theirs is the pride of sustaining that country, right or wrong - preferring that it
      should be right - but their country right or wrong. This is the fourth regimental re-union I have attended since the war, and none can be compared to
      this. There is nothing more gratifying to him who has been honored with the command of men,
      than to know his men think he has done his duty. The government gave me the power to command,
      but you did the work. God bless you.</p>

     <p>Fifth - "The citizen solder."</p>

     <p>Responded to the Lieut. Geo. W. Welsh. The tyrants of the Earth, in all ages, have sustained
      themselves upon their thrones by the power of standing armies, supported by resources wrung
      from the hands of their toiling subjects. By this means the ambitious and selfish have
      enslaved and perpetuated the slavery of millions. Wrest, for a day, from the hands of Emperor,
      King, Czar and Sultan the power of these hired soldiers, and the next dispatch which flashes
      beneath the Atlantic from the Old World will proclaim that in all Europe there exists not a
      throne, crown or sceptre. Remove from the soldiers which compose
      these armies all hope of gain and preferment, and they will disappear like mist before the
      rising sun. Stimulated only by promises of reward and promotion, without an impulse of
      patriotism, these mercenary wretches have become traitors to their the best interest of their
      fellow men, the tools by which despots rivet their shackles on the limbs of their victims.</p>

     <p>How different the character of the citizen soldier. Stimulated only by patriotism, and love
      of race, the citizen soldier ignoring all selfish interests has been the defence of 
      in ever age. Wherever the iron grasp of despotism has been broken, wherever
      the freedom of a people has been achieved, it has been done by the citizen soldier. Look at
      the history of your own government. It was the citizen soldier who achieved your liberties,
      the citizen soldier who has defended and sustained them. In every battle of the revolution
      from the opening fray at Lexington to the closing fight at Yorktown, it was the citizen
      soldier who met the drilled and disciplined hireling of the tyrant and at last vanquished and
      drove him from our shores. In our late war with England, veteran who had been drilled and
      disciplined under the eye of Wellington, soldiers who in Europe had been the victors of many a
      bloody field, were vanquished by the untrained citizen solder in
      almost every battle from Niagara to New Orleans. It was the citizen soldier who sustained our
      national honor in every battle in the war with Mexico and planted our flag on the walls of her
      capitol.</p>

     <p>And in the last great struggle for national life it was the citizen, untrained in way, who
      at the call of his country in the hour of her extreme peril, relinquished his peaceful
      avocation, and from work bench and plough and desk came to her defence and crushed the power
      of treason and rebellion.</p>

     <p>Despots may sustain their thrones by the power of a mercenary soldiery, but the liberties of
      a free people when threatened by tyrany are only to be sustained
      and defended by the patriotism of the people themselves.</p>

     <p>Sixth - "The comrades of other regiments."</p>

     <p>Response by Capt. G. W. Skinner. I certainly did not expect to be called upon to respond to
      this or any other toast. My eloquent friend, Mr. Kennedy, has broadly asserted here this
      evening that no American mother ever nursed a coward, but I am afraid I am about to disprove
      the truth of his assertion, by shirking the duty you, sir, have just imposed upon me. Besides,
      by your own intimation, the time for this part of the programme of
      the evening has passed. I must go so far, however, as to thank you, and the gallant boys of
      the 126th, in behalf of my comrades of other regiments, for your remembrance of us on this
      occasion. I feel that it is no uncommon honor you have done us - Fredericksburg and
      Chancellorsville toasting the other battle fields of the war.
      between all soldiers, Mr. Chairman, there exists a common bond of sympathy. It was well said
      by Col. Rowe, in his address of welcome to-day, that we are all in a
      manner brothers. Yes, brothers. Having been called forth to succor the same cause, having
      passed through the same routine of duties, and having shared the same kind of dangers, the tie
      that binds us is almost strong as that which draws to one another the hearts of those who in
      childhood's hour knelt at the same parental knee. Between my own regiment, which held a
      reunion here a few weeks ago, and the 126th, there exists a peculiar bond of sympathy. It
      might be said that the same section sent us forth, and in the ranks of the one were numbered
      many friends and relatives of those in the ranks of the other. We gave you our sympathy in the
      field, we felt proud of our bravery, and we unite to night, present
      and absent ones alike, in wishing you a good time generally. Again we thank you for your
      kindness.</p>

     <p>Seventh - "The Loyal People of the Border, who fought the enemy at the front, while their
      homes were ravaged by rebel invaders."</p>

     <p>Response by Lieut. James Pott.</p>

     <p>Lieut. Pott in his response took occasion to refer to the repeated invasions made by the
      rebel armies into the defenceless border counties, and the havoc made by them upon the
      property of loyal citizens, many of whom were at the front fighting the common enemy, and
      animadverted severely by forcibly upon the unwarranted assaults of the press of the State upon
      our citizens in their appeal to the Legislature for relief. We regret that the extreme length
      to which he extended his remarks compels us to forego the pleasure of publishing them in full,
      and it would be doing him manifest injustice to present an unsatisfactory abstract of them.</p>

     <p>The toasts, "The Keystone State," "The Flag," "The 126th Regiment P. V.," "Our Fulton County
      Comrades," "Our Juniata County Comrades," were taken together and responded by all the members
      of the regiment in three hearty cheers.</p>

     <p>Interesting letters and dispatches were received upon a number of members of the regiment,
      whose attendance great distance and other circumstances rendered impossible. Kindly greetings
      and remembrances, tender sympathies for the old associates and expressions of regret tha they could not be present came from the far off Pacific coast, from
      Nebraska, from New Orleans, from Baltimore and other points.</p>

     <p>The regiment now adjourned to the Court House to listen to the recitations and await part
      fourth of their programme.</p>

     <p>Mr. Samuel Palmer was introduced and recited the "Charge of the Light Brigade" in an
      excellent manner.</p>

     <p>As no one had been chosen to complete this part of the programme,
      by a unanimous vote Lieut. J. W. Fletcher was called upon to recite "Sheridan's Ride." The
      Lieutenant, after remarking that he stood on delicate ground in attempting to recite "this
      poet praised poem of an artist poet," delivered the production in a manner to excite the
      admiration and cheers of the audience.</p>

     <p>The Promenade Concert followed next, and as it was intended it should be, so it was, the
      crowning feature of the day. On re entering Repository Hall, we
      found the scene entirely changed. The tables were cleared away, the room was crowded with
      ladies and gentlemen promenading - ladies from abroad and the pretty girls of Chambersburg as
      well - with the Chambersburg Silver Cornet Band and Orchestra discoursing inspiring music, and
      the floor all ready for dancing. Is it surprising, good folks, that those inclined to trip the
      "light fantastic" could not resist the temptation to dance? And dance they did until the
      midnight hour had struck, and the shrieks of the locomotive whistle warned the delegations
      from abroad that it was time to leave.</p>

     <p>The citizens of Chambersburg will long remember the pleasure the happy re union of these brave defenders of the nation's honor, who fought at the front
      while their homes were ravaged by rebel invaders.</p>
