<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository publishes the welcome speech of
                    Lt. Col. D. W. Rowe. The colonel addressed the veterans of the 126th
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers at a recent reunion. Rowe praised the citizen soldier,
                    noting that this model of filling the ranks would prevent armies from being "the
                    play things of monarchs and the tools of ambition." War, after this, "will be
                    made only for the genuine interests of the citizens" because "the man who votes
                    will be the man to fight."<br>

                    <p>Delivered at the Re-union of the 126th Reg. P. V., Dec. 13, 1870,<br> BY
                        LIEUT. COL. D. W. ROWE</p>

                    <p>COMRADES: - The committee of arrangements appointed at a meeting of the
                        officers of the 126th Regiment, which convened at Trostle's Hotel, in this
                        borough on the 13th of May last, the anniversary of the battle of
                        Chancellorsville, to arrange for this reunion of the whole regiment, on the
                        anniversary of the battle of Fredericksburg, have done me the honor to
                        request that I would welcome you to the business and the festivities of this
                        occasion. I shall neither deny nor conceal that the duty is a pleasant one.
                        Nothing which concerns the regiment is indifferent to me. For its dead I
                        have unbounded sorrow, for its survivors a sentiment of fraternity and the
                        extended hand of cordial friendship. Its good name every one of us feels to
                        be in his own peculiar keeping. The memories of the old regiment are
                        cherished in our inmost hearts, and will expire only with our latest
                        breaths. To welcome you, my own comrades and friends, after an interval of
                        seven years, to a renewal of friendships, and an interchange of greetings,
                        under such happy auspices and auguries, is, believe me, for I use no hollow
                        professions, a duty that is remunerated in the performance, if only I shall
                        suitably impress you with the cordiality of our welcome.</p>

                    <p>In whose name shall I welcome you?</p>

                    <p>In that of the officers who pre-arranged this meeting, whose spokesman I am
                        more immediately. For one allowable source of pride there is to them, that
                        they commanded such men. Whatever their own deficiencies, and they were the
                        result for the most part of the unwarlike era which preceded the rebellion,
                        when for so many years the country basked in the sunshine of peace, and the
                        sword was, if not in very fact, at least almost literally, turned into plow
                        shares and spears into pruning books, one all sufficient compensation they
                        found in the dispositions of the men they commanded. For what mattered it to
                        have skilled and efficient commanders, when every man in the ranks was
                        intelligent enough to understand his duty and patriotic enough to do it? Had
                        it not been for this, the South would indeed have had a great advantage over
                        us. For their officers and leaders were for the most part and to some extent
                        accustomed to arms and to the command of men, and to the treatment of them
                        as inferiors and subordinates. But yours were like yourselves inured to the
                        pursuits of industry and accustomed to equality, and they were never able at
                        any time fully to play the superior, even on proper and indeed necessary
                        occasion. - You, by your character and conduct enabled them to command with
                        credit, and even in the end to be victorious, and so to reflect upon their
                        past career with pleasure and sometimes even with pride. Our officers, when
                        the piping times of peace had returned again, and war's stern alarums were changed to merry meetings, had nothing
                        so much at heart as to draw you together that you who did the work might
                        receive the reward, and that having suffered hardships in common, you might
                        in common and together rejoice in the fruition of your labors.</p>

                    <p>I do not hesitate to welcome you also in the name of the old regiment whose
                        baptism of fire at Fredericksburg this day recalls and commemorates. But is
                        not this the regiment which now re-unites? Not so my comrades. This body
                        which marches gaily out of Harrisburg, in August, 1862, which listened to
                        the thunders of second Bull Run and Antietam, and went up Marye's Heights at
                        Fredericksburg, and down into the dense woods at Chancellorsville, exists no
                        more. It is a recollection only - a thing that once was but is no more. An
                        ephemeral existence, that, as we now look back upon its career, lived but a
                        short summer's day and then passed from sight, leaving behind only such
                        memories as linger after the death of a beautiful child, all sadly pleasant
                        and cherished with pain. For the memory of the past is a sigh.</p>

                    <p>The old regiment, as it once existed in organized shape, strong in the united
                        strength of a thousand youthful hearts fired with patriotism, beautiful as
                        it stood forth clothed in all the panoply of war, around whose standard you
                        gathered, under whose banners you marched to champion the grandest cause
                        that ever men fought for by land or sea, or for which ever knightly lance
                        was laid in rest, or ever hero did a deed of derring-do - sleeps in the
                        graves of the departed and is nothing in the sphere of sublunary things.
                        This phantom which we call the 126th Regiment, if it seems to you to appear
                        again, to day, arises to your memories and
                        affections alone. Some of its elements and factors only are here. The words
                        of the mustering officer spoke it into existence, and at his command it
                        perished. And inasmuch as it lives to day only in
                        your fancies - and can never henceforth exist otherwise - I imagine the
                        shade of the old regiment is grateful for this day's reunion, its
                        revivification of the events of the years that are gone, when the regiment
                        made part of the grand army of the Republic and had "a local habitation and
                        a name" among mortal existences, and is delighted at the spectacle which
                        this hall now presents.</p>

                    <p>Above all, I welcome you here and to this reunion in the name of the
                        patriotic people of Franklin county, who sent you out with their blessings,
                        and received you back with manificent
                        ovations.</p>

                    <p>Can any of us forget how this people, our kindred and friends, burthened with the weight of the great contest and
                        already beginning to writhe under its wounds, their tears of sorrow mingling
                        with their smiles of encouragement, sent us, their brothers and sons, forth
                        to the battle, with every hope and wish and blessing, themselves consumed
                        with a secret fear both for us and our country - and envying us the felicity
                        of the power to do and strike as well as to pray and hope for the success of
                        the cause? Are their letters forgotton,
                        steadying us, stimulating us? Are the numbers in which they flocked to us,
                        when opportunity offered, with presents are every token of regard, no longered remembered? What deep excitement pervaded
                        those homes after a disastrous battle? What sincere mourning for our
                        comrades who fell on the field of honor! What a reception to the survivors
                        when, their period of service ended, they returned to their friends,
                        welcomed with every manifestation of pride and delight! And this same
                        people, again and again, since that time, have made evident their regard for
                        you, have suffered no opportunity to pass to express it, have sought
                        occasions to testify to it. They, to a great extent, placed the good name of
                        the county in your keeping, when they sent so large a body of you out
                        together to do valiantly for the Union of their Fathers, and because you
                        kept well your trust, they honor you and see you with pleasure assemble on
                        the occasion of the reunion.</p>

                    <p>To what do I welcome you?</p>

                    <p>To a renewal of friendships, to an interchange of gratulations of cordial
                        handshakings, to the expression of emotions long desiring utterance, to a
                        bursting of the barriers of mere conventiousalism and a genuine restoration of sundered ties of
                        association, once as strong and firm as those of almost any other possible
                        relation in life; to an abandonment of yourselves to good fellowship within
                        the bounds of decorum, and a thorough enjoyment of the day divested of all
                        cares save to be happy whilst the day lasts, and to make all the comrades
                        and friends delighted with the occasion. Carpe
                        diem! Seize those fleeting hours dedicated to the memories of your
                        soldier life, live over again the scenes of the war times; recall the
                        pleasing occurrences and if you choose the "moving incidents by flood and
                        field" in your career, smoke again in fancy your pipes at the tent doors
                        surrounded by close friends and true companions, and let some one tell a
                        tale or story and the clear, ringing laugh resound. I invite you to a day's
                        thorough enjoyment, the cares of life laid aside, and troubles dismissed and
                        forgotten. Shall we have never a day of unalloyed happiness? Is heaven so
                        stern as to forbid an interval of joy? If ever you may be happy, it is
                        permitted to you to be so now - Heaven is propitious, your fellow men will
                        applaud. Something of business there is for you to do. A moment must be
                        devoted to perfecting the organization of the association we to-day establish, we trust to be long maintained,
                        even to the far off days when half a dozen decrepit men shall alone remain
                        to represent the 126th, and recall the glorious, historic days of to them
                        "auld lang syne." This done, a banquet awaits you, where the groaning
                        tables, like a sorely pressed garrison, call loudly to be relieved, and the
                        caterer for this reunion expects with anxiety your coming, and, pallid,
                        waits to hear his Highland Jenny cry.</p>

                    <p>"Did'na ye hear their slogan."</p>

                    <p>Let us see to-day that "it is merry in hell, where
                        beards wag all." Something pleasant we have endeavored to provide for every
                        moment of time. What with toasts and responses, and addresses and
                        recitations, and music and refreshments, it is hoped to carry you
                        delightedly forward to the promenade concert, when with the ladies and the
                        music leading the festivities, the day shall end, like a successful
                        exhibition of fire works, in a blaze of brilliancy. In short, though I may
                        not offer you a feast of reason, I invite you to an overflow of soul.</p>

                    <p>I observe that in accordance with the invitations extended you, your wives
                        and your friends have come up on the feast day to enjoy themselves with you.
                        They are welcome. It is nothing to us to be offered happiness, if they may
                        not participate. They were never forgotten in the days we commemorate, and
                        are not to be omitted now. Without them the reunion could not be a success.
                        The better-half part of the programme would be necessarily omitted. Some of the comrades,
                        however, have not realized, after the lapse of so long a time, the
                        reasonable expectation of their companions in arms in their march through
                        life they have no supporting column, and no entrenched camp guarded by love,
                        the sharpest eyed of sentries. You seem to avoid capture by the ladies with
                        the same anxiety you tried to escape the rebels. You even run, it is said,
                        at the first attack. Do you not perceive how your reputation for courage
                        suffers? For shame! No Andersonville awaits the captive of the fair, and
                        "Libby" has no horrors for her prisoner. She will not release you a green as
                        well as wretched shadow, however she captures you; but will lead you a dance
                        of delightful measures, always, loyal sir, to the music of the Union. We
                        know that faint heart never won fair lady, and that none but the brave
                        deserve the fair, and we lament that your courage has died out. Or are there
                        really positions in the field matrimonial, not so formidable in appearance,
                        still harder to take by storm than Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg? Well,
                        we are willing to believe it for your sakes and because some of the comrades
                        here with wives and babies beside them - on that I must profoundly
                        congratulate them - have encountered some infantry since the war ended
                        harder to conquer than ever was Stonewall Jackson's.</p>

                    <p>On looking over the muster rolls of the regiment, I am delighted to observe
                        how many of our boys came back to take the "girls they left behind them." I
                        thought it would be so, on the days when I saw them like snakes from a stone
                        wall on a sunshiny day, thrusting out long necks from their tents to catch a
                        view of some piece of Virginia calico which was calling down the road, and
                        then retiring back to their bunks to sing after the manner of the dying swan
                        whose note is always, you know, most beautiful just before death, "Annie
                        Laurie." These same girls, who were so constantly screeched out by the fife,
                        and "drummed out" by the drum as left behind, I to-day welcome, having at length come up, with all possible
                        cordiality.</p>

                    <p>We went forth, comrades, eight hundred men from this county of Franklin. As I
                        look over this assembly now, many of the comrades are here indeed, but a
                        majority of those who took the oath and shouldered arms at Harrisburg are
                        not here. Where are they? and why do they not
                        participate? Some valiant and noble youths we wrapped in their blankets and
                        buried to the sound of the muffled drum in the enemy's land. They sleep in
                        soldiers' graves, having met death in the midst of battle.</p>

                    <p>"Their bodies are dust,<br> And their good swords rust,<br> And their souls
                        are with the saints<br> We trust."</p>

                    <p>It was their fortune (shall I call it an evil one?) to die for their country.
                        It was a happy one, if indeed it be true, as Kosciusko dying said, and many
                        champions of fatherland before him, that it is sweet and becoming to die for
                        one's country. Dulce et decorum pro patriam
                        mori. They sleep in honored graves. Their fame 
                        . No error of theirs can impair the debt of gratitude we owe them.
                        They live in our memories youthful heroes. We pity them for their youth, we
                        admire them for their great hearts. If it is permitted to them to know and
                        be interested in mundane affairs, and they perceive from the starry spheres
                        above the beauty and the glory of their work here accomplished, wherein is
                        our fortune better than theirs? Nevertheless, if not for their sakes, for
                        our own, we wish they were here to-day, and their
                        absence leaves a chasm in our happiness which must remain open. I must not
                        chill with gloomy thoughts now, at the outset, the festivities of this
                        reunion, but so much had to be said, could not remain unsaid.</p>

                    <p>On the column which we will erect to their memory, we may justly transcribe
                        the words from the marble which Athens raised over her youths who fell in
                        the lost battle of Chaeronea:</p>

                    <p>"These are the Patriot brave, who side by side,<br> Stood to their arms and
                        dashed the foeman's pride:<br> Into the battle rushed at glory's call<br>
                        With firm resolve to conquer or to fall:<br> That Greeks should ne'er to
                        tyrants bend the knee,<br> But live as they were born, from thraldom
                        free.<br> They fought, they bled, and on their country's breast,<br> (Such
                        was the doom of Heaven) these heroes rest."</p>

                    <p>Others are not here, because they have laid them down to die under the skies
                        of the restored Union, and amidst the graves of their fathers, and have gone
                        to join the former in the Elysian fields. Ah! how I love to fancy them
                        welcomed by Lyons and Baker, and Wadsworth and Sedgewick and Reynolds and he above all, the commander in chief,
                        the Martyr President, not as soldiers, but as the deliverers of four
                        millions slaves from cruel bondage.</p>

                    <p>All still others are absent, because they are scattered all over the Union,
                        and are far away from us, in the pursuit of some one or other of the
                        callings of industry, working with their hands or brains, restoring the
                        waste of the war, architects of their own fortunes and also of the
                        prosperity of the country. No one of them a soldier, the day after Appomatox. No one of them willing to be a
                        hireling to the bloody trade of war or be of a class separate and apart from
                        the citizens, servants of the centurions to go when they say go and come
                        when they say come. The mustering out of our armies, the melting of near a
                        million soldiers fresh from the fields of battle and victory, into law
                        abiding citizens, is "the coming mercy" of our great struggle. It is the
                            grandest fact in the history of the war. To transform
                        such citizens into such soldiers, was great and astonishing performance; to
                        transform such soldiers back again into such citizens far surpasses it.</p>

                    <p>Our citizens were our soldiers, and to-day we
                        observe a great phenomenon in the old world of the same kind. Germany's
                        citizens are also her soldiers. And such great things have been accomplished
                        by the citizen soldiers in two hemispheres, in recent days, that henceforth
                        it is decreed that a standing army of professional soldiers, a body separate
                        and apart from and above the citizens from them but not of them, shall not
                        be found. The hireling butchers of a despot will never again confront the
                        armed citizens, fighting for fatherland, their weapons guided by patriotism
                        and intelligence. Henceforth armies will not be the play things of monarchs
                        and the tools of ambition, nor battles be fought for the glory of dynasties,
                        or houses; but war will be made only for the genuine interests of the
                        Commonwealth, since it cannot be made without the concurrence and assent of
                        the citizens; for intelligence will guide the ballot, and the man who votes
                        will be the man to fight.</p>

                    <p>The discharged soldiers of the Union therefore are not a class, but only a
                        fraternity, Association in dangers and hardships makes fast friends, by a
                        natural law, and brothers in arms are of kin.
                        They are, indeed, in one sense, kindred by blood. Our re
                            union
                        to day is the outgrowth of this sentiment of
                        fraternity. Companions in arms are held together, as it were, by a species
                        of free masonry - and this is a fraternity older than masonry itself. When
                        you go abroad among strangers your discharge is your certificate of
                        membership, the pass word is Gettysburg or Appomatox - and the hailing sign of distress is
                        the wound you bear; and these are recognized not only by your comrades, but
                        by all people.</p>

                    <p>Are we not a fraternity?</p>

                    <p>Soldier - "I belong to Gideon's band"<br> Comrade - "Here's my heart and
                        here's my hand."</p>

                    <p>When on the 20th of May, 1863, we separated, the war was raging. The
                        rebellion was still in its ascendant. But almost immediately it began to
                        sink. Meade hurled Lee back from Round Top. Sheridan sent Early whirling
                        through Winchester. Grant went crashing afterwards, through the Wilderness,
                        and taking the rebel army in his iron embrace, crushed the life out of it at
                            Appomatox. Then ensued the scene under the
                        apple tree, on which the Union soldiers had so set their hearts to hang Jeff
                        Davis; but the good genius of the Rpublic,
                        unwilling that the arch traitor should be hung by the hands of a Union
                        soldier, procured for him from the gods a meaner exit. Then the pageant at
                        Washington and the disbanding of the armies. Then the replacing of the
                        pillars of the Temple - the vast work of reconstruction. And now, this day,
                        there is what our eyes longed to behold, peace and union. And there is
                        Liberty. Soldiers, the work you were given to do, is done.</p>

                    <p>Ten years ago we were no more respected in the eyes of the world than are now
                        the United States of Columbia. We were not only not a great power - we were
                        not a power at all, either physically or morally. We made no impression
                        whatever on the world.</p>

                    <p>To day the flag of the Union is the symbol of power
                        as well as freedom in every sea. China selects an American for her chief
                        ambassador, the greatest honor I think ever conferred. Our minister at Paris
                        is the protector of the Germans when their own is dismissed, and is at the
                        same time the medium of negotiation between the great nations at war. The
                        London Times speaks of Prussia, England, and the
                        United States of America, as able to lead the world. We occupy a position
                        side by side with Prussia, the now acknowledged leader of Continental
                        Europe.</p>

                    <p>That England joins herself with Prussia and us, is not strange. After the
                        battle of Salamis, a vote of the generals was taken as to who should be
                        crowned for most distinguished services - They were to indicate a first and
                        Themistocles second. And it was agreed that Themistocles was first. We only
                        desire that every other nation should admit us to be next to itself.</p>

                    <p>And, my comrades, what wonderful scene are these we
                        are enacted? In England; at a great meeting of the working people to express
                        sympathy with the newly established Republic of France, it does not suffice
                        to unite the tri color of France with England's
                        ensign but the flag of the Union must be entwined with them both. And in
                        France, when the Empire falls like a rotten apple, at a touch and the people
                        set up the Republic of their hearts and we are frantic with joy at their
                        liberties secured, they rush for the American flag, and waving it with their
                        own, cry "Live the Republic!" "Live the United States!"</p>

                    <p>This is what we are. What we will be is told in a word. The United States of
                        America will not live forever. They will at last be lost in the United
                        States of the World. This is the work of him who said when the contest was
                        on: "I am needed; the work cannot be done without me."</p>

                    <p>I must not forget to say, at this reunion of the 126th Regiment, that no one
                        of its soldiers has had reason to blush for the regiment to which he
                        belonged. Its record is without a stain. I am sorry that I cannot say that
                        the record of every man that belonged to it is equally stainless. This
                        regiment always did what it was put to do, so far as man might. At
                        Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, indeed, we were not victorious. But the
                        Gods only are always successful. I saw the work you did. You deserved
                        success. I vouch General Tyler, who sits here to answer, who saw you go up
                        Marye's Heights on that eventful December evening, who saw you rob the
                        cartridge boxes of your dead comrades, in the woods at Chancellorsville, to
                        maintain the fight.</p>

                    <p>Yet I have always regretted that the regiment had not the good fortune to
                        participate in a grand victory, such as came on several occasions later in
                        the war. It would have mitigated the sorrow we felt for the loss of our
                        comrades. To see them die in fruitless efforts. Ah! that was the bitterness
                        of it. But we know better now. Nevertheless they would have been happier in
                        their deaths, if they had died in the midst of victory. I would we might
                        have seen their smiles, and had the good fortune of the friends of Botzzaris
                        -</p>

                    <p>"They fought like brave men, long and well,<br> They piled the ground, with
                        Moslem slain,<br> They conquered, but Botzzaris fell<br> Bleeding at every
                        vein;<br> His few surviving comrades saw<br>
                        His smile, when rang their proud hurrah!<br>
                        And the red field was won;<br> Then saw, in death, his eyelids close<br>
                        Calmly as to a night's repose,<br> Like flowers at set of sun."</p>

                    <p>I have insisted that the 126th played well its part in the grand drama of the
                        rebellion. Its soldiers now, without a blush, may fight over again the
                        battles by their peaceful firesides, of a winter night. Like Uncle Toby and
                        Corporal Trim, they may interlard every conversation with some illustration
                        from the days of the war. I do not expect to hear them talk, however, of
                        angles and bastions, salients and bulwarks, palisadoes and scarps and couter
                        scarps, and revelins and halfmoons. As little do I expect of all of them the
                        grand answer of Capt. Toby, in reference to his courage, if theirs should be
                        called in question: "Sir, I trust I am not afraid of anything but to do a
                        bad action."</p>

                    <p>But there will be many scenes to live over, again to-day, and I detain you from them too long. I invite you to the
                        business of the day, and to its enjoyments. Be happy in the recollection of
                        duty done, and in the glorious future of your country. For the prospect
                        ahead is ill radiant and inspiring. We advance to grandeur and power. We
                        move on to Empire. The Genius of the Republic guides. The lamp of liberty
                        lights the way. The harmony of the States as they move in their appointed
                        orbits around the central sun of the Union, making music akin to the "music
                        of the spheres," is the anthem to which we march. The great company of
                        patriots, liberators and martyrs to wrong in all ages behold us from above.</p>

                    <p>Already we are out of the wilderness and catch a glimpse of the promised
                        land. We are bound for the inner side of Jordan. we are
                        already entering the goodly land our fathers only saw at a distance from the
                        top of the mount. A  the hum of whose cheerful industry mingled with
                        the tones of a free and happy people, without a discordant note from the
                        throat of a single down-trodden creature, shall be in the ears of the
                        oppressed of other lands a music sweeter than the strains the enraptured
                        poet heard -</p>

                    <p>"When once (he) sat upon a promontory<br> And heard a mermaid on a dolphins'
                        back<br> Utter such dulcet and harmonious strains<br> That the rude sea
                        grew civil at her song<br> And certain stars show madly from their
                        spheres<br> To hear the sea-maid's music?"</p>

<b>The First Senatorial District Election</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After the victory of a Democratic candidate in the state senate election,
                    the Repository explores reasons why the Republican
                    party is losing popularity. The article also supports reforms to the State
                    Constitution.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The election in this district for the political control of the Senate in the
                        coming session of the Legislature, was held last Tuesday, and resulted in
                        the success of the candidate of the Democracy. So much depended on this
                        election that the result was anxiously awaited all over the State. Until
                        Senator Watt died the Republicans had a majority of one in the Senate. His
                        unexpected demise unsettled the condition of things, and made the control of
                        the Senate depend upon the uncertain result of an election in the most
                        uncertain district in the State. When the election for Senator was held in
                        the First Senatorial district last fall a year, both parties claimed the
                        candidate, and a contest ensued which gave the seat to Mr. Watt, the
                        Republican candidate. Last fall the Republican majority was very decided. We
                        see it stated that Mr. Beatty, the Republican candidate for Receiver of
                        Taxes, carried the wards comprising this Senatorial district by a majority
                        of 1,010 votes. The total vote was 26,420, the Republican vote being 13,715
                        and the Democrats vote 12,705. Last Tuesday Col. Dechert, the Democratic
                        candidate, received 14,084 votes, and Lyndall, the Republican, 12,741. The
                        aggregate vote is larger than it was last fall by 404 votes; the Republican
                        vote is 947 less than it was then, and the Democratic vote is 1,379 greater.
                        Such a remarkable change in so short a period of course demands at the hands
                        of the Republican journals of Philadelphia some explanation, but strange to
                        say, no two of them account for it in the same way. It is due to treason,
                        says one, in the party. The defeated faction last fall have been taking
                        revenge.</p>

                    <p>Another thinks the refusal of Congress and the Administration to repeal the
                        Income tax has wrought this change. Still another talks of apathy,
                        indifference and disgust generated by party strife; and last of all the
                        charge of fraud is put in, as a matter of form, like the common courts in a
                        lawyers declaration.</p>

                    <p>None of these reasons, it is safe to say are of much account. They are given
                        as most excuses are, because an excuse is expected. Perhaps only this much
                        can be safely said of the unexpected event, unexpected at least to those who
                        formed their opinion as to what it would be from the election last fall,
                        that the defeat was effected by the Republicans themselves. As to the
                        reasons which moved such of them as assisted to elect Dechert over an
                        acknowledged good Republican, we might suggest a number. The charge of
                        corruption against the Legislature has been so general for a long time,
                        during which the Republicans had a majority in both Houses, that many
                        Republicans even were willing to give the Senate over to the Democracy. Both
                        candidates were exceptionally good men, strange to say, and no damaging
                        charges were made against either of them during the campaign. But probably a
                        more specific reason than this operated to elect Dechert, and probably too
                        what it was will be developed during the progress of the legislative
                        session.</p>

                    <p>Some of the immediate results will be the election of a Democratic Speaker
                        and Clerk, and a careful nursing of the party interests of the Democracy in
                        the general organization of the Senate.</p>

                    <p>Questions and measures not of a partisan nature will scarcely suffer from the
                        change. One of those is the adoption of the civil code which is, ready to be
                        submitted. Another is the calling of a convention to revise the Constitution
                        of the State. They are not party measures, and both are needed. The calling
                        of a Constitutional convention has been earnestly advocated by the leading
                        men and journals of both parties, and the people are decidedly in favor of
                        it. If by any means it should be defeated by the Legislature that body will
                        have a heavy reconing to settle. There are
                        without doubt those to both parties who oppose it, and are determined to
                        thwart the people if they can, but they should be warned now that it dare
                        not be done, and that they cannot hope to succeed in seeming to favor it
                        while they strive to defeat it by burdening it with unfair and complicated
                        provisions. All that the Legislature has to do in this matter is to provide
                        for the election of Delegates to the convention in the fairest manner
                        possible, so that the people themselves will have the selection of Delegates
                        wholly in their own hands, and that one party will have no advantage over
                        the other. As to the questions upon which the convention willl deliberate
                        when it meets the Legislature will of course have nothing to do with them.</p>

                    <p>As to the loss which the Republican party has suffered by the defeat of
                        Lyndall, as well as the other losses in the October election, we believe
                        that the best and only way to put an end to them is through the adoption of
                        a new Constitution, which will make it impossible for any man to use the
                        party for selfish and unscrupulous ends, which will make a man just as
                        strong in the party as he is able and good, and no stronger. When that is
                        done, we believe that the Republican party in Pennsylvania will be more
                        powerful than ever it was before.</p>
