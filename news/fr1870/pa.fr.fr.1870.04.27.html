<b>The Commercial's Sympathy</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository expresses offense at a
                    Harrisburg editor's previous articles in opposition to border damage claims,
                    noting how that same writer is now apologizing to the border people only when it
                    is politically advantageous to do so. The editorial insists that the Repository has always had the interests of the border
                    counties at heart.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Chambersburg REPOSITORY might stand a chance of getting something done
                        for the relief of those who suffered from rebel invasion if it would
                        manifest a little common sense. Those sufferers have the sincere sympathy of
                        every part of the State. Precisely what should be done for their relief, and
                        if anything, however, are questions about which men must be permitted to
                        differ. The surroundings of the bill of the late session were so bad as to
                        repel the support of many of the sincerest friends of the cause. The editor
                        of the REPOSITORY is either ignorant or careless if he is not prepared to
                        admit this much. If support of that bill or any similar bill with similar
                        surroundings is to be made the test of friendship for the sufferers on the
                        border, then we fear they will continue to fare badly. They can well afford
                        to have the REPOSITORY abate some of its peculiar zeal in their behalf. Its
                        style of advocacy is unfortunate--Pittsburgh Commercial,
                            22d.</p>

                    <p>Those who recollect the columns of unqualified abuse of the border people
                        which the Commercial published a month or two
                        ago, and the ill-concealed pleasure it took in cruelly insulting the feeling
                        and wounding the honor of many thousands of brave and patriotic people, will
                        be no little surprised and pleased to learn that it has so far mended its
                        ways as to say that there is little in the way of those who suffered from
                        the rebel invasions getting relief except the lack of common sense in the
                        REPOSITORY. To think that "these sufferers have the sincere sympathy of
                        every part of the State," and they wholly ignorant of it and likely to be
                        ever so long, had it not been for this chance paragraph of the Commercial. Well, the oddest things are forever
                        happening, and people and newspapers have the strangest way of showing
                        sympathy! Of course we have no right to complain if their way of showing is
                        not exactly the approved way, nor the old-fashioned way inculcated by an
                            eminet teacher whom we were taught to accept
                        as authority on the subject.</p>

                    <p>Though this offer of sympathy and good will on the part of the Commercial be somewhat late, it will be gratifying
                        to our readers to know that they have it at all. They surely are willing
                        that it should shift the indefensible and foolish assaults it made upon them
                        over to the bill that was offered for their relief, when it finds that it is
                        politic so to do. To judge from its greatly improved tone and temper since
                        our notice of last week, we cannot admit, however amiable we feel, the
                        charge it makes as to our lack of sense. The manifest improvement we have
                        wrought in it must vindicate us from any such allegation.</p>

                    <p>There is a word or two we must say, however, to correct a false impression
                        the Commercial seeks to make throughout the whole
                        paragraph. Its effort is to show that its opposition was to the kind of bill
                        and the influence it had, not to the border people. This we emphatically
                        deny. We are familiar with all it wrote on the subject, and know that it
                        took the position that the border people were entitled to nothing, and tried
                        to maintain it throughout with such marvelous misstatements, as nothing but
                        the grossest ignorance could excuse. If it has learned better since, we are
                        glad, and hope it will make such amends as honest minds seek to make when
                        convinced of error. It can rest assured that we did not misrepresent the
                        sentiment of the border people on the subject of their losses in our last
                        issue, and their determination to use their power to secure the relief to
                        which they are entitled.</p>

<b>Who Will Carry the County Next Fall?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<b>After the Negro Vote</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The extreme scarcity of local news will perhaps justify Local Editors in
                        using double extra magnifying glasses when hunting for items; at all events
                        it is not worth while quarreling with them if they do. It is no
                        justification however for manufacturing, out of the whole cloth, a half
                        column of stuff which has not the slightest foundation in the truth, and
                        attempting to impose it on their readers. Our neighbors, across the way, did
                        this last week, and manufactured the most astonishing story about the
                        colored voters, and how the Republican party was trying to manipulate their
                        votes. They told how we had attended the meetings of the colored people, and
                        we were actually shocked when we learned from them what we had there done,
                        and how meanly we thought of our newly made citizens. Well, we were at one
                        of the meetings. We were very respectfully invited to come, and we very
                        respectfully agreed to go. The meeting was held for the purpose of making
                        arrangements to celebrate the proclamation of the adoption of the Fifteenth
                        Amendment on the 26th inst., and we went as a spectator purely. We might say
                        here that we were regarded as such, and that those who held the meeting did
                        not see fit to consult us in any partiaular.
                        The Local Editor of the Spirit, however, thought
                        us of more importance than the negroes did, and informed us, much to our
                        surprise, that we were there "for the purpose of moulding the opinions and shaping the actions of the negroes
                        according to our own wishes." We did not know that such a deep laid plot was
                        hidden in our heart, and feel badly since we have learned it, to think how
                        completely the colored folks circumvented it. But this sharp Local
                            Editor, what a sly dog he is? told
                        us still more about ourselves, that we don't know. Robie Burns was right. We
                        didn't see oursels as ithers see us. What wicked thoughts we were thinking of our colored
                        citizens without being aware of it until "the Local" told us in the Spirit? Why, we "regard the negroes as 'dumb driven
                        cattle' and think and say that all we need to do is to direct them to do so
                        and so, and forthwith it will be done. We believe them to be like a flock of
                        sheep which will follow wherever the bell-wether leads the way."</p>

                    <p>Ah! no Mr. Local, that last was too big a whopper. We were willing to believe
                        the first, but now we disbelieve the whole story. We can't go the bell-wether part. We know too much of the
                        colored folks for that. Why, if the biggest bell-wether in the Democratic herd was to marshal the negroes
                        and tell them with all the well known eloquence of the "Local" himself, that
                        just across in the Democratic lot there was the finest grazing in the world,
                        and if they just went over with him they could get all they wanted for
                        nothing, do you think that a single one would be fool enough to believe him?
                        No, not one, unless he is far more stupid than any we know.</p>

                    <p>The "Local" further told his readers that "we indulge in vehement
                        denunciations of the negroes who dare assert their independence," that "we
                        instruct our pupils"--who are they pray?--"to murder the man who shows the
                        slightest symptoms of flinching from the support of the Radical party," that
                        "we cried lustily in the meeting, when one of the negroes asked to have his
                        name erased from the roll, 'put him out', 'kill him,'" &amp;c. Who ever
                        heard of a Local cutting a story so fat as that? Why if we denounced the
                        negroes who assert their independence we would denounce them en masse, for in a body they repudiate the
                        Democracy and all their wiles. On the contrary we applaud and admire their
                        independence. As to inviting them to murder any who may not agree with them
                        in politics, the murdering of the poor negro has so long been the exclusive
                        work of the Democratic party that they have for many years regarded it as an
                        indefeasible right, and the obstacles which the Fifteenth Amendment puts in
                        the way of their exercising this truly Democratic amusement is the ground of
                        their main objection to its incorporation in the Constitution. But after the
                            bell-wether story we do not deem it
                        necessary to enter any specific denial to anything the "Local" has said.</p>
