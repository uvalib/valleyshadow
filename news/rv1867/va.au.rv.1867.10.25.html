<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the recent election, Harrison and Waddell were elected by a margin of
                    390 votes; in the contest for the district, county voters extended Southall a
                    majority of 521 ballots. Of the 4,823 whites who were registered, only 2,912
                    opted to vote. As a consequence, the margin of victory was much closer than it
                    should have been, argue the editors, who remain vexed at the poor showing of
                    local whites.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reports that the election took place in Augusta without any
                    disturbances, and notes that almost all the registered blacks in the county came
                    out to vote, though the same was not true for whites.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The election which took place here on Tuesday last passed off very quietly,
                        no disturbance of any kind having occurred.--The colored people turned out
                        and polled very nearly their registered strength, while the whites failed
                        here, as well as at other points in the county, to poll any thing like their
                        strength. We can not account for this apathy on the part of the whites,
                        especially in an election of so much importance as that just held and one in
                        which their pecuniary interests were so much at stake. We trust that no bad
                        effects will result from their failure of so many whites to vote, but if it
                        should prove otherwise the blame will fall heavily on those who allowed
                        their apathy to damage the interests of themselves, their neighbors, their
                        posterity and their State.</p>

<b>The President's View of the Election</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the article, President Johnson and his cabinet perceive the
                    late elections to be a harbinger of things to come in the country. Increasingly,
                    conservative young men are assuming positions of power and intend on brushing
                    off the "old and effete and prejudiced leaders of the Radical party everywhere."
                    Indeed, this new generation of leaders plans to displace the "old Democratic
                    chiefs of the Buchanan school" as well, as it pushes forward with a new
                    conservative agenda.<br>

<b>The South Twenty Years Hence</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>At present, says the article, there are 12,000,000 people in the South,
                    two-thirds of whom are white. Within twenty years, it predicts, the population
                    will have grown to 25,000,000 or 30,000,000, the increase due mostly to European
                    immigration, which will leave southern blacks vastly outnumbered.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Tribune</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Tribune of a recent date says:</p>
                    <p>There are 12,000,000 of people in the South, whereof at least 8,000,000 are
                        whites. There is ample room there for 50,000,000 more, and crowds are
                        flocking in -- all of them whites. Europe is sending a full thousand a day,
                        and the South proffers them cheap land, a genial climate, and employment for
                        every sort of industrial capacity.--Now that a good harvest has delivered
                        the South from famine, and her reconstruction is in rapid progress, there is
                        no region on earth that should attract so may immigrants.</p>
                    <p>Twenty years hence we will have 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 of people, whereof
                        the blacks will probably number 5,000,000.--Unless all the laws which have
                        hitherto governed the increase of population are subverted, the whites of
                        the South must increase faster than the blacks four to one. Not that the
                        blacks will fail to increase also, but they are nowise recruited by
                        immigration, and cannot be. Africa sends forth no voluntary emigrants: the
                        slave trade is on its last legs and no negroes are coming to this country
                        from any quarter. How, then, is it possible that they four million of blacks
                        in this country should overbear the 8,000,000 of whites in the South, with
                        the millions on the point of flocking thither.</p>

                    employees after they voted for the Hunicutt ticket, and commends the merchant's
                    actions. Noting that there "are plenty of honest white men" who would "gladly"
                    replace the fired black workers, it intones, "Give them employment."<br>
