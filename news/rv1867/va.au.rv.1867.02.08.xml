                <transcript>
                    <p>The long period that has elapsed since the appointment of what was miscalled,
                        the "Reconstruction Committee" of Congress, has hitherto driven the nation
                        further and further from the prospect of quick and conciliation. No scheme
                        of re-construction has been submitted by that Committee to the country,
                        every movement of theirs has tended, if it was not designed to widen the
                        breach between the North and South, and render final re-construction more
                        hopeless -- to foment sectional discord, and especially to intensify the
                        already embittered feelings of the Northern people, against the crushed and
                        desolated South. Both Houses of Congress seem to have placed themselves
                        under the leadership of men, such as Sumner and Stevens, whose private
                        griefs, and not the public interest, has rendered furious, and entirely
                        unsuited for calm and patriotic statesmanship. Thus has the example
                        inaugurated by President Lincoln, and attempted to be carried out by
                        President Johnson, been frustrated. Thus have the Southern States, eager to
                        return to the Union, for the attempt to withdraw from which, they had been
                        so terribly chastised, been driven back from the door of Congress, and
                        compelled by Northern power into secession. Why should these things be so?
                        Cumbered as we are, by an enormous public debt, is it not the manifest
                        interest of the whole nation, that her resources should be fostered, North
                        and South -- that the industry of all her citizens should be encouraged and
                        stimulated to the uttermost, instead of being crippled by petty maliginty
                        [unclear] , in order that <emph rend="italic">our</emph> great indebtedness
                        shall be discharged at the earliest period, and with the least oppression
                        upon all? What a blessing it would be at this time to the Northern people,
                        if the great resources of the South, instead of being sacrificed to an
                        unworthy hatred, and dissipated by that continual turmoil and incertitude,
                        which the present unsettled condition of things produces, were, by a grand
                        and statesmanlike policy, brought in to help them in the payment of nation
                        debts -- if every farm and plantation and workshop South of Mason and
                        Dixon's line were animated by calm and hopeful and energetic industry
                        instead of being paralyzed, as they are, by terrible fears of change and of
                        ruin to be brought about by the vindictive policy of the Radical party?</p>
                    <p>At the close of the late, the whole south utterly exhausted, both in men and
                        means, -- disappointed in the movement she had attempted, and disheartened
                        in every way. She sought the old Union almost with avidity, as a refuge and
                        place of rest from her troubles, and had she been met in a kind and friendly
                        spirit by her Northern brethren -- had her conquerors manifested by their
                        conduct, what they had all along previously professed, that the whole object
                        of the war had been to save the Union from dissolution -- had the policy of
                        Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Gen. Grant, &amp;c., been fostered and
                        co-operated in by Congress, -- and such generosity on the part of the
                        conquerors, would have bound the hearts of the Southern and Northern people
                        together with feelings almost of brotherly love, which have never existed
                        before since the glorious days of the first revolution. The readiness and
                        unanimity with which the South surrendered the great cause of our quarrel --
                        African slavery -- the great efforts she has made in her extreme poverty, to
                        pay the heavy federal taxes -- her ready submission to everything that has
                        been required of her, short of degradation, proves the sincerity of her
                        desire for re-construction. What a glorious nation this then would have
                        been! All cause for jealousy and quarrel removed, the people everywhere in
                        the full enjoyment of freedom and equal rights, united in the bonds of
                        mutual love -- prosperous and happy. What an example would they have set to
                        the other nations of the earth, of the stability of Republican government!
                        What a terror to our enemies abroad!</p>
                    <p>We of the South appeal to the honest and virtuous masses of the North to come
                        to our aid, and arrest the wild career of partizan passion and hatred, which
                        seems to bear away in Washington. We appeal to their ancient affections --
                        to the kindred blood that flows in their veins, and the many bonds of common
                        interest that should bind us together. We appeal to their magnanimity, as
                        brave conquerors dealing with a brave and but prostrate foe. We appeal to
                        their self-interest. We must be one people. However divided by feuds and
                        factions, our interests, our laws must be the same. There is no longer any
                        difference in our institutions -- all the precedents made to operate harshly
                        on us must at some time be quoted with the same crushing influence on them.
                        They cannot strike us in the hour of party madness, buy that the blow will
                        fall upon their own heads. If the safe-guard of liberty thrown around us by
                        the Constitution are assailed and broken down, it is <emph rend="italic"
                            >their</emph> liberties must be sacrificed with ours. We are
                        indissolubly members of the same body -- let us determine to become a
                        glorious body -- each member sustaining and nourishing all the rest, until
                        the whole shall be perfected, and before the admiration of the world -- not
                        an insane body, at war with itself, whose limbs tear each other, and render
                        the whole a loathsome and pitiable mass of deformity.</p>

                    <p>Article 14 -- Section 1. The Union under the Constitution is, and shall be,
                        perpetual. No State shall pass any law or ordinance to secede or withdraw
                        from the Union, and any such law or ordinance shall be null and void.</p>
                    <p>Section 2. The public debt of the United States, authorized by law, shall
                        ever be held sacred and inviolate. But neither the United States nor any
                        State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of
                        insurrection or rebellion against the Government or authority of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Section 3. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
                        to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the
                        State in which they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which
                        shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;
                        nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
                        without due process of the law, nor deny to any person within its
                        jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.</p>
                    <p>Section 4. Representation shall be apportioned among the several States
                        according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons
                        in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when any State, shall, on
                        account of race or color, or previous condition of servitude, exclude from
                        voting at any election for the choice of electors for President or Vice
                        President of the Unite States, representatives in Congress, members of

                        hundred and fifty dollars worth of taxable property, nor as an educational
                        qualification more education than enough to enable the voter to read the

                        two hundred and fifty dollars worth of taxable property, shall be entitled
                        to vote at all elections for Governor of the State: Provided, That no person
                        by reason of this article, shall be excluded from voting who has heretofore
                        exercised the elective franchise under the Constitution and laws of this
                        State, or who, at the time of the adoption of this amendment may be entitled

                <summary>William A. Mann, of Christian's Creek, lost his crops and livestock in a
                    fire that destroyed his barn last Saturday. Only through "extraordinary
                    exertions" was the granary located nearby spared the same fate. A black man who
                    had been in Mann's employ for the past fourteen months was arrested and charged
                    with arson; on his way to jail the suspect allegedly confessed his role in the
                    crime and informed the authorities that he had been hired to do it by a black
                    man from Rockbridge County, who had a "grudge" with Mann.</summary>
