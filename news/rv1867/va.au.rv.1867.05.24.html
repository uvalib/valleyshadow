                    <p>Last night Jedekiah K. Hayward, of Mass., was arrested for using language at
                        the negro meeting on Friday night calculated to create a riot. His language
                        was as follows:</p>
                    <p>When I go back to Massachusetts, shall I tell the people there that you are
                        determined to ride in the same street cars in which white man and woman
                        ride? ("Yes!") Shall I tell thtem that you intend to occupy any boxes or
                        seats in the theatre for which you pay your money? ("Yes, yes!")--Shall I
                        tell them that you will go to any public school where people are taught?
                        ("Yes!") Shall I tell them that you intend, in whatever manner you may see
                        fit, to have every right that any white citizens of the State of
                        Massachusetts enjoys? ("Yes!") If you want these things and cannot get them
                        of yourselves the young men of the Old Bay State will help you to get them.
                        They came once adn laid for months for you in the Chickahominy swamps, and they will come again.--(Cheers.) We
                        have paid taxes to make you free, and we will pay more to get you what you
                        want. (Cheers.)</p>
                    <p>He then went on, as he said, to caution this vast audience. During his visit
                        to Richmond he had discovered bravery among them that was astonishing. But
                        those who might be disposed to be reckless, he would warn that they owed a
                        duty to the brave men who had risked, he would warn that they owed a duty to
                        the brave men who had risked so much for them.--(Cheers.) You would not
                        endanger the life of the illustrious Underwood, would you? ("No! No! That we
                        wouldn't!") Well, then as soon as he leaves you may have a high carnival for
                        what you please. It is useless for me to advise you as to what to do; for
                        great masses generally do what they have a mind to [Long and continued
                        cheering.]</p>
                    <p>here John A. Fitchett arose and said: "Mr. Speake, you may tell the people of
                        Massachusetts that the colored people of Richmond are determined to enter
                        any barroom, hotel, theatre or street car they may wish." ["Yes, they will!"
                        Cheers.]</p>
                    <p>The speaker said that a law would have to be passed for Virginia as had been
                        passed for Massachusetts, compelling hotel proprietors, etc., to allow the
                        colored men equal privileges with the whites. [Loud cheers, and cries of
                        "That's what we want here," and "We are going to have it here, too!"]</p>
                    <p>He was arrested on a warrant from the mayor, and was bailed in $3,000 to
                        appear to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>Hayward was arrested by order of the Mayor, it is understood, at the instance
                        of General Scholfield, but on our putting the question to the Mayor, with a
                        view of learning the facts, he declined to answer. We therefore think it
                        safe to conclude that the arrest was made at the instance of General
                            Scholfield.--Rich. Times.</p>
                    <p>The trial was in progress Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but up to the time
                        of going to press, we have been unable to learn the decision of the
                    Mayor.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that violent encounters occurred in New Orleans and Mobile in the
                    wake of an "inflammatory" speech given by Judge Kelly, of Pennsylvania, who is
                    touring the lower South. As a result of disturbances, the military commander of
                    Alabama has disbanded the police force in Mobile, prohibited public meetings

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial blames Radicals for the recent spate of racial violence in
                    Richmond, New Orleans, and Mobile, and contends the Radicals are promoting
                    incendiary beliefs among blacks as a means to maintain political power. The best
                    way to combat the Radicals' efforts, argues the piece, is to "treat" blacks with
                    "kindness" so that they know who their true friends are.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The result of the one sided harangues the people of the South are burthened
                        with from Northern Radical orators are producing the results to essentially
                        necessary to Radical existence and hence so earnestly desired by them. By
                        teachings of bad and reckless men we have had negro riots in Richmond, in
                        New Orleans and lastly in Mobile--the latter two of which were occasioned
                        directly by the inflammatory speeches of Judge Kelley, a Radical
                        Representative in Congress from Pennsylvania. We some time since expressed
                        our conviction that a return of positive peace would be the death-knell of
                        the Radical party. Too severely are we realizing the truth of that
                        conviction. Fearing a return of peace from the Reconstruction plan, the
                        Radicals are using every effort to thwart such a consummation and at the
                        same time build up a hobby upon which to continue in power and by the aid of
                        which to make further onerous exactions from the Southern people.</p>
                    <p>There is but one course left for us to pursue. We must be patient under the
                        taunts and slurs the perigrinating Radical stump speakers heap upon us. We
                        should avoid the gatherings assembled to hear their calumnies against us. We
                        should treat our colored people with that kindness which a life long
                        sympathy for them prompts, and which their faithfulness during the late war
                        demands, uninfluenced by the extraneous existing circumstances calculated to
                        array the white and black classes of the South against each other. In fact
                        we should strive to avoid these disturbances which are so much desired by
                        the Radicals, and without which the speedy dissolution of that party is
                        certain.</p>
                    <p>We have witnesses nothing but peace and amity in this section and community,
                        but we have had no radical ranters spouting their inflammatory harangues to
                        large assemblies of whites and blacks here. The above advice might,
                        therefore, seem to some uncalled for. The occasion, however, may arise when
                        it will be needed and those who are forewarned are generally forearmed.</p>
