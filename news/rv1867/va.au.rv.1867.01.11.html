<b>A Primitive Region</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article notes that the county of McDowell, located in southwestern
                    Virginia, is so remote that it only has a handful of roads, no post-office,
                    doctors or lawyers, and a "low cabin" that serves as the court house.<br>

<b>The Condition of the Freedmen at Arlington</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the article, the freedmen at the refugee camp on the outskirts
                    of Arlington are "destitute and desperate." Known locally as the "Freedmen's
                    Village," the camp contains a "thousand poor benighted creatures scattered in
                    their scanty clothing, freezing habitations" whose only source of food is
                    government rations. Though the article does not doubt the merciful motives that
                    lay behind the establishment of the camp, it contends the project was "a
                    mistake" because the refugees are "in a dreary spot, away from all civilized
                    habitations," thus "even those who are able to do something for a subsistence
                    cannot possibly find anything to do."<br>

<b>Votes on the Changes</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses the issues currently under consideration at the annual conference
                    of the Southern Methodist Church, and includes the results from the measures
                    voted upon thus far. The two topics being debated by church authorities are
                    whether to remove "Southern" from the name of the church and whether to admit
                    lay delegates.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors offer a positive assessment of the President's veto message of
                    the bill to grant suffrage rights to blacks in the District of Columbia, and

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Constitution, contend the editors, will be the first casualty if the
                    Radicals' rise to power. At present, it is the key obstacle blocking their
                    schemes, though they are seeking to overcome it through a "series of amendments
                    and unconstitutional acts." The nation, relate the editors, must remain vigilant
                    to check the Radicals' nefarious plans.<br>

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The following extract from the Message of Gov. Bramlette, of Kentucky,
                    deserves to be printed in letters of gold and hung up in the Halls of our
                    National Legislature, as a perpetual reminder to the members of Congress of the
                    short sighted policy they seem determined to pursue, and warn them of the

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A bill to organize a militia of all men between the ages of eighteen and
                    forty-five has been introduced in Congress, reports the article. The act also
                    calls for the creation of a national guard consisting of two regiments of
                    infantry for each district and territory represented in Congress, one of which
                    would be composed of blacks. Additionally, "more than one-third of the enrolled
                    militia" will be black. No participant of the late war will be commissioned as
                    officers or privates in the national guard, whose main functions would be to
                    "suppress insurrection" and "enforce the law."<br>

                    was held on January 5 to discuss the prospect of impeaching President Johnson.
                    The participants came to few conclusions, but did decide to examine the matter
                    in greater detail before proceeding any further.<br>

<b>Telegraph Fac Similes</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece describes the latest in communication technology, a method of
                    telegraphing that produces "exact copies" of a message at either "extremity of
