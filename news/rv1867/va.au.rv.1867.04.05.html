<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The confiscation scheme of Mr. Stevens, advocated by him in a lengthy and
                        carefully proposed speech, before the adjournment of Congress, seems to have
                        met with but little sympathy in the House and less in the country at large.
                        The Radical papers, with but few exceptions, oppose confiscation and we
                        doubt not that Mr. Stevens' last effort on that subject has been made. Our
                        readers, we think, need not worry themselves on this subject, for it is very
                        improbable that it will ever be mooted in Congress again, so little favor
                        did it meet with under Mr. Stevens' manipulation.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The sum total of the doings Congress may be summed up in the following
                        statement. While it is constantly increasingly the taxes of the people to
                        pay. It is constantly oppropriating money to take care of the negroes, and
                        as constantly injuring the business by which the white people have to take
                        care of themselves. It legislates for Africa, not for America. It was
                        elected by a white constituency, but devoted all its time and energy to the
                        blacks. Black is the standard color for "loyalty" -- all negroes are
                        "loyal," but if a man has a white skin, upon his "loyalty," unless he thinks
                        negroes a great deal better than white folks. To hear the Radical leaders
                        talk to judge from their legislation, a stranger would think that their
                        constituents were all negroes and that the Southern States were located in
                        Africa. Chillicothe Ohio Advertiser.</p>

                    <p>The Radicals are making desperate preparations to unite the colored vote of
                        the South in favor of the Radical party. The most wicked appeals to their
                        passions and prejudices are being circulated among them, and every effort
                        made to array them in deadly hostility to the white people in the coming
                        elections. To counteract these mean and devilish influence, the people of
                        the South must keep constantly before the colored people the fact that the
                        Radical party at the North only want to use them for their party purposes,
                        as is fully evidenced by the fact that both in New York and Ohio they have
                        refused to grant them suffrage, and have only given it to them in the South
                        in hatred and revenge on the white man. The Northern people, too, vote the
                        original slave stealers, and brought the African to this country and sold
                        him to our people. We have kept him and civilized and christianized him, and

                        people of the South are now and ever have been, his only friends, for a
