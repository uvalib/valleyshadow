<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors herald the development of the manufacturing and mining
                    industries in Virginia. These advances will aid Virginia's return "to the former
                    prosperity of the 'Old Dominion.'"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At no time perhaps has the subject of mining engaged the attention of
                        Virginians so extensively as at present. Daily important and valuable
                        additions are made to the great mineral wealth Virginia is know to possess.
                        These discoveries are inducing a disposition to engage in a new species of
                        manufacture in the Old Dominion. We herald this as a good omen. The success
                        of any kind of manufacturing establishment induces greater energy in that
                        line and tends to stimulate other branches. We have noticed with pleasure
                        that our Capital City is turning her attention to a greater degree than
                        heretofore to manufacturing. Richmond, with her vast water power, her
                        attention turned to manufacture, and with her facility to receive the raw
                        material, will take no second rate position among manufacturing cities. This
                        will but increase her importance as a commercial city. Her advantages in
                        this line are no mean order and manufactures will serve to stimulate her
                        commercial interests. To see Richmond turning her attention particularly to
                        manufacturing is a pleasing sight to Virginians. To this means alone, in her
                        changes circumstances, have we looked ultimately to see her take that proud
                        and prominent position among the cities of this country to which her
                        location and natural advantages justly entitle her.</p>
                    <p>Not only is manufactures destined to benefit Richmond, but it is to the
                        proper reduction of the raw material, in which Virginia abounds, into
                        marketable commodities, that we will have to look for restoration of the
                        former prosperity of the "Old Dominion." Every facility in this line will
                        ultimately be taken advantage of. Manufacturing establishments, adapted to
                        the wants, or super-induced by the facility of receiving and cheapness of
                        the raw material, will spring up in every community. They will furnish labor
                        with constant work, produce with a ready market at home, merchandise with
                        prompt and cash customers and indeed give a heretofore, unfelt impetus to
                        every branch of business. What we all have to do is to foster those which
                        have been erected in our communities by our patronage, and stimulate the
                        building up of other branches of manufacture by the success of those already
                        in operation. If we all but add out mite in this line, every city and town
                        will rise in importance, and Virginia be prosperous beyond any realization
                        of the past or the most sanguine anticipation of the future.</p>
