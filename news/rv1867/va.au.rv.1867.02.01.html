<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is not unknown to our readers that an effort is being made in New York
                        City, by the concerted action of her people, without regard to political or
                        party bias, to afford pecuniary relief to the suffering of the South. This
                        is eminently praiseworthy on the part of the people of that great and
                        wealthy city. With the mere fact of an effort being made to extend a charity
                        to the suffering poor of the South, made so by the devastation and
                        destruction of the war, we do not propose to deal, save to express our
                        gratification thereat, and to return the thanks of those people of Gotham,
                        who, aroused by the reports of the destruction and want in various sections
                        of the South, and animated by a Christian philanthropy, from their
                        abundance, are about to extend that material aid, which will relieve many
                        innocent ones from suffering and want, for whom their friends and neighbors
                        can do but little, so destitute were all Southrous [sic] left by the late
                        war and its attendant results.</p>
                    <p>Another feature, we think claims not only our attention, but the attention of
                        the whole people of the country. this effort, as we stated above, excites
                        and interests the sympathy not of Conservatives alone, but finds cordial
                        supporters in the ranks of those from whom the South is led to expect but
                        little. Among those who appeal strongly for the greatest liberality on the
                        part of the people of the "Great Metropolis," are the editors of the radical
                        papers of that city, and, doubtless, heartily endorsed by their thousands of
                        radical patrons. From a Southern stand point we exclaim, "and is not most
                        incumbent upon them to exhibit the greatest liberality! for is it now due to
                        them that the present destitution and suffering in the South has been
                        brought about?" This they do not, or will not see, but they are astute
                        enough and sufficiently unprejudiced to see that the continuation of the destitution in certain portions of our fair
                        land is not due to the war, but to the continued disturbed and unpacified
                        condition of the country so long after the cessation of actual hostilities.
                        That had peace and pacification followed close on
                        the heels of war, want would have been but a name not a reality in the
                        fertile South. This they can readily and do understand, for they are brought
                        into daily contact with it in the diminished receipts of their ills, and
                        feel it in every throb of the commercial and financial pulse in that great
                        business mart. Indeed they not deny it. On the contrary, on this very
                        account, they profess a great desire to see the restoration of the Union
                        accomplished speedily. Yet we find these very journalists, who bespeak for
                        the Southern poor a bounteous donation, daily advocating plans of
                        restoration, introduced into Congress simply because they are believed
                        impossible, and not for the purpose of securing speedy restoration -- not
                        "to preserve the Union of our Father," but to preserve the life of a party
                        which can only live in turmoil and strife, and whose funeral client be the
                        plans [unclear] of peace. They do not cry out against the impeachment of
                        President Johnson, for observing his oath of office to support the
                        Constitution and Laws, as expounded by the Supreme Court, because it is
                        wrong per se, but because it would hazard the
                        existence of a party. Party and party patronage with them is more weighty
                        than country and the prosperity of the people.</p>
                    <p>While the extending of relief to the suffering poor of the South, or of other
                        lands, is both magnanimous and christian-like, yet we say to our Northern
                        readers and exchanges, would you do away with its necessity in this once land of plenty -- would you "cast your bread
                        upon the waters" to "find it after many days," you must throw aside that
                        partizan feeling, which, for an act somewhat similar to that which made this
                        country a Free-Republic -- a proud monument of successful rebellion, would
                        continue in destitution twelve millions of people -- prevent the recovery of
                        the greatest resources of the country from the present crippled condition,
                        and send down a burden of debt never to be cancelled through coming time,
                        and all, that a party may live. You must take a
                        national, not a partizan view of affairs, and dethrone from their positions
                        these men who would not only exercise the Legislative, but also the
                        Executive and Judicial functions of government, supplanting them by men who
                        will exercise the prerogatives of Legislation without infringing on those of
                        the Executive or Judicial Departments, and whose legislation will be for the
                        benefit of the whole country and not that of a party. When you of the North
                        rise equal to the occasion an act as becomes you, as lovers of your country
                        and the Constitution of your "rebel" Fathers, no longer will you hear the
                        cry of destitution and want from any portion of our land, but you will find
                        that her resources will spring forth to relieve her of debt and her progress
                        and prosperity move rapidly onward from where partizan fury brought them to
                        a sudden and shattering halt.</p>

                        the first legal talents in the Legislature, if not in the State, and their
                        united opinions are certainly entitled to at least as much weight as the
                        decision of any one Judge. Indeed, no great legal talents are necessary to
                        show the utter fallacy of Judge Meredith's decision, for had the honorable
                        gentleman gone to sleep in the Katskill mountains with Rip Van Winkle, some
                        fifty years ago, and remained in a state of unconscious torpor until the
                        last gun of Lee had died away on the plains of Appomattox, he could not have
                        rendered an opinion more directly in conflict with the highest Judicial
                        decisions of the country, and the changed circumstances and necessities of
                        the people and the State.--Lynchburg
