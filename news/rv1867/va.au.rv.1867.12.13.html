<b>Capital For The South</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reports that a London barrister is currently touring the South
                    to "ascertain how the owners of plantations and other estates in the South can
                    be assisted with capital to develop the resources" of the region. Should he find
                    a sufficient number of secure opportunities, "it is obvious that immense sums
                    now locked up in England might be invested" here instead.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Labeling Reconstruction a Congressional "farce," the editors ridicule the
                    notion that Virginia's Constitutional Convention will produce anything but an

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There has been no greater farce enacted in the present age, then the attempt
                        at so-called reconstruction of the Southern States, under Congressional
                        enactments. The parties legislated into suffragans and law-makers by
                        partizan politicians and for partizan purposes alone, are about as fitted
                        for the trust, as a Laplander to write essays on tropical productions, or a
                        Rocky Mountain Trapper to expatiate on the currents of the ocean. In all the
                        States where the mongrel Conventions, legislated into existence by a Radical
                        Congress are in session, there is fear and trembling as to the extremities
                        to which they may go. Gen. Pope would give the world could he say the Demon
                        which Radicalism has aroused in part of his Dominion, once called Alabama.
                        His efforts have proven fruitless, and reconstruction (?) goes on with a
                        vengeance there. The same causes produce like results and Virginia will
                        prove no exception in the experience of hybrid convention. If anything,
                        there is less knowledge and sagacity, or, in plain terms, more ignorance
                        among the Radicals in the Virginia Convention, then among the same class in
                        the other State Conventions which have already assembled. We can therefore
                        expect more extreme measures here than elsewhere. There is one consolation,
                        however, to be derived from the extremities to which the colored Radicals
                        are likely to go. That is a more terrible awakening of the situation into
                        which radical folly has plunged the country. If the mere fact of Radicalism
                        having forced negro suffrage upon the South has arroused our Northern
                        brethren sufficiently to cast aside that party with loathing and disgust, as
                        witnessed in the late elections, what must be the effect of witnessing negro
                        legislation in the South, with a considerable prospect of negro domination
                        throughout the whole country? No one can have observed the causes which led
                        to the late conservative victories, without being able to satisfactorily
                        answer the question and to see a good result must follow the very
                        extremities into which Southern Radical legislation is hurling itself. We
                        would decidedly prefer to see them run to the length of their tether in this
                        State. As a means of doing this we would like to see every Conservative
                        withdraw from the Convention, in which they have but little voice, or, at
                        least, not correct the ignorance of the radical members or inform [unclear]
                        of which they have not a conception, but allow them to go on in their
                        legislation until they got into that foreshadowed entangled condition, from
                        which the legal acumen (?) of Underwood will not be able to extricate them,
                        not forty Philadelphia lawyers be able to tell what they mean. Then for an
                        exposition of their ability to vote and legislate, and of the Radical folly
                        which placed its pets in so false a position. If conservatism will keep its
                        hands off, we will witness such at denouement, and Radicalism will then find
                        that the clarion cry of "Universal Suffrage" which it sounded was but its
                        own death knell. God speed the day and with if the return of peace and
                        prosperity to our long oppressed land.</p>

                    over the body since they have learned the result of the recent elections. The
                    radical party in and out of Congress demanded the impeachment of the President,
                    and were prepared to depose him at all hazards for party purposes. At last after
