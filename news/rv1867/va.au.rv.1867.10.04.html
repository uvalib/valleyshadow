<b>Negro Candidate For Congress</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contains a letter from a black candidate for Congress in
                    Georgia who advocates a platform that includes support for the military
                    reconstruction bill and opposition to the "unGodly tax upon cotton and tobacco."
                    He also supports a measure that would divide the political positions in the
                    state: blacks would run for Congressional seats and whites would run for state
                    offices.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors urge conservatives to unite "in support of good men" in the
                    upcoming election rather than voting for "local" favorites. Should conservatives
                    fail to do so, the editors warn, it will dissipate the strength of the
                    conservative vote and result in the election of Radicals to represent "'Old
                    Augusta'" at the convention.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We endeavored in our last to impress upon our people the necessity of unity
                        of action in the selection of delegates to the Convention, should it be
                        called, and we again urge it upon them. No matter whether favoring or
                        opposed to the Convention, it is the incumben duty of each one of us to vote
                        for delegates. It is equally incumbent upon us to unite in support of the
                        same men. For, without some concert of action on the part of conservatives
                        in the selection of suitable persons as delegates, each section of our
                        county may support some local favorite and result be the election of a
                        radical representation from "Old Augusta." This may seem improbable to soem,
                        yet we tell them it is probable if there be a division in the conservative
                        vote of the county. The object of this organization is to carry the
                        elections by a solide and united vote. This all understand, yet no concert
                        of action is taken by those well-meaning citizens who could but deplore such
                        a result.</p>
                    <p>This county will send a conservative delegation by a large majority if proper
                        action be taken. Then let us take this action.--Let us assemble at our Court
                        House, from every portion of our county, and, forgetting local favorites and
                        old political confreres, unite in selecting suitable and candidates to
                        represent us in the Convention. Having selected them, let us unite in their
                        support and thus ensure their election. The time is growing short and delay
                        is dangerous.--With the sole purpose of uniting our people in support of
                        good men, to be selected by themselves, we respectfully suggest to them to
                        meet in this place on Saturday the 12th inst. to select such men to
                        represent us in the Convention, should the voters of Virginia favor its
                        call. We suggest the above mentioned day as the latest day, before election,
                        on which our people could meet and have their action generally known in the
                        county, and trust our suggestions may meet with the concordant feeling among
                        our county people and that a large representation from every portion of the
                        county will be present to aid in selecting competent and in every way
                        suitabel men, for whom we can cast an united vote.</p>

<b>Riotous Disturbances In Georgia</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In Savannah, relates the article, a melee occurred at a political rally
                    after a northern "mulatto" named Bradley delivered a speech that included
                    "harangues against white men" and a demand that rebel land be distributed to
                    "conservative negroes." Police and troops were called to quell the violence and
                    confiscate the muskets brought in by "large band of country negroes."
                    Apparently, a "large proportion" of the black population "disapprove" of Bradley
                    and "threaten to assassinate him."<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports from Virginia indicate that "the Union Leagues formed by Radical
                    negropholists are disintegrating." The article attributes their demise to two
                    reasons: the fact that white men who joined the organization are now "ashamed"
                    of their actions and that blacks have begun to see that Radicals view them as
                    "tools of designing men, and nothing more."<br>
