                        respected and influential clergymen of this city and State, embracing all
                        the orthodox denominations, and will be sure to attract attention, and
                        receive the highest consideration:</p>
                    <p>To the Public, North and South</p>
                    <p>In a circular recently published at the North, and copied into our city
                        papers, appealing fro pecuniary aid to erect a Northern Methodist church in
                        the city of Richmond, is a paragraph of endorsation written by U. H.
                        Pierpoint, Governor of the State of Virginia, in these words:</p>
                    <p>"There is great need of the church building just referred to. The spirit of
                        the Southern pulpit is thoroughly disloyal; active in the propagandism of
                        rebel sentiments, and in cherishing the hope that the "Lost Cause" may be
                        regained by the destruction of a republican government in the country."</p>
                    <p>It is the unanimous opinion of the undersigned, minsters of the Gospel,
                        speaking in behalf of ourselves, and representing, as we believe, the
                        sentiment of our Southern pulpit that the relation which we sustain to the
                        allegations of Governor Pierpoint, our fidelity to the cause of God, and our
                        sincere desire for the peace of the country, require hat we should promptly
                        and firmly assert our actual position in the premises; and for the following
                        special reasons:</p>
                    <p>These allegations are made, not by a private individual, but by the highest
                        officer in the State, and carry with them, to those abroad, the influence of
                        his official station. They are reported, nota s the utterances of an
                        incidental conversation, but as the deliberate and mature convictions of a
                        resident amongst us, whose position is presumed to entitle him to credit;
                        they inculpate thousands of pulpits and hundreds of thousands of Christians,
                        many of whom are the constituents of the Governor. Besides, inasmuch as
                        Governor Pierpoint, transcending the properties of his office, has
                        represented the pulpit of the South as peculiarly antagonistic to the
                        pacification of the country, it is our solemn duty to vindicate our sacred
                        from so unwarranted an aspersion, and to repel so unjustifiable an attempt
                        to throw the responsibility of the existing political disquietude upon our
                        impracticability as ministers of the Gospel.</p>
                    <p>As to the propriety of the erection of churches in the South by Christian
                        denominations in the North, we have here simply to say that the country is
                        open and they people are free to sustain religious institutions of their own
                        choice. But we do object to the protest against the manner in which he has
                        arraigned the Southern pulpit before the Northern public.</p>
                    <p>In the charge quoted above, are three distinct specifications:</p>
                    <p>First--That "the spirit of the southern pulpit is
                            thoroughly disloyal,"</p>
                    <p>Second--That it is "active in the propagandism of rebel
                            sentiments:"</p>
                    <p>Third--That it is active "to cherishing a hope that the
                            'lost cause' may be required by the destruction of a republican
                            government in this country."</p>
                    <p>These are graven allegations, an were evidently designed so to be. If they
                        were true, we should be implicated, not only in the crime of positive and
                        outright disloyalty to the Government of the United States, but in the far
                        greater sin of prostituting our calling to political purposes. We do not
                        propose at present to argue the injustice of these allegations. The burden
                        of proof obviously does not fall on us.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, we take the Christian liberty of saying that to each and to
                        all of these allegations we offer a unanimous and unequivocal denial.
                        Further, we affirm that scores of unimpeachable witnesses are ready to
                        testify that they are totally without foundation in fact -- viz: that since
                        the restoration of the Government of the United States over the Southern
                        States, we have in no instance exhibited disloyalty in our pulpits, or used
                        them as political agencies against said Government; that we have in no
                        instance propagated from them what are termed "rebel sentiments;" that least
                        of all, have we, in the discharge of our ministerial duties, expressed
                        directly or indirectly a hope of the establishment of any other than a
                        republican form of government in this country. In a word, we assert that the
                        pulpit of the South, so far as we know, is not liable to the charge of
                        either disloyalty or sedition against the Government of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, we are conscious of having adhered strictly and constantly
                        to our ecclesiastical functions, and have studiously avoided all
                        complication of our pulpits with the political issues of the day.</p>
                    <p>This is our testimony and our record, and we calmly submit the declaration
                        thereof to the world.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Even northerners, contend the editors, are beginning to see that

                    <p>In these times we can scarcely cast about us for grains of comfort, so
                        muddled and indefinite are the ideas of all on all subjects, we should not
                        be exclusively selfish, but should divide the atom among the greatest
                        possible number, satisfied that it will cheer and enliven all whom it
                        reaches. This is the case at present with the political situation. In the
                        various efforts to humble our unfortunate people, it has been suddenly found
                        that there are two sides to the question of humiliating the South by
                        disfranchising their best citizens and enfranchising an unlettered and
                        ignorant class, who, as recklessly desire to seize the reins of government
                        as did the fabled Phaeton to mount and drive the chariot of the sun, and
                        with a like effect politically. Northern men are more generously beginning
                        to count the cost of the extravagant and ill advised legislation of the past
                        and to determine whither it is leading. One of the most noted and widely
                        extended journals in the North, which not only moulds political sentiments,
                        but has ever been a sort of shadow of coming political phases in this
                        country, has just spoken out boldly against Reconstruction legislation, its
                        concomitants and its probable results. It now sees that the effort to throw
                        off the "slave-holding power of the past has but ingrafted upon the country
                        "Freedman" power, greater by odds and more to be dreaded on account of its
                        numbers and its want of reasoning power.</p>
                    <p>Others, of equal boldness, declaim daily and weekly against the
                        "bond-holding" power, built up likewise by reckless and extravagant
                        legislation and find a concordant sympathy among the masses.</p>
                    <p>The grain of comfort we draw is, that the representatives of these opinions,
                        the one restless over the probably entire overthrow of Constitutional
                        Republican government, by running the length of the Radical tether, the
                        other ill content with its condition of overburdened taxation, are
                        endeavoring from different stand points to restore the equilibrium and seem
                        converging to the same ultimate good, from which at no distant day we may
                        hope the goal of peace and prosperity will be reached. We are still
                        powerless, however, to act for ourselves, but our course thus far has been
                        amenable to little censure from those even who sought occasion to find
                        fault. Let us then continue the even tenor of our way, acting fairly with
                        all and trust the causes are at work that will bring order of political
                        chaos and make country and people once more prosperous and happy.</p>
