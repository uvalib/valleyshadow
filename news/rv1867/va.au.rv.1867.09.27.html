<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our people will shortly be required to decide upon the question of a
                        Convention or no Convention, which is, perhaps, the most important question
                        over presented to them with less to guide them in the formation of a
                        rational, not to say a correct conclusion. The Reconstruction Acts leave
                        them the option of calling a Convention or not and the orders of the
                        Commandant of District No. 1 require them to vote "Convention" or "no
                        Convention." Their votes then will decide the question as to whether a
                        Convention to frame a Constitution for Virginia shall be called. It would
                        seem but just that, with the choice left them and required to make it, the
                        matter should be at rest, whether they decide in favor of or in opposition
                        to the call of a Convention. Those, however, who favor a Convention, claim
                        that a failure to call it will exhibit a contumacy and rebellious spirit,
                        which will occasion more stringent and oppressive legislation against our
                        unfortunate people and should not be thought of. Those who oppose it declare
                        that in voting for it we will be perjuring ourselves and helping to place
                        ignorance and vice in control of our State, at the expense of intelligence
                        and virtue. That no worse fate can befall our people than to call a
                        Convention under the present registration, which, while it exhibits a
                        majority of Whites in the whole State, yet, according to the apportionment
                        of representation, gives, probably, sixty or seventy local majorities to the
                        colored votes, who will vote for radicals, against thirty or forty white
                        local majorities, enough to give the radicals a preponderance in the
                        Convention, thus fixing before hand the character of the Constitution likely
                        to be framed.</p>
                    <p>According to this if they vote for a Convention they are likely to be
                        burdened with a proscriptive constitution, with its dire concomitants,
                        whereas if they vote against it punishment is to be meted out to them for
                        exercising the only choice left them by Congressional desire. We know,
                        however, honest and conscientious men who favor either horn of this dilemma.
                        With equal honesty of purpose we have long since formed our opinion, which
                        we did not deem proper to give our readers, preferring rather to keep them
                        posted on all points necessary for them to form an approximately correct
                        conclusion, and we have seen nothing to cause us to change our views and
                        much to confirm us in them. Believing the whole Reconstruction legislation
                        in conflict with the constitution and subversive of the principles upon
                        which the Government was founded and prospered for such a length of time,
                        and, that yielding to it is but a step further in the establishment of a
                        despotism on the ruins of our much vaunted "Model Republic," we are opposed
                        to the call of a Convention. We shall not, however, quarrel with those who
                        differ with us, but would desire that all should calmly consider the subject
                        and when called on to decide, vote, without bias, as their judgement
                        dictates is best for themselves, their State, the prosperity of their whole
                        country and the stability of her long cherished Constitution and
                    Government.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the prospect of a constitutional convention becoming increasingly
                    likely, the editors advise readers to select only the "very best men" as
                    delegates to counter any attempt by the Radicals to draft an "ill advised and
                    proscriptive Constitution."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From the fact that there are a number of the white voters in the State who
                        favor the calling of a Convention, it seems to be thought that a Convention
                        will be called and we think it altogether probable. In view of this fact it
                        behooves our people to select good men and act as a unit in support of
                        them.--There is a great probability that the Convention, if called, will
                        contain a majority of delegates committed to Radical theories and it is
                        therefore more important that there should be no division where there are
                        assured Conservative majorities, lest the Radicals may be strengthened
                        thereby. There is one consolation, however, in the event of Radical
                        predominance in the Convention and the framing of an ill advised and
                        proscriptive Constitution, that it has to be referred to the people of the
                        State, when, if unjust, it can readly be rejected by the large Conservative
                        majority in the State. Nevertheless, as delegates must be voted for, we
                        advise concert of action on the part of Conservatives and the selection of
                        the very best men who are eligible to seats.</p>
