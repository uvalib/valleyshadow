<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Drawn from extracts of an interview with a correspondent of the Cincinnati
                    "Commercial," the article relates the views of Senator Ben Wade, of Ohio, on a
                    number of pertinent issues. Of particular importance was Wade's opinion that
                    confiscation is "d--d foolery." The time to have implemented a confiscation bill
                    has passed; its only purpose would have been to prevent southern men from
                    joining the rebellion, not to grant it to the ex-slaves. According to the
                    correspondent, Wade stated that if southern blacks want land, they should work
                    for it.<br>

                    attend a state Conservative Convention in Richmond on December 11. The editors

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the lead of our Editorial columns we publish the suggestion of the
                        Executive committee of the Conservative party of Richmond to the
                        Conservatives of Virginia, to assemble in primary meetings, in the various
                        counties and cities, and appoint delegates to the Conservative Convention to
                        be held in the city of Richmond on December the 11th next, for the purpose
                        of affecting an organization of the Conservatives of the State. We heartily
                        endorse the timely suggestion of the above mentioned committee and earnestly
                        request our people to meet at the Court House, on the first day of November
                        County Court, to appoint delegates from Augusta to the proposed Conservative
                        Convention. It is a matter of the first importance to the people of
                        Virginia, that the whole Conservative strength of the State should be
                        organized -- thoroughly organized before the Constitution to be framed by
                        the Radical Convention is submitted to the people for ratification. We have
                        just realized the futility of a disorganized majority attempting to win
                        success over an organized minority. Without organization we will realize the
                        same result. Although their property may be taxed for every conceivable
                        purpose, amounting to a slow process of confiscation, yet many Conservatives
                        will again fail to cast their suffrages without organization. Hence it is
                        imperative that there should be a thorough organization and we earnestly
                        repeat our request to the Conservatives of Augusta to assemble on the first
                        day of our November County Court and appoint delegates to the Richmond
                        Conservative Convention. Let there be a rousing meeting. Let no imaginary
                        interests prevent attendance, for rest assured your interest in the future
                        wise Government of Virginia outweighs all merely private considerations.
                        Then "come one -- come all" and unite in selecting delegates to a
                        Conservative Convention of the State and take the first step towards
                        organizing the conservative cohorts of "Old Augusta."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quoting Ben Wade, the article claims the Senator from Ohio asserted that,

                    According to his estimation, Republicans throughout the North suffered badly at

                    <p>"The fact that negro governments are in process of organization, and that
                        Congress may admit their representatives, does not vary the case except to
                        render a degrading farce more contemptible. Certain it is that these bastard
                        government as having the slightest validity. Within four months after the
                        presidential election a heavy battering ram will tumble them into shapeless
                        rubbish. The Southern people will immediately re-organize, hold new
                        elections, oust the negroes, send their own representatives to Washington,
                        and the House will at once admit them. The southern senators plus the conservative senators from the North will
                        form a majority of that body, organize as such, and neither the House nor
                        the President will recognize any other Senate. This course is entirely
                        feasible, will be perfectly constitutional, and beyond question adopted if
                        the Radicals are insane or wayward enough to recognize the negro governments
                        after this great rebuke. The only thing that could prevent it would be
                        acquiescence by Southern whites in the Radical scheme. Whoever expects that,
                        is better entitled to a straight-jacket than a refutation."</p>
