<b>A Female Cavalryman</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article relates that a woman named Francis F. Sigel, who joined the
                    army after disguising herself as a man, has applied to the Pay Department for
                    "back pay for her services in the Western armies as a cavalryman." Sigel
                    enlisted in the 13th Missouri with her husband in 1861 and fought for two years
                    until she was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, at which time her sex was
                    discovered and she was discharged. The piece describes Sigel as having
                    "contracted all the rude airs, attitudes and manners of a man."<br>

<b>Is Alabama A State Or A Territory?</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>As a consequence of an Alabama case in which a man was sentenced to
                    twenty-one years in prison for committing a felony, the Supreme Court is
                    expected to rule whether Alabama is a state or territory, a decision with
                    considerable implications for the current debate over reconstruction.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors praise efforts to re-rejuvenate the local economy over the past
                    year so as to "return to our former prosperous condition." They point to the
                    emergence of "Cotton and Woolen Factories, Machine Shops, Forges and Furnaces,
                    Rolling Mills &amp;c., which have sprung into existence in the South" as
                    industries that have paved the way to fostering greater independence for the
                    region.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors lament that Christmas was difficult for all southerners this
                    past year, particularly the former slaves who, burdened with new
                    responsibilities since gaining their freedom, no longer have money to spend on
                    frivolous purchases. Because blacks had nothing to do with the changes, and "are
                    destined never to return to their former happy condition," the editors avow, "we
                    can only feel for and sympathize with them, and sorrow over their unhappy fate,
                    and wish them happier Christmas holidays in the future than the sad and joyless
                    one just past."<br>

<b>More Reconstruction</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The report asserts that a new plan for reconstructing Virginia will be
                    introduced in Congress when that body returns from the break. The new plan
                    excludes "all ex-Confederates for all time to come from participation in the
                    State Government and places all political power in the hands of those who
                    remained 'loyal' during the whole period of the war."<br>

                    John T. Eubank by Hanson Bumgardner. Bumgardner killed the victim after luring
