<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>While the niggers are raising such a decided rumpus with the assistance of
                        their miscegnation allies, and clamroing for a hand in the government, and
                        before the chains are too securely bound about the people let us look at
                        some things:</p>
                    <p>White men were those who discovered America.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who those who threw the British tea into Boston Harbor.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who first disputed the rights of George the III, to rule
                        America.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who fought so successfully the battles of American
                        revolution.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who founded the government of the United States.</p>
                    <p>White men were those for whose benefit that the government was established.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who originated the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>White men were elected by a free people to administer the government for the
                        benefit of the governed.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who brought the American flag to be respected
                        everywhere, as an emblem of power abroad and protection at home.</p>
                    <p>White men were those who handled the government of fifty years, and made ours
                        such a prosperous Republic.</p>
                    <p>The Puritanical ancestors of Massachusetts miscegenationists were those who
                        first introduced and trafficked in African slavery. They conducted the
                        business as long as it was profitable, then abandoned it.</p>
                    <p>White men are those who comprise the earnest, true men of the county; who
                        contributed to its wealth, who push into the Western wilds to settle it, and
                        white men should now be permitted to enjoy the fruit of white labor.</p>
                    <p>White is the word for Americans and Puritans, Abolitionists, Loyalists,
                        Rumpites cannot displace it for another.</p>
