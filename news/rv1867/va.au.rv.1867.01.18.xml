                <summary>Among the changes taking hold in the South since the end of the war,
                    relates the article, is the appearance of a growing number of "commercial and
                    manufacturing" industries. As this trend continues, the region will be able to
                    satisfy an increasing amount of its needs locally, and, in the future, may
                    export its surplus.</summary>

                    of the Saints.'" Accordingly, they should stop "'whining'" about the "evils of
                    polygamy and such like 'blasphemous twaddle.'"</summary>

                    secure an honest livelihood." Currently, a court in Richmond is examining the
