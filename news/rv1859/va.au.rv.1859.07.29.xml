                    <p>We commend in all sincerity these Springs, situated about thirteen 
                        miles from Staunton, to the health and pleasure seeking public.  The 
                        waters--an analysis of which by an experienced chemist of the 
                        University, can be obtained by application to the proprietor--are 
                        pronounced invaluable for medicinal purposes by the best judges.</p>
                    <p> We have just returned from a visit to these Springs, where we found 
                        the accommodations good and the fare most excellent.  The 
                        Superintendent, Mr. Peter Woodward, has had much experience as a 
                        landlord, and is decidedly the most accommodating gentleman it has ever 
                        been our pleasure to meet with in this selfish world.  We very believe 
                        if some credulous epicure should desire for his dinner a nice slice of 
                        green cheese from the moon, 'twould be forthcoming, if Woodward could, 
                        by any possible or impossible means, get a ladder tall enough to reach 
                        that romantic orb.</p>

                    <p>While our "City Fathers" are making appropriations for the purpose of lighting the town with 
                        gas, and paving some of our dilapidated streets, we would earnestly invoke their aid, to relieve 
                        the horrors of the plank walk leading from the town to the Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institution.  If 
                        our information is reliable on this subject, the Institution and the gentlemen residing in that 
                        portion of the town, bore the whole burden of building that walk, and we think the Corporation, 
                        whose citizens have for a long time enjoyed that (until the last few years) delightful 
                        promenade, should bear its part in its repair.  The walk at present is in a melancholy condition 
                        of dilapidation--in the day time worthless for the purposes for which it was made, and at night 
                        actually dangerous.</p>

                    <p>Wheat this year is generally considered good, and the yield abundant, 
                        but the most extraordinary lot turn out which we have heard, was upon a lot of a half acre of 
                        ground in the neighborhood of Duffield's Depot, owned and harvested by Mr. John Miller.  The 
                        crop of this half acre lot, yielded nineteen bushels measured wheat, which weighed sixty-six 
                        pounds to the bushel, making by weight within a fraction of twenty-one bushels.-- Spirit of
