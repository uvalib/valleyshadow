<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Robert Miller, of Belleville, Ill., recently hired a man named James 
                        Bracewell, to work in his coal pit.  While holding this situation, Bracewell had an opportunity 
                        to make love to Margaret, Miller's daughter.  It was soon understood that Miller was opposed to 
                        Margaret's marrying her suitor, but the two seemed to be no less determined on that account, and 
                        on Saturday week, consummated their purpose accordingly.  Miller, shortly after meeting 
                        Bracewell on the street, asked him if it was true he had married his daughter.--Bracewell 
                        replied, yes;  whereupon Miller produced a knife with which he inflicted a stab in the left side 
                        of his son-in-laws's back.  Bracewell lingered until Monday last, when he expired.</p>
