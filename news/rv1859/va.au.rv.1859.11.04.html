<b>Compromise</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In this time of sectional tension, the nation should follow Clay's example
                    of compromise; maybe in the spirit of compromise Virginia should surrender part
                    of its territory to the North.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Senator Douglas's Reply to Judge Black</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Without having actually read the reply of Douglas to Black's appendix, the
                    Vindicator says that it is sure the reply cannot sufficiently respond to Black's
                    able arguments.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Opposition Meeting</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Last Tuesday there was a meeting of the Augusta Opposition at the Court
                    House, where it was decided to send a number of delegates to the Richmond
                    convention. The Vindicator questions the loyalty of Staunton Whigs.<br>(Names in announcement:  William Bell,  L. Waddell, Mr.  Stuart)</blockquote>
<b>Gov. Wise</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator joins the multitude of voices in praising Gov. Wise for his
                    quick and brave response to Harper's Ferry.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Mr. Stuart's Address</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>As much as the Vindicator regrets it, it does not have room to publish
                    Stuart's address in Richmond. The paper finds the speech quite able, though it
                    disagrees with Stuart's belief that slavery should not be expanded into the
                    territories.<br>(Names in announcement:  Alexander H.H. Stuart)</blockquote>
<b>Interesting Accident</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Doom's son died after his clothes caught fire.<br>(Names in announcement:  Madison Doom)</blockquote>
<b>Fire</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The town was alarmed by cries of fire on Wednesday morning that apparently
                    started in the courthouse chimney. The fire company soon took care of
                it.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The law of Virginia...</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article says that Virginia should show its magnanimity by pardoning
                Brown.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Commercial Advertiser</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>The Vindicator mocks the suggestion that the South forgive Brown by
                    comparing it to letting the devil loose after conviction to continue wreaking
                    havoc on earth.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Trial of the Harper's Ferry Rioters</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John Brown and Coppee, one of his confederates, have been convicted of
                    treason against the state. Brown will be hanged on December 2.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>B.F. Hallett, Esq. of Boston</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article mocks Hallett's anti-slavery and anti-southern sentiment, arguing
                    that Lowell, Mass., could not exist without the cotton sent North that had been
                    produced through southern slave labor. Also disdainfully notes how Hallett
                    argued that Brown's insurrection represented the feelings of people in
                    Massachusetts about slavery and chided him for saying that the slaying of white
                    men, women, and children could in any way be considered Massachusetts
                    philanthropy.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"The act of Brown could not be individualized, it was a type of a whole class
                        at the North inflamed by the teachings of this insane hatred to the
                    South."</p>
