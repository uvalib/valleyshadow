                        westward daily, indicates that there will be an equally large, if not a

                        1500, at the Rockbridge Alum about 700 or 800.  The other watering

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday last Mr. Wm. A. Perrin, a resident of Staunton, was 
                        bitten by a rattle-snake at the Augusta Springs, from the effects of 
                        which he died the next day; though several physicians were in 
                        attendance, their skill could avail nothing.  The fangs of the venomous 
                        reptile had penetrated a blood vessel in the hand and the poison coursed 
                        with the speed of electricity through the system; in ten minutes after 
                        the fatal occurrence his feet commenced swelling, which made it evidence 
                        that the poson had already disseminated itself through the system. - 
                        Before death finished its work, the whole body had become discolored and 
                        enormously swollen.</p>
                    <p> The snake had been sent by some one residing in Highland to Mr. 
                        Perrin who was known to be in the habit of catching and caging them.  
                        Unfortunately, the fangs of this one had not been extracted, and the 
                        fatal blow was struck while Mr. Perrin was changing him from one cage to 
                        another.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>There were 185 deaths in Augusta county last spring ending December 31,
                    1858; there were 634 births and 151 marriages. The small number of deaths for a
                    county of 25,000 reflects a healthy county. The marriage list "shows that the
                    blessing of matrimony still continues to be appreciated. The births speak for
                    themselves."<br>
