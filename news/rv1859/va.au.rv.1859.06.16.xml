                    <p>For long, it was the common opinion among the Lords of Creation that 
                        women were destitute of the capacity to master the occult sciences, and 
                        that the avenues to any attainments beyond the purely ornamental were 
                        completely closed against them.  Indeed, so fixed had become this 
                        sentiment, that even the poor dear darlings themselves were in some 
                        degree contaminated by the heresy, and were beginning to think 
                        themselves a set of mere grumps.  But the history of the present century 
                        has dispelled the illusion, and we bow with reverence before the 
                        illustrious memory of the author of Corinne, the gifted daughter of 
                        Neckar, and offer unbought homage to the names of Blessington and Hemans 
                        and Sigourney and Lomax and L. E. L., and a hundred others who have 
                        contributed to rescue their sex from the degrading charge of 
                        inferiority, under which they had so long and so unjustly suffered.</p>
                    <p> We do not expect or desire that our women should become statesmen or 
                        jurists, but we do wish to see them prepared to take the position, that 
                        so well becomes them, of guides and teachers to future Senators.--The 
                        energetic efforts of our friends of the Methodist-Episcopal Church, have 
                        almost brought to perfection the system of female education.  The 
                        chemical and philosophical apparatus which they propose to add, during 
                        the year, to the already unusual facilities which they now possess, will 
                        compare with those of most of the male colleges in the State, and as we 
                        learn that the finances of the school are in the most flourishing 
                        condition, we take it for granted that no expense will be spared to 
                        render everything complete.  In testimony of this we will state that the 
                        services of Dr. H. Anderson, a graduate of the University of Virginia, 
                        and of course a finished scholar, weekly lectures on the important 
                        subjects of Physiology and Hygeine.  Nor are the politer branches of 
                        education neglected in the meantime.  Professor Turner will continue to 
                        give instruction in Piano music, and sweet sounds generally, but as his 
                        attainments are so well known to the public, we will only say that he 
                        deserves his reputation.  The fact is,that Staunton is, of all places in 
                        Virginia, the best suited for female schools. Geographically it is near 
                        the centre of the State;  the cars,stages and telegraph reach here from 
                        all sections;  the health of the whole surrounding country is undoubted, 
                        and the morality of the population unimpeached.--Added to these numerous 
                        advantages, the Methodist school is now being presided over by a 
                        gentleman most eminently fitted for the high responsibility, combining 
                        all the gentleness of the parent with the figure of the teacher.  In 
                        short, Mr. Arbogast is a finished scholar and gentleman, and being 
                        these, we can ask for nothing more.</p>
