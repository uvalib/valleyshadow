                    <p>Under this caption the Richmond Examiner, has a long, calm article, deploring the inertness, and 
                        indifference of the people, concerning the various elections which are held throughout the 
                        country, and the actual absence from the polls, of a large, a fearfully large, number of the 
                        very best, and most reliable voters.  This is a lamentable fact, made more apparent by every 
                        succeeding election, and especially in the late election for Judge, in this district, when we 
                        think hardly one third, perhaps not that much of the vote of the district was polled.  This is 
                        an evil, which a people, from whom as the original source, all power and all government 
                        emanates, should ponder deeply.</p>

                <summary>The Vindicator relates the position of the "Southern Citizen," which lauds
                    Stephens for supporting the re-opening of the slave trade, but criticizes him
                    for not stressing the need for federal protection of slave property. Senator
                    Iverson, on the other hand, insists on federal protection of slave property in
                    the territories, yet says nothing about re-opening the slave trade.</summary>

                        a policy would 'knock into a cocked hat' that precious scheme of a coalition
                        with 'all the elements of Opposition,' Whigs, Know Nothings, Abolitionists,
                        Free Soilers, Free 'Niggers,' etc. which, at present, is the darling object
                        of the Opposition heart."</p>

                <summary>Article mocks the Spectator's repudiation of the extreme Southern platform
                    for the Opposition, since adopting such a position would destroy the coalition
                    that the Opposition is attempting to create. However, the Vindicator argues, if
                    the Republicans abandon the Opposition once they realize that the coalition
                    can't deliver any Southern states, the Opposition will of course adopt the
                    extreme Southern platform.</summary>
