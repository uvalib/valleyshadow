                    <p>A strange disease has appeared among the hogs of several farmers in this
                        vicinity, which taxes the ingenuity of all to account for. The skin becomes
                        covered with pimples and little sores, resembling leprosy, and the affected
                        hog dies off suddenly. The disease does not appear to have any effect on the
                        hog internally, as the cholera, which is also prevailing to some extent.

                <transcript>
                    <p>We are always willing to meet, and if possible, to refute, an attack 
                        made in a becoming manner upon any position which may have been assumed 
                        by us;  but a batch of impertinences like the following, which are 
                        prominent characteristics of the style of the editor of the "Virginia 
                        Citizen," whenever he speaks of his contemporaries who differ with him 
                        in politics, and which are alike unbecoming a journalist and 
                        gentleman,--we pass by with no other than this brief notice:</p>
                    <p> THE STAUNTON VINDICATOR AND THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.--The Staunton 
                        Vindicator is an amusing sheet.  Its editorials are really rich, rare 
                        and racy. It has had two or three articles on the African slave trade 
                        that are the most amusing things ever conceived by mortal man.  We would 
                        defy all the Philadelphia lawyers in christendom to "make hair or hid" 
                        out of them.  Why, gentlemen, if you are in favor of legalizing that 
                        horrid traffic, the African slave trade, why in the name of common sense 
                        don't you say so at once,!
                        and be done with it;  and if you oppose it why not say so?  Why all 
                        that stuff about slavery as an institution, slavery as a right, slavery 
                        as the natural and normal condition of all human society, and all that 
                        rigmarole of stuff you have about slavery, and liberty, and education, 
                        all of which exhibit the merest jumble of ideas.  Come, now, right out 
                        with what you wish to say, and be done with it.  People love directness 
                        and plain talk.</p>

                        only on account of the superiority of its exhibitions, which is great, but
                        also, because of the politeness and gentlemanly behavior of the managers and
                        all the actors. The free tickets which they gave unasked, to the
                        unfortunates of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institution, indicates a spirit
                        of kindness and generosity, commendable in the highest degree.</p>

                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--You will please give publicity to a brief notice of a
                        procession of the Sons of Temperance and a pic-nic got up, and successfully
                        carried out by the Mint Spring Division on Saturday last.--Rarely have I
                        ever been more fully persuaded to take the pen in hand to describe an
                        occasion of the kind, than the above mentioned, and think those that were
                        not present should be informed and have some conception of the pleasure and
                        enjoyment realized by the assemblage of that day. The procession formed at
                        their Hall, headed by some of Eve's fair daughters, who have enlisted to
                        wield their mighty influence in the cause, and thence proceeded to a grove
                        near by where they and the crowd at large were entertained for a short time
                        in a very able and eloquent address, by the Rev. Mr. Cummins, who described
                        the Star of Temperance as it rose above a gloomy horizon, and traced it in
                        its course, rising higher and higher, and shining with greater and greater
                        brilliancy and splendor. He portrayed in bright and vivid colors, the good
                        and beneficial effects of the Temperance Order, relating how many had been
                        snatched from the brink of a drunkard's grave, and turned from the error of
                        their way to be greeted by their friends, and enliven their family circles
                        with a parental smile, instead of rendering them miserable by the oaths and
                        harsh epithets of the inebriate. On the other hand he painted with the skill
                        of the artistic painter, the horrible and baneful influence of Intemperance,
                        which, when unchecked and unbridled, like a tempest, sweeps every thing
                        before it in its mad career, and brings its victim to a sad and untimely
                        end. The company was then invited to the table where a rich and dainty
                        collation was prepared, to which all were plentifully helped and filled,
                        leaving many baskets full of fragments to be taken up. After the pic-nic was
                        over the county convention order met in which several prominent members of
                        the different Divisions represented, made some very appropriate remarks
                        about the importance of their cause and their success in impeding the
                        progress, and raising great barriers against the inroads of Old King
                        Alcohol.--The assembly then dispersed, and everything went off in the finest
                        style. The weather was cool and pleasant, scarcely a cloud obscuring the
                        azure canopy of Heaven. It speaks well for the young and prosperous Mint
                        Spring Division, which bids fair to be a great herald in proclaiming the
                        glad tidings of Temperance, and especially so since it is favored by the
                        bewitching smiles of the young ladies who have rallied to their support with
                        untiring zeal. In conclusion much praise is due to the ladies of Mint Spring
                        and vicinity for the enterprise and industry exhibited in preparing such a
                        choice repast, and should be long remembered by all present..</p>

                    Division last Saturday. Rev. Cummins spoke to the group, which had formed at
                    their Hall and then walked to a grove, the procession "headed by some of Eve's
                    fair daughters, who have enlisted to wield their mighty influence in the cause."
                    Rev. Cummins related "how many had been snatched from the brink of a drunkard's
