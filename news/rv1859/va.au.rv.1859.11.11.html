<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Madison Courier disagrees with the Vindicator that Douglas and Smith
                    should be convicted for "constructive treason" in the Harper's Ferry incident.
                    The Vindicator argues that it said no such thing but feels the two accessories

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We call special attention to the proceedings of a meeting recently held in
                        Salem, (published on our first page,) which had for its object the
                        consideration of the proposed railway connection between Harrisonburg and
                        that point. The intersection of the Manassas Gap and Va. and Tenn. R. R. is
                        a matter of so much interest to the people of the Valley and adjacent
                        country, that we cannot possibly be too earnest or zealous in urging it upon
                        the attention of the various counties along the Valley she expects an early
                        and enthusiastic response. Will not the people of Augusta, and will not the
                        papers of the Valley agitate and discuss this question, so vital to our
                        interest? J. B. J. Logan, Esq., of Salem, passed through our town recently
                        en route to Harrisonburg, having for his object the agitation of this
                        Railroad question. He is Chairman of the Roanoke Committee and deeply
                        interested in the whole scheme, and proposes that the people of Augusta hold
                        a meeting with special reference to this subject on the 4th Monday of the
                        present month, at which time he may probably make a speech, bearing upon the
                        connection of Harrisonburg and Salem by a Valley Railroad. It is to be hoped
                        that this matter will receive that attention on the day of our County Court
                        which its importance imperatively demands.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letters from his mother and sister were found on the body of one of the
                    dead insurgents from Harper's Ferry. In this correspondence, the insurgent's
                    family talked of their desperate need for money for food and medicine. The
                    article criticizes this example of "northern philanthropy": a strong bodied man

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A WARNING VOICE.--The following says the New York Express, is an 
                        extract from a letter to the editors, from one of the most distinguished 
                        men in Virginia:<br> STAUNTON, VA., Nov. 2, 
                            1859. </p>
                    <p>"It seems to me that the time has arrived when there should be 
                        consultation, and, if possible, concert of action between the 
                        Union-loving men North and South.--We are in great danger of being 
                        precipitated on a purely sectional contest in 1860.--We may stand one 
                        such struggle, but not more than one.  'If'  there will be, beyond all 
                        doubt, a Southern Confederacy formed, and the CONFLICT OF OPINION will 
                        be followed by the CONFLICT OF THE SWORD.  This is no idle surmise.  It 
                        will be an inevitable result.  I sincerely hope there is patriotism and 
                        national feelings enough to avert such a catastrophe.  The outbreak at 
                        Harper's Ferry has given additional intensity to the feeling, which was 
                        strong enough before."</p>
