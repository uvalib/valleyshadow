                    <p>The mothers of the South! <lb/>
                        In the lurid morn of battle,<lb/>
                        When from the cannon's  mouth<lb/>
                        Came the thunder's deadly rattle; <lb/>
                        Their fair and fragile forms<lb/>
                        Shrank  not, in terror, from us,<lb/>
                        But--rainbows on the storms-- <lb/>
                        Still gave us freedom's promise! <lb/>
                        Then pledge to-night their memories bright,<lb/>
                        Our noble Southern mothers! <lb/>
                        Who in the strife--maid, matron, wife-- <lb/>
                        Stood by their sons and brothers.<lb/>
                        On Camden's fatal plain,<lb/>
                        At Eutaw and Savannah, <lb/>
                        The star  of freedom's train<lb/>
                        Was beauty's woven banner; <lb/>
                        Throughout the night of woe.<lb/>
                        The flag was still resplendent,<lb/>
                        And many a son fell low<lb/>
                        To keep its folds ascendant! <lb/>
                        Then pledge to-night their memories bright,<lb/>
                        Our noble Southern mothers! <lb/>
                        Who in the strife--maid, matron, wife-- <lb/>
                        Stood by their sons and brothers! <lb/>
                        Oh, yes! we'll keep their names <lb/>
                        Embalmed in song and story, <lb/>
                        Those lion-hearted dames, <lb/>
                        Who cradled freedom's glory; <lb/>
                        And should the strife of  war <lb/>
                        E'er tinge again our waters, <lb/>
                        We'll find our hearts to cheer <lb/>
                        Those matrons in their daughters! <lb/>
                        Then pledge to-night their memories bright, <lb/>
                        Our noble Southern mothers! <lb/>

                    <p>Quite a stir was created at the depot on Sunday last, upon the arrival of the
                        Mountain Guard, under command of Capt. Bushong, from Charlestown. They were
                        cordially welcomed back by their friends both from town and country. Respect
                        for the day, was the cause of no formal demonstration upon their arrival.
                        Though perhaps not as well drilled as some other companies, yet we learn
                        that handsome compliments were paid them by Gov. Wise and others, for their
                        soldier-like appearance. Having exchanged their military coats for red
                        flannel shirts, they presented quite a dashing appearance, as they marched
                        through town to their homes in the country.</p>
