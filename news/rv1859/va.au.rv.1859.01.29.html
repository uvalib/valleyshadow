<b>Reform</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Every politician calls for reform and retrenchment, but no one has yet
                    "struck the right path." The Vindicator supports some government projects, such
                    as the Pacific railroad and the continuation of governmental support of the Post
                    Office. However, the paper "would have our representatives wait, until the
                    revenue has been made equal to the expenditure, and we can see some way in which
                    to pay for those things, without going heels over head in debt."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Review of Trade</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator encourages readers to see the Richmond Whig's review of
                    trade and points out that it behooves Virginia merchants to extend their
                    patronage to Richmond. If they do so, Virginians might soon make Richmond "able
                    to compete with the northern cities in her imports, as she now does in many of
                    her manufactories."<br>

                    <p>"[I]f Richmond offers equal advantages with other cities, then she certainly
                        has the right to demand our trade. Why should she be subservient to New York
