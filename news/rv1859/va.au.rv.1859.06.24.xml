                    <p>The annual session of this Institution was closed with the usual 
                        exercises on yesterday.</p> 
                    <p>The large chapel of the Institution was crowded to overflowing with the 
                        elite of the town and surrounding country.  And the exercises and 
                        examination, frequently interspersed with music, passed off with 
                        pleasure to the audience and great credit to the youthful students, both 
                        male and female.--After the examinations had closed, the audience was 
                        entertained by an address of remarkable grace and eloquence from the 
                        Rev. George B. Taylor, the orator of the occasion. When Mr. Taylor had 
                        concluded, the large auditory was held enraptured for full 
                        three-quarters of an hour by a speech from the Hon. Henry A. Wise.  It 
                        is useless for us or any one else to attempt to convey the slightest 
                        impression of the orations of Mr. Wise.  Replete with the highest 
                        flights of original and soul-stirring eloquence, blazing throughout with 
                        the fire of genuine and natural oratory, his every impromptu address 
                        incomparably surpass the studied and elaborate essays of the lecturers of the day.</p>

                    <p>Day before yesterday two sons of Mr. Van were amusing 
                        themselves in front of their father's residence on Plum street, by jumping from a dray.  Strange 
                        to say, both received similar injuries at almost the same time, which resulted in their death 
                        yesterday morning.  Either from the overstraining or falling, in jumping from the dray, they 
                        ruptured their omentums or cauls.  Robert Albert, aged fourteen years, and Theodore Lewis, aged 
                        sixteen years.--What makes this more singular is, that Mr. Van has lost all his sons by 
                        accident--the two above named being the last of eleven boys. </p>
