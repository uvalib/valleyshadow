<b>Editorial Responsibility</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article expounds on significance of editorial responsibility and criticizes
                    the editor of the Spectator for forgetting this lesson in his editorial about
                    the Methodist Church.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The editors of the Spectator and ourselves must agree to differ on 
                        the question of the duty and responsibility of editors. - Nor do we 
                        perceive that the examples quoted of the editors of the National 
                        Intelligencer, and three exchanges, illustrate the question between us, 
                        even by precedent, (which is always a bad mode of argument in ethics, 
                        equally condemned by reason and scripture.) We suppose no one will deny 
                        that the editor is responsible for his own editorials.  Nor do we 
                        understand that the Intelligencer and the other papers referred to 
                        having noticed the subject editorially, question their responsibility to 
                        the advocates of Camp-meetings, and to the public, for the sentiments 
                        they have seen fit to utter against the propriety of such meetings.  Our 
                        proposition is, simply, that the editor of a newspaper, who admits into 
                        his columns an anonymous production, assailing individuals or 
                        communities (especially without comment,) is just as responsible for it 
                        as for his editorials, either legally or morally.  That he is so legally 
                        no one who knows the law of slander or libel doubts, and it is proper 
                        that the press should be cognizant of the fact.  That he should be held 
                        so morally, deeply concerns the purity of the press and the peace of 
                        society. Without such  responsibility, the freedom of the press would 
                        degenerate into licentiousness, and the characters of the purest men, 
                        and the most innocent ad useful association, would be no protection from 
                        insult and abuse.  The illustration put by the Spectator, showing its 
                        own course in reference to a piece signed "Justice," published in its 
                        columns the week before, contains no argument.  It is a mere comparison 
                        of itself with itself - a justification of one by another - and we can 
                        only reaffirm the opinion, (not assailed by the illustration,) that the 
                        editor was just as responsible for that publication as if it had been 
                        his own.  The question between us would be greatly simplified, by the 
                        separation of it  from other questions, with which the Spectator 
                        continually confounds it.  The question is of responsibility - not of 
                        propriety or of public necessity. We do not pretend to determine what an 
                        editor should or should not do--that is a matter for every free agent to 
                        decide for himself.  We only affirm that for what he does he is and 
                        ought to be responsible.  His paper being his, he must answer to 
                        individuals and the public for its contents.</p>
                    <p> As to the piece signed "Conservator," if we misconceived it, we did 
                        so after very careful perusal and while we would be very happy to 
                        believe the author meant no attack on the Methodist Church, we can only 
                        express the belief that ninety-nine of an hundred readers would be apt 
                        to fall into the same misconception that we did, and those of that 
                        church who did so misconceive it ought not to be held to the severe 
                        accountability that the Spectator visits on "Parnassus," and others, who 
                        have naturally written under a sense of injury.  But these are matters 
                        that we have nothing to do with further than, with all good men, to 
                        desire an end of such strife.</p>
