                <summary>In this time of sectional tension, the nation should follow Clay's example
                    of compromise; maybe in the spirit of compromise Virginia should surrender part
                    of its territory to the North.</summary>

                    House, where it was decided to send a number of delegates to the Richmond
                    convention. The Vindicator questions the loyalty of Staunton Whigs.</summary>

                    Stuart's address in Richmond. The paper finds the speech quite able, though it
                    disagrees with Stuart's belief that slavery should not be expanded into the
                    territories.</summary>

                    that Lowell, Mass., could not exist without the cotton sent North that had been
                    produced through southern slave labor. Also disdainfully notes how Hallett
                    argued that Brown's insurrection represented the feelings of people in
                    Massachusetts about slavery and chided him for saying that the slaying of white
                    men, women, and children could in any way be considered Massachusetts
