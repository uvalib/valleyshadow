<b>Senator Douglas and the Opposition Press</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is clear that the Opposition party is beginning to notice and talk about
                    the inconsistency and lack of across-the-scale support for Senator Douglas among
                    Democrats, especially over his territorial policy. While the Vindicator opposes
                    Douglas's nomination as presidential candidate, it would no doubt support him
                    over any Black Republican candidate.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The papers found in Brown's possession after his capture demonstrate beyond
                    a doubt the existence of a northern conspiracy against slavery. The Vindicator
                    suggests that the states that are home to those complicit in the affair should
                    deliver up those absent co-conspirators for persecution in order to restore
                    harmony between the regions.<br>(Names in announcement:  John Brown,  Fred. Douglas,  Geritt Smith, Gov.  Wise)</blockquote>
<blockquote>

                    <p>"...on the action of those States from which the prisoners are demanded,
                        would depend the revival or the total extinction of good feeling between the
                        two sections, and even the existence of the Union itself."</p>

<b>Trial of Farrar</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Farrar is on trial for killing Vance, who had spoken improperly in front of

                    neck.<br>(Names in announcement:  William Farrar,  Michael Vance, Gen. William Harman,  Briscoe Stuart)</blockquote>

<b>Brown and Giddings</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article gives evidence that Joshua Giddings had consulted John Brown before

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"Though Giddings denies having consulted Brown on the insurrection at
                    Harper's Ferry, it seems clear that he is guilty."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Hitherto, Liberty and Religion have maintained...</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article examines the insurrection at Harper's Ferry, essentially condemning
                    the use of violence to try to shake (uselessly) a deeply entrenched social
                    order. It also comments on the futility of trying to get slaves who are content
                    with their lot to revolt.<br>

                    <p>"An invading army lately penetrated into our midst, with the hope that
                        thousands of discontented slaves would flock to their standard at the first
                        beat of the drum--NOT ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article warns the public in general and newspapermen in particular about
                    John Bright, who pretended to have a letter of recommendation from Gov. Wise
                    about his abilities as a printer and who claimed, falsely, to have worked for
                    the Staunton Vindicator. He borrowed money from Wm. T. League &amp; Co. and
                    took off, never to be seen or heard from since. The article then describes
                him.<br>(Names in announcement:  John P. Bright, Gov.  Wise)</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Tom Marshall, our gentlemanly and efficient Constable, who is so very much given to nabbing 
                        others, came near being nabbed himself the other evening.-- He most incautiously invaded the 
                        "beat" of a black Bear, somewhere between this place and Greenville, and was only saved from his 
                        lethal embraces by the speed of his horse, which last, however, did not escape ignominious 
                        wounds on his rump.</p>
