                    <p>During the first part of the season the number of Visitors at the 
                        Springs promised to be small, but now the uninterrupted tide which flows 
                        westward daily, indicates that there will be an equally large, if not a 
                        larger number than usual. There are already at the White Sulphur about 
                        1500, at the Rockbridge Alum about 700 or 800.  The other watering 
                        places are equally well supplied.</p>
                    <p> Gov. White and Chief Justice Taney, fleeing from bustle and 
                        business, have retired to the Rockbridge Baths.</p> <p>There will be a

                    <p>On Saturday last Mr. Wm. A. Perrin, a resident of Staunton, was 
                        bitten by a rattle-snake at the Augusta Springs, from the effects of 
                        which he died the next day; though several physicians were in 
                        attendance, their skill could avail nothing.  The fangs of the venomous 
                        reptile had penetrated a blood vessel in the hand and the poison coursed 
                        with the speed of electricity through the system; in ten minutes after 
                        the fatal occurrence his feet commenced swelling, which made it evidence 
                        that the poson had already disseminated itself through the system. - 
                        Before death finished its work, the whole body had become discolored and 
                        enormously swollen.</p>
                    <p> The snake had been sent by some one residing in Highland to Mr. 
                        Perrin who was known to be in the habit of catching and caging them.  
                        Unfortunately, the fangs of this one had not been extracted, and the 
                        fatal blow was struck while Mr. Perrin was changing him from one cage to 
                        another.</p>

                    is too close to Black Republicanism.</summary>
