                    discontent by endorsing abolitionism. Despite these few conservatives, however,
                    the article argues that the South needs to prepare for the fact that most

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The West Augusta Guards of Staunton, who have been on duty at Charlestown for
                        the last ten days or two weeks, returned home on last Tuesday. They were met
                        at the cars by a large number of admiring friends, desirous of welcoming the
                        "returned soldiers." After parading Main street they proceeded to their
                        armory room, where was prepared for them by the citizens, a substantial
                        banquet, to which they paid their compliments as only men who have been fed
                        on crackers and middling for some time can. No one could have helped
                        noticing the immense improvement in the drill of the Guards since they have
                        been on duty. If no other good should result from the ordering of troops to
                        Charlestown than the improvement of our volunteer corps, this of itself
                        would be sufficient to justify the movement. All the members seemed to be in
                        the finest spirits, and although glad to get home, they, to a man, express
                        their entire readiness to perform any duty in defence of their State which
                        its Executiv! e may think necessary. </p>
