                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--In sending you the report of the meeting held at my place
                        on Sunday last, it is perhaps due to the persons present there to state,
                        that owing to the advice of certain judicious friends, I have suppressed
                        certain resolutions that were then and there passed, as they reflected
                        strongly on the deceased, but I will reserve them for future use, should it
                        be necessary. DANIEL DOWNEY.</p>
                    <p>At a meeting of the Catholics of Staunton, Augusta County, Va., held at the
                        house of the Rev. Daniel Downey, Sep. 11th, 1859, John B. Scherer, Esq.,
                        being called to the chair, and John Beck appointed secretary.</p>
                    <p> The Chairman having briefly explained the object of the meeting, Mr. Downey
                        then rose and said:</p>
                    <p> Mr. Chairman:--"The dangerous malady that I am subject to, is the sole cause
                        why I have delayed so long after my acquittal in Charlottesville to make the
                        due acknowledgments, and advert to the exciting subject of my grievances. As
                        my health is now partially restored, I wish to begin at home and lay my
                        complaints before you, the members of my late congregation, as you know the
                        whole matter, can give indisputable testimony, and act as you may deem
                        advisable. You talk now that I have received unmerited abuse, and bad
                        treatment from certain persons, who should rather have protected me and my
                        house from reproach, and who, after Mullin's death, did all in their power,
                        by crafty and false statements, to excite the public mind against me, and to
                        bring all the prejudices of a Protestant community to bear on me; but there
                        was too much honesty and love of truth among the Protestants to be long
                        deceived by such a lewd set. There are too many noble, fearless and liberal
                        minds in old Augusta County for falsehood to succeed in its evil designs
                        against innocence. I have many other matters to settle but they will be
                        brought before other audiences, perhaps before certain Tribunals."</p>
                    <p> Mr. Downey having concluded, the Chairman then read the following
                        Resolution, which after proper examination were passed unanimously:</p>
                    <p> Moved by H.D. Noon--Seconded by Wm. Whooley: That by the full, free, and
                        honorable acquittal of the Rev. Daniel Downey of the murder of Wm. Mullins,
                        by the unanimous verdict of a jury of Albemarle County, that county has
                        stamped an everlasting character of liberality, unbiased honesty and justice
                        on itself, has given a good name to the whole State of Virginia, to bigots
                        everywhere a valuable lesson, and proclaimed over the world that a Catholic
                        Priest, when upright and on the side of morality and injured innocence, need
                        not fear the Criminal Courts of old Virginia.</p>
                    <p> Moved by Robt. Knightly--Seconded by Thos. Hargan: That we view with deep
                        indignation the conduct of those base Catholics, who did all in their power
                        to excite the liberal portion of the community against Mr. Downey. We think
                        such persons should be shunned by all good Catholics of every class.</p>
                    <p>Moved by E. Roach--Seconded by M. Quinlan: That we admire the skill and
                        ability with which Robt. L. Doyle, Esq., Mr. Downey's Lawyer, conducted his
                        case from the time he took it in hand, and we give him our warmest thanks.</p>
                    <p> Moved by John Gear--Seconded by Thos. Barret: That the very honorable
                        acquittal of Mr. Downey, has been a source of unspeakable joy to us, and the
                        unblemished character that he maintained through the whole ordeal entitles
                        him to the admiration and profound respect of every pure minded virtuous
                        Catholic. Especially when we consider, that Mr. Downey sustained an
                        intensely severe prosecution from Gen. Harman, the Prosecuting Attorney, who
                        left no hole or corner unsearched for charges against Mr. Downey, yet this
                        same General Harman gave him an excellent character both here and in
                        Charlottesville, and actually defended him from some false charges that some
                        of Mullin's female friends wished to fix on him.</p>
                    <p> In view of these facts, and of many others too numerous to be now mentioned,
                        we are sorry and grieved to see that Mr. Downey is not exercising his
                        clerical functions as usual.</p>
                    <p> After the usual thanks to the Chairman the meeting adjourned.</p>

                <summary>Report of meeting of Catholics of Staunton, Virginia. Downey, a priest, had
                    been charged with murder in Albemarle County, but was acquitted. Seems to be the
                    feeling that the charges were trumped up because of anti-Catholicism, but that
                    people in Augusta County don't feel this opposition to Catholics. The meeting
                    included a series of motions praising Downey and his lawyers.</summary>

                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--"Have we a Bourbon among us?" is, I believe, no longer a
                        mooted question; but have we a police officer among us? is a question which
                        will, perhaps, admit of some debate. It is, however, one that many of our
                        citizens do not hesitate to take the negative side. The writer of this
                        remembers to have heard last spring that an officer was elected whose duty
                        it was to preserve the peace of the town, but he thinks there must have been
                        a mistake about it. The quiet, orderly citizens of our town are frequently
                        aroused from their slumbers at a late hour of the night by the noise of
                        drunken rowdies in the streets. Now it is reasonable to suppose that had we
                        a Police Officer among us, this thing would not occur quite so often; for
                        certainly such an officer would be aroused himself sometimes by the noise,
                        and would as a matter of course jump up and be out in time to arrest some of
                        these disturbers of the peace, and bring them to punishment. Were this the
                        case the slumbers of our citizens would not be quite so often disturbed in
                        the manner they were on a recent Friday night. With the foregoing view of
                        this important question, I for one take the NEGATIVE.</p>
