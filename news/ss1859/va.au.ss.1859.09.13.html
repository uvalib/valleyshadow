<b>For the Spectator; Thoughts on the Renewal of the African Slave Trade</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Essay opposing reopening the African slave trade, as it is just a plot to
                    split the Union. Blames non-slaveholders who wish to acquire slaves cheaply.
                    Wants Virginia to oppose it. Draws analogy between Slave Trade agitators and
                    Black Republicans as both wanting disunion.<br>

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>(on page 2) "We publish on the first page of this paper the first part
                    of a communication on the African slave trade, written by a gentleman of another
                    county. The writer, although never an active politician, has always sustained
                    the Democratic party. The conclusion will appear next week"<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font><p>It is a frightful 
                    sign of our times if we consider the carelessness with which we behold 
                    crime, and calmly listen to palliations adduced by those who openly 
                    favor its commission.  It has often been observed that the eve of great 
                    revolutions has been marked by such a state of public and private 
                    morality as exists among us now.  We have not for a good many years 
                    called things by their right names.  The vilest demagoguery has now 
                    assumed the name of patriotism, the evasion of a just debt by a 
                    sovereign State, or swartwouting in private life, is merely a specimen 
                    of financiering and murder in the open streets is merely an unfortunate 
                    recontre--but it has been reserved for the last five years to attempt to 
                    revive a piratical traffic which has received the united execration of 
                    the world, and to endeavor to justify it upon political, moral, and even 
                    religious grounds.</p>
                    
                    <p> The agitators of the reopening of the African Slave 
                        Trade allege that they are moved solely by the consideration of  
                        Southern interests.--They tell us that they are the only party which is 
                        true to the South.  They have held Conventions, set up newspapers, and 
                        pressed their views upon the people in season and out of season--upon 
                        Virginia always out of season.</p>
                    
                    <p> Does a man of these most earnest 
                        advocates expect to land a single negro in the United States legally?  
                        Not a bit of it--they all know that the Union will never allow the Trade 
                        to be reopened.  They therefore intend to persevere in their scheme, in 
                        order to split the Union as soon as they can.</p>
                    <p> The advocates of the Trade 
                        are for the most part those who cannot get place and political 
                        distinction in our Union--so they hope to succeed in a Southern 
                        Confederacy. Accordingly we find that the most distinguished among them 
                        have been young men in search of notoriety, or second and third rate 
                        politicians, who could not  upon any lawful issue obtain political 
                        distinction even in their own States.  Yet these men have produced some 
                        effect.  Already do we find that a class of politicians of much 
                        higher caliber are beginning to advocate the views of their 
                        inferiors to a greater or less extent.  The cause is evident; they are 
                        afraid of the small fry getting the start of them; for already has the 
                        agitation produced a very great effect in certain quarters.  More higher 
                        class politicians will be drawn in after a while, for the agitators 
                        below them have everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to 
                        excite the public mind.</p>
                    <p> It was said in the last Southern Convention that 
                        the non-slave holders in the Cotton States are to the slave-holders as 
                        two to one.  This is the secret of the strength of this party.  All 
                        these non-slave holders wish to own negroes as well as their neighbors.  
                        They can never give $1500 for an able-bodied field-hand; so they wish to 
                        put down the price by the importation of savages from Africa.  If the 
                        trade be re-opened on  a large scale, the slave-traders assure us that a 
                        wild negro will be worth only $150 just one tenth of what they would 
                        have to give now for a field hand.  With such a tempting bait as this 
                        reduction of price is it to be wondered at that already the reopening of 
                        this commerce is so popular?  One thing is certain--the agitators have a 
                        party sufficiently large to command great influence.  It is said that 
                        they are very powerful in South Carolina and Mississippi, and strong 
                        enough to control the politics of Georgia.  We shall, it is to be 
                        feared, have great trouble with this faction.  As Conspirators against 
                        the Union know that they have not yet the majority of the South, nor can 
                        ever obtain it by legitimate arguments, they have with great craft 
                        endeavored to form a new test of devotion to the South--this test is 
                        their Slave Trade.--Unless a man gives into their views, they assume him 
                        to be "unsound" on the slavery question, and affect to rank him with 
                        Seward and Giddings.  This impudent assumption has had its effect.  Many 
                        a man has had the cry of abolitionists successfully raised upon him 
                        simply because he in his judgment has advocated a more conservative 
                        course than is profitable to the demagogues of the day.  It is 
                        reserved for our times to hear that the State of Virginia is censured on 
                        the question of slavery, because forsooth she does not wish again to see 
                        the floodgates of African barbarism let loose upon us.</p>
                    <p> We live in an age 
                        of wonders, and we should be astonished at nothing within the range of 
                        possibility; but we should be astounded indeed if any arguments based 
                        upon political reasons, or any others should induce Virginia ever to 
                        consent to the reopening of the African Slave Trade-- we may as well 
                        expect the sky to fall or her everlasting mountains to be cast into the 
                        Atlantic.</p>
                    <p> Virginia has still some respect left for the ten Commandments. 
                        One of them is "Thou shalt do no murder."  It is a known fact that for 
                        every negro imported in the slave ships, ten are slaughtered in Africa, 
                        or die of disease in the "Middle Passage."  She has always abhorred this 
                        infernal commerce.  Protest after protest against it did our noble old 
                        colony send over to the Crown of England, all of which were treated 
                        with contempt, and at last we risked our all in the cause of the 
                        Revolution, our  greatest grievance being this abominable trade.  
                        Virginia has not changed her views on this subject, and never can.  What 
                        was murder a hundred years ago we look upon as murder still, and no 
                        appeals of ambitious demagogues in other States can make us think 
                        otherwise.  So even in a moral point of view--little as morality is 
                        regarded now-a-days-- there is no chance of the disunionists to occupy 
                        an inch of ground in the glorious Old Dominion; she is not to be 
                        "bluffed off" by charges of "unsoundness" on the Slavery Question.   She 
                        despises such charges, which come with a bad grace from those who in 
                        their Report on the Slave Trade to a late Southern Convention speak 
                        respectfully of but one part in the Union, viz: the Black 
                        Republicans--utterly repudiating any consideration for the Democratic or 
                        American parties, and treating them as packs of wolves dressed in 
                        sheep's clothing, so as more effectually to deceive and devour the
                        
                        South.--Accordingly they empty the vials of their wrath upon them; for 
                        both these parties profess to be devoted to the Union, in which "these 
                        small flies cannot be heard to buzz."</p>
                    <p> Both the Slave Trade faction and 
                        the Black Republicans play into each other's hands, and both are working 
                        with all their might for one object, viz: disunion.</p>
                    <p> It is very strongly 
                        suspected that Black Republican leaders are secretly engaged in fitting 
                        out the great number of vessels now in northern ports known to be 
                        destined to land Africans on the Florida coast.  It is not to be 
                        supposed that those who will be on the shore to await the landing of the 
                        human cargo will be ignorant as to who procured it.</p>
                    <p> These "ventures in 
                        Ebony" serve a double purpose; they put money into the pockets of the 
                        Black Republicans, and at the same time they serve to excite the 
                        northern sentiment yet more violently against the south and her 
                        institutions.  There will be crimination and re-crimination, which the 
                        slave trade men hope will band together the whole South against the 
                        whole North, and bring about disunion.  They then expect to float into 
                        power upon a fragment of the wreck of our present happy country.</p>
                    <p> All sorts of arguments are urged to advance this project for the destruction 
                        of our Government.  The first and most effectual is that the 
                        non-slave-holders ought to have a source whence they may procure slave 
                        labor which they cannot obtain at present prices.  By this argument they 
                        hope to make disunionists of the non-slave-holders of the South, the 
                        small slave-holders, and those of the larger slave-holders who in their 
                        greed for wealth wish to own more slaves than they now have.</p>
                    <p> They also assert that the political status of those now owning slaves will be more 
                        secure as they declare that the non-slave-holders in the mass cannot be 
                        true to our institutions, and therefore that all who are interested in 
                        the preservation of slavery should support the views of these new 
                        preachers of political economy.</p>
                    <p> They also attempt to influence the 
                        Union men of the  South by telling them that if cheap slaves could be 
                        introduced, the unsettled Territories can be secured to the South, and 
                        that thus by the reopening of the Trade the balance of power may be 
                        restored, and that thus only the Union can be preserved.</p>
                    <p> These men know well enough, all the same, that the Trade can never be introduced in our 
                        Union, but they hope that this foolish argument may stop the opposition 
                        of some weak-minded union men and secure them to their cause.</p>
                    <p> They also boldly assert that the prohibition of the traffic is unconstitutional.  
                        This position supposes that the people are such asses as not to know 
                        where to find the first clause of the ninth section of the first article 
                        of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p> But the queerest argument used by this faction is 
                        that which is based upon religion. They say the only way to christianize 
                        Africans is to enslave them.</p>
                    <p> We almost despair of introducing in the 
                        Eastern mind of the negro proper conceptions of our holy religion; but, 
                        admitting this to be possible, the people of Virginia will never 
                        consent to the doctrine that it is christianity to butcher ten men that 
                        one may be the recipient of religious instruction.</p>
