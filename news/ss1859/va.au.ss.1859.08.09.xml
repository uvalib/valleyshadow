                <summary>Spectator is responding to an article in the Vindicator that painted the
                    opposition as a party of "Whigs, Americans Free Soilers, Free Niggers etc." The
                    paper takes issue with the last category. It also discusses good Northern men
                    who refuse to interfere with slavery in the South, even though they oppose it.
                    Raises the specter of Black Republicanism.</summary>

                <transcript><p>Messrs. Editors.--I was at the Presbyterian 
                    Church on last Saturday, and was pleased to see it so neatly carpeted; 
                    but the question occurred to me, how can that neatness be preserved in a 
                    Church where so many tobacco chewers attend, and chew tobacco all the 
                    time? I wonder if gentlemen cannot be induced to forbear the use of the 
                    "weed" for about one hour and a half.  I believe it is not considered 
                    genteel to chew tobacco in private parlors and spit over the carpets; if 
                    so, it must be looked upon as far from genteel to spit tobacco juice 
                    over the floor or carpet of the House of God.</p>
