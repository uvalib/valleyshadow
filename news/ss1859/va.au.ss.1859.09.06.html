<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator responds to the Vindicator, which condemned it for publishing
                    the August 2 letter by "Conservator." The Spectator claims that the Vindicator
                    misunderstood the letter. The article invokes freedom of the press and freedom
                    of expression. The Spectator also links the conflict to the place of the
                    Methodist church in local society and its ties to the paper.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Vindicator thinks we erred in admitting into our paper the 
                    communication which appeared on the 2nd of August, over the signature of 
                    "Conservator," on the subject of Camp-Meetings.  Our position is that we 
                    did right in publishing the piece, and that we could not have refused to 
                    publish it without a failure of editorial duty.  Our convictions on the 
                    subject are so clear and decided that it seems to us we cannot fail to 
                    satisfy any impartial person of the propriety of our course.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Vindicator's remarks are based upon what we conceive to be a 
                        misconception of "Conservator's" piece.  That writer did not charge 
                        that the Methodist Episcopal Church or any of its members were guilty of 
                        the various disorders or improprieties which he alleged were attendant 
                        upon Camp-Meetings.  As we understood him at first, and still understand 
                        him after a fresh perusal of his communication, he, as we certainly do, 
                        believes that the members of the Church interested in the Camp-Meeting 
                        desired and intended only to do good; but he alleged that owing to 
                        the assemblage of disreputable people at such meetings, over whom the 
                        managers had no control and of whom they would gladly get rid or turn 
                        from their vicious courses if they could, certain evils resulted, and 
                        that thus more harm than good ensued. This we understand to be the 
                        spirit of the piece, without quoting its language.  We knew nothing 
                        about the facts of the case, but for these the writer was responsible.  
                        If he misrepresented the matter, it could easily be shown, and no harm 
                        be done to any individual.  Now the question is, should we have 
                        published the piece?  It related to a matter of public interest.  The 
                        writer, so far as we knew, was instigated by no malice or ill-will 
                        towards the Methodist Church or any of its members, and only sought to 
                        promote the welfare of the community at large.  The mode he selected for 
                        calling attention to the subject, in order to dissuade from the holding 
                        of the meeting, was the one which he regarded as the most efficient.  
                        Under these circumstances, we did not feel at liberty to refuse 
                        publication, and if we had done so we would, in our opinion, have been 
                        justly chargeable with muzzling the press and denying the freedom of 
                        discussion upon matters of public and general interest.  A few days ago 
                        the venerable National Intelligencer felt called upon to publish an 
                        editorial article upon Camp-Meetings in Virginia, expressing the opinion 
                        that unless they could be protected by legal enactments from the 
                        disorderly persons who frequent them, they ought to be put a stop to 
                        altogether in every infected district.  No less than three of our 
                        exchanges in one day published the substance of this article.--Does any 
                        one charge that the Intelligencer or the other newspapers alluded to 
                        have assailed the Methodist Church?  We have heard no such complaint, 
                        and presume it will not be made,--Much less can we be justly censured 
                        for merely allowing a correspondent to be heard through our columns.  We 
                        have the satisfaction of knowing that our course is sustained by many 
                        members of the Methodist Church, some of them having volunteered to tell 
                        us so.  And we may mention that the very number of the Spectator which 
                        contained Mr. Tebbs' fulmination, contained also a communication from 
                        another Minister of the Methodist Church, in which the writer alluded to 
                        the paper in kind and complimentary terms.</p>
                    
                    <p> But our friend of the 
                        Vindicator thinks that an editor "is bound, before he admits whole sale 
                        accusation into his columns, to be satisfied, personally, of its truth." 
                        Let us illustrate.  Last week we published a communication signed 
                        "Justice," in which a large number of tax-payers generally, and the 
                        Commissioners of the Revenue particularly, were taken to task.  The 
                        writer stated that many tax-payers did not give in the whole of their 
                        taxable property, and that the Commissioners were delinquent in not 
                        putting every man to his oath.  Now what shall be done in this case?  
                        The Commissioners are highly esteemed by us as personal friends.  It 
                        will be very unpleasant to them to see this piece in the paper.  
                        Moreover, we do not know that these statements are true.  The writer, to 
                        be sure, is a man of veracity, who would not intentionally state a 
                        falsehood or do any one wilful injury; but still it will be disagreeable 
                        to our friends, the Commissioners, and therefore, we refuse to publish.  
                        What would every man in the community have thought of us if we had 
                        pursued such a course?  The Vindicator surely will not say that it was 
                        our duty before publishing to examine the Commissioner's Books and 
                        travel about the county to ascertain for ourselves that the allegations 
                        of the writer were true!  Upon precisely similar grounds we justify the 
                        publication of the piece signed "Conservator."  In the one case there 
                        were two persons who might possibly feel aggrieved, in the other more 
                        than that number.--This seems to us the only difference.</p>
                    
                    <p> In regard to the delectable communication signed "Parnassus," we have but little to 
                        say.--There is a littleness about the whole article well calculated 
                        to excite the most profound commiseration.  The Rev. Mr. Tebbs, in the 
                        letter which he saw fit to address to us, took occasion to allude to the 
                        patronage bestowed upon the Spectator by the members of the Methodist 
                        Church, and now we have this anonymous writer expressing his 
                        unwillingness "to assist any sheet which is filled with such 
                        contemptible slurs against a form of worship which is identified with 
                        one particular denomination," and declaring without a blush, this is 
                        what he "means by holding the editor responsible."  And in another part 
                        of his article he again presents for our reflection the sordid 
                        consideration that "they [the Methodists] may learn where to bestow 
                        their patronage."  Now, we have only to tell this writer that we have 
                        never asked him to assist our paper, and have but little doubt that he 
                        would gladly damage its interests to any extent in his power.  He much 
                        mistakes the editors of the paper if he supposes that they are governed 
                        in their course by any such paltry consideration as that which seems 
                        to be held in the highest estimation by himself; and we should deem 
                        ourselves as despicable as we deem his pitiful threats, if we should 
                        swerve one hair's breadth from what we conceive to be the path of duty 
                        to secure the permanent patronage of every man in the county.  We hope 
                        the high-minded correspondent of the Vindicator understands us--be he 
                        layman, or clergyman, or politician.  He tells us to beware how we 
                        trifle with Methodist Camp-Meetings and Methodist preachers.  Let such 
                        Methodists as he beware how they trifle with us. We have repeatedly 
                        disclaimed any design on our part to reflect upon the Methodist Church, 
                        or its preachers, or its meetings, and if any of them are so 
                        unreasonable as not to be satisfied, let them make the most of it; and 
                        "Parnassus" and his sympathizers may begin at once the chivalrous job of 
                        taking as much as they can from our pockets.  The Reverend gentlemen 
                        certainly commend themselves to an intelligent and liberal community, by 
                        preaching in one breath that gospel which inculcates the most enlarge 
                        charity, and advising in the next a venomous crusade against their 
                        fellow men.</p>
