<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses controversy over whether or not to hold a Democratic nominating

<b>Fire</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A bad fire occurred in town, although damage was contained by the "Fire
                    Association." Article is helpful for locating property in town, since it
                    describes the relationships between people's houses, stables, and other
                    property. Article also expresses fear that the large number of recent fires
                    indicates "incendiaries in our midst."<br>(Names in announcement: Mrs.  Warden, Dr.  Waddell,  L. Waddell,  Thomas Shumate, Mr.  Bell, Mr.  Scherer)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday 
                    night last between eleven and twelve o'clock the large barn on Mrs. 
                    Warden's lot, immediately in the rear of the residence of L. Waddell, 
                    jr., was consumed by fire.  The building contained about a ton of Hay, 
                    and a valuable Cow perished in the flames.  The new stable on Dr. 
                    Waddell's lot and the building occupied as a school-room on the lot of 
                    L. Waddell, jr., both situated within ten steps of the burning building, 
                    were in great danger, the roof of the latter being on fire in several 
                    places before the firemen arrived.  By their exertions, however, it was 
                    saved, for which the owner desires to return his sincere thanks to the 
                    members of the Association.  The wind was blowing briskly at the time, 
                    and large flakes of burning matter were carried to the distance of 
                    several squares, igniting the roofs of several houses.  We understand 
                    that the small frame building adjoining the residence of Mrs. Warden was 
                    on fire, as was also the case with Mr. Thomas Shumate's house and Mr. 
                    Bell's stable, and even Mr. Scherer's house beyond the Presbyterian 
                    Church.--The frequent burning of old stables and other buildings within 
                    the last twelve months, indicates that there are incendiaries in our 
                    midst, and it would be well if some measure could be adopted to ferret 
                    them out.  At the same time let our citizens and the town authorities 
                    lend every encouragement to the Fire Association--the best insurance 
                    Company that any property owner can have.</p>
