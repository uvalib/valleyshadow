                    <p>Rumors reached this place last night, about 8 o clock, by telegraph, of 
                    a negro insurrection at Harper's Ferry.  The dispatch was from the 
                    operator at Richmond, and stated that the negroes, under the lead of 
                    white men, had taken possession of the arsenal, and sent wagon loads of 
                    muskets and rifles to slaves in the surrounding country, and that large 
                    numbers had been killed.--They had cut and destroyed the telegraph 
                    wires.  It is further stated that Gov. Wise had left Richmond with 
                    several miliary companies, and that two companies from Washington with 
                    three twelve pounders had gone from that city with orders to take the 
                    bridge at all hazards by midnight.  Troops from Old Point Comfort had 
                    also been ordered out, and companies from Baltimore had also repaired to 
                    Harper's Ferry.  The payhouse is said to have been robbed of a large sum 
                    of money.</p>
                    <p> These rumors may be exaggerated in some particulars, but there 
                        seems to be no doubt, from what we learn of Mr. Baskin, the operator at 
                        this place, of the fact of the insurrection. We think it probable, 
                        however, that a rebellion among the white operatives at the Armory has 
                        been mistaken for slave insurrection; though it is probable that some 
                        negroes may have been induced to join them.</p></transcript>

                <transcript>
                    <p> A correspondent from Waynesboro writes us during the past few days, that
                        very serious casualties have occurred in that community. A son of Spotswood
                        Harrington, fell from a Hickory tree into which he had climbed to gather its
                        fruit, a distance perhaps of 30 feet.--He came down head foremost, throwing
                        out his hands to protect himself, the whole force of the fall was received
                        upon the arms, the right wrist crushed, the bone protruding through the
                        flesh, entered the ground from one to two inches; the other wrist was broken
                        or badly dislocated. The face of the little sufferer, (for he was under 12
                        years old,) was much bruised, and the concussion being of course great,
                        affected him generally. Drs. Waddell and King were soon on the ground,
                        rendering the needed assistance, and the boy is doing as well as could be
                        hoped for.</p>
                    <p> Another--Young James Bush, son of Mr. John Bush, whilst in the act of
                        sending up a bucket of stone and earth from the bottom of a well, which he
                        was digging f! or J. B. Smith of Waynesboro, was surprised somewhat, by the
                        return of bucket and contents on his head and shoulders, a distance of 25 to
                        30 feet, the bucket weighing near one hundred pounds. Death was supposed to
                        be the consequences, but not so; Bush was terribly bruised but is getting
                        well.</p>
                    <p> Another case of well doing which occurred in our village some time since,
                        perished for want of a chronicler. It fell out on this wise: Mr. L. Shaw
                        abandoned a well he was digging, after obtaining a depth of 60 feet--the
                        mouth of the well was covered with loose thin plank, barely sufficient to
                        support a man. Mr. David Bush's horses had escaped the enclosure and were
                        playing in the vicinity of the well; two of them, large, able-bodied and fat
                        fellows, leaped together upon the plank crossing the wells mouth, which gave
                        way, and together they descended to it dismal depths. Reader, you will say
                        they were instantly crushed to death--not a bit of it--by the skillful
                        management of stalwart men, and by means of ropes and pulleys, they were
                        brought to light and life, and marvelous to say, very little injured.</p>
