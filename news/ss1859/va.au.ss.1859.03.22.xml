                <head>For the Spectator; Behavior in Church</head>
                <origin/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript><p>There are some points in reference to behavior at Church 
                    to which I wish, respectfully, to call attention.  The first relates to 
                    the ladies.  Why is it that many ladies have such a fondness for sitting 
                    at the end of pews next the aisle?.  They take their seats just by the 
                    door, and compel everybody else who comes in to climb over them.  If the 
                    first one who enters a pew would sit at the further end of it, and the 
                    others range themselves in order close together, the convenience of all 
                    would be promoted.</p>
                    <p>The next two points relate to the gentlemen.  
                        Why is it that young men and boys have such a fondness for standing 
                        about Church doors before and after service?  Some of the seniors too, 
                        who ought to set a better example, occasionally do the same thing.  The 
                        practice is irreverent, unsuited to the character of the place, 
                        exceedingly unpleasant to the ladies of refinement, and, therefore, a 
                        breach of good manners. Lastly, why will tobacco chewers defile the 
                        floors of churches and soil the skirts of ladies' dresses in the manner 
                        they do?  If gentlemen cannot dispense with the use of tobacco for an 
                        hour or two while in Church, they certainly ought to provide themselves 
                        with spittoons.--They should have some regard for the sexton, who has to 
                        clean up after them, and for the comfort of other persons.  No one could 
                        behave so in a private house without being asked out, and why should 
                        greater liberties be taken at Church, where more people are annoyed and 
                        more trouble given?</p></transcript>
