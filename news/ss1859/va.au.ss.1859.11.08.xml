                <transcript><p>The 
                    trial of Capt. Brown at Charlestown has resulted as everybody 
                    anticipated it would, and the prisoner has been sentenced to be hung on 
                    the 2nd of December.  It is probable, however, that the case will be 
                    taken up to the Court of Appeals on a point of law, and if the objection 
                    is sustained a new trial will be ordered.  We, for one, shall not regret 
                    any delay in the execution of the sentence which the laws authorized, as 
                    we wish the country to see that the State of Virginia is acting calmly 
                    and deliberately, and not under the influence of passion or alarm.  So 
                    far, the proceedings have been conducted in admirable style, and Judge 
                    Parker is commended on all hands for his dignity and impartiality.  We 
                    are glad that even the whims of the prisoner have been treated with the 
                    utmost forebearance.  The State guarantees a fair trial to every man 
                    accused of crime, and that Brown had one he is obliged himself to 
                    confess, notwithstanding his complaints at the outset.  In his address 
                    to the Court, when called upon as usual to say why sentence should 
                    not be pronounced, he remarked:  "I feel entirely satisfied with the 
                    treatment I have received at my trial.  Considering all the 
                    circumstances, it has been more generous than I expected."</p>
                    <p> The prisoner 
                        complained, however, of his sentences, because he was convicted of 
                        capital offenses--treason, murder and conspiracy with negroes--when he 
                        only intended peacefully to run off slaves; and if lives were sacrificed 
                        it was the fault of those who interfered with him! Such an apology is, 
                        of course, very absurd, but why did Brown provide so many rifles and 
                        pikes if he did not contemplate violence and bloodshed?  He was, no 
                        doubt, deceived in reference to the assistance which he expected, both 
                        from the free and slave States.  He calculated upon large accessions to 
                        his force from the North, as Cook admits, and the fact that, after all 
                        his preparations for months beforehand, he could muster only seventeen 
                        white men and five negroes, goes far to prove that the number of such 
                        fanatics,is very small.  He also, according to his own statement, 
                        expected assistance from Maryland, Virginia, and other slave States.  
                        Upon what this expectation was founded does not appear.--It may be that 
                        he had read in the newspapers the charges of abolitionism, or 
                        unsoundness upon the slavery question, preferred against each other by 
                        the two political parties, and that these criminations and re- 
                        criminations, which are well understood here, really induced him to 
                        believe that hundreds of white men in the slave States were prepared to 
                        join his standard.--Whether this be so or not, it is high time that the 
                        sort of party warfare alluded to were discontinued.  It is certainly 
                        calculated to do great injury, by giving aid and comfort to outside 
                        fanaticism.</p>

                <transcript><p>A letter from Charlestown reports Cook as saying that 
                    the Harper's Ferry enterprise only failed through the cowardice of the 
                    negro abolitionists Fred Douglass. That individual was to have arrived 
                    at the schoolhouse with a large band early on Monday, but Cook says, "I 
                    conveyed the arms there for him, and waited till nearly night, but the 
                    coward didn't come."</p>
                    <p> Fred replies to the charge of cowardice, in a 
                        letter dated Canada West, Oct. 31. He says:-- "I have always been more 
                        distinguished for running than fighting--and tried by the Harper's Ferry 
                        insurrection test, I am most miserably deficient in courage--even more 
                        so than Cook when he deserted his brave old Captain and fled to the 
                        mountains. To this extent, Mr. Cook is entirely right, and will meet no 
                        contradiction from me or from anybody else. But wholly, grievously and 
                        unaccountably wrong is Mr. Cook when he asserts that I promised to be 
                        present in person at the Harper's Ferry insurrection.--I may have been 
                        guilty, I have never made a promise so rash and wild as this. The 
                        taking of Harper's Ferry was a measure never encouraged by my word or by 
                        my votes, at any time or place; my wisdom or my cowardice, has not only 
                        kept me from Harper's Ferry's, but has equally kept me from making any 
                        promise to go there." The time has not come, he says, for him to make a 
                        full statement of what he knows about the affair. He has no apology for 
                        keeping out of the way of United States Marshals at this time. If he has 
                        committed any offence it was done in New York, and he is willing to be 
                        tried there; but he has "insuperable objections to be caught by the 
                        hands of Mr. Buchanan, and "bagged by Gov. Wise."</p></transcript>

                <transcript><p>Mrs. Lydia Child, the philanthropic and popular writer, is 
                    presumed to be the lady referred to by the Herald's Richmond 
                    correspondent in the following passage, dated October 28th:</p><p> "A letter 
                        was received from a Boston lady asking the Governor's permission to go 
                        to Charlestown to nurse old Brown, and pledging her honor, while she was 
                        a strong abolitionist, that she would take no improper advantage of the 
                        privilege. The letter contained a note addressed to Brown himself, which 
                        she requested the Governor to forward to him after he had read it. Both 
                        were unquestionably the best production I have ever seen from the pen of 
                        a woman and woman-like, they breathed all the sentiments of sympathy, 
                        kindness and affection that martyrdom in a holier cause might be 
                        supposed to elicit.--She avowed herself frankly a thorough abolitionist, 
                        while disapproving the means resorted to by Brown to accomplish the ends 
                        sought for. One thing was apparent from these productions, and that was 
                        she truly sincere in her opinions; and the Governor could not help 
                        expressing regret that so accomplished a person should suffer under such 
                        an illusion as seemed to have possessed her. He will grant her 
                        permission, and guaranty her perfect immunity from any violence or 
                        indignity in the State. But as to the privilege of acting nurse to 
                        Brown, that is a matter in the discretion of his physician at 
                        Charlestown, and he may admit or exclude her at will. The presumption 
                        is, however, that she will have entire liberty to exercise her humane 
                        office in behalf of that `brave veteran,' as she designated old 
                        Brown."</p></transcript>
