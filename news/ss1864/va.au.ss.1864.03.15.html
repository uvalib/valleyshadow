<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In several issues of the "Rockingham Register," the Editors stated that they
                        had been informed that there were some of the members of these churches, the
                        members of which are exempt in consequences of religious faith and the
                        payment of five hundred dollars, who did not intend to raise any more
                        produce than would be necessary for their own families. We were astonished
                        at the statement, and thought that there must be some mistake about it, and
                        are pleased to learn from the last issue of the "Register" that our
                        confidence in the loyalty of that class of citizens was not misplaced. Those
                        who will do all they can to raise supplies will perform as efficient service
                        as if they were in the field, for it is necessary to plant corn as to plant
                        batteries, and as necessary to reap wheat as to reap victories. The enemy is
                        now making war upon our means of sustenance, and every one is efficiently
                        defending his country who is engaged in increasing the supplies of
                        subsistence. The "Home Soldier" wields the peaceful implements--the plough,
                        the shovel, the hoe--whilst the soldier in the battle's front uses the gun,
                        the sabre, the bayonet--the former laboring to save, whilst the latter
                        strives to destroy life; yet both are using means for the accomplishment of
                        the same end--Liberty and Independence. The soldiers in arms will do their
                        duty and we hope those at home will do theirs also. We are pleased to hear
                        that more ground than usual has been already ploughed, and that the prospect
                        for planting a large crop of corn is very flattering.</p>

<b>Negro Genius</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the creation of a wooden steam engine by Bob, a slave of Mrs.
                    Margaret A. Crawford. The author says that this indicates "genius" on Bob's part
                    and he argues that Bob should be given work in a machine shop.<br>(Names in announcement: Mrs. Margaret Crawford,  Bob , Mr. William B. Kayser)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some time since, a colored boy, "Bob," 15 years of age, the property of Mrs.
                        Margaret A. Crawford, went to the depot where the Engine, "H. D. Whitcomb,"
                        was standing. A gentleman observing that he seemed interested in the engine,
                        asked him what he thought of it. He replied, "pretty big work, Master, but I
                        think I can make one like it." The gentleman addressed laughed at what he
                        conceived to be the absurdity of the negro boy's presumption. The boy went
                        home with his mind full of the project of vindicating the truth of his
                        assertion, and, sure enough, with no tools but an axe, hammer, saw, knife
                        and gimblet, he made in wood an exact counterpart of the Engine, complete in
                        all its parts. This model can be seen at the Law office of Mr. Wm. B. Kayser
                        of this place, where it has excited the admiration and wonder of all
                        beholders. They all agree that "Bob" must be a boy of remarkable mechanical
                        genius. Such genius should be cultivated, and "Bob" ought to be placed in
                        some good machine shop where his genius can be made serviceable to the
                        country. "Bob" would be as happy in a machine shop, as a "common nigger"
                        would be at a dance or "shucking."</p>
