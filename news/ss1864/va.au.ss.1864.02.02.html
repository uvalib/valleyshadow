<b>Strange Sentiments</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the Richmond Enquirer for supporting the suspension of the writ
                    of Habeas Corpus.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our last issue, we noticed the fact that the Richmond "ENQUIRER" not only
                        advocated the policy of suspending the writ of Habeas
                            Corpus but denounced it as the "criminal's writ." It seems from
                        an article published a few days after, that the "Enquirer" is not only in
                        favor of suspending the writ of Habeas Corpus,
                        but also of "tearing up the Constitution as waste paper." The following are
                        extracts from an editorial article in the "Enquirer" of January the 25th: </p>
                    <p>"In common with the people, we would sacrifice every right of person and of
                        property, submit to the unrestricted use of any and every power, that can
                        contribute to the overthrow of the enemy. The success of the cause is
                        embarrassed by the trammels of a Constitution designed and constructed for
                        the development of a people in times of peace, but which fetters the public
                        arm in the present conflict of life and death. Nations, like athletes, must
                        strip for the fight. The earnestness of the enemy, as well as their
                        resolution, is exemplified in the manner in which they broke the fetters of
                        their Constitution, and rushed to the conflict with limbs free from clogs of
                        every kind. But in this conflict with a giant, the Confederacy often finds
                        its hands tied by its own Constitution.</p>
                    <p>This tender regard for the constitution is very much like Mr. Pickwick in the
                        Fleet--"on principle." But it won't drive back the enemy, and won't feed the
                        army; it aids bad men in harboring desserters [sic], and protect traitors
                        who won't plant, because the Confederate Government don't pay as much as the
                        speculator. Speaking only for ourselves but firmly believing we represent
                        the people, we boldly avow that we would tear up the Constitution as waste
                        paper, rather than suffer it to impede the public defence, or embarrass the
                        Government in the conflict for Independence.</p>
                    <p>In noticing the strange and startling sentiments expressed by the "Enquirer,"
                        the Petersburg "Express" inquires, "who would have thought three years, or
                        two years, or one year ago, that any respectable Southern journal would come
                        out and boldly propose to set aside the Constitution which the President and every officer of the government has solemnly
                            sworn to support because "the success of the cause is embarrassed
                        by its trammels?" Who would have dreamed that such a journal would have held
                        up as worthy of imitation by our government the example of the Yankee
                        Administration in breaking the fetters of their cons[t]itution that they
                        might rush to the conflict with limbs free from clogs of every kind?" That
                        it would ridicule "a tender regard for the constitution" as Pickwickian
                        foolishness! And that, finally, speaking for itself, with the belief that in
                        so speaking it was representing the people, it
                        would "tear up the Constitution as waste paper rather than impede the public
                        defence, or embarrass the government in the conflict for independence!" </p>
                    <p>The Constitution, it seems, was intended only to dispense its benefits in
                        times of peace! This, to say the least of it, is a strange idea. There is
                        nothing in the instrument itself that by the remotest &amp; most
                        arbitrary construction can be interpreted into such an intention, and
                        certainly there is everything in the circumstances under which it was framed
                        and adopted to indicate that it was designed to operate as well in times of
                        war as in times of peace, for the country was on the very brink of war when
                        it was framed and accepted as was well known at the time to its framers.
                        When the Permanent Government was organized, of which the Constitution is
                        the life and soul, the country was in the very midst of a war, which had
                        already been waged on a gigantic scale for more than six months, and yet
                        nothing was then said or thought about its being designed only for peaceful developments. The truth is, the
                        Constitution and the Government (not the Administration of the Government) are synonymous things, if not
                        terms, because the last is organized upon the platform of the first and
                        derives from it all its vitality. There is not a power that it possesses
                        that is not granted by the Constitution. The whole orbit in which it moves,
                        and the movements themselves, are ordained and regulated by the
                        Constitution, and the moment this connection between them ceases, the
                        government, such as it now is, dies. </p>
                    <p>We do not--we cannot think that the people of the Confederate States are
                        prepared as yet to give themselves up to the embraces of absolutism. They
                        can conquer the enemy without the shadow of a necessity for resorting to
                        this prodigious sacrifice. They can triumphantly bear themselves through the
                        struggle, and preserve at the same time the Constitution, which is the
                        charter of their rights."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every man has his work to perform in carrying on the war. The farmer, the
                        manufacturer, the mechanic, the editor, and numbers of others, if they
                        faithfully discharge their duty, can render a far more valuable service to
                        the army and country at home than they can with muskets on their shoulders
                        in the field. In fact, it were impossible to conduct the war at all if a
                        sufficient number of these, especially farmers, are not left at home to
                        provide for the wants of the army. Bread and meat are to be made, clothing
                        and other supplies of the army are to be manufactured, intelligence to be
                        disseminated, the spirit of the people to be kept up and made equal to the
                        necessities of the time, and their liberties guarded against
                        encroachment--all this can be done only by those who remain at home, and
                        they constitute as indispensable a class in time of war as the soldiers
                        themselves.</p>
