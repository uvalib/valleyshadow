<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The good people of this county will be greatly astonished, as we were, to
                        learn from the communication published in this issue, of Brig. Gen'l J.A.
                        Walker, commanding the "Stonewall Brigade" that there are two hundred of the
                        gallant soldiers of that famous Brigade who are without shoes and socks.
                        With Gen. Walker, we think it a "shame", that
                        such should be the fact, but we are sure that the good people of this county
                        would not have suffered such a state of things to exist if they had been
                        apprised of the fact that shoes and socks were needed, had it been possible
                        for them to supply the need. We do not know whether they could have supplied
                        shoes, but socks, they could, and would have supplied with pleasure, if they
                        had been apprised of the need for them. The Government should have supplied
                        these necessary articles, but if it had been known in this county that the
                        Government could not, or had, by mismanagement, failed to furnish them, we
                        know that the citizens of this county would have done all in their power to
                        have the gallant soldiers of the illustrious "Stonewall Brigade" properly
                        shod. Think of it, the thermometer standing at zero, and two hundred soldiers of the "Stonewall
                            Brigade" without shoes and socks!!! This is truly a "shame," but the culpability does not attach to the
                        patriotic and benevolent citizens of this county. If the Government will
                        furnish the yarn, we promise that the fair ladies of "Augusta" will supply,
                        in a remarkably short time, the whole Brigade
                        with good socks knit by their own fair hands. They do not regard working for
                        the soldiers as a labor, but a pleasure. For that burpose [sic] they work
                            con amore, it being with them a labor of
                        love, and we can assure them it will not be "Love's labor lost." As we had
                        heard no complaint from the army this winter of the want of proper clothing
                        we had supposed that the soldiers had been amply supplied by the Government,
                        and consequently we made no appeals to our citizens to supply their wants in
                        that respect. If we had been apprised of the fact that our soldiers were
                        suffering for the want of shoes and socks we would have appealed to our
                        citizens to supply them, and we are satisfied, from their promptness in the
                        past, that the appeal would have been responded to with promptness and
                        cheerfulness. Now that our citizens know the wants of the soldiers in the
                        "Stonewall Brigade," we are sure that they will exert themselves to have
                        their wants supplied. The noble example of Mr. Wm. B. Gallaher and his
                        mother is worthy of emulation, and we hope that it will not be long before
                        the General Commanding the Stonewall Brigade will have the pleasure of
                        acknowledging similar donations from other persons in this county. It is not
                        expected that single individuals shall make such large donations, as but few
                        have the means to do so, but even larger can be made by associated action.
                        Large donations are composed of many small amounts, and if each will give
                        but little the aggregate will amount to a large sum. Even small donations,
                        will be recieved [sic] with gratitude, and, like the widow's mite, will be
                        abundantly blessed. It requires but a short argument to establish that the
                        citizens should contribute liberally to the support of the wants of the
                        soldiers. If our cause shall be successful, it will be due to the efforts
                        and sacrifices of the soldiers, and as they will save our property and make
                        our money good, we should be willing to pay a portion for their comfort. If
                        in spite of their heroic efforts, our cause be destined to fail, then the
                        money will be worth nothing, and the contributor will have lost nothing whilst he will have the consolation to know
                        that he did a good act, and promoted the comfort of the suffering soldiers
                        who freely spilt their blood in defence of his rights and property. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The exhibition of the Tableaux Vivants, given in the Union Hall, on Thursday
                        evening last, was well patronized. The Hall was filled to its utmost
                        capacity, and so great was the press that there
                        was not a seat for the Press, which concluded, in
                        good humor, to stand it. After the Hall had been
                        filled to overflowing, and when it was as hard for any more to gain
                        admittance as it is for a camel to creep through the eye of a cambric
                        needle, the bell jingled, the curtain rose, and the first scene, "The
                        Reception," was exhibited. It was such as is frequently given, but not such
                        as confers pleasure--being formal, stylish and freezingly cold. "Infant
                        Samuel" was well represented, as was also the "Light of Life." "The Soldier
                        and Landlord," illustrated the imposition practised by some Landlords upon
                        Soldiers by charging much for very little. "Home Treasures" were treasures indeed, and where such "treasures are, there will the
                        heart be also." The "Unfortunate Schoolmaster," like the condemned criminal
                        on board ship, was compelled to "walk the plank," and "great was the fall,
                        my countrymen." This scene should have been entitled, "The fall of man." The
                        "Game of Draughts," won, and made a considerable
                            draught upon the approval of the spectators.
                        In "The Soldier's Departure", the departing hero was such a good soldier that he "stood upon the order of his going," instead of going at once," and as the order to go was not given, his departure was not
                        accomplished. "Family Prayer" was a very impressive scene, and should have
                        impressed some who witnessed it that they should cease to prey like vultures and learn to pray like Christians. "The Orphan Boy" struck the chord of
                        compassion in the "Harp of a thousand strings,"--the human heart. In "All is
                        fair in love and war," the chief art of war--"strategy, my boys,
                        strategy"--was shown to possess as much virtue in the court of Cupid as in
                        that of Mars. "The Marriage" scene was so beautiful and attractive as to
                        inspire many of the youthful spectators with the desire of enacting it--tho'
                        not in a style so mute and statue like. "First Boots" was very well acted,
                        and the proud little possessor of the boots had no idea of obeying the call,
                        so common in the army, "come out'n dem boots!" In the "Soldier's Return,"
                        the reception given the laurel-crowned and battle-scarred hero seemed more
                        of a surprise than a pleasure, owing probably to the fact that he returned
                        before the war was over--the "hurly-burly done, and the victory won." "Day
                        and night" embraced "all the light of dark eye in woman," and "as sure as
                        the night follows the day" it was not appreciated as it should have been.
                        "The Miniature" was quite a pretty scene. "Beautiful Star," though a
                        "bright, particular star", was not the star scene
                        of the exhibition. "The Dream," though it seemed to partake of the Elysian
                        type, was, like Lord Byron's, "not all a dream." In the scene of "Pocahontas
                        and Capt. Smith," though clubs were trumps, yet
                            hearts won the game. "The Contest" concluded
                        the exhibition, and that it gave satisfaction, no one will contest. The proceeds of this exhibition amounted
                        to $1250. and that of the week before to $850., making an aggregate of
                        $2100., which will be applied to paying the debt of the M.E. Church of this
                        place. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The case of Josiah Blackburn, who had furnished a substitute for the war,
                        came up on a writ of habeas corpus for decision
                        before Judge Halyburton's Court in Richmond on Tuesday last. It was decided
                        by the Court that the recent law of Congress, placing this class of persons
                        in the service, was constitutional, and the men liable to service,
                        notwithstanding they may have been exempted for the war. The Judge denied
                        that the Government had the power to make a contract which would alienate
                        her right to the services of every man capable of bearing arms, and that if
                        such contract was made, it was null and void, and there was nothing in the
                        Constitution to restrain Congress from disregarding such contract, whenever
                        the exigencies of service might require the service of all men capable of
                        bearing arms. The case was elaborately argued by Messrs. Davis and Orvis for
                        the petitioner, the Government not being represented. Upon the rendition of
                        this decision the peti[t]ioner, Blackburn, was remanded to Camp Lee. </p>

                        in this brigade still barefooted, without either shoes or socks to protect
                        them from the cold weather? Surely the good people of the Valley, whose
                        peculiar pride it is to have furnished the "old Stonewall Brigade" to the
                        country, do not know this, or they would strive with each other who should
                        first come to their relief.</p>
                    <p>To the people of Augusta, particularly, whose homes have never been polluted
                        by the presence of the invader, and whose means of liberality have not been
                        dimished [sic] by the war, I would appeal for aid. Remember Cross Keys and
                        Port Republic; and remember that more than one barefooted man in this
                        brigade can show scars which they received as they stood on the very border
                        of your county, perilling [sic] their lives to keep the enemy from your
                        homes!</p>
                    <p>How many gentlemen and ladies of Augusta county will follow the example set
                        them by Mr. and Mrs. Gallaher, and deliver to Col. Nadenbousch, Commanding
                        the Post at Staunton, similiar [sic] donations to be forwarded to the
                        brigade?</p>
                    <p>I am, Mr. Editor, <br>Very Respectfully, <br>J. A. WALKER <br>Brigadier
                        General. </p>

                    <p>CAMP AT SUMMERVILLE FORD, <br>Feb. 21, 1864 </p>
                    <p>
                        My good old Friends of Augusta:
                    </p>
                    <p>Whereas, I think it my duty to inform you of our present condition, I shall
                        endeavor to do so, by first informing you that we now are volunteeringly in
                        for the war. Some few of our regiment refused to re-enlist, from the fact
                        that they want a re-organization, which, I think they will not get, and at
                        last be forced into service when their three year's time expires. It is our
                        duty to re-enlist and serve our country to the last. I have been serving the
                        Confederate States of America for three years. I have never had a furlough
                        since I first volunteered. I have received one wound from the enemy which
                        caused me to be absent from my company a few months. Yet I am determined to
                        remain with my company as long as my services are needed in defence of my
                        country.</p>
                    <p>I am truly happy to inform you that company C, 52d Virginia Infantry, has
                        re-enlisted for the war. This company has fought gallantly in every battle
                        the regiment has been engaged in, which are not a few.</p>
                    <p>The weather is beautiful at present and I hope it will remain so. All is
                        quiet along the lines at present.</p>
                    <p>I am, very respectfully, <br>A SOLDIER. </p>

                    <p>At a meeting of the members of Company D, 52d Va. regiment held at their camp
                        near Summerville Ford, Feb. 18th, 1864, for the purpose of reiterating their
                        determination to remain in the service of the Confederate States until the

                        Sergt. James W. Marshall was chosen Secretary. On motion of Corpl. George
                        Harman, a committee of five were appointed to draft resolutions expressive
                        of the sentiments of the company. Whereupon the Chairman appointed Sergt.
                        Jas. H. Maupin, Fred. Cupp, Jas. Marshall, Jas. Curry and Corpl. Harman. The
                        committee after a short absence returned and the following resolutions were
                        unanimously adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved 1st, That we do recognize the necessity of remaining in the service,
                        and offering our past action as a guarantee of the sincerity of our purpose,
                        do pledge our honor, and, if need be, our lives, to fight this struggle to a
                        successful termination, over the embittered foe now marshalled for our
                        subjugation and destruction.</p>
                    <p>Resolved 2d, That we do, in vindication of what we have expressed, hereby
                        re-enlist for the war, with the reservation that we think the privilege of
                        reorganization ought to be granted us.</p>
                    <p>Resolved 3d, That in view of the exigencies of the crisis and the imperative
                        duty of every patriot, to rally to the bleeding standard of his country and
                        every Southerner to defend the battle torn and powder-stained flag of the
                        Confederate States, do reaffirm, that we will never consent to lay down our
                        arms, until the nationality and independence of our country shall have been
                        achieved.</p>
                    <p>Resolved 4th, That a copy of these proceedings be sent to the Staunton
                        Spectator and Rockingham Register for publication.</p>
