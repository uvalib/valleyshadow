                    <p>A meeting will be held in the Court House of this place on next Tuesday
                        night, May the 3d, for the purpose of forming an Association to aid the one
                        formed in Richmond, for the benefit of the maimed soldiers of the
                        Confederacy. This meeting will be addressed by the Rev. J. L. Stirewalt who
                        has been very successful in other places in having Associations formed and
                        in getting contributions for the purpose of supplying artificial limbs to
                        our maimed soldiers. The meeting will also be addressed by Hon. A. H. H.
                        Stuart &amp; probably others. The Ladies, (who are the main reliance in
                        every good enterprise) it is hoped, will attend in full force. Staunton
                        should do more than any place yet visited by Mr. Stirewalt for this purpose.
                        We believe it will. We pledge Augusta to do more than any county in the
                        Valley.</p>

                        between the ages of 17 and 18 years.</p>

                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>An experienced house keeper has furnished for the GAZETTE, the following
                        which was tried in our own culinary department, and proved to be good.</p>
                    <p>A CHEAP AND PALATABLE SUPPER.</p>
                    <p>The following is good for adults but still better for children. Take one pint
                        of milk, 1 egg, and two pints of water; boil the milk and water in separate
                        vessels; beat the egg well in a quart bowl or cup, and pour upon it slowly
                        the boiling milk, stirring briskly as you pour. When the egg and milk have
                        been thoroughly mixed, pour them into the boiling water, stirring at the
                        same time. Add 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, and let the mixture boil for a few
                        minutes. In the meantime fill a half-gallon tureen or pan two thirds full of
                        light bread, cut into slices or broken into fragments, and pour your boiling
                        mixture over it. Double the quantity of milk and eggs would be better, if
                        you can afford it, but the above is both agreeable and wholesome.</p>
