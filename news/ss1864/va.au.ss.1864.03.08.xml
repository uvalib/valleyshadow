                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Merchant occupies an intermediate place in society between the producer
                        and the consumer. He is the agent of both. A high and honorable position
                        this, not only because of its responsibility, but also because of the
                        confidence necessarily placed in his honesty. If faithful to his trust, he
                        will be respected and honored; if not, he will recieve [sic] the reward of
                        all unfaithfulness, the distrust and contempt of all.</p>
                    <p>It is not the function of the Merchant to make his fee--to get his profit.
                        The fee is only the first payment of the labor he expends in providing for
                        the wants of the consumer. It is his function--a function to be performed
                        irrespective of fee or for quite the contrary of fee--to thoroughly
                        understand the qualities of the things in which he deals, and to apply all
                        his sagacity &amp; energy in obtaining them in their purest forms and
                        distributing them at the cheapest price possible, where most needed. This is
                        his bounden [sic] duty, and it is his duty, too, to suffer any loss--to
                        welcome poverty and even death itself--rather than provide that which is
                        impure or adulterated or at exorbitant prices. Does it ever occur to our
                        merchants why it is that they, as a class, are not respected and honored as
                        the men of other professions are respected and honored? The clergyman, the
                        lawyer and the physician are all more respected and honored than the
                        merchant. It cannot be because of the superior or mental qualities requisite
                        to the successful pursuit of these professions. For there is as much energy,
                        tact, foresight, decision and other mental qualities required for the
                        successful management of mercantile operations, as are expected in the
                        members of the other so-called "liberal" professions.</p>
                    <p>This public estimate of honor must be deeper than in the measurement of their
                        several powers of mind.</p>
                    <p>The truth is, the respect we pay to the soldier, the lawyer, the physician
                        and the clergyman is founded ultimately in their self-sacrifice. The world
                        honors the soldier, because he holds his life at the service of the State;
                        the lawyer because of its tacit conviction that in all important acts of his
                        life, justice is first with him, his own interest second; the physician,
                        because of his persuasion, that to alleviate the suffering and save the life
                        of the sick is his first object; the clergyman, because it firmly believes
                        he seeks, above all things else, man's welfare for time and eternity. And
                        the merchant the world does nor honor, because he is presumed to act
                        selfishly. The public believe that his whole object in his dealing is to get
                        as much for himself and leave as little for his neighbor as possible. The
                        same public, that loudly declares, as the law of the universe, that it is
                        the buyers function to cheapen and the sellers to cheat--do involuntarily
                        condemn the man of commerce for his compliance with their own rule. And this
                        is the reason, that the land echoes with anathemas pronounced against
                        speculators. Bring speculation to the best of the commonly recieved [sic]
                        laws of trade, and it appears all right and proper. Nevertheless the very
                        men who recieve [sic] these laws of trade for laws of the universe, condemn
                        speculation. It is not right to buy as cheap as possible, and sell as dear
                        as possible, because such a rule ignores all affection--that which we <emph
                            rend="italic">owe</emph> to our neighbor--and is therefore a rule
                        commending injustice. The man who hides or stores away in his barns or
                        cellars those things which are necessary to the being and well being of
                        society until his neighbors are starved into paying the highest possible
                        price, is an unjust man, a cheat richly deserving the contempt of all. This
                        robbing the poor, because he is poor, is especially the mercantile form of
                        theft, consisting of taking advantage of a man's necessities to obtain his
                        labor or property at a reduced price. </p>
                    <p>"He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches shall surely come to
                        want." "Rob not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted
                        in the place of business. For God shall spoil the soul of those that spoiled
                        them."</p>

                <excerpt>"I think there are well founded apprehensions that this great Valley will
                    be subjected to plundering raids before and in corn-planting time."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>I would like to talk an hour with each of you, but as that can't be, I
                        address you thus:</p>
                    <p>You are all busily in engaged in preparing your Spring crops. This is right,
                        and I urge you to the most strenuous exertions to raise to the full extent
                        of your means, grains, hay, and vegetables. There is but one serious
                        obstacle in your way, and that is the possible interference with your
                        farming operations by the public army during the early Spring months. I
                        think there are well founded apprehensions that this great Valley will be
                        subjected to plundering raids before and in corn-planting time. If the enemy
                        comes he will seek to destroy your farming operations and resources by
                        stealing your horses, burning your implements, and kidnapping your negroes.
                        All this can be prevented, and I think will be, by the presence of an
                        adequate force for your protection, <emph rend="italic">provided</emph> it
                        can be subsisted in your midst. As regards ample provision for the men I
                        have no apprehensions, but the defence of this Valley requires a large
                        cavalry force, and to maintain it <emph rend="italic">the horses must be
                        fed</emph>. I know that the Valley people have, this Winter, furnished an
                        enormous amount of army supplies, and that there is a general scarcity of
                        grain and long forage; but, I believe, there is still a sufficiency to carry
                        your stock safely through the Winter on diminished allowance and to spare
                        enough by a little close economy to support the Valley troops. In sixty days
                        from this time your cattle, sheep and colts can live on grass, and in ninety
                        days your horses can do the same, and so can ours. It is of the utmost
                        importance to you and the country that the Yankees shall be kept from
                        plundering you during these sixty or ninety days. That can hardly be
                        expected to be done unless you can feed the cavalry and artillery horses. We
                        cannot haul feed from the upper country, 75 or 100 miles, to feed our horses
                        when on duty to the front. I might possibly obtain a supply by sending my
                        Quartermasters to your barns and cribs with orders to take whatever they
                        might find; but if this is done you will think yourselves outraged in many
                        instances. The Quartermasters will be cursed and I shall be denounced. If on
                        the other hand supplies cannot be had at all, and the troops are obliged to
                        fall back on that account, and the Yankees ride over your country, stealing
                        and plundering as they go, and living off the very supplies we could not
                        get, I shall be cursed from one end of the Valley to the other for falling
                        in my duty, and the Government will be blamed for an alleged indifference to
                        your safety and welfare. Now I don't want to send impressing officers to
                        barns and corn-cribs, to your hay mows and garrets, for it is the most
                        unpleasant task I ever have to perform, nor do I intend to fall back too far
                        to afford protection, unless I am ordered to do so, or forced by dire
                        necessity. To meet the whole difficulty and surmount it, I think you have
                        but to act in concert, and promptly. I have a plan to submit to you, and beg
                        that you earnestly consider it. It is this--in each neighborhood let some
                        energetic patriotic man immediately mount his horse and see his neighbors,
                        and ascertain from each one, on a close calculation of his wants for the
                        next 90 days, how many pounds of hay he can spare--how many shocks of fodder
                        he can let go, and how many bushels of corn or oats he can dispose of. If he
                        can't spare a ton, perhaps he can a half a ton of hay or fodder, or if that
                        would run him too close, he would hardly miss 500 pounds. In the same way
                        try his corn. No one has a moral right to hold on to 6 or 9 months
                        provisions. He must trust in Providence and the seasons for a good harvest,
                        and have faith in the army and our cause, and show his faith by "pinching" a
                        little. Let the names of all who can spare us a little be sent to me by the
                        19th of March, with a statement of what they can furnish, and I will send
                        the money and a wagon to each house to pay for and collect it. If a wagon
                        can't be loaded at one house it may at two or three, and the aggregate, I am
                        sure, will supply our wants. Thus imprecaments will be unnecessary--good
                        feeling will be preserved and promoted--the troops will be sustained--the
                        farmers and our wives and children, I hope, will be protected, and, with the
                        blessings of Providence, our armies, which are never low-spirited or
                        desponding, will, I firmly believe, this year, drive the dastardly and hated
                        invader beyond our borders, and establish our future peace and maintain our
                        present independence. The distinct proposition I have submitted may seem to
                        many a small affair, but I assure you it is a most important one, and
                        affects you more nearly, perhaps, than you are aware. I consider no matter
                        too small for the earnest consideration of any man, which contributes to our
                        success. An acre of cabbage is of more real value to us now than would be a
                        ship load of the richest spices of India. I would rather see a spare load of
                        hay in one of your barns than a rosewood Chickering piano in your parlor,
                        and would rather be invited to send for 20 shocks of corn than to attend, at
                        one of your houses, the most sumptuous entertainment of even the halcyon
                        days of peace. "A little here and a little there" will furnish all I need.
                        Then, again, I appeal to you, as your fellow-citizen, to rid your country in
                        the manner proposed. If you cannot see each other during the week, confer
                        together on Sunday at church. It surely cannot be a desecration of the most
                        holy day and place to help forward a cause so sacred as that we are fighting
                        for. </p>

                    <p>HEADQ'RS 25th VA. REGT., <lb/>Feb. 16th, 1864 </p>
                    <p>I have been requested by the men of this regiment, to tender their grateful
                        acknowledgements to the ladies of Staunton for a package of cloth socks and
                        gloves--36 pairs of socks and 22 pairs of gloves. They were received a short
                        time since, and many of the men being destitute of socks suffered from the
                        exceedingly cold weather, or were excused from duty for want of this
                        necessary article of clothing, thus leaving the duty, to be performed by
                        those better provided, much harder than it ought to have been. But owing to
                        the timely arrival of this package the men were rendered comfortable for the
                        time, and to-morrow when the regiment goes on picket <emph rend="italic"
                        >all</emph> will be able to go. </p>
                    <p>The ladies may think they cannot do much to advance the interests of our
                        cause, and may feel discouraged at times in regard to their efforts; if so,
                        they know not how much their labors contribute to the preservation of the
                        health and efficiency of the army, and do not realize how highly their
                        efforts are valued by the officers and men. A soldier that has warm socks is
                        not particular whether they are yarn or cloth; and moreover his health is
                        preserved during the Winter and he is ready for the earliest Spring
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>I regret that those who so kindly donated these articles could not be present
                        when they were distributed, that they might have heard the expressions of
                        gratitude used by the thankful recipients.</p>

                    <p>With the early Spring, there comes a duty to those out of the army, as well
                        as to the gallant defenders of the country. That duty is diligent labor to
                        raise supplies of food for man and beasts. Let there be early and late
                        planting of corn, taking the chances of all seasons; plant large supplies of
                        vegetables; give the ground all kinds of seeds, and then strain every effort
                        to make the most out of mother earth. This is the duty of those out of the
                        army--a duty second only in importance to that of the army. Well performed
                        by every farmer, an enemy more dangerous than those commanded by Meade and
                        Grant will be defeated, and the overthrow of Lincoln's hireling soldiery no
                        longer a matter of doubt.--<emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph>. </p>
