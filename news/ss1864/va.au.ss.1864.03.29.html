<b>Lincoln's War Unpopular</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Highlights reports in Northern newspapers that suggest the war is unpopular
                    in the North.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York News shows that Lincoln's war is not
                        popular in the North, as the administration papers maintain, but, on the
                        contrary, that the people "yearn for peace and will have it." To learn the
                        true sentiment of the people of the North, "we must not go," says the New
                        York News, "to the columns of the pensioned press of the dynasty at
                        Washington; nor to the manufacturer of New England or New York, or
                        elsewhere, who have grown fat on the carnage of better men; nor to the
                        traders, or jobbers, or contractors, or place-men, or parasites--the myriad
                        of jackals who feed on the bloody offal of the strife. We have only to
                        contemplate the simple and naked facts, that with a population three times
                        that of the States at war with us, and a fighting population proportionately
                        much larger--with bounties proffered, such as never tempted cupidity, in any
                        war before--we are compelled to seduce foreigners from
                            their homes to fight our battles for pay, and are driven to the
                        still more degrading necessity of committing the
                        honor of our flag and the vindication of our manhood to
                            the hands of negroes, bond and free. Not the relentless grasp of
                        a most merciless and unconstitutional, conscription, nor the seduction of
                        bounties large enough to make a poor man's fortune, can
                            now drag or entice American citizens, except in numbers
                        absolutely insignificant, to fight the battles of this war. It is insolent,
                        as well as idle and absurd, to talk of the "popularity" of any war that can
                        command no warmer support than this, from a brave and impulsive people. If
                        the hearts of the people were in the war, they themselves would be in the
                        field to fight to the death. If they sincerely believed it to be a war in
                        which they ought to offer themselves as a sacrifice, they would crowd to the
                        very horns of the altar, without threat or bribe. That they shrink from the
                        contest--that they will devote all the little earnings of their lives to
                        purchase exemption--that they cannot be tempted or
                            forced into the ranks, while there is an escape--all these things
                        tell the story. The people do not feel any longer that the war is their war.
                        They may support a little while because the government is waging it and the
                        flag is waved over it. Some of them may be willing it should continue,
                        because it pays themselves or their friends large profits, or keeps up their
                        influence or advances their party, or flatters their vanity or gratifies
                        their rancor. But the great current of public feeling and opinion runs in
                        its favor no longer. It has now no hold on public enthusiasm. Its popularity
                        is dead! </p>
                    <p>If the Administration really believes that all this is false--if it is
                        persuaded that the popularity of the war continues, let it abandon the
                        conscription and the bounty system and make the experiment of volunteer
                        enlistments for a single week. That brief space
                        of time would suffice for the entire solution of the problem. If such an
                        experiment, however, be deemed hazardous, let Mr. Lincoln and his
                        counsellors make a still simpler one. Let them tell the people the truth for a single month, if the thing be possible,
                        if not let them endeavor to do it for a fortnight. Let Mr. Chase give us the
                        real amount of the public debt and of his means and provisions for its
                        payment. Let him inform us of the amount of taxes which we must endure to
                        avert the shame of repudiation now without increasing the debt a single
                        dollar. Instead of see-sawing between greenbacks and bonds, which appears to
                        be the substance of his financial policy, and concocting paltry schemes for
                        jobbing in gold on Wall street, let him trust the people, if he dare, with
                        the facts from which they may know their own solvency, or insolvency, and
                        appeal to them to meet the issue, face to face. Let Mr. Seward try if he can
                        write one solitary despatch without some intentional perversion of the
                        truth, and confine himself to the legitimate purposes of diplomatic
                        correspondence abroad, instead of loading the files of the State Department
                            with claptrap and misrepresentation for home
                            consumption and deception. Let Mr. Stanton, instead of flooding
                        the country with false bulletins from irresponsible or fictitious sources
                        undervaluing the strength and resources of the enemy, exaggerating their
                        wants and sufferings, multiplying their reverses and our triumphs, give
                        himself up, for ever so brief a space, to the
                            dissemination of the truth, which the people are entitled to have
                        in regard to a struggle for which they are taxed to the utmost in treasure
                        and blood. With what face can he assert the war to be the people's war,
                        when, after having caused the press to teem with telegrams, announcing the
                        almost universal and enthusiastic re-enlistment of the veterans of the army,
                        he has caused the President to refuse to give the House of Representatives
                        any information on the subject, on the ground that it would be "prejudicial to the public interest?["] If the
                        Administration will not venture to pursue the plain, straightforward course
                        we indicate, let it cease to prate of its war policy as rooted in the
                        confidence of the people. If the people uphold it, why conceal from the
                        people what they uphold? Or, is it that the war can be maintained in its
                        pretended popularity, only so long as the people are kept from knowing what
                        it is and what it promises. </p>

                    <p>Camp "STONEWALL BRIGADE," <br>Feb. 20th 1864. </p>
                    <p>Mr. EDITOR:</p>
                    <p>Allow me through the medium of your well known paper to direct the attention
                        of the citizens of Augusta to one of the most hardhearted and mercenary acts
                        that has been perpetrated in our county since the commencement of the war.
                        The circumstances of the case are these--At the late battle of "Paynes Farm"
                        on the 27th of November, one of the best and bravest soldiers in the 5th,
                        Va. Infy., (Co. E.) fell mortally wounded whilst charging the enemy; his
                        admiring and sympathizing comrades, out of their own small means, made up
                        money enough to have the body taken from the battle field and sent to
                        Augusta County for burial, that their gallant comrade might rest beneath the
                        soil that he had so long defended so bravely and loved so well. The
                        distressed widow of the deceased soldier, on the arrival of the body at
                        home, took the twenty dollars which is allowed by the county to the wives of
                        soldiers for their support, and wishing to pay the last sad rites to her
                        husband in the usual manner, went to a prominent cabinet maker in
                        Greenville, for a coffin, the usual price of which was twenty or twenty-five
                        dollars, but he refused to let her have it on any terms unless she paid him
                            forty dollars cash, refused to credit her for
                        the remaining twenty dollars, and had it not been for the generosity of some
                        kind neighbors in making up the money, this cabinet-maker, whose heart must
                        surely resemble in durability one of his coffin plates, would have left the
                        remains of our beloved comrade unburied yet. </p>
                    <p>On hearing of the above facts, many members of the company, although more
                        accustomed to handling the musket than the pen, resolved, to try to show to
                        their fellow citizens at home that there exists even in Old Augusta some men
                        as mean and avaricious as even Yankee land can boast of. We do not mention
                        the name either of the deceased soldier or of him who so cruelly treated his
                        widow, as we hope he will take warning by this exposure of his degrading and
                        disgraceful conduct and--"go and sin no more."</p>
                    <p>Very Respectfully, <br>Many members of Co. "E." 5th, Va. Infy. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"In a deep vale, shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world," there once
                        lived an humble dweller of the forest who earned his bread by the sweat of
                        his brow and partook of the bounties of munificent nature beneath his own
                        vine and fig tree, where there was none to molest or make him afraid. With
                        "conscience void of offence" he lived at peace with his Maker and all
                        mankind. But, alas! grim visaged war sent his agent into this Eden to bring
                        forth this simple "child of nature" to do battle for his country. Without a
                        moment's warning he was hurried away from his forest home and the dear
                        little ones who were wont to climb upon his knee and make glad his heart
                        with their ceaseless caroling. Unaccustomed to war, and knowing nothing of
                        the privations to be endured he went forth without blankets or clothing,
                        never thinking that he would have to sleep upon the cold wet ground with
                        nothing to protect his shivering body from the wintry blast. After a few
                        months suffering in the service of his country, he received the sad
                        intelligence of the illness of his wife. When he thought of that loved one
                        at home--the idol of his heart--lying prostrate upon her couch, the victim
                        of insidious disease, and of those dear little ones who could not minister
                        to her wants and who were likely to suffer from hunger, he lost sight of his
                        duty to his country, and in one wild paroxysm of anxiety, threw down his
                        musket, plunged into the dark wilds of the forest without thought of duty or
                        danger. Onward he pressed day and night, all heedless of weariness and
                        hunger, until he found himself by the prostrate form of his bosom companion
                        ministering to her every want. After providing for his family, as best he
                        could, he was about returning to his command, when the hand of disease laid
                        him low. When he had partially recovered, he was again hurried off under
                        guard to his regiment, where he was ordered to the guard-house; and after
                        suffering as never man suffered for some three or four months, he was
                        arraigned before that honorable (?) body--the court-martial, where he was
                        sentenced to be shot to death with musketry. </p>
                    <p>Come with me poor, wayworn soldier, with your tattered garments--you who have
                        stood by my side when the leaden hail fell thick and fast; let me take a
                        stroll in the direction of yonder splendid mansion. See, the candles are
                        lighted in the parlor and hall. Listen, there is a sound of music and
                        revelry there. Let us go to the gate, Lazarus-like, that we may learn
                        something of the pomp of this world. The bacchanalian song is struck up, the
                        dance begins, and all moves on as "merry as a marriage bell."</p>
                    <p>Who is this man that can revel in luxury and riotous living, while every one
                        else is mourning in sack-cloth and ashes on account of the great calamity
                        which is now resting upon and devouring us? From whence all this luxury and
                        grandeur? Go ask the poor widow and orphan children of him who poured out
                        his heart's blood in defence of his country. They will tell you who it was,
                        in the beginning of this war, that made loud professions of patriotism and
                        persuaded their husbands and fathers to go forth and do battle for their
                        country while he remained at home and wrung the last morsel of bread from
                        them that he might "dress in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously
                        every day." With him swindling is not only one of the prerequisites of
                        trade, but a virtue. With a smile upon his face, such as we might well
                        imagine Satan wore when he approached our first parents, he meets the
                        soldier and asks, "When are you going back
                        again?" </p>
                    <p>Let us bring these two characters face to face that we may compare them for a
                        moment. The one served his country until the sickness of his family requires
                        his presence, when he left in order to rescue them from starvation, for
                        which he was tied to a stake and shot to death. </p>
                    <p>The other never did a day's service, but on the other hand has done more to
                        break down and destroy our country than the avowed enemy, and yet, strange
                        as it may seem, he is permitted to go unmolested, unrebuked.</p>
                    <p>Fellow-soldiers, are you to permit the man to go
                        unscathed? Are you going to stand like dumb
                        brutes and see your fellow-soldiers shot to death, while your worst
                        enemy--the Speculator--roams up and down the
                        country at large? May my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, and my right
                        arm forget her cunning if I fail to heap upon him my maledictions! Come
                        forth, you miserable recreant, you loathesome vulture who has been feeding
                        upon the vitals of our country; take your place in the criminal box with
                        this poor soldier and let the world judge between you and him. </p>
                    <p>He left his post to rescue his family from
                        starvation. You avoided your country's call that you might remain at home and filch the bread from his poor
                        starving children. He persuaded no one to leave his post of duty. You have
                        caused hundreds to desert, by hoarding up the necessaries of life, so that
                        their wives and families could not get them. He caused no dissatisfaction in
                        the ranks. You have caused more croaking, more rebellious feeling than all
                        other causes put together. He was guilty only of desertion, you of high treason. </p>
                    <p>I do not ask those high in office, who have screened this man from the
                        beginning of the war and who had the other shot, to render a verdict in the
                        case. But I ask those who shouldered the musket and marched to the "field of
                        carnage and bloodshed," who have withstood the leaden hail of the enemy
                        without flinching, whom they consider deserving of death in this case.</p>
                    <p>This man, with patriotic sentiments upon his tongue, and treason written in
                        blazing characters upon his penurious soul, may
                        go unscathed through this world; but I would just remind him that the
                        Supreme Judge of high Heaven, He who passed sentence upon a certain rich man
                        many years ago, shall be his Judge. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As the labor of the Valley is done chiefly by white persons, and as the
                        conscription act, together with the repeal of the exemption of those who had
                        employed substitutes, will abstract nearly all of the productive labor from
                        this section, unless a very liberal system of details be adopted, and as
                        supplies are needed as much as soldiers, and as the Valley of Virginia is
                        entitled to be called the great granary of the State, the best thing, in our
                        humble opinion, the Department could do would be to grant details to all
                        those in the Valley who are engaged in agriculture, and who are not now in
                        the military service. If the labor be withdrawn from the Valley, there will
                        be some danger that there will not be sufficient supplies raised in this
                        State to feed Gen. Lee's army, and as we cannot depend upon the limited
                        means of transportation to ensure supplies from the South--even granting the
                        supplies to be there--it might necessitate the withdrawal of that army from
                        this State. The necessitated withdrawal of that gallant army from Virginia
                        by any cause whatever would depress the spirits of the people, not only in
                        this State, but in the whole South, more than all the defeats we have
                        suffered since the war. We have no idea that anything else than the want of
                        supplies can cause the withdrawal of that army from Virginia. It is
                        altogether important that proper provision be made to ensure a sufficiency
                        of supplies, and nothing would go so far to secure that result as the
                        retention of sufficient labor in the Valley to cultivate its fruitful soil.
                        Unless details be liberally granted to those engaged in productive labor,
                        the fertile lands of the Valley will lie idle, and no crops will be raised
                        where, otherwise, abundant harvests would be gathered, and a sufficient
                        supply obtained to furnish the armies in Virginia. Details of this character
                        should be liberally granted in all such sections as the Valley where the
                        soil is fertile and slave labor scarce. What we have said of the Valley
                        applies to most of the counties of Western Virginia.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>CAMP STONEWALL BRIGADE. <br>March 24th, 1864. </p>
                    <p>Mr. EDITOR:</p>
                    <p>Thinking our friends [of whom I hope there are many] in Augusta, would like
                        to hear what the boys of the old "Stonewall" are doing these snowy times, I
                        thought I would tell you of a big fight we had yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Day before yesterday was one of the worst days we have had this year. It
                        commenced snowing early in the day, and continued until late in the night,
                        in consequence of which we found, on awaking in the morning, old mother
                        earth covered with snow about fifteen inches deep. This was just what our
                        boys wanted. We were beginning to think Winter would pass away without our
                        having a snow-ball.</p>
                    <p>Quite early in the morning, the 4th and 5th formed and started to storm the
                        camp of the other three regiments. We succeeded in routing them after some
                        very heard [sic] fighting. But this was not enough to appease our desire for
                        fun, so a part of the whole brigade, together with some Louisanians, and
                        commanded by a Louisana Col. drew up in line in front of Dole's, Georgia
                        brigade, and challenged them to combat, which they were not at all loth
                        [sic] to accept; but quickly forming, charged for a small bridge across a
                        ravine which divided the contending parties and led by Gen. Dole in person.
                        Here occurred one of the most stubborn fights of the kind ever known.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Dole tried several times to force his horse over, but in vain. He was at
                        last knocked from horse, and, supposing him badly hurt, both sides ceased
                        firing. We then agreed to let them cross over and have half of the field.</p>
                    <p>It may be well here to state, that a great many of our side, thinking the
                        fight over, and hearing that the 3rd Gen. Stuart's brigade, was in
                        posses[s]ion of our Camp, left the field. By this we were considerably
                        weakened. In the mean time Gen. Dole was bringing out every man.</p>
                    <p>Well, all the preliminaries being arranged, the fight soon became general.
                        First one party would charge and then the other, and the tide of battle
                        ebbed and flowed without either gaining any decided advantage. Thus things
                        continued for some time; but after a while our boys had to give way. We
                        would rally every few paces, and stand for some moments, but finally they
                        proved to[o] many for us. We wished very much for Gen. Walker, but no one
                        apprised him of it. They continued to drive us until we reached our camp,
                        where they halted and went back exulting over their victory. Nothing could
                        please them more than to say that they had whipped the "Stonewall brigade"
                        for it has ever been a source of envy to many brigades that any one should
                        take the name of him who, when living, they loved to follow to fields of
                        glory, and whose memory, now that a kind of Providence has taken him away,
                        they revere and hold most sacred.</p>
                    <p>Hostilities now ceased for a while, but the mortification of a defeat, a
                        thing unknown to the army of Northern Virginia, much less the "Stonewall
                        brigade," was rankling in the bosom of every man.</p>
                    <p>About this time, Gen. Dole and Staff undertook a raid through our camp. They
                        were greeted on all sides with showers of ball, during which two of the
                        party lost their hats. They claimed that it was as successful as
                        Kilpatrick's. Gen. Walker now rode out and formed the brigade, determining
                        to fight to the last, but such was the enthusiasm of our boys, when led by
                        our gallant Brigadier, that we broke their line the first charge, and drove
                        them through their camp in complete rout. After giving three cheers for Gen.
                        Walker and the "Stonewall Brigade," we returned to camp entirely satisfied
                        with our day's work.</p>
                    <p>I write this account of our snowball battle hoping it may entertain some of
                        our friends, and also to correct some of the rumors which reach our homes
                        that we are all depressed and in low spirits about our affairs. I assure you
                        these are all false. Our boys are all in fine spirits and look forward to
                        the coming campaign with anything but feelings of despondency, and hope, ere
                        the beginning of another year, with the blessing of the God of battles, to
                        free Virginia's soil from the presence of our unscrupulous and blood-thirsty
                        foe.</p>

                        footsteps on earth, and guide them to Heaven; so firm in virtue that should
