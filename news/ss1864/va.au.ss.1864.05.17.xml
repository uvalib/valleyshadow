                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We noticed last week the battles of Thursday and Friday, the first two days
                        of conflict between the armies of LEE and GRANT. On Saturday following there
                        was no battle, only some skirmishing. On the next day, Sunday, there was
                        very hard fighting, and we were successful in repelling the assaults of the
                        enemy. On Monday there was also some fighting. On Tuesday the battle was of
                        a severer character than any which had preceded it. We repulsed the enemy
                        with very great loss. Our loss was not small, but that of the enemy greatly
                        more. On Wednesday there was no regular battle, but some active skirmishing,
                        which was kept up even throughout Wednesday night. On Thursday, the 12th,
                        the battle was terrific, and raged with fierceness from daylight throughout
                        the day--the death struggle lasting ten hours.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday morning at day light, the enemy, having massed forces in front of
                        Johnston's Division, made a most vigorous assault upon Jones' Brigade, and
                        for a while our line was broken. They pressed our breastworks, gaining
                        possession of several pieces of artillery, and capturing a number of
                        prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Forces, however, were quickly sent to the relief of those thus engaged, and
                        the enemy was driven back.</p>
                    <p>About 10 o'clock the enemy made most vigorous &amp; repeated assaults
                        upon Fields' Division, but were driven back with great slaughter.</p>
                    <p>At 2 P. M. the enemy made a most desperate fight in Ewell's front, but all
                        accounts concur that we drove them back and punished them with great
                        slaughter.</p>
                    <p>The musketry was the heaviest of the war.</p>
                    <p>The battle extended along our whole lines and was fought by the Yankees with
                        more vim and bravery than in any other fight in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Our men, after a temporary repose, in front of Johnston's division,
                        successfully resisted every onset of the enemy, who repeatedly assaulted our
                        lines with troops massed in as many as ten columns.</p>
                    <p>Our boys stood to their work manfully, piling the enemy's dead thickly before
                        our breastworks.</p>
                    <p>The lowest estimate of the enemy's loss in the battle Thursday is 20,000.
                        These figures are corrob[o]rated by a Yankee Colonel who was wounded and
                        taken prisoner.</p>
                    <p>Our loss on Thursday in killed and wounded is estimated at 2000.</p>
                    <p>Since the battle of Thursday there has been no fighting, except artillery
                        firing, that we have heard of to this time [Monday.] We suppose that Grant
                        made his most vigorous effort on Thursday last, and, failing to dislodge
                        Lee, will now find it necessary to postpone his trip to Richmond, and will
                        be compelled to search a better route, if such can be found. We suppose he
                        will find the back track towards Washington the only safe route for him and
                        his army. Though the enemy had a superiority of numbers, we repulsed them in
                        every conflict. There has been fighting for several days on the South side
                        of Richmond. There was a general engagement near Drewry's Bluff on Sunday.
                        The loss heavy on both sides, but much heavier on the part of the enemy than
                        on our side. The enemy were repulsed. If we drive off this column, we are
                        safe. All the others have failed.</p>
                    <p>In the Stonewall Brigade there are 926 missing. But 349 men left in this
                        Brigade. There are 30 officers in the Brigade, killed, wounded and missing.</p>
                    <p>James H. Skinner, Colonel of the 52nd Va. Regiment, who lost an eye in the
                        battle of Thursday, and Lt. Stephen Kinney of this place, who was shot in
                        the battle, [illegible] more on Sunday evening last, [illegible]. Capt. Jno.
                        Byers of the 52d Brigade was wounded in the battle Thursday, though not
                        seriously. He [illegible] yesterday evening. He was short [sic] in the foot.
                        Stribling Trout, of this place, was slightly wounded.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Friday evening last, the forces under command of Genl. Imboden had a
                        skirmish with the advance guard of Siegel's forces at new Market [sic], in
                        Shenandoah county, in which the enemy were driven back and a part of them
                        captured, together with a number of horses. Ninety-five Yankees and two
                        negroes (prisoners) arrived here on yesterday evening. At that time Gen.
                        Breckenridge was on the march from this place, on his way to reinforce Genl.
                        Imboden. He arrived in time on Saturday to form his line of battle about a
                        mile South of New Market, and near the boundary line between the counties of
                        Rockingham and Shenandoah--the position taken being in the county of
                        Shenandoah. The enemy fell back and the battle was fought on the northside
                        of N. Market. On Sunday, the Dutch General, "<emph rend="italic">mit all dat
                            fites mit Siegel</emph>," offered battle and after a severe engagement
                        were defeated, with the loss of a good many killed, wounded, and prisoners,
                        and five pieces of artillery. They were pursued as far as the bridge across
                        the North Shenandoah, near Mt. Jackson, which the enemy partially destroyed
                        and thus stopped, for the time, the pursuit, as the river was too full to
                        ford. The force of the enemy consisted of 5060 infantry, 2000 cavalry and
                        four batteries of artillery. The strength of our force, it may not be
                        prudent to state at this time, but it was sufficient to defeat and rout
                        Siegel and all "<emph rend="italic">dat fites mit him</emph>." </p>
                    <p>Our loss was considerable, though up to this time (Monday evening) we have
                        been unable to learn the extent of it. We have heard that the 62nd Regiment
                        of Imboden's command lost 7 captains killed and wounded. We have learned the
                        names of none of these captains except that of Capt. Currence, who was
                        killed.</p>
                    <p>The Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute participated gallantly and
                        efficiently in this battle. Their loss is reported 6 killed and 39 wounded.</p>
                    <p>We have received the names only of the following:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Killed</emph>. W.H. Cabell, --- Jones, Chas. Crocket,
                        McDowell, Stanard, Randolph. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Badly Wounded</emph>. Garnet, Whitson, J. A. Stuart,
                        Shriver and Capt. Hill. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Slightly Wounded</emph>. Chas. W. Turner, J. Wise,
                        Johnston, Dillard, Berkeley Triplett, Marshall, Watson, and H. C. Reed. </p>
                    <p>Jno. A. Stuart, and Chas. W. Turner, are from our town and neighborhood. The
                        other Cadets from this place, Alex. H. H. Stuart, jr., Carrington Taylor,
                        Win. Crawford and Carter Harrison, we are pleased to learn were not hurt.</p>
                    <p>P. S. Since the above was in type we learn that we captured one hundred
                        prisoners exclusive of the wounded, and that the enemy left 138 of their
                        dead on the field, which would indicate a loss of not less that [sic] six or
                        700.</p>
                    <p>The casualties in the Captains of the 62nd Regiment alluded to above are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Killed</emph>. Captain Currence. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Wounded</emph>. Captains Chipley, Bastable, Hill, Holt,
                        Smith, and Woodson. </p>

                    <p>BATTLE FIELD, NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., via LOUISA C. H., May 11.--There was
                        heavy cannonading all day yesterday.</p>
                    <p>About 12 o'clock yesterday the enemy having got possession of a road leading
                        to the main road to Louisa, C. H., with a large force, Heth's division was
                        sent to drive them off, which was accomplished with slight loss to us. Our
                        troops drove to the enemy back some three or four miles, and out of their
                        lines of breastworks, capturing one piece of artillery, one caison and some
                        115 prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Among those wounded on our side was Brigadier Gen. Wm. H. Walker, of
                        Virginia, whose foot had to be amputated.</p>
                    <p>Between 12 o'clock and nightfall the enemy made repeated assaults upon
                        Fields' division, but was handsomely repulsed in every instance by our line
                        of skirmishers, Fields' line of battle never finding it necessary to engage
                        them, Fields' loss was very trifling.</p>
                    <p>Very near dusk the enemy made a vigorous and determined assault on Rodes'
                        line of Battle, driving Daniel's and Dole's line of battle from their
                        breastworks and capturing six pieces of our artillery--Johnston's North
                        Carolina, Walker's Stonewall Virginia, and Gordon's Georgia brigade,
                        however, quickly came to their assistance, driving the enemy back and
                        recapturing our artillery.</p>
                    <p>The enemy's loss is said to be very heavy, especially in Fields' and Rodes'
                        front.</p>
                    <p>The enemy are certainly fighting with great desperation and nerve.</p>
                    <p>Sedgewick is certainly killed, and it is reported that Warren and Stevens are
                        also killed.</p>
                    <p>On other parts of the line yesterday there was nothing but heavy skirmishing.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Hays, of Louisiana, was wounded in the leg yesterday, not dangerously.</p>
                    <p>Fredericksburg was occupied by the enemy, Sunday night. The enemy have three
                        pontoons over the Rappahonock. The town is said to be filled with Yankee
                        wounded, the number being estimated as high as 15,000.</p>
                    <p>The enemy's loss thus far is believed to be fully 30,000 some have it 40,000.</p>
                    <p>Stuart's cavalry have been unceasingly fighting and pressing the enemy, and
                        have done excellent service.</p>
                    <p>Our position is very strong. Grant has issued orders congratulating his
                        troops on their success, telling them that Petersburg is in Yankee hands,
                        and urging them to fight hard.</p>
                    <p>Our troops, thought wearied, are in good fighting plight, and confident of
                        final success.</p>
                    <p>The enemy in their rapid raid around our lines captured a few of Ewell's
                        ordnance wagons, and recaptured some of their prisoners on their way in
                        Richmond.</p>
                    <p>Up to noon to-day no general engagement has taken place. There has been some
                        skirmishing and occasional discharges of artillery, on our right.</p>

                    <p>We have been furnished with the following interesting letter, written by an
                        intelligent gentleman who was a witness of the scenes he describes:</p>
                    <p>Camp Near Spottsylvania. <lb/>5 A. M., Wednesday, May 10, 1864. </p>
                    <p>My Dear---: We have now been a week on the war-path, fighting more or less,
                        daily. I have not had time to write before. We repulsed all the attacks of
                        the enemy on our left on Saturday, and pressed them closely. We buried on
                        that day 1800 Yankees, in front of our corps alone and left fully 900
                        unburied. The enemy moved on down the river that night and we followed and
                        kept along their flank on Sunday, skirmishing as we went. Rosser and the
                        rest of the cavalry fighting their advance with desperate valor--losing many
                        killed and wounded.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Early was put in command of Hill's corps, as Hill was sick, Anderson of
                        Longstreets, he being wounded. The lines marched not more than 1 to 1 1/2
                        miles apart. Our cavalry fought back the advance of the enemy at
                        Spottsylvania C. H., but had to yield. They wished to pass that way by the
                        Brook road, but just then Anderson's advance got there and received them
                        from behind some breastworks the cavalry had thrown up and gave them a
                        decided repulse, driving them back and holding them there. The 2d corps
                        followed the 1st and the 3rd brought up the rear and had a brush with the
                        enemy in passing. We took up a line on the South Side of the Ny river, our
                        right being 3-4 of a mile East of Spottsylvania C. H., and 1-2 mile in
                        front, then carving Northward and Westward, but nearly parallel to the
                        Rappahannock river, the enemy being across the Ny and enclosing a segment of
                        a circle, their left being below Fredericksburg and their right near
                        Chancellorsville, there was skirmishing and maneuvering for position and
                        fortyfying on Monday. Tuesday the enemy attacked our lines, first in one
                        place, then in another, massing divisions to do it, but we repulsed them in
                        every instance until late in the day. They advanced three divisions quietly
                        up a hill, our breastworks being down on the other slope a short distance,
                        and then came rushing over the hill and carried it by assault, before we
                        could fire more than 2 rounds, capturing our artillery there. They ran over
                        Dole's and part of Daniels' and the "Stonewall" Brigades. But their triumph
                        was short, for the rest of the Stonewall and Battle's brigades turned on
                        them in gallant style and drove them back in rout, re-capturing our
                        artillery. The enemy came on again but was served in the same way. They made
                        as many as eight desperate charges on some parts of our lines and must have
                        suffered great losses as they were repulsed at all points.</p>
                    <p>In the P. M., Gen. Early gave them a "Jackson flank," to meet their right,
                        carried 3 lines of entrenchments and drove them then nearly 2 miles,
                        capturing a good many, &amp;c., &amp; c.</p>
                    <p>We remain in the same position to-day--i.e. with Early advanced on the
                        enemy's right and I suppose we shall renew the fight to-day.</p>
                    <p>Col. Higginbotham of the 25th was killed and I think Col. Brokner of the
                        44th. We have great cause for thankfulness at our great success against such
                        enormous masses. The enemy had 15,000 wounded in Fredericksburg day before
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Yours truly, <lb/>J. H. </p>
