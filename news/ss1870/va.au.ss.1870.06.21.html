                    <p>For the Spectator</p>
                    <p>"The land which we were dreaming."</p>
                    <p>BY MYRTLE</p>
                    <p>"A thousand glorious actions, that might claim</p>
                    <p>Triumphant laurels and immortal fame,</p>
                    <p>Confused in clouds of glorious actions lie,</p>
                    <p>And troops of heroes undistinguished die."</p>
                    <p>God has been good indeed in his distribution of beauty in nature. Here we are
                        encircled with mountains, towering in their dignified tranquility, speaking
                        alone in their language of beauty, and the heart, with clouds of
                            insence offered in gratitude that they are of the sisterhood
                        that was made holy by the temptation and transfiguration; the one showing
                        the strength of the strong arm of deliverance, and the other showing the
                        symbol of glory that awaits the faithful. Stretching out in their broad,
                        expansive, verdure of spring are plains dotted with hills and forests as if
                        reaching to tell to other lands their beauty and wealth. -- Water laughing
                        in the sunlight as do happy thoughts in a beautiful soul, rippling joyously
                        over moss-covered rocks, reminding one of life of heart with living verdure;
                        sometimes gliding smoothly on, reaching out here and there, widening as does
                        the influence of the good, silently but surely -- then again deep and still,
                        all, all flowing on to the eternity of waters as we to the eternity of
                        souls. Shadows, gliding over meadows as swiftly as sorrow over a little
                        child's heart, when it has been soothed by its mother -- sunlight, gleaming
                        as brightly as words of blessedness falling from lips of love to the
                        burdened soul -- spring-life, echoing music over hill and dale, borne by
                        breezes from Cuba's aromatic bowers -- all, all is life and joy in nature.
                        Can there be such a thing as death amid such
                        beauty.</p>
                    <p>Beautiful hopes were those that we anchored upon a nation's birth "in the
                        land where we were dreaming" six short years ago, and when our faith was
                        shipwrecked we felt there was nothing to live for. O! it went down, down
                        amid the crash of bleeding hearts, mourning for those who died in vain --
                        its memories live in the maimed -- the wrecked in heart -- in life -- in
                        fortune; we saw then with the vain human eye which looked only at the
                        present with its utter desolation, we could not feel that the dying were the
                        blest. Humanity will yearn for departed hopes and our hearts will ache for
                        one more look from the death-sealed eyes of loved ones. There is something
                        so holy in our thoughts of the dead, we do not mingle humanity's faults with
                        immortality's perfection -- they have rights inviolably their own, and bad
                        and cowardly is the heart that would reach into the defenseless grave to
                        recall aught that would detract from its sacredness. We clothe the dead with
                        mantles of charity and honor, but how much more closely do we wrap these
                        habiliments around the forms of those who died for our defence -- died for what they believed to be right. Our
                        conquerors have much to perpetuate in history of their dead who died
                        fighting for a great nation's preservation, they fell for something, at
                        least they conquered. -- Ours is the "Lost Cause." We sit down amid our
                        tears, and hug to our aching hearts memories made sacred because there were
                        beautiful dreams of what was to be. We awoke, found all chaos, and now our
                        hearts take up the refrain "what might have been."</p>
                    <p>This beautiful valley boasts of the life, the home and grave of him whom
                        immortality baptized "Stonewall Jackson" -- in its every hill, mountain and
                        plain has been made sacred by the echo of his cannon's boom -- whose
                        villages and towns and byways have been honored with his veteran's marches
                        -- whose peoples' hearts have glowed with joy at his victories and whose
                        eyes have wept at his defeats. Here lived, suffered and died the sad,
                        courteous, knightly Ashby. His memory is immortalized in our hearts for we
                        loved him because those we loved followed even to the grave. Manly hears
                        groaned inward sorrow, and woman's tears fell thick and fast when from heart
                        to heart the current passed that "Ashby is dead."</p>
                    <p>There are moments, yea, times in every life when we feel that we are
                        powerless, when we reach out our arms for strength to battle with life, and
                        when we gather them again to our hearts and find we have grasped a phantom.
                        -- But Ashby sleeps well -- his own Shenandoah's waters murmur his requiem
                        -- loving hands will cover his grave with immortelles, and in that "Far away
                        land of the soul," he gathers his brother to his heart and they are one.</p>
                    <p>Here in this secluded spot where Tacite reigns Priestess, sleep those who
                        followed Jackson and Ashby. No proud shaft rises to tell of the score who
                        went out from amongst us -- but this is emblazoned on the record kept by
                        hearts that knew them -- they did their duty. -- Collectively we know they
                        were a band of heroes -- individually we embalm their names and memories
                        with all that is holy. Some of these household bands sleep where Delaware's
                        waters silently keep watch, laving their graves with her misty dew, as their
                        loved ones here soothe their lonely hearts with tears shed for them. -- We
                        know they fell for us even there, though they cannot sleep where Southern
                        vines are dressed, yet their spirits can hover around us. -- Here lies one
                        who died in the bosom of home -- who fell asleep calmly and quietly amid the
                        sobs of motherless sisters and wifeless fathers. Another closed his eyes in
                        a dreary hospital, with but one to bear messages home. Another with
                        blessings upon wife and children, consecrating them to his God, leaving such wealth of faith and trust in the goodness
                        of God that we know he was a man in Christ. -- To
                        another, another, another death came, oh! so
                        suddenly, it was but stepping across a narrow deep abyss, bringing such
                        stunning grief to those who were left -- we reck but little of the strength
                        imbedded in our hearts to suffer till death comes thus. Here is one whose
                        sisters and brothers gathered in the far West to weep over him whose grave
                        they will never see. Another, another lies here -- "somebody's darling." At
                        this grave with fir and myrtle let us pause. We see carried back, back, by
                        memory's breeze to a communion season, when Christ's children were gathered
                        around Christ's table to receive comfort -- O! we needed it -- the cannon's
                        boom was heard above the voice of prayer, offered that we might have power
                        given us to bear any tidings from the battle -- the benediction pronounced
                        amid sobs of minister and people, when above the cannon's roar, the
                        thunder's roll, the rain's dash, there came a wail from a sister's aching
                        heart -- another who had gone out from a happy home, cheered by woman's
                        tearful smiles had been gathered with death's trophies.</p>
                    <p>Here at this one we are taught the lesson of patience through suffering; long
                        weary days and nights, longing for day, when no shadow of sin will darken
                        our visions of full redemption. And what of this one's history? We see a
                        handsome manly form borne from battle, wounded to a hospital, cared for by
                        one of that manly host of matrons, whom the living bless and whose names the
                        dead have carried with them to Heaven where they are recorded "inasmuch as
                        ye did it unto the least of these ye have done it unto me." We see through a
                        concourse of mourners a pale mother borne trembling to the grave of her boy.
                        O! we felt -- "there is none in all this cold and hollow world, no fount of
                        deep, strong, deathless love, save that within a mother's heart" -- but we
                        must bow the head in silence, hush the heart's murmurs, when God calls for
                        what we love.</p>
                    <p>And here is a group of graves. We feel we could linger long over this sacred
                        spot -- three of them</p>
                    <p>"Grew in beauty side by side,</p>
                    <p>They filled one home with glee;</p>
                    <p>The same fond mother bent at night</p>
                    <p>O'er each fair sleeping brow;</p>
                    <p>They rest beneath the same green tree,</p>
                    <p>Whose voices mingled as they prayed,</p>
                    <p>Around one parent knee;</p>
                    <p>They that with smiles lit up the hall,</p>
                    <p>And cheered with song the hearth."</p>
                    <p>Must we tell of this other one in this group? He followed Ashby through
                        winter's cold until he longed to pass over the cold river and live in the
                        sunlight of the celestial city. He followed Ashby through summer's heat
                        until he yearned for the land where cooling waters would bathe his aching
                        brow in the beautiful shadow of the throne of God. When Ashby fell, he wept
                        manly tears, for he loved him. -- He did his duty -- and what was duty? Ah,
                        "in the land where we were dreaming," it was to be faithful even to death.
                        "Wounded!" -- Oh! it looms in all its bitter, bitter, blackness -- the
                        midnight carriage ride -- the railroad journey, where steam even seemed
                        laggard, for what? "There are sacred moments, which like the wings of the
                        butterfly, are injured by the slightest touch of the human hand -- words
                        which no human ear ought to listen to -- tears which God alone should
                        count."</p>
                    <p>"In his cherished valley we've buried him there,</p>
                    <p>Neath her skies so blue, 'mid her flowers so fair,</p>
                    <p>And her grand old mountains their vigils now keep</p>
                    <p>O'er the grave of the soldier, there, there, let him sleep."</p>
                    <p>Those graves have their lessons of brightness and of gloom. We know that some
                        of them live as they never lived before. We know they have houses and peace,
                        and crowns and love. We know that the life of nature this beautiful June
                        morning, is but symbolical of the verdure in the Life-land that will burst
                        upon us in the resurrection morn, when we will see gathered from prison
                        grounds -- from name-less graves -- from battle-fields -- from city and
                        rural burial grounds those who, living, gave joy, who, dying, left sorrow,
                        but who are enshrined in every Southern heart -- Our
                            Dead!</p>

                    delivered two speeches. The first concerned the importance of a holy life during

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In connection with the closing exercises of the "Wesleyan Female Institute,"
                        Bishop E. M. Marvin, of St. Louis, Missouri, preached in the morning and
                        evening of last Sabbath in the M. E. Church South of this place. This
                        commodious church was filled, floor and gallery, both in the morning and
                        evening. In the morning, the text was: "Remember now thy
                            Creator in the ways of thy youth." The chief object of the sermon
                        was to impress upon the minds of the young the importance of spiritual and
                        moral cultivation, -- that their thoughts should be occupied with subjects
                        which tend to elevate and refine the spiritual nature -- that it was true
                        that if a child be trained in the way he should go, when he became old he
                        would not depart from it -- that it would be almost impossible for him to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>He dwelt with impressiveness upon the importance of spirit -- its superiority
                        over matter -- saying that it was more substantial than matter, being the
                        essence of all life and motion, without which matter was dead. He said that
                        no satisfactory definition of faith had ever been given -- that it embraced
                        more than belief and trust -- it was assimilation of man's spirit to that of
                        Divinity. He forcibly applied his subject to the young, particularly to the
                        pupils of the Institute by whom he was surrounded. He exhorted them to
                        remember their Creator amid all the fascination and charms of earth, amid
                        its prompt, pageantry, fashion and vanity to keep God, the highest ideal of
                        human thought, always before their minds, to strive to conform their
                        spiritual nature to his, to live to be like him, and finally to be with him
                        and enjoy him forever -- this was Heaven.</p>
                    <p>His able discourse in the evening was based upon the following text: "Do we then make void the law through Faith? God forbid:
                            Yea, we establish the law."</p>
                    <p>His introductory remarks were designed to correct the misconceptions
                        generally entertained concerning the offices and relations of the law and
                        the gospel. The main postulate of his argument was, that the law and the
                        gospel were one in nature and in design, and that the Law was as much an
                        expression of Divine beneficence as the Gospel. This was shown by proving
                        that the Divine law was the utterance of the Divine nature, and that the
                        Divine nature was love, and the essence of God's nature was love -- infinite
                        love -- and the keeping of the law was the perfect realization of sinless
                        spiritual life and happiness. The law was not a mere arbitrary rule of God,
                        but was, in the very nature of things, the only condition of sinless and
                        blissful existence, and, as such, was as beneficent as the Gospel. The
                        fulfillment of the law was the condition of moral purity and happiness --
                        its violation, spiritual ruin and death. The law was not responsible for
                        man's sin or suffering, no more than was gravitation, a beneficent law,
                        which only inflicts injury when violated. The sinner was saved in perfect
                        harmony with the law. Christ had met all its claims, and in his atonement
                        the law was satisfied, and the guilty pardoned. The law as the condition of
                        sinless existence and the Gospel as the condition of the sinner's recovery
                        to the law were one and the same. These sermons, (particularly the latter)
                        were distinguished by profound thought, clear analysis, and faultless logic.
                        The whole sweep of his argument was grand, and irresistible -- leading the
                        minds of his vast auditory, while in close sympathy with him, directly to
                        the main conclusion of his text. He evinces a mind of high cultivation, of
                        vast philosophical grasp, with splendid imagination. He is one of the most
                        natural, unaffected and spontaneous orators we have ever heard, and his
                        sermon at night was regarded as a master-piece of pulpit eloquence. He is a
                        peer among the first pulpit orator, of his church, and not only his church,
                        but Missouri has reason to be proud of a son, so good, so great, and so
                        gifted.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with the appointment by the committee of arrangements published
                        last week, about a hundred Confederate soldiers and their friends, with
                        shovels and hoes, assembled at the Soldier's cemetery on Saturday last to
                        dress and repair the graves of the Confederate dead, and to organize an
                        Association for the purpose of putting the Cemetery in proper condition and
                        keeping it so. A good deal of work was done. Those engaged in this sacred
                        work felt that it was, with them, a "labor of love." The ladies furnished
                        the needed refreshments. A meeting was held to organize the permanent
                        Association referred to above. The following is the official report of the
                        proceedings of that meeting:</p>
