<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the Spectator.</p>
                    <p>There is no subject so deeply interesting to the people of Staunton, at the
                        present time, as the extraordinary assessment, by the council, of one dollar
                        and ten cents tax on the hundred dollars worth of property, real and
                        personal, and one dollar per head water tax, which amounts with the license
                        tax to over $27,000. And this excessive and impolitic tax is about to be
                        collected from a people hardly able to meet such violent demands upon their
                        scant means, and this revenue system will result in the seizure of the
                        property of many of our confiding and unoffending workingmen.</p>
                    <p>As this tax is forced upon the tax-payers without their consent, they want to
                        know and they have a right to know, why this waste of their substance. But
                        we are told that it is to repair the damages caused by our late flood. --
                        With prudence and economy the bridges can be placed in the same condition
                        they were before the flood, without any extra tax. Let this heavy expense of
                        digging up one street and removing the dirt to another street, and digging
                        up the most substantial gutters and supplying them with inferior ones, be
                        dispensed with until the bridges are in good condition, and collect only
                        revenue enough to meet the present wants of the Town, as former Councils
                        have done, and obviate so heavy a pressure on the means of subsistence of
                        our people. To give an idea of the operation of this excessive tax, we will
                        give a case of a workingman for your calm consideration. He has a little
                        home valued at $2,000; a wife who does all the indoor work for her husband
                        and seven children, and in order to keep out of debt they do without many of
                        the comforts of life. What will be this workingman's tax on his little
                        property:</p>
                    
                        
                            City tax, at $1.10 -(2,000)
                            $22.00
                        
                        
                            City water tax at $1.00 per head
                            9.00
                        
                        
                            His watch dog
                            2.00
                        
                        
                            His tools and furniture, value $250
                            2.75
                        
                        
                            State tax
                            11.25
                        
                        
                            Total
                            $47.00
                        
                    
                    <p>Is it not a pity this workingman, who is by no means wealthy, should be
                        compelled to yield to the necessity of giving up his scanty means, as a day
                        laborer, to pay this excessive tax, leaving a bare remnant for the support
                        of his family? We do not think the judgment of the tax payers can be
                        convinced, that this excessive tax is wise, just, or proper, and we
                        earnestly and calmly ask for a modification of this tax, that the harmony of
                        our Town may not be disturbed and the tax payers driven to the alternative
                        of testing the validity of this ordinance. TAX-PAYERS.</p>
