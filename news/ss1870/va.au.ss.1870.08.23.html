<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From a communication bearing the above caption, published in the Rochester
                        (N. Y.) Union and Advertiser, we make the
                        following extract:</p>
                    <p>"A gentleman by the name of Winthrow, from Waynesboro' -- a native Virginian,
                        a merchant, and a man of intelligence and strength -- a good social,
                        princely man, who was "cleaned out" by the war, has made large efforts and
                        written much in our New York papers, and even in our own city papers, to
                        induce "Yankee enterprise and capitol" to strike in Virginia, and with some
                        success. But another gentleman, Mr. N. H. Hotchkiss, a native of this State,
                        but long time a resident of Virginia, was in our city a few days since
                        beating up recruits for the South and using such arguments as are almost
                        irresistible. This Mr. Hotchkiss is now at Baltimore, Md., and has been
                        persuaded to take the agency of the Richmond &amp; York River and
                        Chesapeake &amp; Ohio railroads, and any one to hear Mr. Hotchkiss tell
                        the story of what they want in that country and they can do for men that
                            mean business will see that a great promising
                        field is open for the true citizens of these United States in the Old
                        Dominion.</p>
                    <p>But what I was particularly desirous to say in this communication, was about
                        the Virginia Springs, and the interest Mr. Hotchkiss has in sending
                        passengers to them; for of all the places of resort for pleasure and by
                        invalids, these old Virginia Springs claim precedence. On going to Baltimore
                        one should go to No. 90 Light st., where he can take choice of routes -- by
                        rail with splendid cars, or by water to Richmond in magnificent
                    steamers."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The gentleman whose name heads this article is one of the young men of
                        Virginia who is just entering upon a career of public usefulness and
                        distinction. He gave early indications of great promise, and won laurels at
                        the University of Virginia. After his academic course was finished he
                        retired to his home and engaged in the study and then the practice of the
                        law; from the pursuit of which he was called by his countymen to represent
                        them in the House of Delegates of Virginia. -- Few young men, untrumpeted,
                        have so soon commanded the attention of the House and won its confidence,
                        and fewer, under the circumstances which have surrounded the present
                        Assembly, have continued to hold this attention and confidence. Judge
                        Cochran at the close of the late session possessed, probably in a greater
                        degree than any other member, the ear of the House, and though he rarely
                        trespassed upon its time, he never addressed it without effect. His
                        position, as chairman of the committee of finance, imposed upon him much
                        labor and called for a great mental exertion. He proved fully equal to all
                        the demands upon him.</p>
                    <p>As a clear, forcible and logical debater he had no superior in the House. He
                        was one of the few who thought for himself, and rare indeed was it that he
                        did not lead the House to his conclusion. When
                        the General Assembly was called on to elect city Judges he was selected as
                        eminently fit to wear the ermine, as well for his irreproachable moral
                        character as for his native intellect and legal attainments. For many weeks
                        he kept the question of acceptance under advisement, and finally concluded
                        that he could better serve his constituents in the House of Delegates than
                        on the Bench, and he allowed the period for qualification to pass by
                        default.</p>
                    <p>We can but congratulate the State, and especially the people of Augusta, upon
                        this determination of Judge Cochran, for if there ever was a time when
                        Virginia needed in her legislative halls men of enlarged views, with
                        learning sufficient to enforce them and character to give them weight, now
                        is that time, and Judge Cochran is precisely one of that sort.</p>
                    <p>We feel satisfied that there is a brighter future yet in reserve for this
                        gentleman, and we doubt not that his constituents will be quite ready to
                        secure his abilities and retain his services until the State shall demand
                        him for a yet more enlarged arena.</p>
                    <p>Judge Cochran has it in his power to win the highest honors, and for him we
                        have not the fear that the glitter of present place will withdraw him from
                        the earnest pursuit of those studies necessary to make the finished
                        statesman. He has youth, strength, health and intellect, polished by a
                        generous education, needing only the spur of ambition to meet the fullest
                        hopes of his friends.</p>
