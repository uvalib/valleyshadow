<b>The School System</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Norfolk Virginian criticized the Underwood Convention's plan for public
                    schooling as compared to the educational system in the Northeast. Claimed that
                    differences in population density make this system unsuitable for the more rural
                    populations of the South.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In nothing, says the Norfolk Virginian, has the
                        folly and incompetency of the Underwood Convention been more clearly shown
                        than in the attempt to introduce into a sparsely populated and comparatively
                        unsettled country, the county organization and educational systems as they
                        exist in the densely peopled and teeming communities of the Northern and
                        Eastern States. There these methods have gradually been introduced, subject
                        to such changes and modifications as the increasing wealth and population
                        from time to time suggested, until they have attained their present
                        proportions and development. In such a community, and with such a
                        population, it is not to be denied that the educational facilities are such
                        as to enable the citizens to educate their children in an economical, if not
                        a thorough manner; but to transplant the system here, and expect its
                        machinery to work with the same efficiency and smoothness, argues both
                        ignorance and folly. There all the people are taxed equally to defray the
                        expenses incident to the plan; here the burthens will fall with ruinous
                        weight upon a few; there the school districts are small and compact, each
                        containing, however, a sufficient number of inhabitants to fill the school
                        houses with a sufficient number of pupils to give employment to the teacher,
                        and secure the dissemination of the rudiments at least of an education to
                        the masses of the people; here the introduction of the plan will cause one
                        of two results: either the school districts will be so large that the
                        distance will deter half the pupils from attending, or the State will be
                        dotted over with empty school houses, and the people be taxed to death for
                        the construction of the buildings and the salaries of the teachers, when
                        half a dozen children, on an average, will receive the benefits of the
                        so-called education, and the whole thing will be a farce.</p>

<b>Virginia Politics</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors of the Spectator agree with the Richmond Whig that Virginia
                    politics should remain nonpartisan; instead focusing on electing honorable men
                    and passing just laws. Party divisions would merely divide the people over
                    unimportant issues.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>With the Richmond Whig, we think that the election
                        of good, honest, capable men to office, the passage of wise, wholesome, and
                        constitutional laws, and the care of our industrial affairs and of our works
                        of internal improvement, should for the present constitute the politics of
                        Virginia. We have more to fear from a heated, bitter and premature political
                        contest than from any other cause. It would be a contest between divisions
                        of our own people over mere shadows, when we should all be united and
                        harmonious in fostering common and solid interests. It ought to be the wish
                        of every good citizen of Virginia, native and adopted, white and black, to
                        place her once more on the high road to prosperity, and influence. Party
                        divisions will come soon enough without our attempting to force them
                        prematurely.</p>

                    <p>We publish below a letter issued to our citizens by the Library Association.

                        hope so laudable and advantageous an enterprise will meet with encouragement

                    <p>Staunton, Va., Feb. 19th, 1870.</p>
                    <p>SIR: -- It is sought to create a Circulating Library in this place, which it
                        is believed will be of great advantage to the community. Few of us can
                        afford to supply ourselves with large private collections of books, but by
                        the establishment of a well-selected Circulating Library every person, in
                        return for a small annual contribution, may have consant access
                        to a large and valuable collection, which will be rendered every year more
                        and more complete. Our effort has so far succeeded that we have already
                        opened a Library containing over a hundred volumes, which we hope you will
                        assist us by your subscription to increase, until finally a Library will be
                        established which will be a permanent institution -- a credit to our town
                        and an unfailing source of improvement to our people.</p>
                    <p>The terms of annual subscription have been sized at $3.50, of which only two
                        dollars thus far have been required. If one person in each household will
                        subscribe, the members thereof will have the use of one or two volumes a
                        week from the Library.</p>
                    <p>The benefit of your contribution and example is solicited. If the majority of
                        the families of the town will aid this scheme by one year's subscription,
                        its success will undoubtedly be secured.</p>
