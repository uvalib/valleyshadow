                        dead:</p>
                    <p>The citizens of Staunton having learned that the family of the late Gen. R.
                        E. Lee have expressed a desire that his mortal remains shall, for the
                        present, be deposited in the Memorial Chapel of Washington College, and that

                        o'clock.</p>
                    <p>And the citizens of Staunton feeling a strong desire to testify in some
                        public manner, their profound love and veneration for the memory and
                        character of this illustrious man, who has shed so much honor, not only in
                        his native State, but upon human nature;</p>
                    <p>It is therefore resolved that a delegation, on behalf of the citizens of
                        Staunton, be appointed to visit Lexington and unite in the ceremonies
                        intended to mark the deep sense of the great calamity that has befallen
                        Virginia in the death of him, who, next to Washington, enjoyed in the
                        largest measure the affection and confidence, esteem and gratitude of his
                        fellow citizens.</p>
                    <p>Col. B. Christian seconded the resolution and briefly explained to the
                        meeting the resolutions of the General Assembly of Virginia, which had been
                        transmitted through him by the Legislature of Virginia, to the family of the
                        deceased, and the response made by Gen G. W. Custis Lee to the request
                        therein contained.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS: -- In your paper of the 11th inst., there is a short
                        article, copied from the Vindicator over the
                        signature of "Observer," in which the writer complains of the manner in
                        which the Female Schools of our Town make their purchases. He calls it a
                            "perilous custom." We fully agree with
                        "Observer," but how can we remedy it. By the way, it is a pernicious custom
                        not entirely confined to the Schools; other institutions, and even private
                        citizens make all their purchases at one or two stores. We think this thing
                        altogether wrong, at least so far as it concerns the public institutions and
                        Female Schools of the Town, especially, when we consider that these public
                        institutions and large Female Schools were gotten up, for the exclusive
                        benefit of the mercantile community of the city of Staunton. -- No doubt the
                        Legislature of Virginia, when it chartered them, had that object solely in
                        view. We have thought seriously over the matter, and talked with friends
                        about it, and believed we had fixed upon a plan, which would entirely break
                        up this "pernicious custom." The plan we had agreed upon was this: The
                        merchants all to meet in the Town Hall, the handsomest man among them to be
                        called to the chair, and the next handsomest to be Secretary; pass
                        condemnatory resolutions, get a number of circulars printed, and send them
                        to the friends of the pupils of the different Female Schools in this place.
                        No doubt, the Principals of the Schools would take great pleasure in
                        furnishing their addresses, and any other information that might be wanted,
                        such, for instance, as the amount of clothing, book and stationery, jewelry,
                        cakes and candies, &amp;c., &amp;c., that each pupil might probably
                        purchase during the session. Such information being obtained, it could the
                        better be shown forth in the circulars, how great the advantages to be
                        gained by making all the purchases in Staunton. The custom should be
                        distributed among our merchants, in proportion to the capital employed in
                        their business. As the pupils would not need any articles in the grocery,
                        hardware, or tobacco line, the other merchants should be required to lay out
                        a certain per cent of their incomes derived from the Schools, with these
                        branches of trade. Some of the friends of our scheme think it would be well,
                        through the circulars, to request the patrons of the Schools not to bring
                        any more clothing with them for the pupils than one change of garments, of
                        the cheapest sort. This would do away with the necessity, which every
                        traveller knows is a great bother; as trunks, clothing, cakes, and candies
                        are everything else needed to make a complete outfit for young ladies
                        entering first class Seminaries, can be had in Staunton on the best terms,
                            especially if they have the money to pay down
                        for them. We thought, after reflecting over our plan that it was first rate,
                        and would soon effect the desired reform -- but alas!</p>
                    <p>"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men.</p>
                    <p>Gang aft a-gley."</p>
                    <p>On our way to the printing office, to get some handbills printed, calling on
                        the merchants to meet at the Town Hall, we stepped in to see an old friend
                        and laid our plans before him. We had a rough draft of what we intended
                        doing, which he read. After a short pause he raised his head, threw his
                        spectacles up and quietly remarked, "that our plan was not worth the paper
                        it was written upon." Said he -- "Don't you know the Principals of our large
                        Schools are persons of some independence, and like many others of our
                        citizens, make their purchases where they think best, without any regard to
                        what some of our merchants may say, or think about the matter."</p>
                    <p>We then asked him, if he thought our City Council or the Virginia Legislature
                        could do anything to remedy this terrible evil.
                        He said what I was well aware of before, that, "our City Council and the
                        Virginia Legislature were very important bodies indeed, and possessed of
                        great powers, but did not think that they could render us any aid whatever;
                        but would advise us to apply to the Congress of the United States to have
                        the Schools reconstructed; he thought it might come in as the Seventeenth
                        Amendment of the Constitution." We asked him why not as Sixteenth. He said
                        -- "he believed it was generally reserved for an article on woman's rights." And there it seemed would be
                        another difficulty in our way; we feared this Seventeenth Amendment would be
                        an infringement on woman's rights, though he
                        thinks there would be no difficulty on that score, as it could all be
                        managed very well on old Thad. Stevens' plan, outside of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>FAIR PLAY.</p>
