<b>To the Tax-Payers of Staunton</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

                    <p>GENTLEMEN: -- The election of Thursday is over, and we desire no criminations
                        or re-crimination; but while the election is over the politics and
                        principles involved in that election are not over, and may not be in our
                        generation, and as the much deplored social irritation, and unfriendly
                        demonstrations are past, the issues involved are very grave to the
                        tax-payers, and we invite, as it deserves, your earnest consideration. The
                            real and only
                        issue in the canvass was a large increase in the debt of the town, and
                        whether those who were in favor of the increased debt or those who were
                        opposed to it should be elected. And the only object of
                            the gentlemen who organized the Court-house meeting was to defeat those
                            who had been, and are still, opposed to an increase of the town
                        debt; and they have succeeded in electing some that have not one
                        dollar's worth of real property to tax, but whether they will accomplish
                        their purpose, time alone will tell. It won't do, tax-payers, to say, when
                        the tax gatherer comes around, that your hands were tied -- that you voted
                        under pledges.</p>
                    <p>No amount of ridicule can change facts, or turn us aside from what we believe
                        to be the interest of the town, in which we have a deep interest. The facts,
                        in this case, go to show that we are correct in our assertions. What are the
                        facts? The present debt of the town, now due, in round numbers, $27,650;
                        Valley Railroad subscription, $100,000; proposed increase of debt for steam
                        fire engine, &amp;c., $10,000; purchase of plot for C. &amp; O. R.
                        R. work shops $6,000; and additional Valley Railroad subscription $27,000,
                        making a total of $170,650. This is the amount of debt, then, proposed to be
                        saddled on the tax-payers of poor little Staunton.</p>
                    <p>Now, let us see what our taxes will be on the real and personal property of
                        the town, in order to carry this debt. The interest on $170,650, at 6 per
                        cent per annum, is $10,239; present amount necessary to pay the current
                        expenses of the town $10,000; add $5,000 for school purposes, and $6,000 for
                        State taxes, and you have $31,239, to be raised annually by tax on the real
                        and personal property of Staunton. You will remember, too, that the head tax
                        is reduced to fifty cents, and the license tax is prohibited by the
                        constitution of Va., which tax has heretofore paid two-thirds of the entire
                        tax of the town. So the sum of $31,239 must be levied on the real and
                        personal property. The present assessed value of the real estate is
                        $967,128, and put down the personal property at $300,000 -- a very large
                        estimate -- and you have $1,267,128, upon which to be taxed, and in order to
                        raise annually the $31,239. We must pay a tax of 2 1/2 per cent on the
                        dollar. -- To illustrate -- on a house worth $5,000 you now pay $20 tax; you
                        then will pay $125.00.</p>
                    <p>These are facts -- facts that will make the tax payer groan. We ask you not
                        to let a bitter spirit of hatred, and the false and
                            malicious cry of nigger and Radical, which was raised in this canvass to
                            cover up the real issue before the people, cause you to shut your
                        eyes to what is going on about you in the impoverished condition of our
                        town, and the burdens of debt under which our people groan. Ask the Sheriff
                        how many executions are in his hands now for collection. Do you feel like
                        entering upon this untried sea of debt and taxation? There may be a bright,
                        delusive, promise, which never will be realized, held out to induce you to
                        submit. Stop and consider before you consent to be bound by these biting
                        chains of taxation.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we will state that we still adhere to, and no amount of abuse
                        and slang can drive us one inch from the position heretofore taken, and when
                        the people understand our position they will appreciate our motives, and we
                        do not mean to have our hands tied and quietly submit to the gentlemen who
                        organized the Court-house meeting. And whenever they came before the people
                        to carry into effect the objects that prompted that meeting, we will fight
                        them at every step. Tax-payers, we ask you to investigate these facts and
                        figures for yourselves, and see "who is who," and what is at the bottom of
                        this whole affair.</p>

                    <p>ELECTION DAY. -- The election for municipal officers of Staunton resulted in
                        the election of the ticket nominated at the primary election on last
                        Tuesday. The day was a very disagreeable one, as there was a constant
                        falling of rain. The contest between the "Independent" and "Conservative"
                        tickets was spirited and brought out almost the entire registered vote of
                        both wards. Mr. Trout's majority for mayor is 74. The cry of "Radical"
                        swamped the "Independents," and they have applied themselves with fishing
                        tackle, &amp;c., preparatory to a trip up "Salt River." -- Some of them
                        have already secured tickets, guaranteeing them a "free passage."</p>
