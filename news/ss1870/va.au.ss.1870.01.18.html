<b>Admission of Virginia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator reported on the House of Representative's adoption of a bill
                    admitting Virginia into the United States. Additional amendments to the bill
                    were introduced and voted upon, and the Senate decided not to consider the
                    question at that time.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the re-assembling of Congress the question of the admission of Virginia
                        has been the chief subject of interest, and has elicited considerable
                        discussion. It would seem that the end has been nearly reached. Though it is
                        not very probable, yet it may be that even before we go to press, we may learn that the Senate, like the House, has
                        adopted the resolution declaring "that the State of Virginia is entitled to
                        representation in the United States." On Friday last, the motion in the
                        House to substitute the preamble and resolution offered by Bingham for the
                        bill reported by the Reconstruction Committee was adopted by the vote of 98
                        to 95. The preamble was then adopted by a rising vote 76 to 74. The bill was
                        then adopted by 142 to 49. The announcement of the result was received with
                        applause on the floor of the House. The bill, as passed, is as follows:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, The people of Virginia have adopted a Constitution republican in
                        form, and have in all respects conformed to the requirements of the act of
                        Congress entitled "An act authorizing the submission of the Constitutions of
                        Virginia, Mississippi and Texas to a vote of the people, and authorizing the
                        election of State officers, provided by the said Constitutions and members
                        of Congress," approved April 10th, 1869, therefore,</p>
                    <p>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
                        States of America, in Congress assembled, That the said State of Virginia is
                        entitled to representation in the Congress of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The House adjourned until Monday.</p>
                    <p>In the Senate, on the same day, the joint resolution for the admission of
                        Virginia having been taken up, Mr. Willey, Senator from West Virginia,
                        offered an amendment that the members and officers of the Legislature shall
                        take the oath prescribed in the 3rd section of the Fourteenth Amendment, but
                        also allowing the immediate admission of the State.</p>
                    <p>The amendment of Mr. Willey was adopted by yeas 45, nays 13, Messrs. Fowler,
                        Stewart and Trumbull voting in the negative with the Democrats.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wilson moved, as an additional proviso, the fundamental conditions
                        imposed by the bill reported to the House by the Reconstruction Committee,
                        which was rejected -- yeas 23, nays 35.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drake moved an additional proviso, that the Legislature shall have no
                        power to rescind the ratification of any amendments to the Constitution of
                        the United States, which, after debate, was rejected -- yeas 11, nays 44.</p>
                    <p>At the night session, a message was received from the House announcing the
                        passage by that body of the bill for the admission of Virginia, which was
                        read.</p>
                    <p>The Senate decided not to consider, at that time, the bill adopted by the
                        House, and proceeded with the consideration of its own bills. At 10 o'clock
                        P. M. the Senate adjourned till Monday -- yesterday -- with the
                        understanding that a vote would be taken at 4 o'clock on that day.</p>
