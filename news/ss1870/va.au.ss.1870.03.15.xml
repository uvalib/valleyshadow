                    <p>We think the experience of the past week has fully proved the promptness, and
                        efficiency of our fire department. The fire of Wednesday morning, though
                        occurring at two o'clock A.M., an hour when the whole town was wrapped in
                        sleep, had burned scarcely ten minutes, when they were upon the ground,
                        playing a stream of water on the light, dry wood buildings adjoining; thus
                        saving them from inevitable destruction. But for the timely assistance
                        rendered, it is difficult to say where the flames would have been arrested,
                        or how many poor families would have been turned homeless on the charities
                        of the Town.</p>
                    <p>The fire of Thursday night broke out in a locality, and among material
                        peculiarly adapted to make wide-spread destruction, and but for the prompt,
                        well-directed efforts of the fire department, such would doubtless have been
                        the result. We have been lookers-on at fires in large cities, where paid
                        fire Companies and paid Police were supposed to render all aid, and to the
                        credit of this fire organization we can truly say that we never saw a more
                        efficient, better-governed body of men -- respecting private property, and
                        zealous to do their whole duty -- than this Company shows, and from our
                        citizens, they deserve something more than mere thanks. Should
                        property-holders lose twenty or thirty thousand dollars in some fire --
                        likely at any time to occur -- they would then awaken to a sense of their
                        duty; but would that not be locking the door after the horse was stolen? To
                        any one who will ask himself what destruction either of these fires might
                        have done, had the nights been windy, and then consider the inadequacy of
                        the apparatus of the Fire Company to prevent it, this appeal will not be in
                        vain. This Organization is made up of our best young men -- they have given
                        not only their time, but largely of their private means to promote the
                        efficiency of this body. -- No one receives a single penny for his services
                        -- they certainly deserve to be well provided with suitable apparatus.</p>
                    <p>No more competent officers, or willing and self-sacrificing men can be found
                        in any Town or City than those who make up this body. -- They deserve a new
                        Engine, Hose, and a Hook and Ladder carriage fully equipped; the necessity
                        of which is evident to every one, knowing anything about this perilous
                        business. We ask you, as a Town Corporation, Insurance Companies and
                        individual property-holders, to move in this matter. Place in their hands
                        suitable apparatus, and we are not afraid to guarantee that all which human
                        hands, with human aid, can do to protect your homes, will be cheerfully and
                        promptly done.</p>

                <summary>The Staunton fire department effectively prevented widespread property
                    damage by containing two major fires in the past week. The Spectator heavily
                    praised their efforts and asked property-holders to donate funds for the
                    purchase of new equipment.</summary>

                <summary>The paper announced that the repeal of the income tax will take effect
                    after taxes for 1869 are paid. The editors did not anticipate a revival of the
                    tax in the near future.</summary>

                    <p>The Balt. <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> says that, to the transparent
                        and infamous usurpations of the Federal Congress this journal has advocated,
                        and will advocate, active resistance where that be possible, passive
                        resistance where that is available, and non-acquiescence under all
                        circumstances and at any cost. The Fifteenth Amendment is, as all men know,
                        and none better than the Radical majority in Congress, the result of force
                        and fraud. It is not, as they know, the work of the American people. It has
                        not, as they know, been fairly ratified. It is not, as they know, legally
                        part and parcel of the Constitution. * * * * * * * If the capacity of the
                        American people for self-government be not a dream; if their hatred of
                        oppression be not a delusion; if their love of their rights and liberties be
                        not a sham, the time cannot be far distant when they will call to account
                        the knavish and reckless conspirators who are daily trampling upon the
                        Constitution and upon the fundamental principles upon which alone it is
                        possible for a Republican Government long to endure.</p>

                <summary>The Baltimore Gazette called for resistance to the fifteenth amendment.
                    Claimed the amendment was passed solely by "force and fraud" and predicted that
                    the American people would soon rally against the men who forced the amendment
                    upon the country.</summary>
