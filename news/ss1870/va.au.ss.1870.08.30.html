<b>Voters of Staunton</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Anonymous writer "VOTER" criticized the Stanton Council's efforts to
                    reintroduce the bond issue for the Valley Railroad after the county already
                    voted it down. Warned voters not to be taken in by Railroad men, who would
                    plunge the county into irretrievable debt.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We find in the papers of the Town an Ordinance, passed by the Council of
                        Staunton, August 15th, to take the sense of the voters on the 17th day of
                        September, whether the Council of said Town shall subscribe to the stock of
                        the Valley Railroad Company the sum of $50,000 in addition to the $100,000
                        heretofore subscribed. A thoughtful man cannot read this ordinance without
                        feeling that its adoption will prove ruinous to the interest, and fatal to
                        the honor of Staunton. We had hoped the vote on this question on the 6th day
                        of August, would have settled it, so far as the Town and county were
                        concerned, but we regret to find it again forced upon the Town by those who
                        presume they can carry any amount they may ask, under their coercive plan of
                        operation. And by what authority this Council has passed this ordinance we
                        cannot conceive. The action of the Council upon this question seems to be
                        environed by difficulties and embarrassments. -- There seems to be a want of
                        calm deliberation, prudence and judgment in the solution of this highly
                        important question. The effort made to coerce the Town seems to have its
                        effect upon the action of the Council, as well as upon the people. No worse
                        effort was ever made to coerce a people into a degrading submission. If you
                        don't vote whatever amount the Railroad authorities may ask and demand, we
                        are taunted with, "Staunton will not be made a point." It would be monstrous
                        if the property of this Town is to be held in the hands of these Rail Road
                        authorities, and they to dictate their own terms. At pleasure, to vote the
                        Town and county together. At pleasure, the Town is voted by itself. At one
                        time $100,000 is demanded; at another time $125,000; at another $200,000; at
                        another $400,00; at another $150,000, and we are told if this question is
                        again submitted to the county $18,000 more will be demanded. Like the
                        horse-leech, never satisfied, their cry is "more, more," under the taunt:
                        "Staunton will not be made a point." This is rather mortifying to the
                        property-holders of Staunton.</p>
                    <p>The Council is elected to avow the popular wellfare of the people, and they
                        should not be influenced by these Rail Road authorities. -- Your action, on
                        Monday night, the 15th inst., was published in the "Salem Ledger," and copied into the "Baltimore Sun," days in advance of your meeting. We give the
                        Council credit, with a desire to do that which will promote the best
                        interest of the Town, but we are forced to conclude they are acting too much
                        under the influence and advice of the Rail Road authorities. We hold, the
                        Council has no jurisdiction over this question outside of the special act of
                        the General Assembly of Virginia, approved June 27th, 1870. In pursuance of
                        the provisions of this act, this question was submitted, on the 6th day of
                        August, with the county, and the subscription was lost. There it must rest
                        until another bill is passed by the General Assembly. If the subscription
                        had been carried we hardly think it would have been contended the vote could
                        have been taken over. It is contrary to the spirit of the act to re-submit
                        this question. If therefore the Council exceeds their power and this
                        subscription is carried, and the bonds of the Town sold to pay their stock,
                        there will exist grave doubts of their legality. It is important, therefore,
                        before we vote on this question, that we should understand with clearness
                        and precision its purport and meaning. We are not satisfied with the vague
                        and indefinite manner in which this subject has been hitherto treated. If
                        this subscription is forced upon the property of the Town by an arbitrary
                        will and without authority, we say to the bond-holders, take warning. The
                        Town may adopt measures in the future in defence of its rights, and this
                        flagrant wrong will be redressed if it be in repudiation. This dishonour of our Town must ever stare us in the
                        face, for it must be apparent to any business man, that if the bonds are
                        sold in the market to pay this stock, they will not net over 50 cents in the
                        dollar and a horrible debt of $300,000 necessarily involved. Let us not
                        depend upon blind fortune, but upon the counsel of wisdom and the lights of
                        experience. Staunton is to-day the most enterprising and thriving inland
                        Town in Virginia, and it is due to the rich and populous county of Augusta,
                        and we must look to the county for our future prosperity, and not the
                        building of Railroads, therefore we should at all times cultivate friendly
                        relations with the citizens of the county, and offer all the inducements in
                        our power to secure their trade and stand ready and willing to subscribe our
                        proportion with the county in any great improvement, but not afflict and
                        harrass ourselves with a frightful Rail Road debt.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the process of reconstruction commenced, says the Richmond Whig, the Radical leaders in Congress and all the
                        power of the Government have been directed to the end of achieving Radical
                        victories in the South. -- They have acted on the idea that the Radical
                        party was the Government, and that all measures for building up that party,
                        including force and fraud, were legitimate. They attempted to make
                        Radicalism the test of patriotism and loyalty, and to place under the ban
                        all who did not conform to it. To strengthen their party in the South, they
                        gave suffrage to the negroes, and to clinch the nail, inaugurated military
                        Government and created the Freedmen's Bureau. The negroes, being ignorant
                        and inexperienced, they officered them with carpet-baggers and adventurers.
                        They then set them to the work of making State Constitutions that should be
                        in harmony with the principles of the Radical party. In one word, they
                        resorted to all the measures they thought necessary to give ascendancy to
                        their party in the Southern States, and to maintain that ascendancy for all
                        time.</p>
                    <p>For a while they thought they had succeeded, and felicitated themselves upon
                        their success. But the election of 1869 in Virginia was a stunner. It showed
                        them that their cunningly contrived scheme had failed. We broke through
                        their arrangements as if they were so many cobwebs, and succeeded in
                        establishing a Conservative State government. After a year, North Carolina,
                        with more to contend against than we had, has followed our example. South
                        Carolina and Louisiana are organizing movements looking to the same result,
                        and all the Southern States, that were so cunningly fixed up, are preparing
                        to do the same.</p>
                    <p>It has become plain to the whole country that the Radical plan to establish
                        and perpetuate Radicalism is a failure.</p>
