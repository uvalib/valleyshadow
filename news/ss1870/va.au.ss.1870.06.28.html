<b>Voters of Augusta</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Augusta" gave his own extensive opinion about the subscription to the
                    Valley Rail Road. He counseled patience, recommending that the county wait until
                    they are out of debt to invest in the railroad. Otherwise, their investment will
                    end up in the hands of the owners and lawyers of the railroads who would likely
                    make decisions detrimental to the county's interests.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>You will soon be called upon to vote $300,000 to the stock of the Valley R.
                        R. The importance of this question cannot easily be exaggerated. It is one
                        of the most important ever submitted to the
                        Tax-payers of the county, except, perhaps, the question of $300,000 to the
                        Chesapeake Road, which you promptly voted down. Our object in discussing
                        this important question in this article is, that we may understand more
                        fully and clearly the vague and indefinite promises upon which we are asked
                        to mortgage our homes to the amount of $300,000. What principal question,
                        then, can be more momentous to the county this hour, than the one before us.
                        We ask you, voter, to ponder it well, understand it well, and know its
                        extent, before you cast so important a vote, and after a careful
                        investigation, see if you can afford to tax yourself with this enormous debt
                        of $300,000. It is no holiday sport, but dollars and cents, to be dug out of
                        the ground, or your land sold to pay it, and the interest for 30 years (of
                        $540,000), making an enormous total of $840,000. Let us glance a moment at
                        the promises made by the interested parties to catch the voters, and induce
                        them to vote $300,000 to the Chesapeake Road.</p>
                    <p>They appealed to the pride of the county -- they told us if we did not vote
                        the subscription the Road would not be built -- all dependent on Augusta. We were told of a market, at city prices,
                        at our very door -- we were told that the Baltimore
                            &amp; Ohio R. R. would be compelled to build the Valley R. R. in
                            self-defence.</p>
                    <p>The Chesapeake Road is now under contract, and about 6,000 hands at work; has
                        a single promise been fulfilled? -- have you a regret that you voted No? Now
                        to the main question. -- We are asked to vote $300,000 to the stock of the
                        Valley R. R. We will state a few among the many delusive promises and
                        advantages upon which our votes are claimed for this important question:</p>
                    <p>1st. One Hundred Dollars per acre for good farms will be as common as $40 is
                        now.</p>
                    <p>2nd. Population and capital will flow in streams into the county.</p>
                    <p>3rd. Out mineral resources will at once attract attention.</p>
                    <p>4th. We have use for a rival line which will save us 30 cents on a barrel of
                        flour.</p>
                    <p>5th. The competition of the Road will relieve us from paying the interest any
                        longer than 2 or 3 years.</p>
                    <p>6th. Give us this Road, and wealth and prosperity will be our future history.</p>
                    <p>A second paradise. Is not this enchantingly grand? Can you permit yourself
                        for a moment to doubt these fond imaginings? Now let us bring these fond
                        anticipations down to the ordeal of stern facts. Would any one endorse a
                        bond for $25 upon such promises, much less vote the county bonds for
                        $300,000. And we assert without fear of contradiction that there is no
                        Valley R. R. Company, and we think this can be demonstrated by a letter from
                        the employed council of this so-called Company, published in the Spectator,
                        May 31st. Who are the stockholders? -- is there one private stockholder? Not
                        one. Towns and counties in the Valley, $1200,000; Baltimore City,
                        $1,000,000; Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Company, $1,000,000; (Baltimore
                        City and Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. are one). Mr. Garrett, President of
                        the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company, in a speech made in Louisville as late
                        as June 1st, at a meeting of Railroad men, said: "The Baltimore &amp;
                        Ohio R. R. Company is now engaged in opening a line through the Valley of
                        Virginia. Of this line 108 miles are already in operation from Harper's
                        Ferry to Harrisonburg." Is it not manifest there, that this Road will be
                        under the exclusive control and management of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
                        Company -- a greedy monopoly, whose income is already a million of dollars
                        per month. Be not deceived and cheated. If you vote $300,000 it goes into
                        the hands of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company, and not to the Valley R.
                        R. Company. If we are mistaken and do not state facts, is it not important
                        then for us to know into whose hands the bonds of the county will go, and
                        who will control them. Who is to be made rich at the expense of the Company.
                        -- Who is to be responsible for the promises made? What security has the
                        county that they will be complied with? Who is pressing with such untiring
                        energy, this question on the county? Is it not done by the inordinate
                        ambition of one single man? We ask these questions for the simple purpose of
                        putting the voters on their guard. The plain question is: -- Shall we vote
                        the Bonds of the county for $300,000 and place them in the hands of the
                        Balt. &amp; O. R. R. Company, without any security that one dollar of
                        either principal or interest will ever be paid back. You will be in the
                        hands of a foreign corporation which can at any time vote themselves such
                        salaries and subsidies as they may choose. Holding 2/3 of the stock of the
                        road, will not this overshadowing power absorb the last farthing and run the
                        roads in their exclusive interest, with utter disregard to the interest of
                        the county? Can the county go to the stockholders meetings? -- We think not.
                        Who then will represent the county? Will it not be some Lawyer, who has his own interests to advance and not the
                        interest of the county. Are these questions to be kept hidden from the
                        county? No! let us canvass them -- let us talk about them whenever we meet
                        -- let us explain to our hands on the farms and in the workshops -- let
                        there be great excitement, as there is great interest at stake.</p>
                    <p>We have stated truly and plainly the position you will be placed in, if you
                        vote the Bonds of the county for $300,000, with the present security. If the
                        Balt. &amp; Ohio R. R. will step forward and secure the interest and
                        principal, as you secure your bonds to them, we say then, and not until
                        then, will we give the county bonds.</p>
                    <p>We ask you in all candor are you prepared with the present lights before you,
                        to put your property under contribution for 30 years to a foreign
                        corporation and by your own votes put a burden of taxation upon yourselves
                        and your children, which you will scarcely be able to stand, together with
                        the heavy taxation which must follow the introduction of the new and untried
                        machinery of the State constitution.</p>
                    <p>The completion of the Valley R. R. to Salem is to be devoutly wished for; but
                        let us have patience and wait for the gradual development of our lands with
                        the wants of the people, and for the present be satisfied with the
                        Chesapeake &amp; O. R. R. to Richmond, and connecting with Petersburg,
                        Norfolk, and O. &amp; A. R. R. to Alexandria, Washington and Baltimore,
                        which is 20 miles nearer Baltimore than by the Valley R. R. These will serve
                        our purposes until we get out of debt, and a more efficient mode is
                        presented of building up our county.</p>
                    <p>We understand that a proposition has been made, that the Town of Staunton in
                        addition to the $100,000 already subscribed, shall take her proportion of
                        the Company's $300,000 -- thereby throwing into the county 900 votes to
                        carry the $300,000. If this be so, in the name of Augusta county, we protest
                        against the fraud. This subject deserves earnest consideration. Go to the
                        polls as members of the same family. Let every one cast his vote for or
                        against giving $300,000 to be placed in the hands of the B. &amp; O. R.
                        R. or in the hands of the President of the V. R. R. Let us have a clear
                        decision, leaving no room for complaint.</p>
                    <p>AUGUSTA.</p>
