                    <p>Every member of permanent society is interested in the prosperity of the
                        whole society, and the prosperity of the whole can be best served by making
                        each member prosperous. A strife between races destroys the weaker, while it

                        friendly relations. But the colored race is infinitely more interested to do
                        so than the race which is more numerous and more powerful.</p>

                        Port Republic, where, under the immortal Stonewall Jackson, the tide of
                        invasion was rolled back from our county border, and where so many fell who
                        now sleep their last sleep within our own quiet cemetery. That day will this
                        year fall on Thursday. An arrangement for a fitting memorial will, in due
                        time, be announced. A procession will be formed at 9 o'clock, A.M., on Main
                        street, with the head of the column opposite the Town Hall; thence to the
                        cemetery to pay this annual tribute to the memory of the faithful ones who
                        died for us. -- The business houses will be closed from 9 o'clock to 12 M.
                        The Stonewall Band, and a volunteer band will accompany the procession. The
                        female schools will be invited to attend, in column. So many of the young
                        ladies are from distant Southern States, that it is well they should witness
                        and bear testimony to many bereaved homes in the far South, how faithful we
                        keep watch and ward over their loved and lost.</p>
