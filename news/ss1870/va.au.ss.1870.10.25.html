<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Augusta County Fair was held last week in accordance with the
                        announcement previously published. The time was fixed before the great
                        freshet occurred which did so much damage to bridges, roads, farms,
                        &amp;c. Such was the destruction that most persons came to the
                        conclusion that it would be unwise to attempt to hold the Fair at the time
                        appointed, for they believed it would result in a mortifying failure. The
                        farmers, generally, supposed that the Fair would be postponed. But the
                        President -- Col. Jno. Baldwin -- was not so easily discouraged. He never
                        faltered; he despaired not; his decision remained unshaken; and in tones of
                        confidence, declared his purpose to hold the Fair at the time appointed. The
                        Fair has been held, and the result has justified the confidence so
                        heroically entertained by its President. -- Notwithstanding the destruction
                        of bridges -- preventing the transportation of articles for exhibition from
                        abroad, and deterring persons, from a distance, from attempting to reach
                        this place -- and the serious damage to county roads, rendering them almost
                        impassable -- especially so with vehicles -- and the incalculable loss
                        inflicted upon farmers in the destruction of crops and fencing, the Fair
                        proved to be, both in the number of persons in attendance and the number and
                        character of the stock and articles exhibited, all the circumstances
                        considered, quite a surprising success, and has had the effect of inspiring
                        increased confidence in the bosoms of those who felt any solicitude about
                        the Fair as a permanently established institution. -- Doubts have been
                        dissolved, and the most sanguine hopes have been confirmed. In future, each
                        succeeding Fair -- if the circumstances be propitious -- will exceed its
                        predecessor.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the very crowded condition of our columns this week, we will be
                        compelled to make our notice as brief as possible, and cannot speak of the
                        exhibition and the incidents attending it with that particularity which they
                        deserve, and which, under other circumstances, it would afford us pleasure
                        to do. Our remarks must be brief, they must be merely general in their
                        character.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday, the 1st day of the Fair, the weather was favorable, and the
                        number of tickets sold and the number of persons in attendance were nearly
                        equal to those on the first day of either of the preceding Fairs -- the
                        receipts being nearly as much as on the first day of the Fair last year, and
                        the number of persons in attendance being about three thousand. With the
                        exception of machinery from a distance, the entries for exhibition fell but
                        little short of those of last year, and for cattle exceeded it. -- Quite a
                        number of horses were entered, but the exhibition of horses of quick speed
                        was not as good as that of last year. That was the chief defect in the
                        exhibition of this year -- though there were some pretty good trotters,
                        pacers and rackers.</p>
                    <p>Little Eva Benedict, a child of seven Summers, with profuse flaxen ringlets,
                        accompanied by a younger sister, in an exquisite little carriage
                        manufactured by her father, with an air of composure and remarkable nonchalance, drove around the track a pair of
                        beautiful matched and harnessed goats which excited the admiration of all,
                        and intensely enthused the little boys who crowded around the miniature
                        carriage, and made the welkin ring with their merry shouts of pleasure and
                        wonder. To this tiny driver of this little team the committee awarded a
                        diploma, as will be seen by reference to the list of premiums awarded.</p>
                    <p>This was the day appointed for the balloon ascension, but the wind blew such
                        a breeze as to make it impossible to inflate the balloon sufficiently to
                        bear the weight of the aeronaut, so that, to the disappointment of the
                        expectant spectators, it had to be postponed till the next day.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday, the 2nd day of the Fair, the weather was still favorable, and
                        the number of persons in attendance was about double that of the day before
                        -- being about six thousand. In this connection we would say that in the
                        exhibition of persons, male and female -- but especially the latter -- we
                        believe that we could take the premium in a world exhibition. In this
                        respect, our exhibition of stock would be "A No.
                        1," and no mistake, and in our race, we would
                        distance all competitors.</p>
                    <p>In the trotting race, the victory was won by Wm. H. Moorman's sorrel horse,
                        "Solitude." -- Whether W. H. M. is delighted with that kind of solitude in
                        which Pope says "heavenly pensive contemplation dwells," we know not; but he
                        certainly is delighted with that "Solitude," which, like a good christian,
                        "runs with swiftness the race set before him," and gloriously wins the prize
                        of victory.</p>
                    <p>Why, upon the authority of Lord Bacon, is our friend, Wm. H. M., either a
                        wild beast or a god? Because he is "delighted with Solitude;" for Lord Bacon
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Whoever is delighted with solitude, is either a wild beast or a god."</p>
                    <p>On this day -- Wednesday -- as the breeze was not so strong as on the day
                        before, Prof. Strong succeeded in having the balloon sufficiently inflated
                        to make the promised ascension, which -- in the absence of Miss. Lottie St.
                        Clair, who was sick, else would have made the ascension as advertised -- he
                        did at about 12 o'clock to the admiration of the thousands who were present
                        and deeply interested spectators of the perilous enterprise. The balloon
                        ascended beautifully to the height of about 800 feet, when it began to
                        descend, which it did more and more rapidly till it landed the aeronaut on
                            terra firma, about three hundred yards from
                        the point of ascension. The spectators were sadly disappointed to see him
                        come down so soon, and felt relief when they discovered that he was not much
                        hurt by re-union with mother earth.</p>
                    <p>The failure of Senator Thurman to fill the appointment made by him, sadly
                        disappointed many who were anxious to hear him, as his character as a man of
                        ability and sound political views is appreciated by our people, who are ever
                        willing to honor Northern or Western men who entertain and boldly express
                        correct views of constitutional liberty. He is a Virginian by birth, whom
                        Virginia would delight to honor, as his political views and sentiments are
                        such as Virginians generally entertain.</p>
                    <p>Thursday was anticipated with great interest, especially by the young ladies
                        and gentlemen as that was the day appointed for the Tournament, Coronation
                        and Ball; but, horribile dictu, it commenced
                        raining in the morning as though another freshet was in the contemplation of
                        the clerk of the weather, and it continued to do so till noon. As a
                        consequence, these interesting exercises and ceremonies were postponed till
                        the next day, much to the disappointment of students from the University and
                        Lexington, and young ladies and gentlemen from the country. Acting upon the
                        philosophic maxim that, "what can not be cured must needs be endured," they
                        waited with as much patience as they could summon, the arrival of the next
                        day.</p>
                    <p>On Friday, the weather was favorable, and the Tournament took place, as per
                        appointment made the day preceding. Twenty-four knights entered the lists as
                        competitors for the honor of selecting and crowning the Queen of Love and
                        Beauty, and winning the prize, (horse, saddle and bridle,) offered as the
                        reward of success. When the Knights were drawn up in order by the Marshal,
                        Captain Lewis Harman, he introduced to them Wm. H. Effinger, Esq., of
                        Harrisonburg, who had been selected to deliver the charge. The address of
                        Mr. Effinger was one of the most appropriate for such an occasion which we
                        ever heard, and was delivered in good style. It was chaste and eloquent, and
                        breathed a spirit of patriotism which awoke responsive chords in the hearts
                        of all his auditors, near a thousand in number, composed of lovely ladies
                        and brave men. It was heard with delight, and, at its conclusion, the
                        speaker was warmly congratulated on the handsome manner in which he had
                        performed the part assigned him.</p>
                    <p>The following is the list of the Knights:</p>
                    <p>Maryland, (Wm. Bantz); Knight of the Valley, (J. Fred Effinger); Va. Military
                        Institute, (Alex Harman); Augusta, (S. R. Bell); Mountain Home, (L. L.
                        Abbott); Silver Star, (Jno. A. Harman, Jr.); Fort Lewis, (Jno A. McGuffin);
                        Last of the Mohicans, (John Francisco); Forrest, (Wm. B. Craig); Virginia,
                        (Samuel B. Finley, Jr.); Golden Slipper, (Jos. R. Smith); Ivanhoe, (R. F.
                        McGlamery); Red Cloud, (Thos. A. Shumate); Glenmore, (Robert Wren);
                        Rockbridge, (H. D. Lindsey); Woodland, (Brooke Eskridge); Sky Lark, (Ed. M.
                        Parker); Lone Star, (W. H. Dennison); Seven-foot Rebel, (H. F. Turke);
                        Spring Hill, (Z. McChesney); Lost Hope, (J. S. Dinkle); Rolling Wave, (O. B.
                        Roller); Kosciusko, (G. H. Edison); West Virginia, (Henry Hogshead).</p>
                    <p>The honors were won in the following order:</p>
                    <p>"Knight of the Valley," "Fort Lewis," "Augusta," "Red Cloud." The former
                        crowned Miss Louise Sheffey, Queen of Love and Beauty, and the other three
                        crowned, respectively, the following Maids of Honor: Miss Mary Lewis Trout,
                        Miss Kate Smith, and Miss Martha Welsh.</p>
                    <p>The coronation ceremonies were performed in the dining room of the American
                        Hotel. -- In the absence of the orator appointed to deliver the coronation
                        address, that duty devolved upon Col. Jno. B. Baldwin, who delivered an
                        appropriate and humorous impromptu address, after which the coronation took
                        place, and the Ball commenced and continued till one o'clock in the morning.
                        There were about one hundred who participated in the dance on this joyous
                        occasion, and "all went merry as a marriage bell."</p>

<b>The Merchants of Staunton</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In response to damaged transportation done to the state canals through
                    recent flooding, the editor pleaded with local merchants to set up a wagon line
                    to stimulate trade with Rockbridge County. Insisted such a move would promote
                    valuable trade and lessen jealousies between the two counties over the long run.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We doubt if there is a town in the State that can boast of a more energetic
                        and intelligent set of merchants than our own. They are generally active,
                        vigilant, industrious and upright in their dealings. They are keen to
                        perceive an opportunity of extending their business and prompt to avail
                        themselves of it. -- Such an opportunity now offers itself, and we
                        respectfully beg to call their attention to it, that they may seize on and
                        make the most of it.</p>
                    <p>The recent destructive freshet has seriously damaged the North River Canal,
                        and also the James River Canal. It has likewise swept away the bridges at
                        Lexington, at the Rockbridge Baths, and at Strickler's two miles above the
                        Baths. Months must elapse before the Canals can be repaired and the bridges
                        replaced. Meanwhile a large portion of Rockbridge is cut off from its most
                        convenient means of access to market down the River to Lynchburg and
                        Richmond, and up the River to Goshen. In the absence of the ordinary means
                        of transportation by those routes, the next most convenient outlet to market
                        is at Staunton. It seems to us that if a line or two of wagons were
                        established between Lexington and Staunton a very large amount of trade
                        might be brought to our Town. And if, as soon as the Rail Road is in fair
                        working order, our merchants would enlarge their stocks, especially of
                        groceries, they would be able to supply the wants of Rockbridge and
                        establish a mutually beneficial trade with the people of that county. If the
                        current of trade can be made to set in this direction at present, it will
                        probably continue to flow hither for years to come. We should regard such a
                        commercial intercourse between the people of the two countries as a great
                        blessing not only in a business, but in a social point of view. It would not
                        only promote the pecuniary interests of the people of both counties, but
                        tend to dispel the miserable and contemptible jealousies, which narrow and
                        contracted men, for selfish ends, have sought to foster. The people of
                        Rockbridge and Augusta come of the same old Scotch-Irish stock. They are of
                        the same race, and marked by the same characteristics. We would like to see
                        more intercourse between them, and the relations of business and good
                        feeling firmly established on a permanent footing.</p>
                    <p>Now is the time for our merchants to move in this matter. Let the people of
                        Rockbridge be tempted to come to our town once, and we venture to predict
                        they will find it to their interest to come again.</p>
