                        prescribe the ceremonies of the Memorial Day, provide for the delivery of
                        such addresses as may be proper, and give sufficient previous notice thereof
                        by publications in the newspapers of the County.</p>

                    <p>The annual contribution shall be expended under the directions of the
                        Executive Committee, in keeping in repair the graves of the Confederate dead
                        in Augusta. The fund arising from the contributions of honorary members, may
                        be invested in a permanent fund or otherwise as the Association may
                        determine.</p>
                    <p>ARTICLE IX.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary shall inscribe the names of the members of the Association in a
                        well bound book for preservation, and the roll of members shall be published

                        gentlemen and three ladies at each precinct to collect contributions and to
                        obtain members for the Association.</p>
                    <p>Under this resolution the following appointments were made, viz:</p>

<b>Railroad Subscription by Staunton</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    Railroad, carried by a near unanimous vote.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some time since Staunton voted almost unanimously in favor of the
                        subscription of $100,000 to the capital stock of the Valley Railroad
                        Company. On Saturday last, she voted an additional subscription of $50,000
                        -- thus making her subscription of stock to that Company the considerable
                        sum of $150,000. The vote of Saturday last resulted as follows:</p>
                    <p>For subscription.....................................286.</p>
                    <p>Against subscription.................................90.</p>
                    <p>Total vote.............................................376</p>
                    <p>Affirmative majority, 196. With 90 negative votes, only 135 affirmative votes
                        were required to carry the requisite three-fifths majority, but as 286
                        affirmative votes were cast, there were 151 more affirmative votes than were
                        necessary, and it would have required 101 more negative votes to have
                        defeated the subscription. If 191 negative votes had been cast, it would
                        have required 287 affirmative votes to have obtained the requisite
                        three-fifths majority, whereas only 286 were cast.</p>
                    <p>There was no excitement, as none doubted that the subscription would be
                        carried, and the vote was consequently small. Less than half of the voters
                        in the city voted at this election.</p>

                        which successful opposition to that corrupt and unscrupulous party, which
                        has for years controlled the Federal Government to the ruin of the country,
                        is possible, is by a hearty and earnest co-operation with the National
                        Democratic party, it would be suicidal to send a Representative to Congress
                        upon any other basis.</p>
                    <p>I hope therefore we will have an early and unmistakable declaration from all
                        the candidates upon this vital matter.</p>
                    <p>AN OLD WHIG.</p>
                    <p>September 15th, 1870.</p>
                    <p>We feel warranted in saying that Mr. Stuart is uncompromisingly opposed to
                        the whole policy of centralization, usurpation, corruption and oppression,
                        practised by the Radical party in regard to the Southern States, and that he
                        will cordially co-operate with any party, and employ any and every honorable
                        means to defeat radicalism in all its forms and phases. He has no sympathy
                        with modern republicanism as represented either by Underwood &amp; Co.,
                        or by Rives and McKenzie.</p>
