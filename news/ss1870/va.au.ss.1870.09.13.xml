                    <p>The Railroad authorities in dividing $1200,000 subscription to the Stock of
                        the Valley Railroad Company, between the Counties and Towns in the Valley,
                        gave to Staunton in the division $100,000, one-tenth of the assessed value
                        of her property, while the other Towns and Counties received about
                        one-thirtieth of the assessed value of their property, and we accepted this
                        unequal amount without hesitation. After this improper and dangerous policy,
                        $50,000 more is demanded under the last that "Staunton will not be made a
                        point." And this hardship of placing the hard-earned means of the citizens
                        of Staunton at the mercy of the Valley Railroad Company, is to be forced
                        upon the tax-payers by the votes of non-property-holders, under an ordinance
                        of doubtful validity, passed by the Council without authority. And we are to
                        submit, with no protest, no opposition. Men of property, this is no trifling
                        question, for if adopted it will prove the knell of hope to the welfare of
                        Staunton, and to treat this momentous subject with indifference, is not only
                        foolish, but it is the height of madness. It is contrary to every principle
                        on which reasonable men act, in relation to their own private affairs. To
                        retain the profits of our business or to prevent the loss of a few dollars,
                        we will submit to ruinous privations, and yet we seem to remain perfectly
                        indifferent to the unreasonable demands made upon our property, and take no
                        step to put a stop to the Railroad demands that will throw a dismal gloom
                        over our future welfare and happiness. We are called upon to ratify by our
                        votes an agreement or contract between the Valley Railroad authorities of
                        the one part, and the Town of Staunton on the other part, and as prudent men
                        we should examine the provisions of this contract before voting, and see if
                        we are not driving a hard bargain.</p>
                    <p>1. We are asked to vote $150,000 to the Stock of the Valley Railroad Company
                        upon the only condition, that the Town of Staunton shall be made a point in
                        the main line of the Valley Railroad.</p>
                    <p>2. For the purpose of paying said Stock as it may be called for, the Council
                        shall appoint an agent to negotiate a loan, and issue bonds of the Town to
                        secure the same.</p>
                    <p>3. At the time the council shall make its levy for such Town, it shall levy a
                        tax on all subjects liable to State tax to pay the interest on the bonds of
                        said Town so issued, and create a sinking fund to redeem the principal
                        thereof at a period not to exceed thirty years.</p>
                    <p>4. And from year to year the Council shall repeat such assessment until the
                        debt and interest be fully paid.</p>
                    <p>Here is a solemn contract which we are asked to ratify by our votes on the
                        17th day of September, and the Town the only party in the contract bound.
                        The Railroad authorities are in no wise bound, and it is by no means
                        certain, after they receive the money on the $150,000 of Stock, we will
                        secure the Road, as we insist on no guarantee. This is a very loose and a
                        very extraordinary contract. It is a miserable Shylock bargain, and if we
                        adopt it we will find the Railroad authorities exacting the last dollar on
                        the Stock, if the Town bonds are submitted to public auction and cried off
                        in the Streets of our Towns and Cities at 25 cents in the dollar. And for
                        all this sacrifice we have the old stale and threadbare answer, that the
                        people are deeply interested in this Road because it will add value to the
                        houses -- manufactures and population will be increased, and if these
                        promises are realized it will be the first time in the history of a Virginia
                        Town.</p>
                    <p>Let us pause a moment and each one ask himself, how shall I meet the claims
                        upon my property to carry out this contract, which will remain in full force
                        and virtue for 30 long years? And in order to aid the Tax-payers to arrive
                        at an intelligent answer, we will give you a few plain figures, which we
                        think will hardly be gainsaid.</p>
                    <p>$150,000 worth of Stock upon the basis of the Council, (which will have no
                        binding force) not to dispose of the Stock at a greater discount than ten
                        per centum, and five per centum to negotiate said bonds, will create a
                        Railroad debt of $172,500; the interest on which at 6 per cent is $10,350;
                        sinking fund per annum 2,500, making $12,850, so that the Railroad tax will
                        be $1.07; Town tax $.55, State $.50, making $2.12, and we are assured that
                        the Legislature at its next session will be compelled, in order to provide
                        for the interest, and a sinking fund for the State debt, to levy a tax of
                        $1.00, and for the current expenses of the State a tax of 50 cents, so that
                        we will have a tax of $3.62 on each hundred dollars worth of property. Can
                        any observant or reflecting man say this will not be a hardship. Let us not
                        then throw a veil over our responsibilities, for when we shall have leisure
                        hereafter to reflect, we will realize the fact that we are tax ridden, and
                        that Staunton will increase in wealth and prosperity, only in proportion to
                        the increase of the County of Augusta. VOTER.</p>

                <summary>Anonymous writer "VOTER" rails against the proposed vote for furnishing
                    stock to the Valley Railroad. His concerns included the high taxes on property
                    which would accrue, further taxes issued by town and state authorities to cover
                    the stock, and the likely chance that railroad directors would squander the
                    money. Urged all voters to think very carefully about their interests before
                    voting for the stock.</summary>

                <head>A Word of Caution to the Conservatives</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The coming election of Representatives to Congress is one of unprecedented
                        importance to the Southern States. Upon its result the most vital interests
                        of the South depend. We think that there is strong ground to hope that the
                        Conservatives and Democrats may carry the next House of Representatives. But
                        the contest will be a close one. The majority, either way, will be small. A
                        single District may control the result and give the organization to the
                        radicals on the one hand, or the Conservatives and Democrats on the other.
                        In view of these facts, it is of the highest importance that the people of
                        the South should make no mistake by which they may lose a single member, and
                        thereby endanger the organization of the House, with the immense advantages
                        that may result from it.</p>
                    <p>The test-oath is general in its terms. It applies to every member, North and
                        South, unless his disabilities have been removed. It is a mistake to suppose
                        that a person who labors under no disabilities by virtue of the 14th
                        amendment, can take his seat in Congress without swallowing the test-oath. A
                        man who is not disfranchised under the 14th amendment, can sit in the <emph
                            rend="italic">State</emph> legislature or fill any <emph rend="italic"
                            >State</emph> office. But it is not so in regard to <emph rend="italic"
                            >Congress</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Federal offices</emph>. No one
                        can take his seat in <emph rend="italic">Congress</emph> or fill any <emph
                            rend="italic">federal office</emph>, without taking the test-oath, <emph
                            rend="italic">unless his disabilities have been removed by act of
                            Congress.</emph></p>
                    <p>In nominating members of Congress, therefore, care should be taken not to
                        nominate any one who does not fall within one or the other of these two
                        classes. In other words, the nominee must either be able to take the
                        test-oath, or his disabilities must have been removed.</p>
                    <p>The nomination and election of any man outside of these classes, be his
                        merits what they may, will be futile, for he will not be allowed to take his
                        seat.</p>
                    <p>We regard this as a matter of so much importance that we think the Executive
                        Committee at Richmond, ought, at once, to issue a circular warning the
                        people of the several Districts to bear these facts in mind in making their
                        nominations. It would be unpardonable for any District to endanger the
                        supremacy of the Conservatives and Democrats in the House of Representatives
                        by a blunder of this kind.</p>
                    <p>We beg leave respectfully to call the attention of the Committee to this
                        important duty, and we also request our contemporaries at Richmond to sound
                        a note of warning.</p>

                    <p>At each place of voting in the county, meetings will be held at 3 o'clock P.
                        M. on Saturday, the 17th inst., for the purpose of electing three delegates
                        to the County Convention which will be held in the Court-house at 1 o'clock
                        on Monday, the 26th inst., for the purpose of nominating county officers,
                        and for the selection of Delegates to the Congressional District Convention
                        which will meet in Harrisonburg on Wednesday, the 5th of October, for the
                        purpose of nominating a candidate for Congress.</p>
                    <p>The precinct meetings should be fairly conducted, so that the Convention,
                        composed of Delegates elected by these primary meetings, shall fairly
                        represent the sentiments of the voters of the County. There should be no
                        intriguing, and no dishonest packing -- otherwise, the chief object in
                        holding a Convention will be defeated -- that object being to secure the
                        harmony and unity of the Conservative party. If there should be good grounds
                        to charge unfairness in the nominations or improper manipulation of the
                        Convention, the effect will be to divide and distract rather than to unite
                        and harmonize the party. Such a result should be carefully guarded
                    against.</p>

                        <emph rend="italic">Messrs. Jos. A. Waddell, John Paris, Leigh R. Waddell,
                            D. S. Young, C. T. Cochran and others:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN -- I have had the honor to receive your favor of the 9th inst., in
                        which you request me to allow you to announce me as a candidate for election
                        to a seat in the next House of Representatives of the Congress of the United
                        States, subject to the decision of the District Convention, proposed to be
                        held in Harrisonburg, on the 5th proximo.</p>
                    <p>In reply, I beg leave to say, that if it shall be ascertained that your
                        invitation is in harmony with the general wish of the people of the
                        District, I will not feel at liberty to withhold such service as I may be
                        able to render.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1865, I was elected by a District, composed, in a large part,
                        of the Counties which constitute the present District, to a seat in the
                        House of Representatives, but was not allowed to qualify. Since that time,
                        my political disabilities, under the 14th amendment of the Constitution of
                        the United States, have been removed, by act of Congress, and in the event
                        of my election now, there would be no legal obstacle to my taking my seat.</p>
                    <p>It may be proper to add that if the voters of the District shall honor me
                        with their suffrages, I should labor assiduously to accomplish the
                        following, amount other, important objects.</p>
                    <p>1. The immediate removal of all disabilities, resulting from the civil war,
                        and the restoration of harmony and fraternal fellowship between all sections
                        of the country, which the abuses and usurpations of partisan power have
                        hitherto tended to prevent.</p>
                    <p>2. A tariff for revenue, to cover the expenses of an economical
                        administration, and to meet the just obligations of the Government, as
                        opposed to the existing system of exorbitant protection for special
                        monopolies, and undisguised partiality for favored interests.</p>
                    <p>3. Reduction of the present odious and oppressive scale of taxation, both as
                        applied to imports and internal revenue.</p>
                    <p>4. Rigid economy in every department of the Government, and retrenchment of
                        expenses.</p>
                    <p>5. Reform of the public service in all its branches, civil, military, and
                        naval.</p>
                    <p>6. A sound National Currency, equally distributed among the States, and
                        protected against speculations.</p>
                    <p>7. The rights of intelligent labor against all selfish combinations to
                        degrade and depreciate it.</p>
                    <p>8. Legislation by which the public lands will be reserved for actual
                        settlers, and as a resource of national credit, in opposition to the Radical
                        policy of enormous grants to speculators and corrupt schemes of
                        appropriation for the benefit of one portion of the country at the expense
                        of the other.</p>
                    <p>9. Aid from the Government of the U. S. in the most available form, to
                        complete the line of Water Communication between the Chesapeake and Ohio.</p>
                    <p>10. Strict and impartial neutrality in the contests between other nations,
                        cultivating friendship with all, and entangling alliances with none.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Gentlemen, I pray you to accept my profound acknowledgments
                        for the confidence which you have shown in me, and for the very flattering
                        terms in which you have been pleased to convey your invitation.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your ob't servant,</p>
                    <p>ALEX H. H. STUART.</p>

                    Stuart and his reply. The first letter requested Stuart to change his mind and
                    run for a seat in Congress. Stuart's reply accepted their request and outlined
                    what he would do if elected, including removing all political disabilities and
                    supporting internal improvements.</summary>
