<b>To the Citizens of Augusta County</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Progress" contributed a letter to the citizens of Augusta, asking them to
                    vote for the Railroad subscription. He presented numerous reasons why the
                    profits from the construction of the road will more than exceed the cost of
                    constructing it. Also, people should not worry about any added tax burden since
                    railroad profits would cover those as well.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads to
                        fortune and renown. This tide has just now set in towards the Valley of
                        Virginia, and especially to Augusta county, but if not taken promptly at the
                        flood, it will certainly recede and leave us stranded, high and dry, on the
                        shoals of poverty. Augusta county, situated near the centre of the Valley
                        and having one line of railway from East to West, if she will now seize the
                        opportunity offered her and secure one or both of the proposed lines through
                        the Valley, she may make herself a great railroad and commercial centre, and
                        have her inexhaustible sources of wealth speedily developed, her mines of
                        valuable ores opened and pouring out their treasures; her fields enriched
                        with cheap fertilizers; and her produce carried cheaply to the best markets;
                        -- furnaces, foundries, workshops, factories, flourishing stores with cheap
                        wares, churches, depots, and school-houses, with a teeming, prosperous and
                        happy population in all her borders. But if, in her penny-wise and
                        pound-foolish policy, she now refuses to subscribe her small quota to the
                        Valley Railroad, and thereby defeats that enterprise and discourages, by so
                        doing, the Shenandoah road, those enterprises with the capital at their
                        command, will be diverted into other channels, and go to build thoroughfares
                        and carry prosperity to sections of the country that know how to profit by
                        them. The Ches. &amp; Ohio R. R. Company have resolved to have their
                        road a direct line from Kanawha to Norfolk. (This the writer states from
                        positive knowledge direct from the parties and not by what has been
                        developed.) This will leave Staunton and Augusta with only an old circuitous
                        local railroad track of no general public value, which may be abandoned
                        altogether, unless the countries on its line will undertake to keep it up,
                        and if they do, it will cost Augusta county more to keep it up than it will
                        now to secure all the proposed railroads. Augusta county, thus cut off from
                        general railroad communication, her men of enterprise and capital will leave
                        her for better fields of operation, her young men, when they grow up, will
                        find no avenues to success at home, and will desert her to more prosperous
                        sections of the country. -- Her farms will be worn out and deserted,
                        poverty, desolation and want will brood over all her borders, and the owls
                        will hoot at their folly. -- This is no fancy sketch. We live in an age of
                        progress, and we must either ride on the wave to success, or we must be
                        content to fall back into oblivion. We cannot stand still if we would; we
                        cannot plod along in the old beaten track that our fathers did, for the
                        world has gone far ahead of their times. Our fathers kept up with the times
                        in which they lived, and we should do the same. It is as great folly for us
                        to talk of doing without railroads, steam machinery, and modern
                        improvements, as it would have been for them to have abandoned their houses,
                        farms and agricultural implements and adopted the life of the wild Indians
                        around them. And for what do you propose to sacrifice all the prosperity to
                        be had with these railroads? On account of a paltry tax that cannot, in any
                        event, exceed 1/8 of one per cent, per annum on your property, and in all
                        probability will never have to be paid at all, as it is almost certain that
                        the road will pay as a dividend that will meet the tax and yield an income
                        besides. It is true the Central road did not pay such dividends, but it
                        began nowhere and went to no place in particular. It never was finished, had
                        no connections West of Gordonsville till after the war, and was nearly
                        destroyed by the war; in other words, it was a failure -- and yet is there
                        any man in Augusta county so far demented that he would be willing to take
                        back the county subscription into the county treasury and have the Central
                        R. R. blotted out of existence? You know there is not. You have got ten
                        times the worth of your money, and, for shame, let us hear no more about the
                        pitiful $20,000. Besides, this tax, if it ever has to be paid, will not be
                        called for until 20 years from the time the subscription is made, when, if
                        we get the roads, the population and wealth of the county will be at least
                        ten times as great as now and your ability to pay proportionally increased,
                        and for every dollar you are asked to subscribe, five dollars in ready money
                        will be expended among you in building the road, relieving you of the
                        present hard times and scarcity of money. It will take at least $1,500,000
                        to build the road through the county. Consider the effect of having that
                        amount put in active circulation in the county, remember your need of money
                        to pay up old scores, and, above all, to meet the heavy taxes that are not
                        of your own choosing, but are to be imposed upon you for free schools, and
                        other Radical devices. -- Remember, these taxes must be paid, nolens volens, and where is the money to come from
                        -- from no possible source that at present can be discovered, if you reject
                        this overture of capital from Baltimore and the lower Valley counties. The
                        fact is, you must have this money, and get it by voting the subscription by
                        Augusta county, or financial ruin is inevitable. Do not content yourself
                        with voting yourself, but go to work and arouse your neighbors to the
                        importance of the crisis, and see to it that the county is saved, PROGRESS,</p>

                    <p>The county has been divided into townships, voting places established,
                        registrars appointed, and the registration of voters preparatory to the
                        election of township officers, on the 4th Thursday in this month, will
                        commence at the various precincts on this day, (Tuesday,) and will continue
                        seven days. It is important to bear in mind that, all who expect to vote
                        will have to come forward during the seven days of registration and have
                        their names recorded, to entitle them to take part in the coming election.
                        It is true the registrars will sit two days previous to the 4th Thursday to
                        revise their lists, when those who failed to come forward at the first
                        sitting can have themselves registered, but it is best and safest to attend
                        to the matter this week. Many are under the impression that, as they were
                        registered heretofore by the military authorities that ruled the State, it
                        is not necessary for them to register again. In this they are mistaken. The
                        former registration goes for nothing. We are a State now, and this
                        registration is made under State authority, and all who expect to vote must
                        be so registered. Again, some are not aware that all citizens are entitled
                        to vote, regardless of past political offences. -- While some cannot hold
                        office by reason of the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United
                        States, yet they are entitled to vote by the 3d article of the Constitution
                        of Virginia. Let the 14th amendment men remember this, and not fail to come
                        forward and register.</p>

                        State Treasury will be necessary for the future support of the Institution,
                        and in this estimate the Board of Directors express their concurrence.</p>
                    <p>The Directors express the opinion that the Western Lunatic Asylum will
                        compare favorable with any similar Institution in the United States, both as
                        to the per-centage of cures, and the cost, per
                        capita, of maintaining its inmates.</p>
                    <p>The Directors say that, it has become an imperative duty on the part of the
                        Government to make adequate provision for the colored insane, and that they
                        cannot, for a moment, suppose that the General Assembly will fail to fulfill
                        its obligation in that particular.</p>
                    <p>The importance of making suitable provision for the proper care and treatment
                        of insane colored persons was urged upon the Legislature by the
                        Superintendent of this Asylum as early as 1844, and repeated in his reports
                        of 1845 and 1848. In his last report he reiterates the importance he
                        attaches to this subject, and expresses the decided opinion that the
                        interests of both races will be promoted by having them separately treated
                        in different Institutions.</p>
                    <p>If we were asked to express briefly the chief secret of the successful
                        management of this Asylum other than skillful medical treatment, we would
                        say, in three words: "Kindness, Frankness, Firmness."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institution issued a report detailing its
                    activities and recommendations for the future. They requested additional funding

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have received the Report, for the Fiscal years 1867-'68 and 1868-'69, of
                        the Board of Visitors of the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind
                        to the General Assembly of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The Report of the accomplished Principal, Prof. J. C. Covell, for the year
                        1866-'67, contained an interesting and valuable history of the Institution
                        from its establishment to that date, which is reprinted with this Report as
                        it was not acted on by the Legislature to which it was addressed, and that
                        body is asked to give favorable consideration to its recommendations.</p>
                    <p>The Report strongly presents the reasons for asking the Legislature to make
                        the following appropriations:</p>
                    <p>1st. That $15,000 be added to the present annuity, thereby making it $40,000
                        per annum.</p>
                    <p>2nd. That a special appropriation of $4,604.77 be made to liquidate the debt
                        incurred in 1867, by making additions to the steam apparatus for warming
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>3rd. That a special appropriation of $13,000 be made for the erection of
                        laundry buildings and piazzas.</p>
                    <p>At the date of the report there were 92 deaf-mutes and 39 blind pupils. Since
                        the establishment of this Institution in 1839, the whole number of
                        deaf-mutes admitted is 352, and the whole number of blind pupils is 178 --
                        the whole number of pupils admitted into both departments being 530. In lieu
                        of commendations of our own respecting the management of this Institution in
                        all its departments, we copy the concluding paragraph of the report of the
                        learned committee of examination, which reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>"We cannot close this report without expressing our deep conviction of the
                        faithful management everywhere exhibited in this Institution. -- In our
                        observation through the day, we saw the happy results of executive ability,
                        faithful and earnest administration, and paternal kindness to the
                        unfortunate recipients of this great State charity. Supported in his efforts
                        by a corps of experienced teaches, and by the assistance of a
                        faithful steward and an excellent matron, we feel confident the Principal
                        will realize, as heretofore, the object of his toil, and keep his
                        Institution in the first rank of similar benevolent enterprises in the
                        land."</p>
