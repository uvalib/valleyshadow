<b>A Word to Anti-Subscription Voters</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Explained the reasons why the Valley Railroad subscription went down to
                    defeat. Though disappointed, the editor did not lose hope and believed that a
                    lot of people who voted against the measure will have second thoughts.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As we stated last week, the defeat of the subscription by this county of
                        $300,000 to the capital stock of the Valley R. R. Company was due chiefly to
                        the fact that the impression was successfully made in the Eastern portion of
                        the county that the Shenandoah Valley R. R. would be built through that part
                        of the county without cost to the citizens along its line. Though this was
                        the chief cause of the defeat of the subscription
                        to the Valley Road, it was not due wholly to that
                        cause. Many in the county voted against the subscription because they
                        believed that the town was allowed to vote on the question for the purpose
                        of carrying the subscription though a majority in the county might vote
                        against it -- that it was done on the theory that the affirmative majority
                        in the town would exceed the negative majority in the county, and thus the
                        subscription would be carried. Taking this view of the subject, and wishing
                        to rebuke what they conceived to be a purpose to force the subscription,
                            nolens volens, upon the county, quite a
                        number, we believe, voted against the subscription, who, otherwise, would
                        not have done so. We believe that the voters of the county, if the question
                        be submitted to them free from "entangling alliances with the town, will
                        vote a subscription of $200,000. What we now desire to see is a movement on
                        the part of the voters of the county to have the
                        question of subscribing that sum submitted to their vote. We would be
                        especially pleased to see this movement inaugurated by those who voted against the subscription. It would present a noble
                        spectacle, and furnish opportunity to win honor and enviable distinction
                        which is but seldom vouchsafed. Those who are now reproached for defeating
                        the subscription necessary to secure the other conditional subscriptions
                        amounting to $2,900,000, and thus defeating wholly this great and valuable
                        Railroad project, would then have the credit of securing the amount
                        necessary to make this great improvement, and they would be hailed as public
                        benefactors, and their praises would be on every tongue.</p>
                    <p>The Railroad men -- builders of improvements -- now value you as of little
                        worth; but will not the stone rejected by the builders become the head of
                        the corner? We do not despair yet of obtaining a subscription by the county
                        to this improvement, which would be so prolific of benefits to the county.
                        We appeal to the calm reason, the dispassionate reflection, the careful
                        calculation, the enlightened self-interest of the voters of the county. We
                        have great confidence in the sober second thought of our people, and believe
                        that they will not fail to reverse the decision they recently rendered. It
                        would be manly in them to have the independence to do so. We appeal from an
                        excited and biased, to a calm and unprejudiced judgement.</p>

<b>Subscribe Stock to the Valley R. R.</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Called on Augusta voters to reverse the humiliation of the defeat of the
                    Valley Railroad subscription by privately investing in the railroad. Claimed the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The defeat of the subscription to the Valley R. R. is not only unfortunate on
                        account of its jeopardizing that important enterprise, but it places Augusta
                        county in the unenviable position of having, by her opposition, and arrays
                        against her the opinion, prejudices and interests of all the other counties
                        of the Valley. She thus stands in a humiliating position which she has never
                        before occupied. A plan has been adopted to enable Augusta to make up, by
                        private subscription, what she, in her corporate capacity, has failed to do.
                        Many of those who voted against the tax, declared their willingness to make
                        private subscriptions. They now have a chance to show their sincerity. The
                        friends of the Road can at least subscribe what they would have paid in tax
                        if the vote had been in its favor. Let all who feel able subscribe at once.
                        The time is short. What is done must be done quickly. All subscriptions thus
                        made must be in before the 1st of September. If you feel able and willing to
                        subscribe anything, hunt up one of these papers and subscribe at once. There
                        are a large number of them in circulation. Remember this opportunity to
                        retrieve the credit of Augusta County will only add doubly to the prejudice
                        against her, if it be lost.</p>

                        were adopted, recommending the Town Council to submit to the vote of the

                    <p>There were some voters in the county who voted against the subscription by
