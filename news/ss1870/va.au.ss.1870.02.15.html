<b>Gov. Gilbert C. Walker's Inaugural Address</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Inaugural Address of Republican Governor Gilbert Walker. Walker alluded
                    to the tremendous responsibilities of the Legislature, and the prospects for
                    economic development. He closed with an appeal to universal suffrage, universal
                    amnesty, immigration, and national expansion.<br>

                    <p>
                        Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of
                        Delegates:
                    </p>
                    <p>Accept my hearty congratulations that you are again seated in this hall,
                        clothed with all your rightful powers and functions. You are to-day the
                        lawfully-constituted General Assembly of the Sovereign State of Virginia.
                        Notwithstanding "fundamental conditions," as futile as unnecessary, you are
                        the Legislature of a State co-equal in all her rights and prerogatives with
                        any and every other State in the American Union. Your powers and duties are
                        no longer "limited and qualified," save by a Constitution almost unanimously
                        adopted by the people, and by the Constitution and laws of the United
                        States. You are no longer subject to the domination of a power in its very
                        nature antagonistic to the genius of republican institutions. No; you have
                        been emancipated from this as well as from the fears and doubts and terrible
                        uncertainties which enshrouded the future. Our people are secure once more
                        in the exercise of their own affairs with public servants elected by and
                        amenable to them alone. Surely in all this there is abundant cause for
                        "rejoicing with exceeding great joy." The voice of Virginia is again heard
                        in the national councils. May it be potent for good! May it be heard in
                        thunderous tones demanding the application and enforcement of the great
                        principle upon which our senators and representatives, and you and I, were
                        elected -- "Equal rights to all!" Let it not cease to enforce this demand
                        until every hated test-oath shall have been erased from the national statute
                        books, nor until "political disabilities" shall be known no more among men.
                        You and I have qualified by taking the same oath of office. We have solemnly
                        pledged ourselves before high Heaven to support and maintain as well the
                        Constitution and laws of the United States as of the State of Virginia; that
                        we "recognize and accept the civil and political equality of all men before
                        the law;" and that we will faithfully perform our official duties to the
                        best of our ability. A strict and conscientious observance of this solemn
                        obligation will redound to the peace and prosperity of the State and the
                        vindication of the just expectations of the people and our friends
                        everywhere. It is your duty to make the laws, mine to execute them. Fulfil
                        your duty, and I pledge you a faithful and fearless execution of mine.</p>
                    <p>Never before in the history of this commonwealth has a Legislature assembled
                        upon which devolved greater responsibilities than upon you. It is not a new
                        state you have to form -- that would be a far easier task. You would then
                        break the virgin soil where you pleased, and lay the foundation and rear the
                        superstructure of your civil polity with materials fresh quarried from
                        precedents of the past, and fashioned and moulded by the accumulated
                        experiences and necessities of the present. Not so with you now. A civil
                        polity, originated amid the throes of the revolution of 1776, and partaking
                        of its spirit, made venerable by time and sacred in the eyes of the people,
                        was suddenly overthrown by the rude shock of revolution. It fell amid the
                        clash of battle and "the clash of resounding arms." Its "broken and
                        dismembered fragments" are to be reverently gathered up by you, and with
                        these and the new materials which experience and the needs of the present
                        demand you are to rebuild the edifice of the state. The foundation is
                        already laid for you. It was designed and executed in this very hall two
                        years ago. To-day what matters it to you or me by what, if any, authority it
                        was done? What matters it though rude, inexperienced, and incompetent
                        workmen were employed in this great and delicate undertaking? It has been
                        done -- it is an accomplished fact. The wonder is that it was so well done.
                        You and I, and the people of this commonwealth, have, in the most solemn and
                        delicate manner, accepted it -- yes, and discharged both the architect and
                        the workmen. But we have not banished them. No; far from it. We shall
                        require, and I trust will have, their active aid and assistance in rearing
                        the new superstructure, which may be more grand in its proportions, more
                        harmonious and symmetrical, than the former edifice. Whether it shall be so
                        or not rests mainly with you. Success or failure is in your hands. The
                        foundation is ample. It has been laid broad and deep. Let the superstructure
                        but equal even the foundation, and no fears need be entertained of the
                        future growth and glory of Virginia. The more our Constitution is studied --
                        the more it is considered and understood -- the more will its chief
                        provisions commend themselves to our approval. True, it contains provisions
                        which, in my judgment, might be improved, but what I consider a defect you
                        might esteem a virtue. -- What constitution ever met with a unanimous
                        approval? Are they not all compromises? I doubt if ever in the history of
                        popular government there was one adopted with the unanimity of ours. And
                        while that unanimity may not be the correct measure of its popularity --
                        while other and extraneous causes rather than its real merits undoubtedly
                        contributed to this result -- nevertheless the mandate of the Constitution
                        must, and will be observed as the sovereign command of all the people. Who
                        desires or will presume to disobey them? Not you nor I. No; the Constitution
                        shall be faithfully and honestly executed. Its provisions shall have a fair
                        and impartial trial, and when, if ever, experience shall demonstrate the
                        inutility or impracticability of any of them, we will proceed to make such
                        modifications as our necessities may demand. The manifestations of punic
                        faith by others affords no justification for a departure from the paths of
                        right by us. The ancient and proverbial reputation of the people of this
                        Commonwealth for honor and integrity will be maintained, regardless of the
                        selfish and fanatical vituperation of our enemies at home or abroad.</p>
                    <p>We have but to do our duty faithfully, honestly, and manfully, and we shall
                        inaugurate along with civil government an era of prosperity, of internal
                        development, and individual and corporate enterprise, which in brilliancy
                        will eclipse the past glories of the Commonwealth. We live in a grander age
                        than any of which has preceded us. It is essentially an age of gigantic
                        material development. A continent has been bound together by sinews of iron,
                        and united to others by nerves of electricity. Lofty mountains, which formed
                        alike the boundaries and barriers of ancient nationalities, have been
                        pierced by the aggressive spirit of commerce, and the waters of that
                        turbulent sea that rudely tossed the trail bark of Aeneas, have been led
                        submissively across the arid plains of Sahara and mingled with the waves
                        that overwhelmed Pharaoh and his wicked host. What age ever witnessed such
                        stupendous accomplishments as the Pacific railroad, the ocean cable, the
                        Mount Cenis tunnel, and the Suez canal? And yet we live in and are actors
                        upon the stage of this wonderful era. And shall we supinely fold our arms
                        and, gazing only upon a dead past, glorious though it may have been, refuse
                        to live and move in and be of a grander present?</p>
                    <p>We cannot stand still if we would. We must either advance or recede. Change!
                        change! is the inexorable law of nature -- more fundamental than paper
                        constitutions. You and I must recognize this great truth, and act upon it as
                        becomes rational and responsible men. We must "front face" and "march," ever
                        mindful to keep step to the music of the age in which it is our good fortune
                        to live.</p>
                    <p>Located as our State is, midway of the temperate zone, exempt from the
                        rigorous cold of the North and the torrid heat of the South, with every
                        variety of fruitful soil, from the rich alluvial bottoms along our rivers
                        and sea-coast to the higher table and timber lands in the West, our hills
                        and mountains filled with exhaustless deposits of iron and other ores, with
                        the finest harbor on the Atlantic coast, affording ample and safe anchorage
                        for the combined navies of the world, with an almost limitless water-power
                        far up to their sources in the Blue Ridge and the Alleghenies -- why should
                        not these great natural advantages be utilized and Virginia advanced to her
                        proper position in the front rank of States in wealth and enterprise and
                        material development? -- With a soil as fertile and a climate more
                        salubrious, with greater national wealth in her minerals, her water-power,
                        and her commercial advantages than any of her sister States, why should not
                        Virginia at once set upon a career of prosperity and greatness unequaled and
                        unsurpassed? Nothing but blind stupidity and criminal neglect of
                        opportunities can prevent it. Our people expect it, the country anticipates
                        it, and you and I will be held largely responsible if such an era fails of
                        prompt inauguration. We have a canal which, when completed, will prove as
                        valuable an adjunct to commerce as the far-famed Suez canal. It can and
                        ought, and I am confident will be completed, if you and the people will but
                        heartily co-operate with me in a plan which I shall hereafter take occasion
                        to submit for your consideration. A South Pacific railroad has been
                        projected, with its eastern terminus at Norfolk. -- I doubt not it will be
                        built.</p>
                    <p>When these two great works shall have been completed together with the other
                        railroads and lines of internal communication contemplated and in process of
                        construction and a direct steamship line between Norfolk and Europe shall
                        have been established, every portion of our State will be in direct and easy
                        communication with all the great commercial marts of the country and the
                        world. All this is not only possible, but altogether probable, and that,
                        too, within the first half of the present decade. -- Rest assured that all
                        the influences which I can exert, personal and official, shall be wielded in
                        furtherance of any and every plan which has for its object the development,
                        advancement, growth, and improvement of our State, or any portion of it. But
                        railroads and canals, and other commercial facilities, are not the only
                        requisites to the successful inauguration of that career of development
                        which we all so ardently desire. We need, also, capital and population.
                        These lie at the foundation of all improvement and prosperity. Without the
                        introduction of these agencies it is idle to hope for the accomplishment of
                        the grand results we have in view. In one sense population is wealth. This
                        will prove a cardinal truth with us. Every able-bodied immigrant adds to the
                        wealth of a State, it is estimated, from $1,000 to $2,000. -- With
                        judicious, united, and harmonious effort, our population, now numbering one
                        and a quarter millions, can be annually increased by immigration from thirty
                        to fifty thousand. -- How many years would elapse with such an annual
                        accession to our population and wealth before we should witness the full
                        realization of our fondest anticipations.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, immigration should be fostered and encouraged by all the
                        influences we can exert, and by all the means at our command. Nature with a
                        lavish hand has bestowed upon us all the advantages of climate, soil, and
                        mineral wealth, which could be desired. But these alone will not suffice.
                        There must be other inducements, which our people themselves can alone
                        present. Thousands of vigorous, intelligent young and middle-aged men, with
                        more or less of capital, are, annually, migrating from the eastern and
                        central States of the Union to the West. They are honest, industrious,
                        energetic citizens -- the bone and sinew of our land -- the very class of
                        people we need in Virginia to purchase our surplus lands, to build up our
                        waste places, and to unite with us in developing our vast agriculture and
                        mineral resources. Englishmen are already looking for homes in our State for
                        the surplus population of the empire. Much interest, also, on our behalf has
                        of late been awakened among the other populations of northern Europe.-- To
                        turn the tide of immigration from all these sources to our State only
                        requires the proper combined and harmonious action of our people and their
                        chosen representatives. Now is the opportune moment for such action; once
                        lost it may never return in your day or mine. To the emigrant who settles in
                        our midst with the honest intention of becoming a good citizen we must
                        extend a cordial and hearty welcome, regardless of what State or nation may
                        happen to have been his birth place. He must be made to feel at home, and
                        the equal among his fellows. There must be extended to him those social
                        amenities of life which constitute its chief enjoyment, such as his station
                        entitles him to receive and enjoy, and thrown around him and his must be the
                        protecting aegis of the law, securing and guaranteeing him in his "Life,
                        Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." Let it be known of all men that such
                        are our purposes and intentions -- that such reception and such protection
                        will be accorded to every such emigrant -- that law and order everywhere
                        prevail, and will be maintained at all times and under all circumstances,
                        with the full power of the State, and every railroad train that arrives
                        within your borders, every steamboat that anchors in your harbors, will be
                        laden with people seeking homes and fortunes among us.</p>
                    <p>In executing the functions of the high and responsible office to which I have
                        been elected, the promotion of the public weal will be my highest aim. With
                        charity towards all and malice towards none, I shall perform my official
                        duties liberally, conscientiously,  interest of no clique,
                        faction, or  an eye single only to the good of the whole people,
                        the development and advancement, the glory and dignity, of the State. I have
                        no private political purpose to subserve, and no party behests to obey. I am
                        free from all "entangling alliances," and untrammeled by any political
                        pledges. Always a firm and consistent Unionist, I expect to live and die
                        one. Beyond this the chief tenets of my political faith are the maintenance
                        of the public faith, State and national, untarnished; honesty and economy in
                        the administration of public affairs; the equalization and reduction of
                        tariffs and taxation to the lowest degree consistent with the maintenance of
                        the public credit; free education for all; a fostering care, encouragement,
                        and elevation of labor; and until fully, finally, and permanently
                        accomplished, universal amnesty and impartial suffrage. These are
                        fundamental principles in my political creed, and it matters not what you
                        call them, whether Republican, Democratic, or Liberal, so far as applicable
                        they will be faithfully adhered to in my administration of the affairs of
                        the State. Those who agree with them will naturally sustain and uphold the
                        administration, while those who disagree with them may oppose it. I can see
                        no other reasonable grounds for any division among our people at this time.
                        With all due respect to the opinions of others, it appears to me that any
                        attempt at this time to divide, distract, and vex our people with questions
                        of mere party politics -- any effort to galvanize into life the defunct
                        political organisms, with their attendant ills of sectional hate and
                        animosity -- any attempt for partisan purposes to reopen the terrible wounds
                        inflicted by the late war, now healing, deserve to be frowned down with
                        indignation. Have we not enough to do to resuscitate and reinvigorate our
                        own crippled and desolate Commonwealth? Have we more brain, more energy,
                        than will suffice for this mighty task? Are we not admonished by the love we
                        bear her, by our veneration of her past and our hopes for her future, to
                        stand side by side and shoulder to shoulder, earnest, and, above all, united
                        in a common effort and a common purpose to reorganize and rehabilitate the
                        State, and to start her out once more on "the high road to glory, glittering
                        like the morning star, full of life and joy." What we need in Virginia, what
                        the nation needs to-day, is the inauguration and cultivation of a broad and
                        catholic national spirit, unsullied by local prejudice or selfish and
                        sectional interest.</p>
                    <p>We must not forget that we are to-day a part and parcel of the American
                        nation. Our destinies are inseparably linked with its destines. Its growth
                        will be our growth, its advancement our advancement, its glory our glory. I
                        confess to a strong and conscientious belief in what is popularly styled
                        "manifest destiny." It is manifest to me that the future destiny of this
                        nation points to the gradual expansion of its limits until the entire
                        continent shall have been embraced within its boundaries.-- And I believe
                        that upon this same continent there is to be formed and moulded a new,
                        distinctive, well-defined, and grand American nationality.</p>
                    <p>It is true that our country is peopled by all the numerous offshoots of the
                        Caucasian race, differing widely in language, habits, and education, but
                        time and concurring circumstances will gradually melt together and mould
                        these diverse elements into one united, harmonious, and homogenous people,
                        surpassing all of the great peoples that have preceded them in their mental,
                        moral, and physical development, and in the greatness and grandeur of their
                        achievements. You and I must act our several parts in the fulfillment of
                        this manifest destiny, and whether it shall be well or illy done will depend
                        upon the individual action of each.</p>
                    <p>Let us each and all remember that</p>
                    <p>"We can make our lives sublime;</p>
                    <p>And, departing, leave behind us</p>

<b>Judiciary System--Mr. Stuart's Suggestions</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A. H. H. Stuart submitted a letter concerning the judiciary system. He
                    recommended that circuit and local courts be given exclusive jurisdiction over
                    different kinds of cases, and that circuit judges should be required to spend
                    more time in their districts.<br>(Names in announcement:  A. H. H. Stuart)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A lawyer from another county having requested Hon. A. H. H. Stuart to give
                        him his views in reference to the Judiciary system which should be adopted
                        by the Legislature, Mr. Stuart, in compliance therewith, wrote him a letter
                        containing "suggestions of a plan for a judiciary system for Virginia,"
                        which letter that gentleman sent to the Editor of the Richmond Whig for publication, and it appeared in last
                        Saturday's issue of that journal. We have not the space to publish it this
                        week, and must content ourself at this time with only a brief reference to
                        it. The strong, common-sense views presented in this letter cannot fail to
                        impress favorably the minds of the members of the Legislature. The chief
                        evil in the old system was "vexatious delay in the dispensation of justice,"
                        and that evil was caused by having "too many courts possessing concurrent
                        jurisdiction in regard to common law, chancery and criminal proceedings."
                        "The proper remedy," says Mr. Stuart, "will be found in a judicious division and distribution of jurisdiction
                        among the courts provided for by the Constitution." The county judge,
                        "learned in the law," "should have exclusive jurisdiction in all criminal
                        proceedings, and in all matters of police, and in all questions of probate
                        and administration and guardianship, and in all motions in regard to roads,
                        mills, and local administration," and accounts of fiduciaries should be
                        reported to and inspected and judicially approved by him before being
                        entered of record. "The circuit courts should have exclusive jurisdiction of
                        all actions at law and cases in chancery. Each judge should be required to
                        hold four terms annually in each county of his
                        circuit, of sufficient length to enable him to dispatch the business. Two of
                        these terms should, as a general rule, be devoted to the trial of common law
                        cases and two for the considerations of chancery cases."</p>

                    <p>The following message from his Excellency Gov. Walker was communicated on
                        Wednesday last, the 9th inst., to the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Delegates:</p>
                    <p>On entering upon the discharge of my duties as the Chief Executive of the
                        State under the constitution on the 27th day of January last, excepting that
                        of Attorney-General, I found nearly every office in the Commonwealth either
                        vacant or filled by a military appointee. The office of Lieutenant-Governor,
                        made vacant by the resignation of the Hon. John F. Lewis, was filled by the
                        appointment of John L. Marye, Esq., who duly qualified on the 27th day of
                        January last. The authority for this appointment is contained in the fifth
                        section of the fourth article of the constitution. The necessity for the
                        prompt exercise of the authority was so apparent and pressing that I was
                        unwilling to assume the responsibility of delaying it. Twelve days would
                        elapse before the assembling of your honorable bodies, and probably several
                        days thereafter before you could make suitable provisions for filling the
                        office. In the meantime, the death of the Governor would have left the State
                        without an Executive head, and inevitably, thrown its affairs into confusion
                        fraught with the greatest dangers. The commission of Lieutenant Governor
                        Marye will expire thirty days from the commencement of your present session,
                        and it will be the duty of the General Assembly to make timely provisions
                        for filling the office thereafter. The Secretary of the Commonwealth, the
                        First and Second Auditors and the Register of the Land office severally
                        tendered their resignations to me, to take effect on the 1st inst. For many
                        reasons I did not deem it advisable to accept any of these resignations, and
                        the duties appertaining to these offices have been continued to be
                        discharged by the former inhabitants. To solve all legal doubts as to
                        whether these officers could hold over after the restoration of the State to
                        civil government, as well as to perfect the prompt organization of the State
                        government under the constitution, I trust the General Assembly will proceed
                        at once to fill these offices, as well as that of the
                        Treasurer.</p>
                    <p>PENITENTIARY.</p>
                    <p>[three lines obscured]important duty the better, both for the interests of
                        the State and the safety and well-being of the prisoners. The acting General
                        Agent and Storekeeper has already tendered his resignation, but the
                        Superintendent has not. The condition of our penitentiary demands your
                        prompt and serious consideration. During the past year the number of
                        convicts has increased to an alarming extent. On the 1st of January, 1869,
                        the number of prisoners remaining in the institution was 357, while on the
                        1st of January, 1870, the number had increased to 601. The expenses for the
                        fiscal year ending September 30, 1868, were $65,201.36, while for the fiscal
                        year ending September 30, 1869, they had increased to 79,038.73. Most of the
                        prisoners are able-bodied men, and ought to be employed at some mechanical
                        business, thus lightening the burthen which this institution has always been
                        to the State and benefitting the prisoners themselves by providing them
                        regular and healthful exercise for both body and brain, and by teaching them
                        some useful occupation. But the experience of other similar institutions as
                        well as our own, I believe, has demonstrated that this cannot be done with
                        any profit by the State. -- Hence, in most of the States the "contract
                        system" has been resorted to, and, so far as I am informed, with good
                        success. The convicts are employed under contracts with persons not
                        otherwise connected with the prisons extending from three to five years at a
                        certain stipulated price per day, in the manufactures of articles of
                        merchandise, but principally of boots and shoes. In such cases the State
                        furnishes only the necessary room for the accommodation of the prisoners and
                        the power (steam or water) necessary for the propulsion of the machinery
                        required, and guards or keepers in sufficient numbers to prevent the escape
                        of the prisoners and to preserve order and discipline among them. I am
                        strongly of the opinion that the State can be relieved from a very large
                        portion of the expenses of the penitentiary by the proper introduction of
                        this system. I have already, in my possession, one or two propositions from
                        entirely responsible parties, proposing to employ all the able-bodied male
                        prisoners in this institution in the manufacture of boots and shoes. I have
                        delayed accepting any such propositions thus far, because, among other
                        reasons, the State government has not been fully organized under the
                        Constitution, and because it appeared to me that some additional legislation
                        might be required. The present buildings are old, much out of repair,
                        unsafe, and not well adapted for a prison with the necessary workshops. It
                        must be repaired, and ought to be remodeled and enlarged, or a new
                        penitentiary built.</p>
                    <p>The lands occupied by the institution at this time are too valuable for such
                        a purpose. A new location can undoubtedly be obtained, easy of access and
                        possessing equal or greater advantages than the present, and new, more
                        suitable and complete buildings erected thereon at an expense not very much
                        in excess of the value of the present penitentiary property. If your
                        Honorable bodies should agree with me in this view of the subject, I would
                        recommend that immediate action be taken for the sale of the present, and
                        the purchase of a new site. Repairs of a temporary and inexpensive nature
                        can be made upon the present property, so as to render it comfortable for
                        occupation until the new buildings are completed, and a cheap wooden
                        structure can be erected within the open area enclosed by the present
                        buildings, for the temporary accommodation of the contractors for the prison
                        labor. The contractors themselves would doubtless make these repairs and
                        erect such temporary buildings as they might deem necessary, at their own
                        expense, receiving their compensation therefor from the labor of the
                        prisoners. But if you shall deem it inexpedient to change the location of
                        the prison, then the repairs upon the present property should be of a more
                        permanent nature, and the new building of a more durable and commodious
                        character, and differently located. It is quite important that a prompt
                        decision should be arrived at, as to which course shall be pursued, in order
                        that contracts may be made for the profitable employment of the very large
                        number of now idle and expensive prisoners.</p>

                    <p>It is proper in this connection to speak of the State Guard. The necessity
                        for some organization like the former State Guard, or the State Police, is
                        too apparent to require comment or argument from me. Men must be employed to
                        guard the penitentiary, and to care for and protect the public property. In
                        my opinion, a military organization is preferable to any other. It is quite
                        probable that the State Guard might be reorganized under the present laws,
                        but I have preferred to defer all action in that behalf until the opinion of
                        the General Assembly could be had.</p>
                    <p>I respectfully recommend that this subject be considered and acted upon at
                        the earliest practicable moment.</p>
                    <p>CITY, TOWN AND COUNTY OFFICERS.</p>
                    <p>Among the important subjects demanding your immediate attention, one of the
                        first will be that of providing for filling the various city, town and
                        county officers, until regular elections can be held. The Constitution
                        provides for holding regular elections in cities and towns on the fourth
                        Thursday in May, and in counties on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
                        in November. Before any elections, general or special, can be properly held,
                        it will be necessary for you to enact a general registration law and provide
                        the mode and manner in which elections will be held. Our present statutes
                        are inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution upon this important
                        subject. The 22d section of the fifth article of the constitution
                        undoubtedly clothes the General Assembly with ample power to fill these
                        offices in such a manner as to it shall seem best, until regular elections
                        can be held. I doubt the propriety of ordering special elections in these
                        cases at this time. Aside from the time which will necessarily be consumed
                        in perfecting the requisite legislation for that purpose, the great expense
                        which elections would entail upon the Commonwealth, ought, if possible, to
                        be avoided. In the meantime it is of paramount importance that many of these
                        offices should be promptly filled. It appears to me, therefore, advisable
                        that the Legislature at a very early day enact a law authorizing the filling
                        of three offices by appointment and officers can be regularly elected and
                        qualified as provided for by the constitution.</p>
                    <p>THE JUDICIARY.</p>
                    <p>Five judges of the supreme court of appeals, sixteen judges of the circuit
                        courts and over one hundred county and city judges are to be elected by you,
                        who will hold their offices respectively in the order named for twelve,
                        eight, and three years from the 1st of January next. This is a grave and
                        responsible duty and surrounded by serious difficulties and embarrassments.
                        A learned and incorruptible judiciary has ever been the pride and boast of
                        our people. Whatever other changes our necessities may compel, I trust that
                        the high standard of qualification for judicial position which has
                        heretofore obtained in our State may never be "changed, altered, or
                        amended." Honesty and capability have been and should continue to be the
                        sovereign tests of fitness. The judicial ermine should ever be far removed
                        from the arena of politics. If there is anything more to be shunned than a
                        political preacher, it is a political judge. It may be that you will be
                        unable to fill all these judicial positions by men who are not disqualified
                        from holding office by the Constitution of the United States. Without
                        intending any disrespect to the fundamental law of the land or to the
                        constituted authorities, it appears to me that you not only ought to have
                        the right to the widest range of selection for these exalted positions, but
                        that you ought to exercise that right. It is a solemn duty which you owe to
                        yourselves and to your constituents, to the country and to posterity to
                        elect our ablest, purest and best men, and if in the fulfillment of that
                        duty your choice should fall upon any who are disqualified, by the 3d.
                        clause of the 14th article of the constitution of the United States, I would
                        recommend the passage by your honorable bodies of a resolution respectfully
                        requesting Congress to remove such disqualifications. I am satisfied that
                        such a resolution would receive the prompt and favorable consideration and
                        action of Congress.</p>
                    <p>The salaries of all the judges are to be fixed by you, and while I am an
                        earnest advocate of economy in all departments of government, I am not in
                        favor of meagre and insufficient salaries for public officials, especially
                        for the judges of the circuit courts and court of appeals. They should be
                        sufficient to command the most eminent ability. The lawyer who accepts one
                        of these judicial positions by that act banishes himself from the practice
                        and emoluments of his profession. Unless a man of fortune, he is dependent
                        upon his salary for his support, and that salary ought to be sufficient to
                        furnish him a comfortable living, in keeping with the high position which he
                        holds. I am aware that the judicial system provided for by the constitution
                        will of necessity be an expensive one, but with the many reforms which may,
                        and ought to be instituted, it may be rendered less burthensome than our
                        former system.</p>
                    <p>The expenses incident to the administration of the criminal laws have within
                        the past few years increased enormously mainly due to the larger increases
                        in the number of petty offenses, such as larceny and assault and battery. A
                        thorough reform not only in the laws themselves, but in their mode of
                        administration, is imperatively demanded.</p>
                    <p>It appears to me that all cases of petit larceny, except for a second
                        offence, and all cases of assault and battery, except with a deadly weapon;
                        in fact, for all crimes of a lesser grade than a felony, should be summarily
                        tried by a justice of the peace, with or without jury, at the option of the
                        accused, reserving, of course, the right of appeal to the county court upon
                        questions of law; and in cases of conviction, the punishment inflicted to be
                        a fine or imprisonment in the county jail, or hard labor upon the public
                        roads or elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>By the adoption of this system, and by requiring that the value of the
                        property stolen shall be at least thirty dollars to constitute the crime of
                        grand larceny, you will free the courts of record of a very large proportion
                        of their criminal business, and the Commonwealth from a fourth to a third of
                        its "criminal charges."</p>
                    <p>Cases of trial and conviction of larceny, with mere suspicion of burglary,
                        have lately come to my knowledge where the whole value of the property
                        stolen did not exceed one dollar, and yet these cases went through all the
                        formalities of arrest, examination by a magistrate, commitment in default of
                        bail to the county jail, a formal investigation by the grand jury, resulting
                        in a formal indictment and trial by the county court and a petit jury,
                        consuming days of time and costing the Commonwealth from seventy-five to one
                        hundred dollars. Now such cases ought to be tried by a justice of the peace
                        in two hours at an expense not exceeding five dollars. Every county and city
                        should be compelled by law to establish, at as early a day as practicable, a
                        poor-house, for the care and sustenance of the infirm and helpless within
                        its corporate limits, and in connection therewith, or with the jail, a
                        workhouse, where offenders of the class under consideration may be compelled
                        to labor upon the public roads, or in tilling the soil, or at such other
                        employment as may be most profitable, thereby contributing to lighten rather
                        than increase the burthen of the people. In all our courts, the compensation
                        of all officers except the judges should be only the fees appertaining to
                        their respective offices, to be paid in all cases by suitors, except in
                        criminal cases, where either the prosecution fails, or the defendant has no
                        property from which the fees can be collected. While our courts should be
                        freely open to all, and the costs incident to litigation ought not to be so
                        high as to amount, in any sense, to a denial of justice, yet it is right
                        that suitors should bear, to some extent, the increased expenses they
                        occasion. I would recommend that, in every civil case in a court of record,
                        a fee or tax of from three to five dollars be imposed, to be paid to the
                        clerk at the commencement of the suit, and before any papers are filed or
                        issued and to be by the clerk paid into the Treasury of the State.</p>
                    <p>By such modifications of our laws as I have thus briefly suggested, it is
                        quite probable that at least fifty thousand dollars can annually be saved to
                        the State in the administration of our civil and criminal jurisprudence.</p>
                    <p>ASYLUM FOR INSANE COLORED PEOPLE.</p>
                    <p>Soon after entering upon the discharge of my duties as Provisional Governor,
                        I ascertained that both the Eastern and Western Lunatic Asylums were filled
                        to overflowing with patients, and that there were many people, both white
                        and colored, in the various county jails, and other places around the State,
                        where they could not be properly treated or cared for. It seemed
                        imperatively demanded that some measures be promptly provided for the
                        suitable care and custody of these unfortunate people. The propriety of
                        enlarging the Eastern Lunatic Asylum was first considered, but the expense
                        of such enlargement seemed too great to justify its being undertaken at that
                        time. Besides it was deemed advisable that the insane of the two races
                        should be provided for separately. Subsequently the property lying
                        immediately east of the city, known as Howard's Grove Hospital, through an
                        arrangement effected by the Commanding General, was turned over to the
                        State, and it was determined to convert the same into an asylum for the
                        colored insane, and to remove thereto those of that race who were at the
                        Eastern Lunatic Asylum, thus leaving in that institution sufficient
                        accommodation for the white insane, who, as before stated, were in different
                        jails and other places of confinement in the State. -- That arrangement has
                        been carried fully into effect. The property thus turned over to the State,
                        without cost, is of considerable value. -- It consists of eighteen acres of
                        land now under lease to the State for ten years, at an annual rental of two
                        hundred dollars, whereon stand several wooden buildings worth five or six
                        thousand dollars, one additional wooden building has been erected, and some
                        necessary improvements and repairs made at the expense of the State. Beds,
                        bedding and other necessary articles, which were in use, or stored on the
                        premises, were purchased from the Government at a nominal price.</p>
                    <p>The lease and a plan of the grounds and buildings are on file in the office
                        of the auditor of public accounts. The report herewith submitted of the
                        superintendent of public buildings, who at my instance has had charge of
                        this property for the past month, contains a statement of the expenditures
                        made by the State, the condition and capacity of the institution and the
                        number of patients now under treatment. With the further expenditure of a
                        small sum it is believed that all the colored insane of the State can be
                        well and comfortably accommodated at this asylum for the next ten years. I
                        would respectfully recommend that a law be at once enacted organizing this
                        asylum upon the plans of the Eastern and Western Lunatic Asylums, and
                        providing for the care and custody of all the colored insane of the State at
                        the same.</p>
                    <p>I have been requested by the authorities of Randolph Macon College to submit
                        for your consideration a proposition in writing, for the sale to the State
                        of the property of that institution, situated in Mecklenburg county, for an
                        asylum for insane colored people. My great respect for the gentlemen who
                        make this proposition, and my high appreciation of the ultimate objects they
                        have in view in making the same, induce me to comply with their request,
                        although my sense of duty compels me to decline to recommend this purchase
                        at this time.</p>
                    <p>Having thus called your attention to some of the most important subjects
                        which demand your immediate attention, and the consideration of which will
                        necessarily occupy your time for some weeks to come, I shall bring this
                        communication to a close. I shall at an early day communicate to you a
                        statement of the financial condition and resources of the State, with such
                        recommendations as commend themselves to my judgment, and some suggestions
                        for the amelioration of the condition of the very large debtor class in our
                        State. Public improvements, immigration, education, and other important
                        subjects, will be discussed in communications to be hereafter communicated
                        to your honorable bodies.</p>
