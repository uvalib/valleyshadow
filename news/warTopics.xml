                     Accuses the Lincoln administration of consistently bungling the prosecution of the
                     war. Because of its incompetence and its preoccupation with abolition, the administration has
                     alienated potential allies in foreign countries and sympathizers in the border states and the South.
                     The article also cites a piece in the Philadelphia <emph rend="italic">Daily News,</emph> a Republican paper, that
                     questions the military competence of the administration.

                     supposed to have argued first, that the "instigation of a servile war" is not discussed in any book
                     on military tactics, and must be regarded in the same light as poisoning wells, abusing prisoners or
                     women and children; and second, that if the proclamation is not withdrawn, any women or
                     children murdered by "infuriated negroes" will be avenged by the execution of an equal number of
                     Union prisoners.

                     despotic regime on the country. As evidence, the editors point to Lincoln's proposed
                     reconstruction plan, which would allow the loyal ten percent of the Southern population to rule
                     over the rest of the disenfranchised former rebels. With oppressive conditions such as those

                     greater consequence, as Sheridan attempted to carry out Grant's order to make the Valley a

                     claim to be in the forefront of civilization and still act with the "malicious inhumanity" and
                     "wanton barbarity" evident in recent transgressions in the Valley.  The editor calls upon the
                     county court of Augusta to follow the example of Rockingham county court and appoint a
                     committee to gather information on the full extent of local damage.

                     managed properly.  The many areas of the state that have suffered so much less than the Valley
                     and that, in turn, have more abundant produce should be called upon to provide produce for
                     impressment and to provide food for people in the Valley.

                     aftermath of the battle at Winchester on September 19, 1864.  A Confederate surgeon in charge
                     of the Confederate wounded states that the army left about 400 wounded from the battle and
                     another 260 previously sick and wounded in the hands of the enemy.  From the battle on
                     September 19 until the close of the campaign, the enemy captured 864 sick and wounded, far
                     fewer than previous estimates.  Yankee surgeons at Winchester stated that after the fight on
                     September 19, they buried six Union soldiers for every one Confederate and that local hospitals
                     were filled with six thousand wounded.  These large losses indicate the skill with which the
                     Confederates fought, in light of the overpowering odds against them.

                     columns when they moved on Monday.  They encountered General Early's small force in
                     Waynesboro while they were on their way to Staunton and captured six hundred or seven hundred
                     of Early's men, according to people who saw these prisoners pass through Staunton.  Sheridan's
                     troops destroyed canals, rail lines, and bridges along the way, in addition to large quantities of
                     government supplies and personal property.  Sheridan met little resistance because the

                     is said to be encamped below Strasburg and to have headquarters at or near Kernstown.

                     Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of the week before last, but on Sunday came word that the
                     Confederates were withdrawing their pickets from the state line. Large bodies of men from the
                     northern, eastern, and western parts of the state, responding to the call of the Governor, poured

                     details the flow of action in broad terms, praising the bravery of the men and the wisdom of
                     General McClellan. General Burnside, however, is criticized for delaying the advance of his troops
                     on the left side of the battle. The writer blames Burnside's delay for the ferocity of the fighting, as
                     the Confederates were able to shift troops to meet each new wave of the attack.

                     outnumbered Confederate force under Gen. Echols and Col. Wm. L. Jackson fought heartily, but
                     had to retreat in the face of a determined attack. The enemy troops under the command of
                     General Averill next moved towards Staunton until their forces were blocked by Gen. Imboden
                     near Covington. The presence of a large enemy troop in the area led to the mustering of the Home
                     Guard units at Staunton. The 3rd Battalion Valley Reserves suffered severe losses.

                     County since Imboden is so familiar with the needs of the area.  In the same regard, those with
                     flimsy excuses will likely not receive exemptions because Imboden will know the situations of true
                     need.

                     Valley.  Most of them are farmers who have been ignoring their corn crops, which they planted at
                     top capacity in order to salvage as much of their wheat crops as possible in the few weeks since
                     the Reserves were disbanded.  Since only white labor is available locally, the corn crop will suffer
                     even more if white farmers are called to service.  The editor is certain that the Commandant of
                     Conscripts for Virginia is unaware of the labor situation in the area.

                     discusses the arrival and quick departure of Northern troops at Harrisonburg, but that fails to
                     mention the involvement of the Augusta Raid Guard in the operations there.  The Augusta Guard
                     had "just undergone such severe and unaccustomed hardships at North and Shenandoah
                     Mountains" but assembled and went to Rockingham County anyway.

                     not been published for the three preceding weeks.  During the first week, much of the office staff
                     went with the Augusta Raid Guards to North Mountain and returned on Thursday, the day before
                     the paper should have been issued.  During the second week, they were involved with the Guard
                     in Harrisonburg and returned home on Friday, the day the paper should have been issued.  During
                     the third week the editor gave his employees time off for Christmas.  The editor hopes that no
                     further impediments lie in the way of continuous publication in the future.

                     the Reserves were disbanded.  Since only white labor is available locally, the corn crop will suffer
                     even more if white farmers are called to service.  The editor is certain that the Commandant of
                     Conscripts for Virginia is unaware of the labor situation in the area.

                     Waynesboro while they were on their way to Staunton and captured six hundred or seven hundred
                     of Early's men, according to people who saw these prisoners pass through Staunton.  Sheridan's
                     troops destroyed canals, rail lines, and bridges along the way, in addition to large quantities of
                     government supplies and personal property.  Sheridan met little resistance because the

                     "played out." Many people from the community talked with the prisoners, and generally found
                     them polite but deluded about the chances the South had in the war.

                     has deviated from the initial war goals.  Instead of preservation of the Constitution and restoration
                     of the Union, the editors argue, the Republicans have shifted the war goals to more radical
                     measures. However, the President can still change course, the editors argue, by refusing to use the
                     confiscation bill, by revoking the emancipation proclamation and stopping black enlistment, by
                     purging his Cabinet, and by restoring the original purposes to the war.

                     midst." Business was suspended, and martial law was declared. It was particularly intense on
                     Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of the week before last, but on Sunday came word that the
                     Confederates were withdrawing their pickets from the state line. Large bodies of men from the
                     northern, eastern, and western parts of the state, responding to the call of the Governor, poured
                     into town and advanced to meet the enemy. Luckily, "McClellan whipped Lee on the South
                     Mountain between Middletown and Boonsboro' on Sunday," which precipitated the Confederate
                     evacuation of Hagerstown and took the pressure off of Franklin County.

                     and the Confederate Army. People cried out for Fitzhugh's death, but he was safely hustled off to
                     jail and has since been taken to a fort in the east.

                     was published in the previous week's issue, and the encouraging report it contains.  Most areas in
                     the Confederacy taken by the enemy have been recovered, or at least the enemy's hold has
                     weakened, finances are more stable, and the arming of African Americans is not necessary at
                     present.

                     everyone except those who have made their fortunes on cotton and tobacco.  The editor notes
                     that the Confederacy should have bought all that had been produced since the beginning of the
                     war and that a measure such as this that would do as much good for the nation should meet with

                     soldiers would subjugate the South in a matter of days.  The war has lasted long enough by this
                     point to demonstrate that the South will not easily be subjugated and long enough so that even
                     Massachusetts, where war support has been strong, is having to look to Southern African

                     issue its first edition next week, under the paper's old name, the Franklin Repository. The editors
                     regret "the loss of our friend Strickler from the editorial fraternity," but praise McClure's "enviable
                     reputation" as a journalist, and Stoner's reputation as a "excellent business man and an honorable,
                     high-minded gentleman." They also note that the partners have purchased the Dispatch and are
                     shutting it down, leaving only one Republican newspaper in town.

                     the war, and they point to the administration of Andrew Johnson in Tennessee as an example of
                     how this might work. Beyond supporting Lincoln's prosecution of the war, however, the editors
                     refuse to support his abolition goals or condone the corruption they discern in his
                     administration.

                     out white labor, which will be unpopular with the white working class.  Either way, say the

                     to redouble their efforts in the war effort. He details the preparations that the enemy forces are
                     making for an invasion and reminds the readers that the result of a Northern victory would be
                     "subjugation, slavery, and the utter ruin of yourselves, your families, and your country."  He takes
                     a fairly soft view on the numerous soldiers absent from their regiments and attributes their
                     absence to homesickness and the need to take care of their affairs.  He believes that fear of
                     punishment is causing many who would return to hesitate. In order to rectify this situation, "The
                     President declares a general amnesty and pardon and assures the public that with the return of
                     these soldiers the Confederacy will be able to secure victory in the impending battle."

                     classified as deserters, even though their anxiety about family and friends caused them to act as if
                     they were deserters.  The reluctance for citizens and government to call them deserters has
                     resulted in an increase in their numbers, to the point that the cause of the Confederacy has been
                     affected.  The Senate has passed a bill that is before the House and that addresses the punishment
                     of these men.  The editor calls for their return to duty before they are labeled deserters under this

                     received the same poor fare that Confederate soldiers received, then the Northern government
                     would be more interested in establishing an exchange of prisoners.

                     the people of the Confederacy, and he cites several examples to prove this point.  These traits
                     have prevented Southern troops from retaliating, in most cases, for Northern atrocities.  In one
                     case, however, Colonel Joel R. Griffin selected a private from the 5th Ohio to execute in
                     retaliation for the hanging of Private Daniel Bright of the 62nd Georgia, who was held by General
                     Wilde.  Griffin promises to hang others if Confederate prisoners continue to be hanged.  The
                     editor of the Vindicator applauds this tactic and claims that Griffin's example will save many
                     Confederate men being held from being executed.  The article closes with a copy of the letter
                     Griffin sent Wilde explaining his position.
