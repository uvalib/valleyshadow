                <transcript>
                    <p>A short time since, a delegation from seven Southern States waited upon
                        President Johnson, and addressed him through their Chairman, Mr. McFarland,
                        of Richmond, to which the President replied as follows:</p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN--I can only say, in reply to the remarks of your chairman, that I
                        am highly gratified to receive the assurances he has given me. They are more
                        than I could have expected under the circumstances. I must say I was
                        unprepared to receive so numerous a delegation on this occasion; it was
                        unexpected; I had no idea it was to be so large or represent so many States.
                        When I expressed as I did my willingness to see at any time so many of you
                        as choose to do me the honor to call upon me, and stated that I should be
                        gratified at receiving any manifestations of regard you might think proper
                        to make, I was totally unprepared for anything equal to the present
                        demonstration. I am free to say it excites in my mind feelings and emotions
                        that language is totally inadequate to express. When I look back upon my
                        past actions and recall a period scarcely more than four short years ago,
                        when I stood battling for principles which many of you opposed and thought
                        were wrong, I was battling for the same principles that actuate me to-day
                        and which principles, I thank God, you have come forward on this occasion to
                        manifest a disposition to support. I say now, as I have said on many former
                        occasions, that I entertain no personal resentments, enmities or animosities
                        to any living soul South of Mason's and Dixon's line, however much he may
                        have differed from me in principle. The stand I then took I claim to have
                        been the only true one. I remember how I stood pleading with my Southern
                        brethren when they stood with their hats in their hands ready to turn their
                        backs upon the United States; how I implored them to stand with me there and
                        maintain our rights and fight our battles under the laws and Constitution of
                        the United States. I think now, as I thought then, and endeavored to induce
                        them to believe, that our true position was under the laws and under the
                        Constitution of the Union with the institution of slavery in it; but if that
                        principle made an issue that rendered a disintegration possible--if that
                        made an issue which should prevent us from transmitting to our children a
                        country as bequeathed to us by our fathers--I had nothing else to do but
                        stand by the Government, be the consequences what they might; I said then,
                        what you all know, that I was for the institutions of the country as
                        guaranteed by the Constitution, but above all things I was for the union of
                        the States. I remember the taunts, the jeers, the scowls, with which I was
                        treated. I remember the circle that stood around me, and remember the
                        threats and intimidations that were freely uttered by the men who opposed
                        me, and whom I wished to befriend and guide by the light that led me; but
                        feeling conscious in my own integrity, and that I was right, I heeded not
                        what they might say or do to me, and was inspired and encouraged to do my
                        duty regardless of aught else, and have lived to see the realization of my
                        predictions and the fatal error of those whom I vainly essayed to save from
                        the results I could not but foresee. Gentlemen, we have passed through this
                        rebellion. I say we, for it was we who are responsible for it. Yes, the
                        South made the issue, and I know the nature of the Southern people well
                        enough to know that when they have become convinced of an error they frankly
                        acknowledge it in a manly, open, direct manner; and now, in the performance
                        of that duty, or, indeed, in any act they undertake to perform, they do it
                        heartily and frankly; and now that they come to me, I understand them as
                        saying that "we made the issue. We set up the union of the States against
                        the institution of slavery; we selected as arbitrator the God of Battles;
                        the arbitrament was the sword. The issue was fairly and honorably met. Both
                        the questions presented have been decided against us, and we are prepared to
                        accept the issue." I find on all sides this spirit of honor and candor
                        prevailing. It is said by all: The issue was ours, and the judgement has
                        been given against us; and the decision having been made against us, we feel
                        bound in honor to abide by the arbitrament. In doing this we are doing
                        ourselves no dishonor, and should not feel humiliated or degraded, but
                        rather that we are ennobling ourselves by our action; and we should feel
                        that the Government has treated us magnanimously and meet the Government
                        upon the terms it has so magnanimously proffered us. So far as I am
                        concerned, personally, I am uninfluenced by any question, whether it affects
                        the North or the South; the East or the West. I stand where I did of old,
                        battling for the Constitution and the union of these United States. In doing
                        so I know I opposed some of you gentlemen of the South when this doctrine of
                        secession was being urged upon the country and the declaration of your right
                        to break up the Government and disintegrate the Union was made. I stand
                        to-day, as I have ever stood, firmly in the opinion that if a monopoly
                        contends against this country the monopoly must go down and the country must
                        go up. Yes, the issue was made by the South against the Government, and the
                        Government has triumphed; and the South, true to her ancient instincts of
                        frankness and manly honor, comes forth and expresses her willingness to
                        abide the result of the decision in good faith. While I think that the
                        rebellion has been arrested and subdued, and happy in the consciousness of a
                        duty well performed, I want not only you, but the people of the world, to
                        know that while I dreaded and feared disintegration of the States I am
                        equally opposed to consolidation or concentration of power here, under
                        whatever guise or name; and if the issue is forced upon us I shall still
                        endeavor to pursue the same efforts to dissuade from this doctrine of
                        running to extremes; but I say let the same rules be applied. Let the
                        Constitution be our guide. Let the preservation of that and the union of the
                        States be our principal aim. Let it be our hope that the Government may be
                        perpetual, and that the principles of the Government, founded as they are on
                        right and justice, may be handed down without a spot or blemish to our
                        posterity. As I have before remarked to you, I am gratified to see so many
                        of you here to-day. It manifests a spirit I am pleased to observe. I know it
                        has been said of me that my asperities are so sharp, that I had vindictive
                        feelings to gratify, and that I should not fail to avail myself of the
                        opportunities that would present themselves to gratify such despicable
                        feelings. Gentlemen, if my acts will not speak for me and for themselves
                        then any professions I might now make would be equally useless. But,
                        gentlemen, if I know myself, as I think I do, I know that I am of the
                        Southern people, and I love them, and will do all in my power to restore
                        them to that state of happiness and prosperity which they enjoyed before the
                        madness of misguided men, in whom they had reposed their confidence, led
                        them astray to their own undoing. If there is anything that can be done on
                        my part, on correct principles, on the principles of the Constitution, to
                        promote these ends, rest assured it shall be done. Let me assure you, also,
                        that there is no disposition on the part of the Government to deal harshly
                        with the Southern people. There may be speeches published from various
                        quarters that may breathe a different spirit. Do not let them trouble or
                        excite you, but believe that it is, as it is, the great object of the
                        Government to make the union of these United States more complete and
                        perfect than ever, and to maintain it on constitutional principles, if
                        possible, more firmly than it has ever before been. Then why cannot we all
                        come up to the work in proper spirit? In other words, let us look to the
                        Constitution. The issue has been made and decided; then, as wise men--as men
                        who see right and are determined to follow it, as fathers and brothers, and
                        as men who love their country in this hour of trial and suffering--why
                        cannot we come up and help to settle the questions of the hour and adjust
                        them according to the principles of honor and justice? The institution of
                        slavery is gone. The former status of the negro had to be changed, and we,
                        as wise men, must recognize so patent a fact and adapt ourselves to
                        circumstances as they surround us. [Voices--We are willing to do so. Yes,
                        sir, we are willing to do so.] I believe you are. I believe when your faith
                        is pledged, when your consent has been given as I have already said, I
                        believe it will be maintained in good faith and every pledge or promise
                        fully carried out. [Cries--It will.] All I ask or desire of the South or the
                        North, the East or the West, is to be sustained in carrying out the
                        principles of the Constitution. It is not to be denied that we have been
                        great sufferers on both sides, and much misery is being endured as necessary
                        results of so gigantic a contest. Why, then, can not we come together, and
                        around the common altar of our country heal the wounds that have been made?
                        Deep wounds have been inflicted. Our country has been scarred all over. Then
                        why cannot we approach each other upon principles which are right in
                        themselves and which will be productive of good to all. The day is not
                        distant when we shall feel like some family that have had a deep and
                        desperate feud, the various members of which have come together and compared
                        the evils and sufferings they had inflicted upon each other. They had seen
                        the influence of their errors and its result, and, governed by a generous
                        spirit of conciliation, they had become mutually forbearing and forgiving,
                        and returned to their old habits of fraternal kindness, and become better
                        friends than ever. Then let us consider that the feud which alienated us has
                        been settled and adjusted to our mutual satisfaction, and that we come
                        together to be bound by firmer bonds of love, respect and confidence than
                        ever. The North cannot get along without the South, nor the South from the
                        North, the East from the West, nor the West from the East; and I say it is
                        our duty to do all that in our power lies to perpetuate and make stronger
                        the hands of our Union, seeing that it is for the common good of all that we
                        should be united. I feel that this Union, though but the creation of a
                        century, is to be perpetuated for all time, and that it cannot be destroyed
                        except by the all wise God who created it. Gentlemen, I repeat, I sincerely
                        thank you for the respect manifested on this occasion; and for the
                        expressions of approbation and confidence please accept my sincere
                    thanks.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Since our last issue, in which we called attention to an extract from the
                        letter of President Johnson, in reference to the militia troubles of
                        Mississippi, the President has been waited upon by a large delegation from
                        the Southern States, and, in reply to the remarks of their Chairman, (which
                        reply will be found our first page,) spoke plainly and candidly. While the
                        entire address is worthy of perusal there are portions of it which can not
                        be read without strengthening the conviction of all that President Johnson
                        is determined to restore the Union under the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>He distinctly states his position when he says, "I stand where I did of old,
                        battling for the Constitution and the union of these United States." But as
                        if not satisfied that the radical element of the North would understand,
                        that, in the preservation of the Union of the States, any attempt on their
                        part to pervert the Constitution to selfish aims would find him an ardent
                        opposer, he, elsewhere, expressly declares, that "I want not only you, but
                        the people of the world to know, that, while I dreaded and feared
                        disintegration of the States, <emph rend="italic">I am equally opposed to
                            consolidation or concentration of power here, under whatever guise or
                            name</emph>." Thus showing that he still upholds the doctrines for which
                        he has so long contended.</p>
                    <p>He has thrown a bomb-shell into the radical camp, and amid the confusion
                        thereby occasioned, the conservatives of the country should rally to the
                        support of him, who says, "All I ask or desire of the South or the North,
                        the East or the West, is to be sustained in carrying out the principles of
                        the Constitution." * * * * * "Let the Constitution be our guide. Let the
                        preservation of that and the Union of the States be our principle aim." Will
                        he be sustained? Unless the South shall, by some unwise and impolitic
                        course, give the radicals a rallying cry, he will. It therefore behooves us
                        to weigh well our acts, and to pursue a politic course, and thereby
                        strengthen the hands of him who is making strenuous exertions to preserve
                        the Union of co-equal States.</p>

                        reference to her people, "if I know myself, as I think I do, I know that I

                        restore them to that state of happiness and prosperity which they enjoyed

                        utterly destroy this fair land of ours, and calls not only for the North,
                        the East and the West to support him, but also the South. Every effort
                        should and will be made by the South to sustain him, and the conservatives
                        of the land will be untrue to themselves if they withhold their cordial

                    <p>There is nothing, perhaps, which has more astonished our people than the
                        energy displayed in the various walks of life among us, since the cessation
                        of hostilities. It was at first supposed that the poor, desolated South
                        would require years to resume her wonted prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The many obstacles to her progress being of such a character, that, unless
                        assistance was rendered from outside and unexpected sources, it was deemed
                        impossible that the latent energy of the Southern people would be sufficient
                        to elevate the condition of the South to its former degree of prosperity.
                        Greater energy has been exhibited than the most sanguine had looked for, and
                        a more prosperous condition is ostensibly arrived at, than thought could be
                        reached in years. We have always opposed "Old Fogyism," believing that the
                        world still moves and advances in healthy progress, and that we are required
                        to do things to-day as they were done yesterday. The energy already
                        displayed is, by far, less than we expect to see. We look forward to the day
                        when the mechanics and laboring men, not only of Staunton and Virginia, but
                        the whole South, will be actively and lucratively employed. That will be a
                        blessed day to the poor man and the rich.</p>
                    <p>It must be confessed, however, that there are paralyzing causes affecting our
                        native energy and "go-aheadativeness." Not the least of these is the fear of
                        losing by confiscation the little left from the desolations of war. We are
                        hopeful that this great drawback to progress will be removed. Our Northern
                        exchanges, learn through their Washington correspondents, that it is
                        expected, on good grounds for belief, that President Johnson will shortly
                        issue a General Amnesty. This is what we most need, and the President will
                        add greatly to the material prosperity of the whole country by relieving the
                        South of the greatest burden under which she labors, at present, in
                        approximating her ancient prosperity. God speed the day when the expected
                        General Amnesty proclamation will be issued.</p>

                    <p>Not a Republican State Convention has yet fully and fairly endorsed President
                        Johnson's policy, while every Democratic State Convention has. One
                        Republican State Convention (Minnesota) has directly condemned the
                        President's policy, and the rest of them have taken exception to and by
                        innuendo condemned his "mild and generous method of reconstruction." Not one
                        Democratic Convention has done so. Some of the Republican Conventions have
                        set Stanton above the President, and four others have endorsed negro
                        suffrage, to which Johnson is opposed. No Democratic Convention has thus
                        "opposed the Government." Taking all these facts together, we find the only

                    <p>From Washington.--It is understood here that it is contemplated by the
                        President to entirely withdraw troops from the South in a short time,
                        leaving the States lately in rebellion to reorganize on the basis of civil
                        government, precisely as they stood before the war, with the exception of
                        slavery. This policy is said to have arisen through the good sense of
                        leading Southern men themselves in accepting the position of affairs, as
                        disclosed in the interview between President Johnson and a considerable
                        deputation of their leading men, at the White House, the other day. Thus,
                        the late slave States will have hardly a soldier left among them, save such
                        as may be required to garrison the several forts; and these, as in the
                        Northern States, will be retained in active service only for the purpose of
                        meeting any emergency that may arise from the action of foreign Powers.</p>

                    the exception of slavery." The paper attributes such a possibility to "the good
