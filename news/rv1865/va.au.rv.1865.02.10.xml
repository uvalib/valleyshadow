                <summary>The editor reports that the commissioners who traveled to the North to
                    discuss peace met with immediate rejection from President Lincoln, who said he
                    would agree to nothing less than the South's unconditional surrender. The editor
                    posits that the idea of a quick peace other than through a Southern victory is
                    now gone forever. As a result, the South will become even more united and
                    determined to succeed.</summary>

                    resolutions from the Staunton Artillery and that this week's has resolutions
                    from the 52nd and the 31st Virginia Regiments. Any who are discouraged should
                    read these resolutions and be encouraged by the determination of the soldiers to
                    last until victory is achieved.</summary>

                <summary>Colonel A. W. Harman arrived home in Staunton on the Central train
                    Wednesday evening. Harman formerly commanded the 12th Virginia Cavalry, Rosser's
                    Brigade. He was captured in July 1863 and sent to Johnsons Island, where he has
                    been a prisoner of war ever since. His health is "somewhat shattered," but his
                    spirits are high. He returns home with even higher conviction in the ultimate
                    success of the Southern cause.</summary>

                    Southern pickets near Petersburg but that no engagements have occurred yet. In
                    the Valley, the enemy surprised the Confederate picket at Edinburg, captured a
                    lieutenant and fourteen men, only to be pursued by twenty men from the 12th
                    Virginia Cavalry and overtaken. The Confederates regained their picket and took
                    sixteen prisoners and twenty horses.</summary>

                <summary>"McC." writes the editor of the Vindicator to report his conversation with
                    Joseph Beard near Sangersville. Beard is a paroled prisoner from Point Lookout
                    and was able to provide information on some people from Augusta and Rockingham
                    Counties. Charles H. Anderson of Mt. Solon, John Litten from near Spring Hill,
                    and John H. Byerly of Rockingham died of diarrhea some months ago. Litten was
                    not a soldier but was captured by Sheridan near Spring Hill. E. A. Samuels of
                    Sangersville, Addison Hansbarger of Sangersville, George W. Harman of Mt. Solon,
                    Jessee Ralster of near Mt. Solon, Cornelius Nott near Mt. Solon, Jacob Michael
                    of Christian near Mt. Solon, Abner Blair of Dry River, John Wright of Dry River
                    were doing well, except two or three suffering from frost bite of the feet,
                    including young Beard and Sherfey. Robert Coyner, formerly of Buckhannan in
                    Upshure and captured near Waynesboro, and Peter Bright, captured on Long Glade,
                    were in Fort McHenry. John H. Karricoff from near Sangersville left Point
                    Lookout some time ago and reportedly took the oath of allegiance to the United
                    States. The writer heard General Wise's speech on the night of February 4, 1865,
                    at the Capitol and thought it a speech every Confederate ought to have heard.</summary>
