                <transcript>
                    <p>At the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                        Company, held in Baltimore last Wednesday a proposition was made to build a
                        railroad from Harper's Ferry to connect with the Virginia and Tennessee
                        railroad in the Upper Valley. President Garrett, in his report says:</p>
                    <p>"In the new era that has opened another subject of the greatest importance to
                        the country, and especially to the people of Virginia and Maryland, has been
                        presented.-Many of the most distinguished citizens of Virginia have
                        expressed their anxiety for the early construction of a line of railway
                        leading from Harper's ferry through Winchester and Strasburg, to connect
                        with the great Virginia and Tennessee road, in the southwestern part of the
                        State, and thus open a direct and effective line of communication from
                        Baltimore to new Orleans, presenting to the States of Virginia, Tennessee,
                        Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana an admirable, economic and
                        direct line to the national capital an the great seat of commerce at the
                        head of the Chesapeake. The Valley of Virginia-fertile, rich in mineral
                        resources with fine water power, with a most beautiful climate-possesses a
                        region of wonderful attractiveness and characteristics for great populations
                        and extensive development. The entire region through Virginia, Tennessee and
                        the connecting States presents the greatest advantages for emigration, and
                        these advantages are sure to give absolute assurances of prosperity and
                        wealth.</p>
                    <p>"During the existence of slavery in Virginia, a jealousy existed of any line
                        leading to the free States, by which slave property became less safe. That
                        obstacle having been removed, all jealousies appear also to have ceased, and
                        I have been called upon by many of the most eminent and sagacious citizens
                        of that great State, who urge that the attention of the people of Baltimore
                        and the managers of the Baltimore and Ohio road should be directed to this
                        subject. Their region has been desolated, their capital has been almost
                        destroyed, and now they are most anxious that the enterprise and capital of
                        this community shall be drawn to the road in accomplishing objects which
                        will [REST OF PARAGRAPH UNCLEAR]</p>
                    <p>"A natural route, full of local and general advantages, is thus presented. It
                        is true that whilst a portion of traffic which now comes up the Ohio river,
                        and is received by Western railways from the Southwest-thus passing over the
                        whole three hundred and seventy-nine miles of the Baltimore an Ohio road,
                        would, through a valley line, pass over but eighty miles of the main stem;
                        yet, in view of the great objects to be achieved for those interest and
                        scoring a direct communication to Washington, and adding vastly to the
                        commercial strength and importance of Baltimore, I do not hesitate to
                        commend to the most earnest and favorable consideration of this community
                        and to this board this interesting subject.</p>
                    <p>"The Baltimore and Ohio road has built up the region of Virginia through
                        which it passes. It has aided largely in the construction and of the
                        Parkersburg road, which has cost more than seven millions of dollars; and
                        whilst it has enormously increased business and prosperity upon that line
                        and made millionaries [CORRECT millionaires] of the owners of oil lands, and
                        largely advanced the values of all properties in that region, that road has
                        thus far failed directly in paying any interest upon the investment: yet in
                        the future it is believed that remuneration can be secured, whilst the
                        general commerce of Baltimore has been benefited and that region so
                        specially improved. Like difficulties may embarrass the enterprise proposed,
                        but its results in the future will justify every effort in its behalf."</p>
                    <p>Of the ability of the Company to construct the road, our readers, who, we
                        fear, have never paid much attention to this mammoth corporation, will be
                        able in judge from the following statistics. President Garrett says:</p>
                    <p>"The Baltimore and Ohio Company has increased its equipment to about three
                        hundred locomotives and four thousand cars. Its capacity for business is now
                        far beyond the ability of lines working in conjunction with it to dispose of
                        the vast quantities of freight it brings to our city. At this time more than
                        seventy-five trains daily of passengers and freight pass over the main stem
                        of the Baltimore and Ohio road upon the Baltimore division. The power of the
                        Company, by its large additions of the double track, and increase of
                        facilities and equipment with its additional branches will be constantly
                        enlarged. The direct outlets for this vast outlets for this vast [UNCLEAR]
                        of traffic must follow."</p>
                    <p>Think of that, reader. Three hundred locomotives, four thousand cars,
                        seventy-five daily trains! And all this besides the business done on that
                        branch of the same road which extends from Washington to Baltimore.</p>

                <summary>Quotes extensively from the report of President Garrett of the Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad Company, advocating the construction of a rail line through
                    the Valley. Garrett argues that "during the existence of slavery in Virginia, a
                    jealousy existed of any line leading to the free States, by which slave property
                    became less safe." But with that "obstacle" removed, Garrett argues, the time
                    for the Valley railroad is right.</summary>

                    <p>On our first page will be found an extra from the report of Mr. Garrett,
                        President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., which favors the
                        construction of a railroad, by that company, through the Valley of
                        Virginian, from Harper's Ferry to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. A
                        somewhat similar proposition was made many years since, but was rejected,
                        and we have looked forward to the revival of the proposition for some time.
                        There is no richer region of the country in the United States than the
                        Shenandoah Valley, and none which would more amply repay the expense of
                        building a road through it. It possesses a climate unequaled on this
                        continent, a soil rich and productive, and abounds in mineral resources, but
                        being deprived of an easy access to market, the greater portion being many
                        miles by wagon transportation from railway communication, it is, as yet, in
                        a comparatively undeveloped condition. We believe it to be to the interest
                        of Virginia, to intersect the entire State with a net-work of railways, and
                        thus bring every portion into direct communication with the markets of the
                        world. States of far less natural resources than the "Old Dominion," have
                        passed her in the race of progress, by the facilities of trade and travel
                        they have created, and now is the time for Virginia to profit by their
                        experience. Systems of rapid intercommunication will greatly increase the
                        value of her lands, and induce a rapid and healthy emigration. Particularly
                        will this be the case in the Valley. With a railroad running through the
                        entire length of the Valley, it would be but a few years before it would not
                        only be the most populous, but most productive region in the Union.</p>
                    <p>There seems to be a fear in the minds of some, that Richmond will suffer by
                        the building of such road. This is poor logic indeed. Must the Valley lay
                        dormant, because, in advancing her interest, the interest of Richmond, or
                        some other locality, may suffer? Did Richmond consult the interest of any
                        other locality when her own interest was concerned, unless she was to be
                        advantaged thereby? If she had, we would have considered Richmond very
                        foolish. We do not believe, however, that the building of such a road would
                        be detrimental to the interest of Richmond. It is true, Richmond would have
                        to compete with Baltimore and other cities, for the trade of this section,
                        but such a competition would be the life of Richmond. It would give her a
                        vitality which she has never had. The trade which the Valley now furnishes,
                        would be small, compared with what she would then furnish. To secure this
                        trade, Richmond would put forth vigorous efforts-she would, as Baltimore is
                        doing, import direct from foreign countries, instead of being the middle man
                        between the country merchant and the importer. If she did not put forth
                        efforts to induce a trade from the interior, she would not deserve the
                        trade. But she will do so. She only needs a live coal on her back to make
                        her move. This road would unquestionably add greatly to the wealth of
                        Richmond, Baltimore and other cities, but what is of more importance to us
                        it would add greatly to our own wealth &amp; to the interest of the
                        entire State. Virginia has lain long enough in her undeveloped condition.
                        Her resources must be brought out-must be made available for the general
                        good. Project railroads in every direction: complete and equip them, and her
                        resources will be developed, and her wealth and prosperity greatly enhanced.</p>
                    <p>As a commencement, we know no better undertaking than to build a railroad
                        through the Valley, &amp; we say, with all our heart, "on with the good
                        work."</p>
                    <p>The Legislature should facilitate the construction of a railway communication
                        through the Valley, and in other available directions in the State. By no
                        other means can it add some much to the welfare of our people, or so rapidly
                        promote the general interests of Virginia.</p>

                    <p>At the residence of her father , Mr. Wm S. [UNCLEAR], near Greenville,
                        Augusta County, Va.. on Friday 8th of Dec. 1865, Miss SALLIE ANN [UNCLEAR],
                        aged about 23 years.</p>
                    <p>"Death loves a shining mark." This truth was exemplified in the deceased of
                        our young friend. Beautiful in person, attractive in manner, the object upon
                        whom was lavished the love of parents and friends, there was much to bind
                        her to earth. But "whom the Gods love die early." The deadly shaft was
                        launched: the ties of earthly affection were broken: the grave received its
                        prey.</p>
                    <p>Her death was calm and peaceful. Having embraced Christ as her Savior about
                        eighteen months ago, the sting was extracted from death, and when the end of
                        life's pilgrimage drew near, she "had a desire to depart and be with Christ,
                        which is far better." Toward the close of her illness, she raised her hands
                        and said: <lb/></p>
                    <p>"Filled with delight, my raptured soul</p>
                    <p>Would here no longer stay." <lb/></p>
                    <p>"Thy will be done." We commit her dust to its kindred dust and hopefully look
                        forward to the resurrection of the last day.</p>
                    <p>May the grace of the gospel and the comfort of the Holy Ghost be furnished to
                        the bleeding hearts of her surviving friends. <lb/></p>
                    <p>IN MEMORY OF MISS S. A. H. <lb/></p>
                    <p>Farewell, dear Sallie, fare thee well,</p>
                    <p>That thou art gone, is true;</p>
                    <p>Though, in the shining courts you dwell,</p>
                    <p>We've wept-still weep for you.</p>
                    <p>The angels there, with deep-toned harps,</p>
                    <p>Bent from the heavenly dome,</p>
                    <p>And shouted, as she entered there:</p>
                    <p>"Behold! She comes, she comes." <lb/></p>
                    <p>She came to join the blood-washed hand,</p>
                    <p>From doubt, and pain and woe;</p>
                    <p>She came to share these heavenly courts,</p>
                    <p>Where sorrow is no more.</p>
                    <p>Here not a cloud shall shade her brow,</p>
                    <p>Her eyes ne'er shed a tear;</p>
                    <p>No anxious doubts can pain her now,</p>
                    <p>No sorrowing hearts are here. <lb/></p>
                    <p>She came to meet long severed ones-</p>
                    <p>All are united now.</p>
                    <p>She came with wreaths of gladness twined</p>
                    <p>Around her beaming brow</p>
                    <p>She came with raptures songs of joy.</p>
                    <p>She came with gladness home,</p>
                    <p>While angels tune their harps anew,</p>
                    <p>And shout: "she comes, she comes."</p>
