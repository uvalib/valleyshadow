                <summary>The paper reprints an article from the Richmond Whig which reports that
                    many northern soldiers are complaining to their home communities about the delay
                    in mustering out. The article supports and sympathizes with the desire of the
                    soldiers to return home. "The people of the South are quiet, peaceable and
                    loyal, and propose to continue in that frame of mind the remainder of their days
                    on earth. So far as they are concerned, therefore, there is not the shadow of
                    necessity for the presence of a single Federal soldier in their midst."</summary>

                    <p>A friend furnishes the Winnsboro' <emph rend="italic">News</emph> with the
                        following as a substance of a speech made by a negro man in a neighboring
                        town, on the Fourth of July:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">My Colored Friends:</emph> I belong to the same man I
                        belonged to when I can first remember. He has always treated me kindly, and
                        he is a perfect gentleman, because I have always tried to do my duty to my
                        master. I expect to stay with him as long as we both live. I intend to do
                        the very best for him I can, and I feel that in promoting his interest I am
                        doing but good service to myself.</p>
                    <p>Now, many colored people are of the opinion that the way to be gentlemen and
                        ladies is to have nothing to do. Now I tell you, people that will do nothing
                        will cut a poor figure in the world after awhile, for they will have nothing
                        to go on. No true gentleman is lazy. If you wish to be gentlemen and ladies
                        you must work, and in order to do this successfully you must have something
                        to work with--you must have a home, land and means of cultivating it. If you
                        leave your former master you can't have these. I have no doubt you have all
                        the necessaries of life in greater abundance than you can have after you
                        leave your masters.</p>
                    <p>My advice is for you to go home, stay there, do all you can to please and
                        profit your masters, and Heaven's richest blessings will come upon you.</p>

                <summary>The paper prints the substance of a reported speech by an ex-slave urging
                    all freedmen to return to work for their old masters. The speaker praises the
                    kindness of his master and attacks the notion that "the way to be gentlemen and
                    ladies is to have nothing to do." The speaker argues serving ex-masters is the
                    only way to gain access to homes, land, and supplies.</summary>
