<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals in the United States Congress, not content with the overthrow of
                        slavery in the Southern States, seem intent upon still further goading our
                        section, under the shallow pretense of protecting the emancipated slaves.
                        The know full well that the best friends the poor negroes have are the
                        Southern people, their former owners, and if left alone, they will be made
                        useful laborers and be properly cared for. But this does not suit the
                        Radical faction. Without the negro as a hobby their party must sink into
                        oblivion. Desperate cases require desperate remedies, and desperate are the
                        efforts of the Radicals to keep their party together.</p>
                    <p>Just before the assembling of Congress, a Radical caucus was held and a
                        course mapped out, evidently looking to the forestalling of public opinion
                        on the forthcoming message of the President, and likewise to commit the
                        Republican members to the Radical policy.-In the pursuance of this plan,
                        Messrs. Sumner, Wade and Stevens, on the first opportunity after the meeting
                        of Congress, presented a series of resolutions and bills, aimed directly at
                        the further humiliation, if not the destruction of the Southern people.</p>
                    <p>Among these, the bill presented by Mr. Sumner, to preserve the trial by jury,
                        to the effect that, in sections where one-sixth of the population are
                        Africans, one-half of grand juries shall consist of persons of African
                        descent, and a like proportion of petit juries, where the cases refer to
                        injuries inflicted of persons of African descent upon whites and vice versa, and prejudice to said race is made the
                        ground for challenging or expulsion, is most particularly aimed at the
                        Southern people. If not, why not make a general law for such formation of
                        juries, for descendents of the African are to be found in every section of
                        the Union? This bill aimed at the South, if passed, will not that
                        immediately on its passage, African labor will ceased [MISSING LINES] forced
                        to go North to find employment.--Being a citizen, no laws can be framed by
                        Northern Legislatures, as was done in days gone by, to prevent his coming
                        among them, and soon in Northern States, and no where else, will the African
                        number one-sixth of the population. The South will then have no further
                        trouble on this score, but the North will. Their juries will be framed in
                        the plan of this proposed law of Congress, until the unnatural climate of
                        the North, brings to early graves the African race of this Continent. </p>
                    <p>They can live long an easily, become useful members of society and be amply
                        protected, and increase instead of diminish in the congenial climate of the
                        South, if their pretended Northern friends would cease their silly and
                        malicious interference, and it is to be hoped that they will cease ere long,
                        for every blow struck at the South, thus far, falls, and falls heavily, on
                        the head of the poor negro.</p>
