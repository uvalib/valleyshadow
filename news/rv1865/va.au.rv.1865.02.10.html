<b>The Peace Bubble Exploded</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor reports that the commissioners who traveled to the North to
                    discuss peace met with immediate rejection from President Lincoln, who said he
                    would agree to nothing less than the South's unconditional surrender. The editor
                    posits that the idea of a quick peace other than through a Southern victory is
                    now gone forever. As a result, the South will become even more united and
                    determined to succeed.<br>
