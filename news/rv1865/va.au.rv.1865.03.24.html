                    <p>Public Meeting.</p>
                    <p>At a large and enthusiastic meeting of the citizens of Augusta County, held
                        at their Court House on Monday the 27th day of February 1865. General Kenton
                        Harper was called to the chair and Wm. H. Tams. Wm H.H. Lynn and Richard
                        Mauzy were appointed Secretaries.</p>
                    <p>Gen. H. on assuming the chair forcibly explained the object of the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Col. Wm. H. Harman, in behalf of the committee appointed by the primary
                        meeting held in Staunton, and which called this meeting, reported the
                        following Preamble and Resolutions:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, The people of these Confederate States have had a distinct and
                        unmistakeable [sic] issue presented to them by the Despotic Ruler of the
                        United States, We are emphatically informed that the abject surrender of our
                        liberty as a people is demanded, and further contumacy and assistance is to
                        be visited with all the horrors of a subjugation which carries in its brain
                        deprivation of personal freedom for ourselves and children; confiscation of
                        our property, and the destruction of every right we hold dear. The
                        Government created by us and fairly representing us, has met this insolent
                        demand with a manly defiance, which we re-echo and endorse. Placing our
                        trust in the Lord of Hosts; relying upon the justice of our cause;
                        preferring death to dishonor--determined to bequeath the precious boon of
                        Independence which we inherited from our Fathers, to our children, or die in
                        the effort; willing to lay our all if need be
                        upon the altar of our country, resolved never to submit to the yoke of such
                        a people as those with whom our brothers and sons have been engaged in
                        deadly struggle for four years, and who have delighted in sacking and
                        destroying our houses, devastating our lands, insulting our women and
                        murdering our citizens; the People of Augusta County have assemble[d] in
                        primary meeting, and do solemnly Resolve:</p>
                    <p>1st. That we have a firm and certain conviction of the justice of our cause,
                        and will maintain it at every sacrifice of blood and treasure.</p>
                    <p>2nd. That the watchfires of Liberty lighted in 1861 burn with undiminished
                        brilliancy in this the 5th year of the cruel war waged against us by our
                        unscrupulous and vindictive foe; and though occasional disasters have and
                        may occur to our gallant armies, they cannot be extinguished until our
                        independence as a people is fully established.</p>
                    <p>3rd. That the noble, defiant and patriotic resolves coming up daily from our
                        gallant armies in the field and from our people at home, give renewed
                        assurance of unspoken determination to persist in the struggle until that
                        end shall have been attained.</p>
                    <p>4th. That our subjugation cannot be effected if our people are united--and
                        notwithstanding the vaunted superiority of our enemy in numbers, having full
                        faith in the justice of a righteous God, in the valor of our veteran
                        soldiers and in the patriotism of our people, we may, and do set their
                        threats of extermination at defiance.</p>
                    <p>5th. That we regard reconstruction as but another name for submission to
                        tyranny, and "we pledge our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor never to
                        entertain even the idea of it, but to resist it in the future as we have
                        done in the past, to the utmost extremity.</p>
                    <p>6th. That our confidence in our Rulers, civil and military and our noble
                        armies is unabated.</p>
                    <p>7th. That for the sustenance and support of our Government and our soldiers
                        we are prepared to meet all demands which are made upon us, and to this end,
                        if it be deemed necessary, we are willing to open our Store Houses, and
                        reduce our families to half rations, or even less.</p>
                    <p>8th. That having given our sons and brothers to the cause we would be "less
                        than man," if we were not ready to make any sacrifice of property, or
                        hesitate to respond to the calls of our chosen leaders.</p>
                    <p>9th. That whilst some of our fellow citizens oppose the arming of our
                        negroes, we are content with the knowledge that we have the sanction of God
                        for using all the means in our power to resist wicked oppression, and if
                        this means of resistance be deemed necessary and available by such men as
                        President Davis and by Gen. Robt. E. Lee, we shall not stop to discuss
                        abstract questions, but will cheerfully give our servants, as we have our
                        sons to our country.</p>
                    <p>Which at his instance, were laid upon the table until after the speakers had
                        been heard:</p>
                    <p>Col. Harman then read to the meeting letters from Hons. J.P. Benjamin, J.B.
                        Baldwin and G.A. Henry and Brig. Genl. H.A. Wise, which are hereto appended,
                        explaining the reasons of their declination to accept the invitation
                        extended to them to address the meeting; and verbably [sic] explained that
                        his public duties prevented Hon Bolivar Christian from being present.</p>
                    <p>Richmond, Feb. 20th 1865.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>It would afford me great pleasure to accept your invitation and to address
                        the people at your meeting on the 27th inst., but I regret to say that
                        during the session of Congress my public duties do not permit my leaving
                        Richmond more than a few hours at a time.</p>
                    <p>I am, very respectfully</p>
                    <p>Your ob't serv't</p>
                    <p>J.P. Benjamin.</p>
                    <p>-------</p>
                    <p>Messrs Wm H Harman, T J Michie, B Crawford and others.</p>
                    <p>-------</p>
                    <p>Messrs Wm H Harman and Others, Committee.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>I have received yours of 17th inst., inviting me to address a mass meeting of
                        the people of Augusta County on the 27th inst. on the condition of the
                        Country &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>I have already taken occasion, as far as my public duties would allow, to
                        speak to the people and the army as to what I regarded as the duties of the
                        home, and it would give me great pleasure to be present among my own people
                        on the occasion referred to, to give and receive counsel in this time of our
                        country's trial. If my duties here will allow of my absence I will be with
                        you, but I fear it will be impracticable, in which event please explain the
                        cause of my failure.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully Your ob't serv't,</p>
                    <p>John B. Baldwin.</p>
                    <p>-------</p>
                    <p>Richmond, Feb 21st 1865.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sirs:</p>
                    <p>Your note of the [illegible] was duly received, inviting me to address the
                        people of Staunton on the 27th inst., at a mass meeting of the people. If
                        Congress adjourns before that date, I will be with you if possible, if it
                        does not and I must say I think it will not, I do not see how I can comply
                        with your wishes and certainly with my own. My heart is with you and I pray
                        you to assure the people, we are not conquered, and will not be if the
                        people are true to themselves and our country. Be firm, let the people be
                        bold and hopeful and self sacrificing of property, and blood, and life, if
                        need be, and all will yet be well. We have no choice, we must fight on, and
                        fight ever or be subjugated by a low born Despot, the worst calamity that
                        can afflict a free people.</p>
                    <p>Ever yours,</p>
                    <p>G.A. Henry.</p>
                    <p>-------</p>
                    <p>Head Qr's Wise's Brigade,</p>
                    <p>Trenches Near Petersburg Va,</p>
                    <p>February 21st 1865.</p>
                    <p>To Wm H Harman and Others</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>I received yours of the 17th inst., yesterday; requesting me to attend and
                        address a mass meeting of the people of Augusta on the 27th inst. I wish it
                        was in my power to do so. Glorious old Augusta has so often and so early in
                        this war spoken to my heart, that in never ending gratitude I would speak
                        back to her with my whole heart and soul: Go on! don't
                            falter and you will not fail, if you are sorely pressed strive
                        only the more: the darkest hour is just before the day breaks, we want light, and let every watch fire be kindled. Light
                        every match and shed every ray--if it be but from a rush light or a
                        camp-match. Don't despair, despondency is darkness and death. I don't forget
                        that as Patrick Henry seized the Magazine at Williamsburg so the men of
                        Augusta seized the arsenal at Harper's Ferry; and as she began the struggle
                        and set the first ball of revolution in motion in Virginia, so let her
                        gallant and devoted people keep it rolling on until it reaches the mark of
                        our entire, separate [sic] and sovereign independence? Fight, march, suffer,
                        struggle, starve, perish rather than take any thing short of that! Think not
                        at all of submission or subjugation but with hot indignation and abhorrence!
                        Be men! be free! you can be free if you will. You have but never to cease
                        your efforts, to be united and self-denying and self-sacrifising, and to
                        trust to yourselves and to God alone. He can make us "a chosen generation, a
                        royal pries[t]hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people." My duties here in
                        front of an unceaseingly [sic] active enemy, and a severe attack of bilious
                        influenza, with a distressing cough, will prevent my attendance. But you
                        have my best cheers to animate your efforts and
                        my prayers that God will secure you.</p>
                    <p>Devotedly Yours,</p>
                    <p>Henry A. Wise, Brig Gen.</p>
                    <p>-------</p>
                    <p>Hons J.M. McCue, J.R. Tucker and H. W. Sheffy invited speakers, were
                        several[l]y introduced and entertained the meeting with able patriotic and
                        spirited addresses. Hon. A.H.H. Stuart being then called upon by the meeting
                        delivered a most forcible practical and patriotic address.</p>
                    <p>The following "Appeal to the people of Virginia" was introduced by Maj McCue
                        in his address and by direction is published here with and commended to the
                        people of Augusta.</p>
                    <p>-------</p>
                    <p>Appeal to the People of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Richmond Feb 22d, 1865.</p>
                    <p>Fellow-Citizens: Commissary General St. John, at his recent entrance upon the
                        duties of his bureau, invited several gentlemen of this city, including a
                        number of clergymen, to a conference as to the best means of increasing the
                        supplies of food necessary for the subsistence of the Army of Northern
                        Virginia. At this conference the undersigned were appointed as a committee
                        to prepare and issue an address to the loyal people of the State, for the
                        purpose of placing before them such facts and of making such suggestions as
                        will, it is confidently believed, ensure a general and hearty co-operation
                        in this great and necessary work.</p>
                    <p>You are aware, fellow citizens, that the movements of the enemy in South
                        Carolina and Georgia have interrupted our communications with the Southern
                        States, and seriously embarrassed the operations of the Subsistence
                        Department, so that immediate and energetic action on the part of the
                        Government and the people is demanded for the support of the army.</p>
                    <p>It is ascertained that the supply of food in the acces[s]ible counties of
                        North Carolina and Virginia is ample for the subsistence of both of soldiers
                        and citizens. Of the four modes of obtaining it for the use of the army,
                        viz: by impressment, purchase, loan, and voluntary contributions, it is
                        believed that when the exigency, now existing, is clearly understood, the
                        last mentioned method will be the one most approved by the people, and
                        therefore the one which will command the most cheerful, immediate, and
                        generous aid on their part.</p>
                    <p>The resources of the people have already been severely taxed. Vast puantities
                        [sic] of food have already been obtained by impressment, loans, and
                        voluntary contributions. but for these extraordinary efforts our armies
                        would have long since been disbanded, and without a continuation of these
                        efforts our soldiers cannot accomplish the task yet before them. Apart from
                        all those considerations of honor and duty, which most constrain high-toned
                        and patriotic men, these liberal contributions on the part of citizens are
                        necessary to the preservation of their own rights of property and personal
                        safety. Interest itself demands any and every sacrifice necessary to prevent
                        subjugation.</p>
                    <p>On this point, one testimony will be sufficient. Virginians and patriots all
                        over the Confederacy will regard with implicit belief and profoundest
                        respect any statement on such a subject emanating from our beloved
                        Commander-in-Chief, Gen. Robert E. Lee. in reference to the very appeal we
                        are now making, he writes: "I cannot permit myself to doubt that our people
                        will respond to it, when they reflect on the alternative presented to them.
                        They have simply to choose whether they will contribute such commissary and
                        q[u]artermaster stores as they can possibly spare to support an army which
                        has already borne and done so much in their behalf, or, retaining their
                        stores, maintain the army of the enemy engaged in their subjugation. I am
                        aware that a general obligation of this nature rests lightly on most
                        men--each being disposed to leave its discharge to his neighbor--but I am
                        confident that our citizens will appreciate their responsibility in the
                        case, and will not permit an army which, by God's blessings and their
                        patriotic support, has hitherto resisted the efforts of the enemy, to suffer
                        now through their neglect.</p>
                    <p>Such being the emergency, and the corresponding obligation it only remains
                        now to consider the best practicable means of attaining the end in view.</p>
                    <p>There is in every county accessible to us in the State an officer or agent of
                        the Bureau of Subsistence, charged with the duty of collecting by purchase
                        or otherwise army subsistence, and forwarding the same to this city. It is
                        also proposed to appoint two or more gentlemen of influence, energy and
                        intelligence, in each county, (who shall appoint others in each magisterial
                        district,) to call the attention to every family to the wants of the army,
                        and to urge them to contribute in some way as large a portion of their
                        supplies as can possibly be spared. These contributions can be made as
                        donations, sales or loans, at the option of the owners, and the supplies, so
                        obtained will be sent to some convenient point to be indicated by the local
                        officer, where he will receive and receipt for the same, and give the
                        parties, when required, an obligation in kind or in currency.</p>
                    <p>But, as already intimated, there are difficulties in the way of obtaining
                        supplies either by purchase or by loan, which one be best overcome by the
                        spontaneous and free-will offerings of the people, generously contributing
                        of their substance for the support of the army now battling and suffering in
                        their behalf.</p>
                    <p>For the information of those who desire to aid the cause by voluntary
                        contributions we beg leave to state that the following plan has been
                        considered and approved by the authorities.</p>
                    <p>1. Let every citizen, who can, pledge himself to furnish the rations of one
                        soldier for six months, without designating any particular soldier as the
                        recipient of the contribution.</p>
                    <p>2. Let those thus pledging themselves furnish, say 80 pounds of bacon and 180
                        pounds of flour, or their equivalent in beef and meal, to be delivered to
                        the nearest commissary agent.</p>
                    <p>3. Let the donor bind himself to deliver one half of the amount above stated,
                        viz: 40 pounds of bacon and 90 pounds of flour (or its equivalent)
                        immediately, and the remainder at the end of three months, unless he prefers
                        to adopt the better plan of advancing the whole amount pledged at once.</p>
                    <p>4. Let the pledge of each individual subscribing and furnishing the rations
                        of one soldier for 6 months be made the basis of larger subscriptions. Those
                        whose generosity and whose means will enable them to do so, may obligate
                        themselves to provide the rations of 5, 10, 20 or any other number of
                        soldiers for 6 months; while even the poor who could not offord [sic] to
                        supply the ration of one man, by uniting their contributions may authorize
                        one of the number, 20 combining, to make the designated subscription of at
                        least one ration for one man for six months.</p>
                    <p>We trust that this plan, so intelligible and so easily put into execution,
                        will commend itself to thousands of our patriotic people, who, by reason of
                        age, sex or infirmities cannot serve in the field, will yet take pride and
                        pleasure in being represented in the field in the persons of soldiers whose
                        rations they themselves furnish.</p>
                    <p>On this subject, Gen. Lee expresses the opinion that almost every one who has
                        a family, especially among our farmers, could afford to support one more in
                        addition to his present number and that this plan will not require a man to
                        do more than to send to a soldier what he would always be able to give in
                        the way of hospitality to such soldier, were he an inmate of his house.</p>
                    <p>The scheme thus explained presents a system which may be contracted or
                        expanded according to the ability of the contributor--not excluding the
                        poor, and giving scope to the largest liberality of the rich; and, in fact,
                        presents a plan for securing all the food in the country which can be
                        obtained by voluntary contribution.</p>
                    <p>And now, in order to carry it into immediate execution, the co-operation of
                        legislators, magistrates, ministers of the Gospel, and all persons of
                        influence and standing in every county is earnestly invoked. The cause is
                        one which makes its own appeal to fathers and mothers who have sons in the
                        army; to men of wealth who have large possessions to protect; to men in
                        humble circumstances, to whom the liberties of their country are equally
                        dear; to all classes in the community, whose security and happiness are
                        involved in the issue of this struggle for the right of self-government.
                        Every right-minded and right-hearted man must feel that citizens in their
                        comfortable homes, exempt from the privations and perils of the field,
                        should be willing to exercise the severest self-denial, if necessary, that
                        the army to which, under God, we are indebted for our present safety, and to
                        whom we must owe our final deliverance from the presence and the power of
                        the enemy, should at least be supplied with the food which is essential to
                        the vigorous health and comfort of its soldiers. A claim so reasonable and
                        just must and will be satisfied.</p>
                    <p>And now, in concluding our appeal to you, fellow-citizens, we do not forget
                        that Virginia has already suffered sorely in this struggle to obtain all
                        that is dearest to the patriot's heart. The bloody tide of battle has swept
                        over almost every portion of her territory; the sa[c]rifices, as well as the
                        services, of her sons have been great; yet the spirit of her people has
                        never flagged, nor are her resources exhausted. She has hitherto responded
                        nobly to every call the Confederate Government has made upon her; and it is
                        not doubted that now, when made aware of its present wants, her people will
                        prove themselves both able and willing to relieve them.</p>

                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr Stuarts address, he proposed the following paper for
                        the consideration of the meeting "we the undersigned agree and promise to
                        provide for the use and support of the soldiers in the army of Confederate
                        States the amount of funds and of supplies annexed to our names
                        respectively" whereupon sixty-six of those present subscribed about 135 bbs
                        of flour upwards of 7000 lbs of Bacon, and about $115,000 in C S Treasury
                        notes and bonds.</p>
                    <p>On motion, a central Committee of --- was appointed to issue an address, and
                        to appoint sub committees, in each Majisterial [sic] District, to circulate
                        said address and to solicit further subscriptions of provisions and money.
                        (The names of said Committee will be announced hereafter)</p>
                    <p>On motion it was ordered that the proce[e]dings be published in the Staunton
                        Vindicator and communicated to the Richmond papers for publication.</p>
                    <p>On motion the meeting adjourned.</p>

                    <p>We are sorry that we are unable this week to give our readers any very late
                        intelligence from our armies either in Virginia or North Carolina.</p>
                    <p>The interruption of communication, both by Railroad and Telegraph, caused by
                        Sheridan and his vandals is our apology for the paucity of army news this
                        week.</p>
                    <p>Not having the most implicit confidence in the various reports in circulation
                        (relative to our armies) based upon the authority of Madam Rumor, and some
                        reliable Gentlemen, we are compelled to confine ourselves to the dispatches
                        of Genl Lee (published below) and some extracts from the Lynchburg
                        Republican of the 18th inst., handed us by a friend, believing that they

                    </p>
                    <p>Gen. Bragg reports that he attacked the enemy yesterday, four miles in front
                        of Kinston, and drove him from his position. He disputed the ground
                        obstinately, and took a new line three miles from his first.</p>
                    <p>We captured three pieces of artillery and fifteen hundred prisoners.</p>
                    <p>The number of the enemy's dead and wounded left on the field is large.</p>
                    <p>Our loss was comparatively small.</p>

                    <p>Head'Qrs, March 10, 1865.</p>
                    <p>Hon Secretary of War:</p>
                    <p>Gen Hampton attacked Kilpatrick at daylight this morning and drove him from
                        camp, capturing his guns wagons, many horses and several hundred prisoners,
                        and releasing a great many of our men who had been captured.</p>
                    <p>The guns and wagons could not be brought off for want of horses.</p>
                    <p>Many of the enemy were killed and wounded.</p>
                    <p>Our loss was not heavy.</p>
                    <p>Lieut Col. B.L. King was killed, and Brig Gen Hume, Cols Hayne and Harrison
                        and Majors Lewis, Ferguson and others were wounded.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) R.E. Lee, Genl.</p>
                    <p>Later accounts in the Republican state that Genl Bragg, the next day after
                        the fight at Kinston, was compelled by force of superior numbers to fall
                        back in the direction of Goldsboro.</p>
                    <p>We are also indebted to the Petersburg Express for a little more information
                        in regard to the fight between Genls Hampton and Kilpatrick, which will be
                        (to say the least) very amusing to our readers. The Editor states that he is
                        informed through private sources, that the attack of Hampton was like a like
                        [sic] thunderbolt from a cloudless sky--and of course a most complete
                        surprise.</p>
                    <p>Kilpatrick was aroused from his slumbers--all the more profound because it
                        was the early morning nap--and had barely time to leap from his couch,
                        enrobed in only a shirt and socks, and mount the nearest horse. The weather
                        was cold, and the rain was falling fast, and the Georgia uniform at such a
                        time, was of all others the least calculated to contribute to one's comfort.
                        But there was no time to procure thicker clothing. The Georgia uniform, or
                        surrender to the gallant Carolinians were the only alternatives, and of the
                        two evils, General Kilpatrick preferred the former. It is said that his
                        coat, pantaloons, boots, spurs, pistols and sword, fell into the hands of
                        our men--and we can well imagine how highly the Palmetto boys will prize
                        such trophies. Gen Kilpatrick for once realized the truth of the couplet,
                        "That he who "don't fight," but runs away, will live to fight another day."</p>
                    <p>From the Raleigh Progress of the 13th we learn that the enemy occupied
                        Fayetteville on Saturday the 11th inst., and that our forces are falling
                        back in the direction of Raleigh. A concentration of all our forces, and a
                        big battle near this place is thought probable. The same paper of the 15th
                        states, that a rumor was in circulation that the advance of the Federals
                        were crossing at McNeils Ferry--about 30 miles from Raleigh. It is also
                        stated that Yankee troops were moving at the same time towards Goldsboro.</p>
                    <p>From Richmond we learn that Grant is moving troops to the North side of the
                        James, as if intending to mass for an attack on that portion of our lines.
                        This is thought to be a ruse, and that the attack, if any is made, will be
                        on our right, with the hope of getting possession of the South side
                        Railroad.</p>

                        was handed us:</p>
                    <p>Hdqr's A.C.S., March 20th 1865.</p>
                    <p>Hon J C Breckinridge Sec'y of War:</p>
                    <p>Genl Jos E Johnson reports that about 5 PM on the 19th inst. he attacked the
                        enemy near Bentonville, routed him, capturing three guns. A mile in the rear
                        he rallied upon fresh troops, but was forced back slowly until 6 P M, when
                        receiving more troops, he apparently assumed the offensive, which was
                        resisted without difficulty until dark. This morning he is entrenching, our
                        loss small. The troops behaved admirably well. Dense thickets prevented
                        rapid operations.</p>

<b>Sheridan's Raid</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Sheridan's troops left Winchester on Monday, February 27, 1865, reached
                    Staunton on Thursday morning, moved on to Charlottesville on Friday, then
                    divided into two columns when they moved on Monday. They encountered General
                    Early's small force in Waynesboro while they were on their way to Staunton and
                    captured six hundred or seven hundred of Early's men, according to people who
                    saw these prisoners pass through Staunton. Sheridan's troops destroyed canals,
                    rail lines, and bridges along the way, in addition to large quantities of
                    government supplies and personal property. Sheridan met little resistance
                    because the Confederate troops were so scattered. The editor hopes the forces
                    will be kept more concentrated in the future and insists that farmers of the
                    Valley and in counties east of the Blue Ridge must be willing to supply the army
                    if they want to keep the army nearby for protection.<br>

                    <p>From the best information we can get we give the following statement of
                        Sheridan's force and movement.</p>
                    <p>His force consists of two Divisions and one Brigade of Cavalry under the
                        command of Genls Custer, Merritt and Devin, with four pieces of artillery,
                        the whole numbering from seven to nine thousand men.</p>
                    <p>He broke camp at Winchester on Monday 27th Feb. and reached Staunton on
                        Thursday morning and pushed on to Waynesboro, meeting and scattering Gen
                        Early's small force at that place, capturing, it was supposed by persons who
                        saw them pass through Staunton, about six or seven hundred prisoners, and
                        pressed with his advance through Rockfish Gap to Greenwood that night. He
                        entered Charlottesville Friday 3rd inst. about 2 P.M., the Mayor and Council
                        having surrendered the town and received promise of protection. He remained
                        at Charlottesville until Monday at 10 A.M., when he moved in two columns, on
                        the Lynchburg and Scottsville roads, the first column leaving the Lynchburg
                        road, moved in the direction of and struck James River at New market, thence
                        this column moved down the Canal, preceded by the column from Scottsville,
                        to Columbia, whence they diverged in the direction of the Va Central R R,
                        which they struck at some point between Louisa C.H. and Beaver Dam, and it
                        is supposed have made their way around our extreme left to Grant. They
                        destroyed the bridges and depots, except at Charlottesville, on the Central
                        Road from Staunton to Shadwell, tore up the track of the Charlottesville and
                        Lynchburg R R about 8 miles from Charlottesville and destroyed the bridges
                        and depots on the road as far as they proce[e]ded. They burned the locks and
                        otherwise damaged the canal from New Market to Columbia and it is supposed
                        have destroyed the track of the Central Road at and for some distance beyond
                        Beaver Dam. In many of these depots they destroyed considerable quantities
                        of Government supplies.</p>
                    <p>In the country along their march they behaved with their characteristic
                        vandalism, insulting women, stealing, plundering and burning.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the fact that our forces had been scattered at different points for
                        the purpose of more easily securing a supply of forage, Sheridan was enabled
                        to move over the whole line of his march, almost without an impediment. It
                        is to be hoped that our forces may be kept more concentrated hereafter, to
                        do which the Farmers of the Valley and adjacent counties east of the Blue
                        Ridge, must be willing not only to furnish their tithe, but must spare all
                        they can to supply the army, if they desire to save their property from the
                        devastating tread of the Barbarian Yankees.</p>
