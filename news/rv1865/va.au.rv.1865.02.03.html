<b>The Army of Northern Virginia</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Soldiers in the Army of Northern Virginia are completely devoted to the
                    army, this article argues. Whatever their feelings towards President Davis, they
                    have unending allegiance to the army because they have lost land, homes, slaves,
                    and friends to the Southern cause. They have lost their bonds to civilian life,
                    have no homes to return to, and are devoted to their general, giving them ample
                    motivation to continue the rebellion indefinitely.<br>

<b>Commissioners to Washington</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>President Davis has appointed A. H. Stephens, vice president of the
                    Confederate States, R. M. T. Hunter, senator, and Judge Campbell, formerly
                    assistant secretary of war and formerly a justice on the United States Supreme
                    Court, as commissioners to Washington to confer with similar authorities in the
                    United States on the subject of peace. They are on their way to Washington now.
                    The editor is pleased that the two hostile governments will make this effort to
                    end the war but cautions readers not to get their hopes too high that peace is
                    imminent.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor is pleased with the selection of General John C. Breckenridge as
                    secretary of war. However, he knows the people of the Valley will regret losing
                    Breckenridge's services in the field, as they have witnessed his abilities as a
                    military commander.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>General Hunter</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When General Hunter resigned his post last fall, he returned to Princeton,
                    New Jersey to live. What he found instead of acceptance was that he was not
                    welcomed even in his hometown because of the crimes he had committed in
                    Virginia. He learned that his house would be burned if he tried to settle there.<br>

<b>Meeting of the Staunton Artillery</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Staunton Artillery convened at their camp near Fishersville on February
                    1, 1865. They adopted resolutions affirming that the same spirit that motivated
                    them in 1861 was still strong, that they refused to fail in the cause, that they
                    refused to accept any peace agreement that did not recognize Southern
                    independence, that they thanked the women of Augusta County for the bountiful
                    meal prepared for the Artillery on January 28, and that they pledged their
                    commitment to fight another four years to defend liberty if necessary.<br>

<b>Married</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Charlotte T. Hanger married Henry A. Ludwick, of Rockbridge County and of
                    the 27th Virginia Infantry, at the home of her father in Augusta County on
