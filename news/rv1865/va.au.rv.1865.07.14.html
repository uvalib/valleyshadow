<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial urges men to take the oath of amnesty and loyalty to the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Under the plan of re-organizing the Southern States to take their position
                        under the Government of the United States again, the civil offices of all
                        the States of the South have been vacated and new officers are to be
                        elected. What kind of justice will be administered, or in what way the laws
                        will be executed, is left for the people of the States, who are qualified to
                        vote, to say. Here in the State of Virginia, where we are more directly
                        interested, and to which people we speak directly, any one can see that it
                        is imperatively necessary that the BEST--the VERY BEST men we have should be
                        elected to fill our offices.</p>
                    <p>This obtains from the situation mentioned above, but especially will it be
                        the case if incompetent men should strive to get positions, supposing that
                        others offering are ineligible.</p>
                    <p>Now, if we desire a discreet and just enforcement of the laws--freedom from
                        harassments and feudish malice, and perhaps a permanency of our rights of
                        property, &amp;c, the people should rise in their might and place the
                        very best men in office.</p>
                    <p>No stickling should be entertained about the taking of Federal and State
                        Oaths. You expect to live in the State and Union, and why, in all common
                        sense, should you decline to take the oaths to support the State and Federal
                        Government, when you intend to support these Governments? By declining to do
                        so you bear all the burdens without having any privileges. In truth you have
                        no rights at all until you take these oaths, and you must take them sooner
                        or later. Then come forward like men who realize facts and qualify
                        yourselves as voters (which you can do by applying to Mr. J. C. Wheat, at
                        Staunton,) and then go to the polls, at the ensuing election, and vote for
                        the very best men you can select. Don't regard a man's political opinions in
                        the past, but take him for what he is--take him because he is the best man
                        for the position.</p>
                    <p>This is no time, because your crops or farms may suffer by a day's absence,
                        which may be the case, for you to absent yourselves from the polls, for if
                        you do your own interests and the interests of the community may suffer
                        more.</p>
                    <p>Then let me appeal to one and all to come to the polls and vote, as you
                        conscientiously believe, for the best men for each respective position. In
                        this appeal we believe we have discharged the duty we owe to the people. It
                        now remains for you, the sovereign people, to discharge yours. The election
                        is next Tuesday. See that you do your whole duty.</p>

                        For the "Vindicator."
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor: I desire through your paper to call
                        the attention of the people of the Waynesboro magisterial district, to the
                        importance of selecting four suitable persons to be voted for at the ensuing
                        election, for the office of magistrate. It has been the practice of this
                        district, for many years, to elect two persons who reside in Waynesboro and
                        two in the country. How the country Justices of this district have
                        discharged their duties, I know not. But if there ever was a country that
                        needed two faithful and fearless magistrates, it is that country known as
                        the Waynesboro section in the fifth magisterial district. For the last four
                        years, little or no attention has been paid to the execution of the laws;
                        nearly all the houses from the river to the mountain, have been converted
                        into liquor shops, where mean whiskey and brandy has been sold in broad
                        day-light. And for nearly the same length of time, three establishments of
                        the same character, have been, more or less, in operation in the edge of the
                        village north of the town. More recently a regular Bar has been opened in
                        the same section, where sorry white men and mean negroes resort and are made
                        drunk by a very mean white man. To remedy these evils, I propose to the
                        people of the district to vote for and elect, for the Waynesboro district,
                        Wm. Withrow, Jr., and J. S. Wallace, two gentlemen eminently qualified for
                        the office of magistrate, and who, I am sure, if elected, will make this
                        class of violators of the law howl if they
                        continue their evil practices. Whether these gentlemen are elected or not, I
                        beseech the people of the district not to elect either of the old justices
                        who reside at Waynesboro, for they have not been worth one cent to the preservation of the public peace.</p>
                    <p>A. Voter.</p>
