<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper urges that the voters select "good loyal men . . .
                    unexceptionable to the authorities" in the upcoming congressional elections.
                    Doing so will deny ammunition to radical Republicans which could be used to deny
                    southern representatives their seats in congress and readmission to the Union.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The time is approaching when the people of Virginia will be called upon to
                        select persons to represent them in Congress and the General Assembly. As
                        was the case in the various elections for County and municipal officers, in
                        regard to the reorganization of the State, if we elect men who will not be
                        allowed to take their seats, we retard for a time the restoration of the
                        State in the Union, and besides, the radicals will again imagine they have
                        something to rail against. There are good loyal men in our midst,
                        unexceptionable to any one, who are qualified to represent us and who will
                        most assuredly be allowed admission to their respective bodies. These are
                        the men from among whom we must make our selections if we desire the
                        restoration of law and order here and the speedy resumption of our place as
                        one of the United States. This course will relieve us of many drawbacks
                        incident to the present disordered state of affairs and will also silence
                        the tongues of the radicals, by disarming them of the only argument they
                        have attempted to use against us to prove that we are disloyal still, not
                        having yielded in good faith, and that we have sworn and subscribed to the
                        oaths of Allegiance and Amnesty with a mental reservation. Therefore we
                        suggest that the August Court, Monday 28th inst., when there will be a good
                        a representation from all portions of the County present, affording a fine
                        opportunity for a general interchange of sentiments, that a ticket be
                        arranged which will be acceptable to the people generally and
                        unexceptionable to the authorities.</p>
