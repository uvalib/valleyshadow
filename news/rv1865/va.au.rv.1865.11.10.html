<b>Four Idle Daughters</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article mocks young women who pretend to be "ladies" by refusing to do
                    household work and dressing in fine clothing. The paper advises young men to
                    marry only those women who are "ministering angels, lightening the cares of the
                    over-taxed mothers, not ashamed to be seen with unrolled sleeves and solid
                    fingers" and are "always busy at some sweet, agreeable task."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Yes every one of them, idle, slothful, and, consequently: sensual and
                        unrefined. Dress in exquisite taste do they? No doubt, and show white
                        fingers as they crotchet or play the piano. And what if they do shine in the
                        opera box, or the concert-room and theatre, as the pretty B's?--everybody
                        who knows them at all, knows them as four idle daughters. The gentlemen who,
                        captives of a passing fancy, call upon them at times, know that from morning
                        till night they pass inactive, silly lives; that their mother lives in the
                        kitchen till her face is careworn, and her feet ready to drop with fatigue.
                        Oh! it must be a bad thing to have four idle daughters, not one of whom is
                        willing to lessen the burden of expense by even a trivial employment; not
                        one of them willing to wash a muslin, or prepare a meal. Useless cumberers
                        of the ground are they, and nobody would miss them were their foolish,
                        unreasonable lives to be cut off to-morrow. They pretended to be educated,
                        can tell probably that London is the metropolis of England, and France is a
                        sunny clime; but the best of education, good, practical common sense,
                        genuine self-respect, that would make them blush for their ignoble
                        dependence, these four idle daughters lack. It is not genteel to wash for
                        themselves--it is not lady like to sweep a room, except for those coarse,
                        commonplace persons who have been brought up at work. And what, pray, are
                        they? The children of commonplace people who labor as God means every son
                        and daughter of Adam should labor, or pay the penalty of idleness. Now they
                        are four great animals, feeding, lounging and sleeping. They will never be
                        either respected or beloved by anybody whose love or respect is worth a
                        farthing. As long as their foolish mother lives she will slave for them,
                        humor them, and please herself with the imaginary belief that they are
                        ladies; for "they never did a stitch of work." When she dies, how
                        maliciously the lookers on will say: "Now these four girls have got to work;
                        I'm glad of it." They will never find the sympathy or respect they might
                        have looked for, if they possessed common sense enough to employ themselves.
                        Idleness is the nurse of sin, and it is not possible for men or women to be
                        pure and virtuous, if they lead lives of laziness and inactivity. These four
                        idle daughters are consequently, to be looked upon with some suspicion. It
                        is a hard saying, but the truth, that strict purity is incompatible with
                        laziness. Many a fair-browed girl, with sparkling eyes and engaging smile,
                        is sadly wanting in mental innocence. Watch the deportment of the daughters
                        you know. If at home they are ministering angels, lightening the cares of
                        the over-taxed mothers, not ashamed to be seen with unrolled sleeves and
                        solid fingers; if they are always busy at some sweet, agreeable task, even
                        in what they deem their idleness, the outward beauty of the shadow of the
                        soul, pure, quiet, gentle, womanly. Marry one of them.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper calls for a "farmer's convention" to meet to discuss the South's
                    labor problems. The editors argue that though some white labor can be procured
                    through immigration, Virginians must face the truth that the freedmen will
                    remain in the South for good or ill. Consequently, they must be made to labor to
                    "prevent vagrancy" and "the acquisition of idle habits." The editors argue that
                    African American labor was profitable under slavery, and can be made so again
                    with the proper laws.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the practical questions with which the people of the South have to
                        deal is that of labor. Our old labor system, which has existed for years, to
                        the advantage of the entire country, by the aid of which we have grown into
                        a first class commercial nation, has been lately swept away. With it
                        destroyed we must endeavor to maintain the position acquired through a long
                        and prosperous existence. To do this, shall we essay the reorganization of
                        the labor system of the South, adapted to the change of circumstances, from
                        our old material, or introduce new and white labor? The withdrawal or
                        removal of the freedmen en masse would relieve us
                        of the necessity of solving this question, but with them still among us and
                        to remain among us, for their removal, if ever accomplished, must be gradual
                        and will take years to consummate it, we must needs solve the problem at
                        once.</p>
                    <p>They, as we have stated above, will remain among us for years, perhaps
                        forever, and since they must of necessity be consumers they likewise must be
                        induced or compelled to produce. They have heretofore been excellent
                        producers and with the enactment of proper laws may still be as useful as
                        ever. We are not of those who would cast them aside, whether they are
                        willing to labor or not, yet we confess their action on the announcement of
                        their freedom was anything but promising of future utility as a laboring
                        class. They sought the towns, as many do yet, and refused to contract to
                        labor in the country, but in a short time they will learn that they can not
                        sustain themselves by the precarious vending of Cakes, Candies, Lemonade
                        &amp;c, and must betake themselves to useful employment.</p>
                    <p>A cotemporary, who shows a desire to see the freedmen still made useful as
                        laborers, and at the same time advantaged, recommends a "farmers convention"
                        to meet at some accessible and central point in the State, to take into
                        consideration this matter and determine the best means, with reference to
                        the interests of all parties, of securing the end desired, and to influence
                        the Legislature, by the result of its deliberations, to pass such laws,
                        alike equitable to white and black, as shall compel a rigid adherence to
                        contracts, prevent vagrancy on the part of the older, and the acquisition of
                        idle habits on the part of the younger freedmen &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>We submit this to the consideration of our people, as a matter worthy of
                        their interest, and which will be productive of good to whites and blacks.</p>
                    <p>In our desire to see the consumers among us made producers, we do not oppose
                        the introduction of white labor, simply desiring to call attention to the
                        fact that we must make producers of those who are
                        to remain with us as consumers, knowing well that there is abundant work for
                        white immigration. Indeed the vast fields of productive industry in the
                        South, still in their undeveloped infancy, offer to them inducements far
                        greater than the densely populated and more developed North and West. We
                        believe that there will be labor enough to occupy the freedmen, and
                        immigrants who may come among us for years, but that in our desire to
                        introduce white labor we must remember that we have a large laboring class
                        among us, which must not remain idle consumers, to their own and the great
                        disadvantage of the South and the whole country.</p>
