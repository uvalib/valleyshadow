<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper argues that although the Democratic party lost the recent
                    elections, their principles won. The editors assert that there is now no
                    difference between the platforms of the two parties on such critical issues as
                    reconstruction and the role of the military in the South. The Democrat's strong
                    resistance proved to Republicans that they could not impose a harsh
                    reconstruction upon the South.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Shortly after the elections in Pennsylvania and Ohio, we alluded to the fact
                        that the Democratic party, though defeated, could nevertheless boast of the
                        success of their principles, having compelled the Republican party to fight
                        the late political battles almost without an issue. So strikingly was this
                        the case that one of our Richmond contemporaries compared the platform of
                        the two parties in one state, to show that there was no difference between
                        these parties. This was really the case. Both parties endorsed President
                        Johnson's policy of reconstruction--both parties endorsed and renewed their
                        pledges to support and carry out the Monroe Doctrine,--both parties favored
                        the subordination of the military to the civil rule, and agreed practically
                        upon other minor points.</p>
                    <p>When we consider how widely different and still diverging, these parties have
                        been during the past four years, and that, except in a few points, they seem
                        now almost to harmonize in their respective platforms, we almost wonder how
                        they could have approximated so nearly the same theories and principles. But
                        when we recall the stand taken by these parties during the war and shortly
                        after its cessation, and remember that the Republican party came off with
                        flaunting banners and proud triumphant step, in the war, and were disposed
                        and did, through some of their speakers, attempt to dictate the terms of
                        conquest, and seemed determined to pursue a proscriptive policy, until they
                        found that, with a platform erected on the principles emitted by their
                        leading men, they could only meet with [unclear] at the polls, we can
                        readily understand why there now seems so little difference between them.
                        They then began to alter and amend, and deal in generalities and ignore,
                        until they almost harmonized with their opponents, and in fact nothing was
                        decided in the late elections save the defeat of the northern Democracy,
                        though their principles triumphed.</p>
                    <p>As to the President's policy of reconstruction, as we have said, both parties
                        stand positively committed to its cordial support, and the now triumphant
                        party can scarcely fail to accord that actual support to which it is
                        solemnly pledged, and if its faith is unviolated there is really "nobody
                        hurt" by the late elections.</p>

<b>Judge L. P. Thompson's Charge to the Grand Jury</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints the remarks of Judge Lucas P. Thompson delivered to the
                    Grand Jury upon the opening of the county court. Thompson celebrates the return
                    to civil law from martial law. He reflects upon the causes and outcome of the
                    Civil War and urges Augusta residents not to dwell on the past but to move
                    forward. Thompson argues that the rights of the states, secession, and slavery
                    have been decided by the war and all should abide by the result as citizens
                    firmly committed to the Union. The Grand Jury must respect the new laws
                    concerning emancipation and the rights of freedmen, but argues that most of the
                    pre-war legal code remains intact. Thompson also comments on the duty of the
                    Grand Jury to uphold justice and punish crime.<br>(Names in announcement:  Lucas P. Thompson)</blockquote>

                        (if not incompatible with your idea of propriety) that you furnish the News
                        papers of the Town with a copy of the very able, and appropriate charge
                        delivered to them on the convening of your Court.</p>

                    <p>DEAR SIR: I have received your note of the 5th inst., asking me to furnish a
                        copy of my charge to the grand jury, delivered on the first day of the term,
                        for publication. In compliance with your request, I send the manuscript,
                        granting you permission to give it such destination as you desire, and
                        remain very respectfully,<br> Your obedient Servant,<br> LUCAS P.
                        THOMPSON.</p>
                    <p>To John Newton, Esq.,<br> Foreman of the Grand Jury.</p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY--I congratulate you upon the return of peace, the
                        reopening of the Courts of Justice, so long virtually closed by the violence
                        of war, and upon so auspicious an occasion as that of our reassembling, to
                        inaugurate the reign of law and order, of the civil authorities, in the
                        stead of despotic will or martial law, so hostile to, subversive of, and so
                        justly obnoxious to civil liberty. When I last addressed a grand jury of
                        Augusta from this place, our country was struggling in the throes and
                        convulsions of a gigantic civil war, the like of which, in magnitude and
                        violence, this country has not witnessed, if any of its predecessors has,
                        and worst of all wars, a civil, a fratricidal war; and which since then has
                        culminated in the defeat and overthrow of our arms. Divine oracles inform us
                        that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but
                        in this case victory has perched on the banners of the strong; whether
                        because might and right were on the same side, or because a victory
                        vouchsafed to us would have been our eventual ruin, and was therefore denied
                        us by the all wise Disposer of human events, are questions dependant for
                        their solution upon matters of speculation and conjecture, which it is not
                        my province on such an occasion as this, to attempt to solve, and which I
                        will leave to every one to solve, or attempt to solve, to his own
                        satisfaction. This is neither the time, the place, nor the occasion for
                        indulging in painful and gloomy retrospects and mooting the question of the
                        causelessness or justification of the late disastrous civil war,
                        insurrection, or rebellion, or whatever else it may be called, or of the
                        guilt or innocence of the agents North or South who inaugurated it, and
                        whether or not, but for the insane agency of these architects of ruin, both
                        North and South, fanatics, extremists, abstractionists, the war may have
                        been averted. These are questions, coram non
                        judice, before a State tribunal. They belong to the Federal
                        authorities, executives, legislative and judicial, to deal with in justice,
                        mercy and charity, as to them shall seem meet and proper, and to the
                        enlightened opinion of mankind, both North and South, and of the civilized
                        world. Since the past, the gloomy, disastrous past, can not be recalled, let
                        it be forgotten, or remembered only to serve as a buoy, or beacon light, to
                        warn us against the brakers and quicksands of the future, and not at all for
                        the purpose of crimination and recrimination between brethren, the one class
                        accusing the other of being the authors of our calamities. Let us ignore the
                        past, except for the lessons it do impressively reads us, for our present
                        and future guidance, of the ineffable horrors of civil war, and of the
                        necessity of mutual forbearance, the cultivation of fraternal feelings,
                        abstinence from sectional prejudices, fanaticism, extreme opinions and
                        political abstractions, to avert its recurrence.</p>
                    <p>Speaking for the present, I feel warranted, from my acquaintance with the
                        people of Virginia and her constituted authorities, one and all, and their
                        sentiments on the subject, in expressing the opinion, that they are without
                        an exception, so far as I have any reason to suspect or believe, now loyal
                        citizens of the United States, having in the most perfect good faith
                        returned to their allegiance and resumed their former status, as true and
                        loyal citizens of the United States and the restored government of Virginia;
                        many, if not a majority, from preference, a life long and hereditary
                        attachment to the Union, transmitted to us by our revolutionary ancestors,
                        with Washington at their head, but all as the
                        result and consequence of inevitable necessity, making it a virtue to
                        acquiesce and submit after the issue has been decided against us by wager of battle, the arbitrament of arms, the judicium
                            dei, the ultima ratio regant, from which there is no appeal to
                        any earthly tribunal, to re-hear, re-judge and reverse the decision, save
                        only the appeal to the tribunal of impartial history, whose jurisdiction and
                        province it will be to vindicate or condemn the justice of our cause, the
                        purity of our motives and our right and title to success, though we failed
                        to achieve it, or the reverse.</p>
                    <p>Never since the adoption of the Federal Constitution of 1789 was the Union
                        established on a firmer and sounder basis in Virginia than at this moment,
                        not only because of the preference of some and the acquiescence of all in
                        the present inevitable necessity before referred to, but because of the
                        universal conviction, from the test it has undergone, that it is
                        indissoluble--indestructible. Whether this discovery of the irrefragable
                        strength and consistency of the Union will prove a blessing or a curse will
                        depend upon circumstances--upon future developments. Having overcome and
                        averted forever one of the dangers of our system, arising from the undue
                        preponderance of the centrifugal tendency, anarchy in the members, or
                        disintegration by the States shooting madly from their spheres, unless we
                        guard with cautious circumspection and sleepless vigilance against the other
                        equally fatal to, and destructive of, our unique and beautiful imperium in imperio, tyranny in the head, or
                        consolidation, which is but another name for central despotism, we shall
                        only have escaped Scylla to be wrecked by Charybdis. With the Union and the
                        Constitution restored in their pristine purity, and the danger of
                        Consolidation escaped, I believe the universal prayer, North and South, will
                        be esto perpetua.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, although the ravages of four years war have entailed upon us, in
                        the sudden and compulsory emancipation of our slaves, the sacking,
                        spoliation and desolation of our homes and firesides, the waste and
                        devastation of our fields and forests, the destruction and deportation of
                        our goods, and the utter [unclear] of our [unclear] our fiscal agencies,
                        private and public, the most universal and widespread ruin that has ever
                        befallen any people, a ruin almost unprecedented in history, yet it would be
                        unmanly to despair of the Republic. Let us rather take consolation that,
                        whether right or wrong in inaugurating the bloody contest, we have so borne
                        ourselves as to save our honor and challenge the admiration of the world,
                        not excepting our late conquerors but now fellow citizens and brethren, and
                        let us firmly resolve strenuously to endeavor to repair the errors and
                        calamitous consequences of the past by grappling with and wisely improving
                        the present, and with Lion heart and Eagle eye looking the future in the
                        face, undismayed by the storms that howl along the sky. Divested of Slavery
                        and the slave code, and of paramount State Sovereignty, and the right of
                        secession, deduced from and based upon it (whether properly or improperly,
                        well or ill done, for the better or for the worse, it is useless to enquire,
                        as it is a res adjudicata.) all which have been
                        erased and stricken from our constitutions and codes, first by the sword and
                        soon will be by the pen; we have the same charters and monuments of freedom,
                        State and Federal, we ever had, which, properly interpreted and honestly and
                        faithfully administered, guarantee us life, liberty, property and the
                        pursuit of happiness, the same Federal Constitution, the same State
                        Constitution of 1850; and the code of 1860, with a few slight and immaterial amendments, save that of the abolition
                        of slavery, made by the Constitution and laws of the restored government of
                        Virginia, called the Wheeling and Alexandria Constitution and Government.</p>
                    <p>With the exception, therefore, of the change made in the civil status of the
                        slave, who, henceforth, is entitled to occupy the position of the free negro
                        and mulatto, and must, henceforth, be treated, both civilly and criminally
                        as such, your jurisdiction of enquiry and presentment remains the same as
                        before the war. By reference to the code under the head of slaves, free
                        negroes and mulattoes you will see that divers offences, as well by bond as
                        free, based upon that relation, such as the unlawful assembly of slaves,
                        trading with them by the whites, the extending to them of undue privileges
                        or liberties by the master, owner or overseer, stealing of them, the mode of
                        trial awarded to them for felonies, various offences committed by them to
                        which different trials &amp;c., punishments are assigned, to those
                        awarded to the white man and free negro for the same offence, are virtually
                        repealed or rendered inoperative, by their emancipation, indeed some of them
                        are expressly repealed by the Legislature of the restored government at
                        Wheeling and Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>When we consider that sudden, compulsory and uncompensated emancipation,
                        however inconvenient and unjust to us, was not brought along by the slaves
                        themselves, but was thrust upon them, as passive recipients of the boon,
                        without their asking, by the interposition of others--an interposition, if
                        not invited, justified or excused by our own conduct in inaugurating the
                        war, was at least palliated, and when we remember their loyalty, fidelity,
                        and exemplary obedience during a bloody struggle of four years in our and
                        their midst, in their behoof, it seems to me we owe them a debt of gratitude
                        to be repaid to them in kindness, generosity and humanity to the utmost
                        extent of our ability and its compatibility with our peace and safety. For
                        myself I feel no resentment against them on account of their emancipation,
                        (and I believe I but echo the general, if nor universal, sentiment of
                        Virginia,) a boon, whether imaginary or real, which then tendered it is not
                        in human nature to reject, but to rather reconcile myself, now that the
                        irrevocable deed is done, to the situation, by the consentory hypothesis,
                        that it was the work of an all-wise, inscrutable and mysterious providence;
                        of that God who can make the wrath of man to praise him and restrains the
                        remainder of wrath; and to whom it may have seemed good to make the rashness
                        and morbid sensitiveness of the peculiar and super-serviceable friends of
                        slavery, the means and the instrumentalities of its destruction; seeing that
                        we went to war for the merest abstraction, the right to carry slavery into
                        the territories, we had not and never might acquire, and we have lost
                        slavery in the States, where but for the war it might have remained
                        indefinitely or until gradually abolished. May we not hope that its
                        abolition, in the manner in which it has been effected, was designed by
                        providence and will prove a future blessing in the disguise of a present
                        evil, the timely removal or eradication of a political and social evil
                        before, by the multitude of slaves, it should become irremovable or
                        ineradicable, without the destruction of one or other, or of both races. But
                        be the design of providence in its permission or accomplishment what it may,
                        whether of mercy to the slave and chastisement to the master, or of eventual
                        or unexpected mercy to both; whatever the motive of the human agents
                        employed to accomplish it, of one thing there is no doubt, the deed is done
                        and it is irrevocable. Therefore interest, duty and necessity all concur in
                        counselling on our part calm submission and cheerful acquiescence in the
                        fiat that has made our former slaves freemen. We must discharge our duties
                        to them not only in a spirit of justice and humanity, but of liberality and
                        generosity, and leave to the future the solution of the problem, (involved
                        in so much perplexity,) of their future destiny and of our own, so far as it
                        may be dependant on or effected by theirs.</p>
                    <p>Your jurisdiction of enquiry and presentment is co-extensive with the penal
                        code, subject however to the change or modification in it under the title of
                        slaves, free negroes and mulattoes, made in it as before mentioned, by the
                        emancipation of the slaves, embracing all offences, from the highest to the
                        lowest, from the most atrocious to the most venial, except such petty
                        trespasses, (as to which inconsiderable specific fines or penalties are
                        attached,) as are exclusively cognizable before a justice of the peace.</p>
                    <p>Without your accusation proffered in the form of a presentment or indictment,
                        no one can be arraigned, tried and punished for a high crime or misdemeanor.
                        It depends upon you therefore, in part, whether the penal laws shall be
                        faithfully and energetically executed, or remain a dead letter upon the
                        statute book, for want of an impartial accuser; the laws themselves, so far
                        as trial and punishment is concerned, having no self executing power. There
                        is no greater evil in any government than the inexecution of its laws, and
                        the more especially of its penal laws, and that evil is greatest in a
                        popular government such as ours. To prevent or remedy such an evil was a
                        grand jury devised by our ancestors and engrafted in our system as a vital
                        part, in the machinery adopted for the administration of penal justice. You
                        are styled by the law the grand inquest of the body of your country, taken
                        indiscriminately from all parts of it, presumed to know what is passing in
                        your county, and from the qualifications of estate, residence and
                        citizenship required, and the disqualifications of office, calling or
                        pursuit [unclear] to be lovers of peace and social order, having both the
                        will and ability to perform your duties in the spirit of your oath, and not
                        swerved from it by any sympathy with or fellowship in violations of the law.
                        Acting under mandates of the law and the solemn obligations of a religious
                        oath, in the execution of your office you are exempt from the odium that
                        attaches to the common informer, or the ascription of sinister motives,
                        often made against the voluntary prosecutor or a stated officer of the law
                        as ex-officio accuser.</p>
                    <p>For high crimes and misdemeanors of a deep dye or great atrocity it is rarely
                        necessary for a grand jury to initiate the prosecution; in such cases there
                        is generally an injured party or his friends to complain and originate
                        proceedings in advance of your assembling, or the voice of public
                        indignation calls forth a prosecutor and you are only called on to find or
                        ignore and indictment. But it is in the minor offences--certain misdemeanors
                        declared by statute, forbidden because of their tendency to disturb the
                        public peace, order and economy, and to debauch public morals, as to which
                        there is no injured party to complain or prosecute, and which, without you
                        interposition, would remain unpresented and unpublished, that your incipient
                        action is not only indispensably necessary, but may prove benign and
                        merciful in its effects and consequences not only to the public, but upon
                        offenders themselves, by visiting the minor offences with timely
                        chastisement, to prevent juvenile or venial offenders from becoming
                        criminals of a deep dye. How much more humane and merciful thus to deal with
                        such offences than to wait until the petty offender proceeds, step by step,
                        from vice to misdemeanor, and from misdemeanor to high crimes and then
                        consign him to the gibbet or the penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless prompted by such considerations as these, the Legislature has made
                        it the duty of the courts to bring to your notice and give you specially in
                        charge certain laws or acts of the General Assembly declaring certain
                        misdemeanors, which, from their civil tendencies, effects and consequences
                        upon the public peace and economy, social order, public morals and the
                        general welfare, are forbidden and which, from their importance, it was
                        deemed advisable to make the subject of a special charge. They are the
                        anti-dueling law, the law against incestuous marriages, the law against
                        malicious trespasses, the laws concerning the surveyors of the highways, the
                        laws for the regulation of ordinaries and the suppression of tippling
                        houses, the laws against unlawful gaming, the law against betting on
                        elections and voting in elections by a voter knowing he has no right to
                        vote, or, having the right, voting twice or oftener in the same election,
                        the provisions of the revenue laws requiring the pronouncement of a license
                        as a prerequisite, or condition precedent, to the exercise or carrying on of
                        certain trades, occupations or businesses or the practice of certain
                        professions, and making it penal and indictable to do so without such
                        license, and in the case of the sale of liquors, to sell them without the
                        certificate of the County Court as to the character of the person and
                        fitness of the place for such sale in addition to the license, and the laws
                        concerning slaves, free negroes and mulattoes modified and so far as they
                        have not been repealed or rendered inoperative by emancipation.</p>
                    <p>Your first duty upon your retirement will be to pass upon such indictments as
                        may be sent up to you, and return into Court and report your action
                        thereupon, after which you will again withdraw and enter upon your remaining
                        duties of enquiry and presentment, which, as I have before said, are
                        co-extensive with the penal code, and you will especially enquire into
                        violations of the laws specially brought to your attention. You must not
                        consider your whole duty discharged; or confined to, or limited by remaining
                        passively in your jury room, hearing and acting upon the complaints of the
                        common informer, the voluntary prosecutor, or witnesses sent before you by
                        the court, or the Attorney for the Commonwealth. If an offence or violation
                        of the law be known to two of your body, you must present upon the oaths
                        already taken as grand jurors, if to but one, he must be sent down and sworn
                        as a witness; if to none of your body, but there be probable cause to
                        suspect the commission of an offence in your county, then you must cast
                        about and diligently enquire among yourselves for a witness who can inform
                        you and have him summoned. It requires at least 16 to constitute a grand
                        jury and 12 to concur in making a presentment, or finding or ignoring an
                        indictment. You must write at the foot of your presentments upon what
                        authority made, whether upon the information of two of your body, or of one
                        sent down and sworn as a witness, upon the evidence of a voluntary
                        prosecutor, or a witness sent before you by the Court, or the Attorney for
                        the Commonwealth. Retire gentlemen, taking with you to your jury room the
                        code of 1860, sessions acts since, and discharge your important duties in
                        the spirit of your oath.</p>
