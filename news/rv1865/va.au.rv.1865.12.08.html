<b>A Negro Discovered and Broken Up in Mississippi</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that citizens in Ripley, Mississippi, recently uncovered a
                    conspiracy among the freed people. Disguised as sympathetic Federal officers,
                    they discovered a conspiracy "extending from the Mississippi river to South
                    Carolina." The author claims that if the plans had not been broken up they would
                    "undoubtedly have resulted in the horrors of San Domingo and Jamaica in the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>CAIRO, November 23.-A well-known citizen of Mississippi, in whose statements
                        we place the utmost confidence, informs us that some time since the citizens
                        of Ripley, Mississippi, were led to believe from certain movements of the
                        negroes, in that vicinity, that something unusual was going on. Negroes were
                        discovered making mysterious [UNCLEAR] to La Grange, and returning
                        frequently.</p>
                    <p>The aroused suspicion, and the designs of the negroes. They accordingly held
                        a meeting and appointed two of the number detectives. The citizens to whom
                        the duty of discovering the plans of the negroes had been intrusted,
                        performed their duty well, and obtained the information they desired. They
                        dressed themselves in Federal uniforms, ingratiated themselves into the
                        confidence of the negroes who appeared to be the leaders in the mysterious
                        movement, ascertained that a conspiracy had been organized among the blacks,
                        extending from the Mississippi river to South Carolina, and that an
                        insurrection was contemplated about Christmas.</p>
                    <p>The plans of the negroes were being rapidly consummated, and had they not
                        been discovered, would undoubtedly have resulted in the horror of San
                        Domingo and Jamaica in the Southern States. Four of the ringleaders have
                        been arrested, two of whom have made confession, and divulged information
                        which led to the capture of the arms and ammunition of the conspirators.
                        Great excitement prevailed for a time. A feeling of security has been
                        created by the fact that prompt measures have been taken to nip in the bud
                        any future attempts of the insurrectionists.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In times gone by it was the custom of Virginia's most gifted sons to seek
                        preferment in the political arena in which they shone with no unworthy or
                        borrowed lustre. Indeed, so illustrious were they that Virginia was honored
                        generally, with the title of "The mother of States and Statesmen."</p>
                    <p>A bloody struggle for four years has ended in the overthrow of the cause, for
                        the success of which, Virginia had cast her lot with her Southern sisters
                        for weal or woe.--On this account the "Mother of States" is not likely, for
                        a greater or less time, to be accorded the privilege of sitting in council
                        with her off-spring, and dictating from the mouths of honored
                        representatives the proper course to pursue, or drawing from the industry
                        pages of the past, the wholesome words and patriotic advice of her departed
                        sages to guide them in the future conduct of the noble nation, in founding
                        which some of her best blood was spilled, and which, conducted on the
                        principles emanating from our greatest Statesmen, sons of her soil, and
                        thoroughly imbued with her conservative teachings had taken a foremost
                        position among the nations of the earth. This being the case, would it not
                        be well for those, whose ancestry have gained so much of fame for the noble
                        Old Commonwealth in the past, to endeavor to preserve the position to which
                        Virginia has attained, by making her existence felt, if her voice should not
                        be desired in the councils of the nation. There is much to be done.
                        Necessity has never demanded of her a full exposition of her dormant
                        talents.--'Tis true in the councils of the nation she exhibited some of the
                        strength of her mind and in the minor struggles of the nation showed that
                        she had sons capable of wielding the sword, with an ability not dimmed in
                        comparison with those who wielded that powerful weapon, the pen.
                        Circumstances called them forth. So in the late struggle through which we
                        have passed, far exceeding the significance any contest in the Western
                        Hemisphere, and perhaps in the world, she was not found lacking in that
                        material which makes the hero and the chieftain. Not pretending to cast a
                        shadow over the bright fame, and exceeding talents of many who have spring
                        from the loins of other States, but simply to illustrate our point, we
                        believe we are right in asserting that Virginia has produced the brightest
                        military geniuses of the 19th century. Lee, Jackson, Johnston, and countless
                        others, might not have taken the place of a Jefferson, Henry, Madison,
                        Monroe, Randolph and many others, who have made great the name of Virginia
                        in Legislative halls.--Circumstances did not call them to the forum but to
                        the field, and fame has wreathed equally as bright chaplets for them, and
                        Virginia has been proven equally great in council or in war. Possibly to be
                        denied the exercise of her talents in the former, and there being no
                        necessity for display of her genius for the latter, it illy becomes her to
                        remain idle when her future greatness and prosperity demands at her hands
                        the display of a different sort of genius. During the existence of war, when
                        blockaded on all sides. Virginia was not excelled by any of her sister
                        States in her talent for production, nay she exhibited a wonderful degree of
                        talent in this line. The Virginia of to-day is not the Virginia of the past.
                        Imperative necessity compels her to develop her resources. She must do this
                        if she desires to occupy, or even approximate to, her former position among
                        the States.--No outside talent is necessary, if Virginians will but essay
                        it. Besides, the, so to say, untravelled fields of Literature, Science and
                        Art beckon the way to those whose talents lie in that direction. There is a
                        necessity now for the display of a vast diversity of talent. The future of
                        our beloved old Dominion will be great, if her sons put forth proper
                        efforts. Will they show themselves less able to secure a brilliant future
                        for our dear old mother, than they have been to achieve success in
                        Legislation and on the field of conflict? We trust and believe not. Up
                        Virginians duty beckons onward.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our contemporary of the Charlottesville chronicle, in noticing the
                        improvements going on in Random Row and Cow Street, concludes that
                        Charlottesville has become a city and enumerates the many things which she
                        possesses, to show that his conclusion is not without a sound premise. We
                        could forgive all this, for people do not generally like to decry the place
                        of their nativity, on the contrary, endeavor to create the impression that
                        it is as large in reality as pictured in their imagination. This would be
                        our conclusion but for the fact that, in all his endeavors to create the
                        impression that Charlottesville is a great place, he exhibits his envy of
                        our thriving city. He gets angry if Staunton brain originates a National
                        Express Company and Staunton brain is called upon to manage it, because
                        Charlottesville hasn't brain enough to do such things. And when black eyed
                        peas give out, and some one, in order to get a little pocket change, sends
                        in a quart of milk in a creaking old one horse wagon, with rope gears, on a
                        rickety old wagon, with rope gears, or a rickety old omnibus, dubbed the
                        "Fairy," for the same reason, plies "steady" as two poor, forlorn looking
                        shadows, of what were horses once upon a time are compelled to draw it
                        between the Hamlet and University, without a single passenger for a day at a
                        time, he cries out "poor Staunton." "We feel particularly sorry for Staunton
                        &amp;c., &amp;c." We know that envy is at the bottom of it all.--He
                        sees and appreciates the progress Staunton is making and his desire to live
                        in a place equal to Staunton, has made him imagine Charlottesville is
                        actually a city. We are forced to agree with our devil and he has "Staunton
                        on the brain." And if he does not improve shortly, we would advise his
                        friends to send him over here, for Staunton [UNCLEAR] institution where they
                        cure all such.</p>

                    <p>It would really seem that the very Pandora's box of crime had been opened in
                        the land. It needs but a glance at the headings of the New York Papers to
                        tell of the frightful carnival of crime there. In the Puritan city of Boston
                        crime is so rampant that the Courier  of that
                        city calls for a vigilance committee as the only remedy. Unless the New
                        Orleans, St. Louis, Nashville, Memphis, and other Western journals, greatly
                        exaggerate, crime of every description there is fearfully on the increase.
                        In New Orleans, the murders are said to average about one per day, and the
                        other cities mentioned present a record not much, if anything, better.
                        Despairing of protection from the ordinary processes of law, the citizens
                        are threatening to be themselves the ministers of justice. In Nashville, no
                        man dares to go into the street after dark unless he be armed. Garrotters
                        and robbers hang about the corners, and for every one that is arrested, a
                        dozen escape. In Memphis things are quite as bad. Much of this fearful
                        depravity is due the laxity with which justice is administered throughout
                        the country. Thoughtful people are beginning to enquire where all this is to
                            end.-Washington Star.</p>
