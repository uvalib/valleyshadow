<b>The South for Union and Fraternity</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints from the New York News an editorial that argues that the
                    South's "calm resignation" in the face of defeat proves that they wish to return
                    to and support the Union in good faith. It urges northerners not to take a
                    vindictive course in reconstructing the Union, and asks that southerners be
                    admitted speedily to full citizenship.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is something in the calm resignation of the Southern people that
                        appeals irresistibly to the sympathy and forbearance of their conquerers. We
                        know not whether most to admire their heroism in war or that moral courage
                        that enables them to accept with dignity and composure the consequences of
                        defeat. The dager is lest the vanquished should behave more nobly and more
                        creditably in their helplessness than the victors in their might. There are
                        heard no murmurs, no repinings, no petulant outbursts of rage and
                        disappointment from the South; but, too often, the language and sentiment of
                        hostility and sectional antipathy prevails over the better feelings and the
                        judgement of the triumphant North.</p>
                    <p>There is some excuse for the expression of rankling spite and enmity in a
                        subdued and impoverished people, with the pain and mortification of recent
                        discomfiture swelling their hearts with morbid sensibility; but there is no
                        excuse for the parade of power and the exhibition of malice and resentment
                        in those who stand in the midst of trophies, the acknowledged masters of the
                        field.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of the Southern people attests the sincerity of their abnegation
                        of armed opposition to the Federal Government. With the same unanimity and
                        identity of action and purpose with which they sprang to arms in defense of
                        their political belief, they have now laid down those arms, and with a frank
                        acknowledgement of failure, have expressed their desire to resume the
                        privileges and obligations of American citizenship under the Federal Union.
                        They were bold and open foes so long as they relied upon the agencies of
                        war: their own interests, no less than motives of self respect and honor,
                        are guaranties that they will act in good faith as co-workers in the mission
                        of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>The views and inclinations expressed by the several delegations from Southern
                        States that have conferred with the President, evince a spirit that, if not
                        repelled by harshness, will insure a quiet and natural relapse to the normal
                        condition of subordination to civil authority, in the true intent of
                        republicanism. The most violent and obstinate partisans of secession have
                        become unqualified submissionists to the central rule, and are to-day
                        willing, even zealous, laborers in the cause of tranquility, order and
                        rehabilitation.</p>
                    <p>No Confederate leader has been more active and efficient than General Forrest
                        in striking for the Southern cause. His name is associated with the boldest,
                        the most desperate and destructive phases of that partisan warfare which
                        constituted one of the most terrible resources of the South. But the fierce
                        mosstrooper, the reckless raider, who spread terror before him and left
                        desolation behind, has been transformed, at the first signal of peace, into
                        the quiet and law-abiding citizen, giving bonds for his good behavior, and
                        lending his valuable services to the Federal authorities for the suppression
                        of all the lawless bands in West Tennessee and North Mississippi. Is it not
                        wiser to accept the useful friendship of such men than to compel them to
                        retain a brooding antagonism? General Forrest is but a type of the foremost
                        Confederate chiefs. Bitter and furious on the war-path, they put aside their
                        enmity when they surrendered their swords. There is no inconsistency in
                        their conduct.</p>
                    <p>As soldiers, they were energetic, stern and dangerous to those opposed to
                        them in arms; as citizens, they will be the most peaceable and obedient
                        disciples of law and order. General Forrest says that he means the oath of
                        allegiance he has taken in good faith; that he is henceforward a citizen of
                        the United States and a friend of the Union; that he will aid the Government
                        as far as he can in restoring order; and that the authorities may thereafter
                        try him and hang him if they see fit.</p>
                    <p>How is it possible for a brave and generous people to harbor resentments, or
                        to seek for vengeance against such men? They are disarmed, they are
                        submissive, they are powerless for evil, they are available for good; they
                        ask for our friendship, they invite good will and mutual confidence--surely
                        we neither fear them so much that we cannot trust them, nor hate them so
                        much that we will not accept their offer of fraternity. Shall we put
                        manacles upon the hands that are extended to us in invitation of a friendly
                        grasp? Shall we give the cold shoulder to those who offer conciliation and
                        who, in some capacity, are to be members of our political household? The
                        Southern people must either be trusted as partners in and co-inheritors of
                        our republicanism, or our republicanism must be relinquished. Which shall it
                        be? There is no way, under our legitimate system of government by which they
                        can be deprived of the full rights of citizenship, while the people of the
                        North enjoy republicanism. We must change our form of government or concede
                        that the South and its population are upon a level with ourselves in all
                        political prerogatives. The popular sentiment of the North is fast tending
                        toward an appreciation of this truth and it will soon be impossible to
                        enforce a vindictive policy or to prolong the exercise of arbitrary power
                        without outraging the public feeling. But far better would it be for those
                        that now have influence in the councils of the Republic to anticipate the
                        wishes of the people, and to accord full amnesty and political equality to
                        all classes of the South, as a matter of justice and expediency, and not
                        upon compulsion.--New York News.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>While the war has overturned the political doctrines of Slavery, States
                        rights and Secession entertained at the South, it will have no less effect
                        upon the politics of the North.</p>
                    <p>The intense radicalism, prevalent there for several years back, even now
                        feels the effect of it. Those who have been the leaders of that party,
                        forced by unyielding circumstances, are advocating conservatism. This is a
                        source of gratifying consolation to the Southern people, since they have
                        failed to establish a distinct nationality, and consequently must remain in
                        the Union.</p>
                    <p>Politicians and Prominent Northern Generals, in the main, with the mass of
                        the army favor a conservative policy. Perhaps no more striking instance can
                        be given to illustrate this fact than that of Gen. Frank Blair, of Missouri,
                        who has been an extreme radical for years. In a late speech at St. Louis he
                        opposes governing the Southern States by military Governors and the
                        unnecessary continuance of martial law. On the subject of controlling the
                        right of suffrage in the Southern States, he holds that each State has the
                        right to decide this question for itself. Rhode Island excludes many of
                        Irish and German birth, no matter how much property or influence they may
                        have, and "no one, says he, questions or has the right to question Rhode
                        Island's right in this respect."</p>
                    <p>He says, "Andrew Johnson has put his foot on that proposition and he was
                        compelled to put his foot upon it, if he was an honest man." This sentiment
                        of the Speaker was vociferously cheered.</p>
                    <p>Upon the subject of confiscation and trials for treason he thus expatiates:</p>
                    <p>"I say there can be no justification for any execution which is not demanded
                        by the safety of the State; because these men have already been afflicted by
                        this war to such a degree that retaliation--why, if you talk of retaliation,
                        follow in the wake of the army which marched from the Mississippi to the sea
                        and thence to Washington. Who could then speak of retaliation after
                        witnessing that scene of devastation necessary, it seemed to us, it seemed
                        to those who inflicted this severe calamity upon those people; necessary
                        even for their own safety that we should thus inflict or desolate them; but
                        the desolation rests and broods upon them still. Their homes exist no
                        longer, and the people are driven out, and therefore, to me, accustomed to
                        look at things as I do, I can see no necessity of making treason other than
                        it is already--odious.--(Cheers) No punishment that we could possibly
                        inflict could equal the punishment already inflicted upon them, and
                        justifiable by the great objects which we had in view of the re-uniting of
                        our Government, and justifiable by no other reason and no other right; nor
                        can its prosecution in any other shape or form be justified unless the
                        safety of the Government is imperiled. Any policy, my friends, which
                        proceeds from mere malice, comes from hell, and is at the instigation of the
                        devil." (Loud cheers)</p>
                    <p>Since our political sentiments, fondly cherished for years, have been
                        uprooted, it is, at least, gratifying, as foreshadowed by the remarks of
                        such a distinguished radical as Gen. Blair, to look forward to a spirit of
                        conservatism growing up in the North, kindred to that conservatism for which
                        the South has been pre-eminently noted. It is conservatism which gives tone
                        and character and dignity to a nation, and from the exhibitions daily given,
                        and from unlooked for sources, we confidently expect to see the happiest
                        results attend the growth of this exalted attribute of a nation--the great
                        ally of its progress.</p>

                    <p>For the "Vindicator."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor: It is important that you should
                        impress on the minds of the people, the necessity of qualifying themselves
                        to vote by taking the oath required by the Constitution, and recently
                        modified by the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>Many seem to suppose that they are entitled to vote by reason of having taken
                        the oath of amnesty. Such is not the fact. Every man is required to take an
                        additional oath to support the government of Virginia before they can vote.</p>
                    <p>Rev. James C. Wheat, who is the only notary public qualified to administer
                        oaths in the county, is the proper person, and probably the only person now
                        competent to administer the oath. Let every man then come forward promptly
                        and take the oath or, when the elections come on, he will find himself
                        disfranchised. It is important in the outset of the new government that we
                        elect our best men without reference to old party divisions.</p>
                    <p>The people should understand that it is necessary for the security of their
                        persons and property that they should all take the oath of amnesty. Our best
                        lawyers are of this opinion, and are all taking the oath. The prejudice
                        against taking it is founded in ignorance and folly. It is right that every
                        man who expects to live under the Federal and State Governments, should
                        swear to support them.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Court will meet here on 1st Oct., and those who neglect this warning
                        may find themselves involved in expensive litigation if not more serious
                        trouble. Any malicious person may instigate a proceeding for the
                        confiscation of his neighbors property, and it will be too late then to take
                        the oath. It is better to take it at once. Better err on the safe side. The
