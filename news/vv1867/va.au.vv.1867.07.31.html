<b>The Reconstruction Meeting Monday</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A meeting to discuss Reconstruction was held in Staunton. It was heavily
                    attended by African Americans. The mostly white speakers warned blacks not to
                    trust Radicals and Northerners or join any political party. The people of the
                    South should comply with Congressional demands, work hard, but remain
                    independent.<br>(Names in announcement:  David Fultz,  Henry Davenport,   Houf,  A. H. H. Stuart,  Philip Rosselle,  Chapman Johnson,   Garber,   Lynn, Gen.  Echols, Col. H. M. Bell,   Jackson,   Maupin)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In another column we publish the resolutions adopted by a portion of the
                        people of Augusta, at the Court House on Monday. While opposed to all
                        parties and all meetings looking to the organization of any party in the
                        State, we are glad to notice the good feeling that marked the proceedings on
                        Monday. In these times it will not do to question motives. We try to give
                        the facts.</p>
                    <p>There were about 200 colored men present and about 50 whites--not more than a
                        third of the whites participating in the proceedings. David Fultz, Esq.,
                        explained the objects of the meeting. He spoke for about an hour and gave
                        some good advice to the blacks. He warned them against the influences of
                        demagogues and disabused their minds of the idea that any one wished to
                        re-enslave them. He had been a slaveowner and he rejoiced that the
                        institution no longer existed, and believed every slaveholder agreed with
                        him. He complimented the blacks on their conduct during the war and said
                        that History told of no race who had acted so well under such circumstances.
                        He told them they must learn the important fact that they must live by labor
                        and that their own people were their best friends. He urged upon them the
                        necessity of voting for honest men; men they knew and could trust. He told
                        them that party had ruined the country and that the Government was now in
                        the hands of designing, corrupt partizans--that it was not the
                        representative of the people. The South was under Military Government,
                        &amp;c. He then explained to them the nature and power of the written
                        Constitution. He said that if you can't get your rights by petition; if you
                        try to get them from all the branches of the government and fail, then you
                        have the right of Revolution--but that right must not be confounded with the
                        right of secession, which was no where recognized. He urged upon all the
                        importance of aiding the work of reconstruction, under the Military Bills,
                        as there was no other chance left us, and said the duties of the Convention
                        to reconstruct the State, were so simple that it should not set over 24
                        hours. He earnestly asked all, in favor of peace, to vote for good men and
                        speedily reconstruct under the present orders. The continued rule of the
                        military would be political ruin. We must obey orders. It is our duty and
                        interest to do so, and escape, or we will at last become so demoralized,
                        under military rule, that we will seek safety in a Despot. He claimed
                        honesty of purpose in advocating compliance with orders and said ultimate
                        terms would make us shudder, therefore, it was best to accept the present;
                        for, admitting the Radical party to be corrupt, we could not please them
                        better than to defeat their present plans. Mr. Fultz was listened to
                        attentively, especially by the colored people.</p>
                    <p>During the absence of the Committee on resolutions, Henry Davenport was
                        called for and spoke. Said he did not know how to read and see what was
                        going on like white folks, but had to gather what ideas he had from his
                        intellect. He wanted to say to his fellow travellers, white and black, let
                        us meet together and make laws for the universal fellowship of man. He was
                        for peace and harmony and universal love. The colored people asked of the
                        white "come and give us light." He gave way for the Committee, hoping 'that
                        together we may live and die.'</p>
                    <p>Mr. Houf, white, objected to the appointment of only five delegates, and
                        wanted every citizen, black and white, from Augusta, who might be in
                        Richmond, and wanted to reconstruct, to be a delegate. Mr. Houf earnestly
                        urged his point and wandered around considerable over "the Union," before he
                        ended. He had learned to be a Union man from great men, like Stuart and
                        Baldwin, in that very house; we must accept the Military Bills, while they
                        were not such as he would have made, but there was no use depending on
                        anybody North, and we should obey orders. Here he told an amusing anecdote
                        about "cats" which brought down the house, but won't do to "narrate" here.
                        Mr. Houf said he believed the Confederates were as honest as he was, and
                        spoke feelingly about the "old Flag." Said he loved it, but he sympathized
                        with the men who followed Stonewall Jackson, and he believed that there were
                        never a greater set of patriots and heroes than those who followed Stonewall
                        Jackson, under that infernal thing first raised in Montgomery. Mr. Houf gave
                        the colored people good advice and told them to look to the men who will
                        protect their own interests; that he thought they had been thrown into the
                        political arena too soon. He warned them to listen not to politicians;
                        listen not to Maine men who said they freed them, for it was not so. Abraham
                        Lincoln would not have freed them, nor would the Democrat, but God Almighty
                        did it. Don't attribute your freedom to any one but God, &amp;c. Mr.
                        Houf was pretty hard on the yankee and told another very pointed anecdote illustrating yankee character. He closed by
                        advising the colored people to turn their hands to labor; their hearts to
                        industry and all help to build up the country. He had named a boy after Hon.
                        A. H. H. Stuart, the man who said that there was no hope for the country but
                        in the Union, and he was a Virginian and an Augustinian.</p>
                    <p>Philip Rosselle, colored, was now loudly called. He said he would bestow any
                        privilege on the people of the country and wished no man harm. Wishes to
                        bestow on all men, white and black, equal political privileges. Thought the
                        white people made a mistake about the blacks. The respectable colored people
                        were of the same feelings. The black people wanted to live and work for the
                        whites, for their dollars. He said his race had enemies both North and
                        South, and he had seen the worst enemies of the colored man hailing from the
                        North. He would say cling to the men who are your friends. He said his old
                        master, Chapman Johnson, never allowed his children to call black folks
                        "niggers," nor did any gentlemen. He denounced a Whig paper and said it was
                        filled with "nigger" from beginning to end. Didn't think this was a good way
                        to make colored people friends, and made some allusion to Mr. Garber's and
                        Lynn's papers which we did not catch. Some say some white folks despise the
                        colored people. The greatest fault he found was that they loved them too
                        well. If you didn't believe it go to the colored schools and look at the
                        complexion. Thought the white people were getting sense fast and that they
                        had about got even with the white people, on the high rent question, by
                        charging $3.50 a day during harvest. Closed by saying they were learning
                        sense very fast, and some of them, listening to Mr. Fultz and the other
                        lawyers, were getting to be pretty sharp at the law. He added that the next
                        Thursday they would have another speaking, better speakers than today; that
                        Gen. Echols and Colonel (H. M.) Bell would speak at the Colored Church.
                        Plenty to eat would be there, for those who had the money, and all such were
                        invited to eat--others to listen.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jackson, Agent F. Bureau, being called for, said there was no success to
                        be gained outside of party-organizations, and that there was no question up
                        but that of Loyalty to the Government or Disloyalty; that every man is bound
                        to vote for loyal men by his oath of Registration, and all could easily go
                        back a few years, trace a man up, and know who was loyal and who was not. He
                        didn't think it necessary to give them (the colored people) any advice about
                        industry, &amp;c., but he was satisfied it was not good policy on their
                        part to hold so many meetings. Every meeting meant the loss of a day's work
                        and that was an important item. (Right here a negro, behind us, remarked,
                        "Captain Jackson don't want us to hear Gen. Echols and Col. Bell.") Capt.
                        Jackson's speech was short, but it struck us that it did not please the
                        colored people. They seemed to think he talked to them like a man who owned
                        them and whom they were bound to obey, if we could judge by the remarks
                        around us. One or two said: "Its no man's business how many meetings the
                        Freedmen hold."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Maupin here made an amendment to Mr. Houf's motion, which was defeated.
                        Just here the Immortal Philosopher, J. N., the great "reconstructed,"
                        appeared upon the scene and requested us to make an announcement that he
                        would shortly "lift the veil." We pointed him to the Chair, and Mr. Fultz
                        moved an adjournment. Then, "J. N." majestically throwing back his flowing
                        locks from his princely brow, told the meeting "that Grant was right and so
                        was Lee, and both were wrong," and that he would surely "lift the veil" that
                        night. He was greeted with applause and, so, ended the chapter.</p>

                    <p>"It is plainly the duty of our young men to meet this pressing exigency. They
                        constitute the only remaining resource for the immediate supply of any considerable amount of labor. Let them strip
                        themselves for the conflict; let them "roll up their sleeves," and "gird up
                        their loins" for the noble work of resuscitating Virginia from her present
                        paralyzed and prostrate condition; let them labor with the same self-denial

                        accustomed occupations are all filled to repletion and there yet remains a
                        large number without employment. To continue in idleness--demoralizing and
                        enervating idleness--is a thing to be abhorred by every ingenious,
                        high-minded, honorable young man, and to eat the bread of dependence ought
                        to be more galling to his pride than the performance of comparatively menial
                        duties, if such were necessarily to be encountered, in pursuing the very
                        laudable object of obtaining for himself an honest livelihood and in
                        promoting with patriotic ardor and disinterestedness the honor and
                        prosperity of the State. But no such humiliation awaits our young men. They
                        will rather add dignity to their calling and bring to their aid an array of
                        educated intelligence which will greatly accelerate the march of
                        improvement. They will soon acquire a degree of practical skill, which,
                        aided by their superior knowledge, will guide them in the introduction and
                        management of such mechanical helps as their own enlightened experience may
                        suggest or the inventive genius of the country may supply, and thus
                        contribute to lighten the burden of human toil, remit the mind from the
                        drudgery of debasing labor, and elevate it into the more ennobling spheres
                        of activity, where accretion of strength is gained by the exercise of its
                        powers, and where it successfully conserves the progress of society in
                        civilization, wealth and social happiness. We reserve for a future number
                        what we have to say on the subject of immigration and the sub-division of
                        our lands.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Federal officer recently assigned from the lower Valley to a post in the
                        interior of the State remarked to us the other day that he had been
                        gratified and surprised at the kind manner in which he had been received,
                        and referred to the contrast it offered to the feeling manifested towards
                        him at his former post.</p>
                    <p>The thing is easily explained. On the frontier the people were divided in
                        sentiment; there were Unionists and Secessionists, who were exceedingly
                        bitter against each other during the war. These feuds have been kept up
                        since the war. Such a division of sentiment exists in Alexandria,
                        Winchester, Harper's Ferry, Martinsburg, and to some extent in Norfolk.</p>
                    <p>There was no division of sentiment in the interior; all were Confederates;
                        and when the war ended, they surrendered. The Federal officers have
                        uniformly, so far as we have been thrown in contact with them, acted in a
                        just, humane, and considerate spirit. We bear them no animosity. As a
                        general thing they have not been called on to a great extent in a social
                        way, because our people felt that this would look like an attempt to
                        ingratiate themselves. They felt the natural reserve of a beaten party to
                        seek the company of the victor. We know that this has been misconstrued, and
                        in some cases Federal officers have taken it as an affront. It was no
                        affront, and intended as none. For we feel under obligations to these
                        officers for their kind and just administration, and they have evoked the
                        most kindly feelings on the part of our people towards them as a class. But
                        where citizens have kept aloof, it was because they did not feel that they
                        could associate with military officers put over them on terms of equity.
                        Good taste certainly required this course just after the termination of
                        hostilities.</p>
                    <p>While on this subject, another observation occurs to us; irresponsible
                        persons are much more violent than those who have to act in any matter of
                        difference between themselves and others. We see this in the Northern
                        Democratic press; it is as bitter as gall; it is loaded with denunciation of
                        Congress and the Republicans; it urges the non-acceptance by the South of
                        the Reconstruction bills. But the South, which has to act, which has to feel the
                        consequences of intemperate language, which has to weigh the whole business
                        calmly as practical question affecting its very existence, is quiet and
                        silent. The same fact is illustrated within our State limits. Suddenly the
                        Valley has become our South Carolina. The press of the Valley is much more
                        "unreconstructed" than that of the East. The Staunton papers (excepting the
                            Virginian) call on the people to vote against
                        a Convention.--Why is this?</p>
                    <p>At the North, the Democracy can afford to talk and to denounce, and set up a
                        race of martyrs. The radical storm can only burst on their heads in the
                        shape of an election. No military will rule in their households; no negroes
                        will upturn their social structure. In the Valley there are few negroes, and
                        this explains why they are not as much disturbed as the people south of
                        James River. This is why Mr. Baldwin is not as flexible as Mr. Flournoy. Mr.
                        Flournoy has to deal practically with a great social cloud; Mr. Baldwin only
                        looks at it like an astronomer through a glass. It is the difference between
                        playing the martyr and writing on martyrdom.</p>
                    <p>It is the same thing in Maryland and Kentucky. They are the only Confederates
                            left--now. If Congress takes them in hand,
                        and ruins them, they will become as mellow as the Charleston Mercury.</p>
                    <p>This is the reason why our ladies and the clergy have been so violent. They
                        do not act (the clergy are comparatively
                        withdrawn from secular affairs.) The ladies merely give vent to generous
                        sentiments--often with no sense in them. They did much by their thoughtless
                        ardor to bring on the war. They did much to prevent an adjustment during the
                        war. So with the clergy. These classes dealt with the abstract, and not with
                        real controlling difficulties. The ladies took it for granted the thing
                        would end like a novel--in some pleasant, heroic way. Dr. Dabney is writing
                        on secession now.</p>
                    <p>There is no calculating the mischief the Northern Democracy are doing us now.
                        The Republican there naturally concludes that the Philadelphia Age or the New York Day
                        Book, of the National Intelligencer talks
                        as the Southern press talks. The inference is that we are rife for another
                        fight, and still struggling and kicking. It is a great mistake.--Charlottesville Chronicle.</p>
