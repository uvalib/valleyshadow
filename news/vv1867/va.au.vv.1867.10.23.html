<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that the election "passed off quietly" with "the negroes
                    generally voting the Radical ticket in a body. Surely they will 'have their
                    reward.'"<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Great Chesapeake and Ohio Road Enterprise</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial argues that in an age of progress people must take action to
                    ensure prosperity. Building the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad linking Virginia to
                    the West will ensure that the state's mineral and agricultural resources can be
                    profited upon, and that Virginia will grow to rival New York and Maryland in
                    greatness. The article assures farmers that the coming of the railroad will
                    raise the prices of agricultural products, not drown them out in competition
                    with the West.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Timely Hint</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper warns southerners to be "temperate and prudent" in reacting to
                    Democratic victories in the North. Any celebration or threat to resist the
                    Republicans will only bring down harsher measures from the alarmed Radicals.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Proposition to Congress</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The landowners and former slaveholders of the South take issue with the
                    Radicals claim to be "the only friend of the negro." They propose that if they
                    are compensated for their lost slaves, they will put the money toward the
                    education and colonization of blacks.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Sambo Utterly Repudiated</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that, in Ohio, legislators who "voted for the negro
                    constitutional amendment and were candidates for re-election were remorselessly
                    slaughtered by their constituents."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Sherman and Johnston Treaty</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article asserts that if peace had been made on the terms Sherman gave
                    to Johnston "the country would have been placed on the road to prosperity, negro
                    suffrage and negro equality would have been kept in the background, and all the
                    troubles we have since had upon the question of reconstruction would have been
                    avoided."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that many Pennsylvanians are coming to settle in the
                    Valley. "Come along and keep coming, gentlemen from over the border. Our
                    grand-fathers came from there, and we ain't afraid of you, nor 'any other man.'"<br>

</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that "a negro followed and assaulted Mr. J. Wayne
                    Spitler" in Staunton. "He was put in jail in default of bail to keep the peace
                    for 12 months."<br>(Names in announcement:  J. Wayne Spitler)</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Several cut glass goblets were stolen from Alexander H. H. Stuart's house,
                    and a "fine overcoat" from J. Addison Waddell's. "Thievery is becoming entirely
                    too frequent in and about town. Be on your guard."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Lyceum</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Lyceum met on Monday night. Col. Baldwin delivered his inaugural
                    address as President, and Y. H. Peyton gave the Anniversary Address on "The
                    great moral duties which should underlie the fabric of every political system,
                    which constitutes the corner-stone of a nation's greatness." Bolivar Christian
                    excused himself from the debate on whether or not the Roman Catholic Church,
                    "regarded solely as to its secular influence, has tended, on the whole, to the
                    advancement of mankind socially and politically." Mr. S. H. Coleman will take
                    his place in arguing for the affirmative. Y. H. Peyton will argue in the
                    negative.<br>(Names in announcement: Col.  Baldwin,  Y. H. Peyton,  Bolivar Christian,  S. H. Coleman)</blockquote>

                    passed away of consumption developed by exposure in the field.<br>(Names in announcement:  Stribling E. Trout)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Yesterday our people were called upon to follow another "Soldier Boy" to the
                        grave. Lieut. Stribling E. Trout, of the 52d Va. Infantry is no more. He
                        died of Consumption, aggravated by exposure in the field. No boy was more
                        popular, and the large attendance, of all classes, at his funeral yesterday,
                        bore fitting testimony to the general appreciation felt for his worth, as a
                        soldier and a man. Thus, one by one, they pass away, and the busy world,
                        with its pressing necessities, hardly gives us poor Confederates time to
                        shed a tear over the grave of a comrade. Truly has it been said that--<br>
                        "Doubly do we feel ourselves alone,<br> When thinking of companions
                    gone."</p>
