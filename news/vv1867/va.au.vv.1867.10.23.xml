                <summary>This editorial argues that in an age of progress people must take action to
                    ensure prosperity. Building the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad linking Virginia to
                    the West will ensure that the state's mineral and agricultural resources can be
                    profited upon, and that Virginia will grow to rival New York and Maryland in
                    greatness. The article assures farmers that the coming of the railroad will
                    raise the prices of agricultural products, not drown them out in competition
                    with the West.</summary>
