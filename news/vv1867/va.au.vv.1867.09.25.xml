                    what has, or may, happen North, and all will be well. Local causes North--the
                    prejudice there against mixed suffrage, will work out our safety. Let us watch,

                    <p>There is talk about "another war" soon. We would like to know where it is to
                        commence. Not possibly in the South, for if you would "stack arms," pile up
                        equipments and furnish wagon trains from Martinsburg to the Rio Grande you
                        couldn't raise a company for another <emph rend="italic">sectional
                        contest</emph>. Unless somebody paid very big wages <emph rend="italic">in
                            gold</emph>, you couldn't raise a post wagon master. Then where is the
                        war to commence? The men who fought before are tired of that sort of fun.
                        They say "d--n such fun," as an old militia substitute for his son said to
                        us about the "Romney Campaign." The men who never fought before in the
                        North, may feel like taking a hand. All we have to say is "go and try it."
                        Then "we will see what we will see," but, in the language of the poetic
                        melish, we think we hear them saying "d--n such fun."</p>

                <summary>Capt. Thomas J. Jackson, area Freedman's Bureau Agent, issued an order
                    clarifying tax policy for the Freedmen. All must pay taxes "unless relieved from
                    such payment, by the County Court, on proof that they are paupers." Confusion
                    arose because of a rumor that Jackson had declared that Freedmen did not need to
                    pay taxes for two years. Staunton Deputy Sheriff John Towberman asked Jackson to
                    solve the dispute because of difficulties in collecting taxes from the Freedmen.
                    The paper advises employers to read the directive to all their black employees.</summary>

                <summary>This letter asks Augusta farmers to loan several bushels of wheat to a
                    colony of recently arrived Polish immigrants living in Spottsylvania County.
                    They have been so far able to get only a small plot of vegetables and corn
                    planted, in part because the land in Spottsylvania COunty had been "fearfully
                    ravaged by the two armies" during the war. "A generous act is always its own
                    reward, but in this case I know no better investment than this for the future
                    interests of the country. These exiles are, many of them, men of a high order of
                    intelligence, and every friendly act shown them by our people is not only fully
                    appreciated, but is communicated to their friends in Europe and will influence
                    them to come to Virginia--and under present circumstances every immigrant is of
                    great consequence to us. Let Augusta then, out of her great abundance, lend a
                    little wheat to these worthy people, and my word for it no man will ever regret
                    it, and the County will be ultimately rewarded for it."</summary>
