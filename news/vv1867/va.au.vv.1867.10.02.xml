                <summary>The Valley Virginian seconds Major J. G. Paxton's support of the Chesapeake
                    and Ohio Railroad which John B. Baldwin did much to put in place. The plan is
                    for Augusta to subscribe $300,000 in county bonds for support of the road which
                    will link the Chesapeake Bay with the Ohio River. The road would open the trade
                    of the West to Virginia. "Instead of being an impoverished territory, filled
                    with the wrecks left by four years of terrific war, and with no relief from more
                    than two years of delusive peace, she would today be, not merely the peer of any
                    state, but would, as in the early days of the Republic, be the leading State of
                    the Union."</summary>

                    <p>Dumb George says it "is an insult to honest Confederate, Conservative colored
                        people and the whole race, no matter how mean a nigger may be, to compare a
                        low-down mean white man to them," and adds that "white gentlemen who write
                        for the papers ought not to make colored folks the scape-goats for all the
                        rascality of thieving white people." He is very much of the opinion that any
                        comparison between a mean white man and a negro is an insult to the latter,
                        and he is getting mad about it.</p>
