<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>New Orleans Cresent forcibly illustrates our situation, in the following
                        paragraph:</p>
                    <p>"As to the question of making every possible use of the negro vote in the
                        imminent emergency, it may be said that Congress has placed us in a position
                        similar to that of some of the early Christians under Roman persecution.
                        Cast naked into an arena among furious wild beasts, with nothing but a
                        stylus or a dagger to defend themselves, it was at their option to do their
                        utmost with such means of defense, or to stand quietly until it should suit
                        the appetite of fancy of the beasts to devour them. By the display of
                        extraordinary coolness, courage, and skill, they had a chance for escape.
                        There is to say the least, more than this much chance for our salvation from
                        utter disaster--and shall we throw it away? Most assuredly, if we stand
                        still, we shall be devoured by the beasts of radical agitation, of political
                        vengeance and venal rapacity, about to be turned loose upon us; and most
                        assuredly, therefore, if a stylus, or a dagger, or a still more efficient
                        weapon come to hand in negro suffrage, it will be simply suicidal not to
                        seize it."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This question is agitating a portion of the press, and, we are sorry to see,
                        the Richmond Whig urging the claims of Pierpont and other so-called,
                        "original Union men." "Original," God save the mark! Is playing over the old
                        game of corrupt politicians, is seeking their own aggrandizement at the
                        expense of their oppressed fellow citizens--"original?" Bah! they have no
                        claims upon our people, and, if they ever had, they have been fully paid by
                        the "feed" they have already had at the "public crib." We speak of
                        politicians, not of the mass of honest and true "original Union men," whom
                        we can respect, and expect to work with, in reorganizing the State
                        government.</p>
                    <p>What we want now is men of energy; of brains and nerve; men who will truly
                        represent the people and men they can trust. We have had a surfeit of this
                        sickly sentimentality about "conciliating the North," by elevating to office
                        men who brought on all our troubles, by aiding our enemies to overpower us.
                        The Radicals have laughed such puny efforts, to ward off their intended
                        blow, to scorn, and care as little for these men as we do. They force us to do certain things and that is all they
                        ask. Who it is done by--whether "original Union," "Johnny Reb," the "Devil
                        or Tom Walker," they don't care a continental. They prefer that it should
                        not be done at all. We are for putting an end to the farce we have been
                        playing, and feel assured that our people will elect the good and true, not
                        only to the Convention, but fill all offices in their gift with men,
                        (Confederates if you like it,) who will come up to the requirements of the
                        occasion, and truly represent them.</p>
                    <p>In short, this grand old State and her sisters South, are not left so
                        destitute of talent, even by the Radical disfranchisement, but they can find
                        men who can command respect, and fully appreciate the situation without
                        raking among the dry bones of Original Unionism "so called." And we
                        maintain, without fear of successful contradiction, that policy as well as principle, urge this course. Compliance with
                        the orders of the Military Bill, by a Convention of bob-tailed "Union
                        shriekers" would not effect the Radical power, for all parties in the North
                        would know such a Convention could not truly represent the State, and, then,
                        there is a chance that such a body might be worse than the Radicals--look at
                        Tennessee! But a compliance by a Convention, composed of Confederate
                        soldiers and true men, which would represent all classes, white and black,
                        would effect the Radicals. Such action by such a body would give the lie to
                        all their stories about our being "rebellious" &amp;c.--would open the
                        eyes of the Northern people to the frauds practiced by that party, and at
                        one swoop, hurl it from power and place and, with it, away goes "test
                        oaths," which a capacity for swallowing by the quantity, regardless of
                        quality, forms the chief claim of original Union men, "so-called."</p>
                    <p>One speech from Wade Hampton, the great Confederate Cavalryman, a letter or
                        so from Johnson, Beauregard, Longstreet, and a paragraph, in the Virginian,
                        giving Gen. Lee's known views, have done more to turn the tide North than
                        the whole body of "original Union Shriekers" South have accomplished in two
                        years of power or ever can. Then away with such folly. Brave, earnest men,
                        intent upon settling a difficulty, do not call upon the weakneed and
                        time-serving to act as friends. The strongest nerves and the clearest heads
                        and the truest hearts are chosen. Let us profit by the lessons of the past.</p>
                    <p>Pierpont and his pets have played their little game to no purpose, except to
                        irritate old wounds, long enough. Let the track be cleared for the young,
                        the brave and the vigorous minds of the South, and a few short months will
                        show the world, that the hard lessons of the past six years were not learned
                        in vain. Then, a "new Dominion," and a "new South," more prosperous,
                        prouder, stronger, freer than the old, will bless the men whose brains and
                        strong arms, snatched them from the control of those who now, and always,
                        seek, to reap power and pelf, from our misfortunes.</p>

<b>A Trip Down the Valley</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A correspondent of the Valley Virginian took a ten-day trip through the
                    Valley and reports on conditions up and down its length. He describes the now
                    abandoned battle fields, reports on efforts to bury the Confederate dead, and
                    discusses the opinion of residents on reconstruction.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Dear Virginian:--The return of the bright sunshine
                        of Spring, shedding its renovating influence over "Dame nature" determined
                        us to pay a visit to our native town in the lower Valley. And though we
                        might have mounted behind the fire breathing steed, and coursing along hill
                        and dale, been planted upon the soil that gave us birth, yet we preferred
                        riding her surely down the Valley, that we might once more gaze upon the
                        spots, to which our memory reverted, as sacred ground where, engaged in
                        deadly conflict, many a brave and noble fellow consecrated the soil with his
                        blood.</p>
                    <p>At New Market we found the field upon which Gen. Breckenridge whipped the
                        "Flying Dutchman" enclosed and sown in wheat, looking green and beautiful;
                        the thick cluster of cedars which served as a shield to the flying hosts
                        from the bullets of the little Spartan band under the Command of Col. Ship
                        of the Institute, had entirely disappeared before the axe of the sturdy
                        yeoman as he labors to recuperate his lost fortunes. A little beyond, at the
                        foot of Rude's Hill, on the South, we discovered a white shaft erected,
                        bearing the following inscription: "Erected to the memory of Capt. Summers
                        and Sergeant Koontz, C. S. A., who were brutally murdered in June, 1865, by
                        order of Lt. Col. Hussey,--Ohio Regiment." And then passing on meditating
                        upon this cold blooded murder of these young men in the prime of manhood,
                        the circumstances of which are yet fresh in the minds of all, and gazing
                        upon the beauty of the country and the grandeur of the scenery, just by the
                        road-side we discovered open graves, and we involuntarily exclaimed: Why is
                        this! has the time been ushered in "when the grave shall give up its dead"?
                        Has the resurrection morn burst upon us, and the mortality of those gallant
                        fellows who, once reposed in those open mounds been clothed in immortality?
                        Yes, they have been clothed in immortality in the hearts
                            of their countrymen, and now they are gathered together as one
                        great family of the dead, to repose 'till the resurrection morn in Mount
                        Jackson Cemetery.</p>
                    <p>They have been resurrected from the earthly resting place to which their
                        comrades, wrapping their blankets about them consigned them, not by the
                        trump of Jehovah, but by the noblest handiwork of God--woman. The spot is a
                        beautiful one, immediately upon the Valley Road, enclosed by a neat paling
                        fence as white as the driven snow, everything exhibiting taste and care.</p>
                    <p>Let them rest, and as time rolls on may the thousands and thousands of
                        passers by be impressed with the character and virtues of those martyred
                        dead. Upon inquiring we were informed that Mrs. Meem, the widow of the
                        lamented Dr. Meem, is President of the Association.</p>
                    <p>But travelling on, we found the mighty work of recuperation everywhere making
                        the country smile like an Eden. Barns, houses and fences were being built.
                        Mills and factories springing up, and everybody as busy as a bee. Indeed,
                        never before were we so forcibly struck with the sublimity of a character
                        displayed by the young men of the South. They have proved themselves equal
                        to any emergency--wielding the sword with Herculean skill and strength in
                        the field of mortal combat they now with equal facility convert it into the
                        plowshare. Fisher's Hill, the scene of the sad disaster to our arms in
                        September, 1864, seems to bow her head in shame. The works erected by the
                        labor and toil of the little band under command of the exiled, but noble and
                        intrepid Early, still remain, but no spear of wheat is seen, or preparation
                        made for a stalk of corn. Cedar Creek, unlike Fisher's Hill, appears
                        determined to wipe from her escutcheon the stain of October, 1864, by a
                        renewed and determined effort to cultivate and till the soil and develope
                        her resources.</p>
                    <p>Kernstown, seemingly proud of the part enacted by her and the honorable
                        connection she has in history with "Stonewall" Jackson, smiles with the
                        prospect of a fine harvest. And there in the distance we discovered the
                        various forts which once bristling with cannon encompassed Winchester, our
                        native place. Many memories of the past clustered 'round and scenes of
                        boyhood hours appeared vividly before us in imagination and thus lost in
                        revery and reflection, we drove up to the "Taylor Hotel," and were aroused
                        by the well known and familiar voice of that whole-souled gallant and genial
                        fellow, Major W. W. Goldsborough, the proprietor. We had the good fortune
                        during the war of forming an intimate acquaintance with the Major, and felt
                        perfectly at home when we met him. He has
                        recently taken the "Taylor Hotel" and we feel assured he will receive the
                        patronage he so richly deserves. Long may he wave. Soon after our arrival we
                        met with our old friend Beall, of the "Times," whom we were delighted to see
                        and to learn he was succeeding so well. The Times is emphatically the paper of the lower Valley. How could it be
                        otherwise when Beall attends all gatherings from Social parties and
                        political caucuses down to a "trotting match" and
                        corn shucking, and is generally the soul of the question. He has been, I am
                        sorry to say, in rather a desponding mood of late, and frequently quotes the following lines upon woman:<br> "Away--away--your smile's a curse,<br>
                        O, blot me from the face of men;<br> Kind, pitying Heaven, by death or
                        worse,<br> If ever I love such things again."</p>
                    <p>Winchester is going ahead and with the return of Spring the music of the
                        mechanic is heard, and everything is beginning to put on a cheerful face.
                        Several fine brick buildings have been erected of the Depot, and the rubbish
                        was being removed from the burnt space opposite the hotel, to make way for a
                        magnificent structure to be built by the Masons. The battle fields beyond
                        are all in cultivation, and the plow is sunk deep into the soil, enriched by
                        the blood of hundreds, yea thousands; and all regardless of the terrific
                        engagement, the rattle of musketry, clank of steel and boom of cannon, which
                        almost rent the Heavens, and frightened from their resting places the Nymphs
                        and Naiads, are as "merry as a marriage bell."</p>
                    <p>We conversed freely with many of the leading men along the Valley upon the
                        topics of the day, and there was only one opinion expressed. That in the
                        present crippled and impoverished condition of the country we want rest and
                        quietude from politics, and the many evils it engenders, and capital to
                        develope the resources of our highly favored land and disembowel the
                        vastness of its mineral wealth. To accomplish this we must reconstruct upon
                        the best terms we can, and they regard the Sherman bill the only basis. The
                        soldiers say that the mere fact of "Uncle Bob" favoring a Convention is
                        enough for them. No doubt is entertained of our ability to control the negro
                        vote--their interests are with us, and the masses will vote with us. We
                        returned home after an absence of ten days, perfectly delighted with our
                        trip and prouder than ever of our native Valley.<br> STAUNTON.</p>

                    <p>Our usually discreet contemporary, the Staunton Spectator, is we fear, allowing itself to be swayed rather by
                        passionate impulses than by those enlightened views, that generally
                        influence its course. It advises the white people of Virginia to vote
                        against the Convention, saying:</p>
                    <p>"They are free to vote for or against the Convention. The choice is submitted
                        to them. If they vote for the Convention, they cannot plead as an excuse
                        that they were forced to do so. We do not know what persons in other
                        sections may do, but we may confidently predict that the citizens of this
                        substantial old county and of gallant little Highland, will record their
                        emphatic protest against the unconstitutional military bill by voting
                        AGAINST the Convention."</p>
                    <p>We are really at a loss to understand our esteemed contemporary. To vote, and
                        to vote a Convention, and to aid in framing such a Constitution as will
                        embody the features indicated in the military bill, is the test prescribed
                        by Congress. Unless the whites shall co-operate in doing these things, they
                        will, in all probability, be permanently disfranchised, their property
                        confiscated, and the whole States government handed over to the Hunnicutt
                        faction. Is the Spectator desirous of bringing
                        about such a result? Is it prepared for it? It speaks of "choice," as if we
                        could by any action of ours defeat a Convention and prevent the adoption of
                        a Constitution. We had thought that the argument predicated of "choice,"
                        like that in relation to "honor," had long since been dissipated in the air.
                        There will be a Convention and a Constitution whether we vote for or against
                        them. If the whites vote them down, the whole reconstruction policy will at
                        once be committed to the faction to which we have referred. This is "choice"
                        with a vengeance.</p>
                    <p>The blacks will, of course, vote for a Convention, and for such a
                        Constitution as Congress has indicated on the military bill. If we vote
                        against them we at once make a wall of separation between them and
                        ourselves. Our only hope of attaching the blacks to our fortunes, is by
                        manifesting a willingness to vote and act with them in regard to the
                        Convention and the Constitution. The leading object of Congress is, by
                        Constitutional guarantees, to secure permanently to the blacks the suffrage
                        accorded them by the military bill. Of course the colored people will all go
                        for securing this right to themselves, and for the Convention as auxiliary
                        thereto, and they will just as certainly go against all opposed to these two
                        things. Those of the whites who shall vote against the Convention will,
                        whether such be their purpose or not, be effectual co-workers of the
                        unprincipled faction now endeavoring to create division and discord between
                        the two races.--Richmond Whig.</p>

                    <p>
                        By Jed. Hotchkiss, Topographical Enginer, Staunton,
                        Va.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Commissioner in charge of the Census in 1860, in the preface to the
                        volume devoted to manufactures recently published, says "It was
                        manufacturing and mechanical resources and the granaries of the West which
                        enabled the republic to arm, subsist and pay immense armies and create iron
                        clad fleets to meet the emergency. It was mainly for the want of these, and
                        not for any lack of courage, will, or skill that the revolt failed. A more
                        striking illustration of the value and power of such resources is not to be
                        found in history; and from it, now that the cause of discord is at an end,
                        the integrity of the Union vindicated and the reign of peace begun, all
                        sections of the country, States, Counties, and parishes may derive lessons
                        of wisdom and profit in regard to the value of manufactures and the mechanic
                        arts." These "lessons of wisdom and profit" have been made available in many
                        States, always with the same results, and wherever the Great Creator has so
                        happily mingled the elements that "plow, loom, and anvil" can work side by
                        side there comfort and prosperity find their habitations. The times here are
                        hard and money scarce, and yet in a region of country twenty miles long and
                        eighty miles wide we have at least a million and a half of bushels of corn,
                        by the estimate of well-informed persons, beyond the wants of our
                        population, worth at least a million and a quarter dollars, and this in a
                        population of less than seventy thousand.</p>
                    <p>There is another fact in our circumstances that seems strange, lands of the
                        very best quality, on a limestone foundation, in good condition and in a
                        genial climate have an average value of less than fifty dollars an acre, (it
                        was only twenty-five by the census of 1860,) while lands not as good in any
                        respect, in New York and Pennsylvania have an average value of more than an
                        hundred dollars an acre. The best farms in Lancaster county, Pa., are worth
                        $250 per acre, while here they are not worth more than $75. But these things
                        are nothing new: it was a long time ago that Locke wrote "In places where
                        thriving manufactories have erected themselves, land has been observed to
                        sell quicker and for more than in other places":--and Adam Smith, the great
                        English economist, says: "The most opulent nations excel in agriculture as
                        well as in manufactures, but they are eminently more distinguished by the
                        latter than by the former." The conclusion is obvious; we are too much
                        devoted to agriculture, we need more consumers of the products of our lands,
                        if we would add to their value, and these consumers must be brought nearer
                        to us, for now our farmers complain that it costs most of the profits of a
                        crop to get it to market, therefore the corn lies in the crib and the
                        farmer's pocket is empty, and so is every one's for by the plow alone we
                        thrive.</p>
                    <p>The County of Augusta is about 32 miles square, therefore it has an area of
                        near 1,000 square miles or 640,000 acres and only one third of this is
                        improved, yet in 1860, with a population of near 28,000 this County produced
                        over a million bushels of wheat and corn or about 40 bushels to each person
                        in it; so the county had not only "full rations" for its own people for that
                        year, but enough for a hundred thousand more. From this it may be seen that
                        we can add largely to our consuming population and yet produce no more than
                        usual. It needs no argument, after these facts, to prove that it is to our
                        interest to work two-handed by introducing manufacturing as one of the
                        leading pursuits of our section, and create a market that shall buy all our
                        surplus and quicken the circulation in all the channels of industry. We are
                        so situated now that, although we could do it, it
                        would require a long time for our own people to much diversify their
                        pursuits, therefore it seems best that we should invite, by superior
                        inducements, capital, trained labor and population to come and occupy the
                        unoccupied two thirds of our County and help our people develope the
                        resources Providence has so lavishly bestowed upon us, and so aid us in
                        paying off our individual and State debts, finish our great lines of
                        projected internal improvements, improve our roads, rebuild our schools and
                        bring us again to such a state of prosperity as we once enjoyed, if not to a
                        greater.</p>
                    <p>Impressed with these views we have concluded that it would, perhaps, be of
                        some advantage to show, in detail, some of the advantages our region offers
                        to those having capital and talent to invest, and call the attention of our
                        own people to their varied resources that they may be induced either to make
                        use of them themselves or offer them for sale at such rates as shall induce
                        parties from abroad to come into our midst and purchase and develope them.
                        There is but one sentiment we know, in regard to an increase of population
                        and capital here, all desire it, and men of sense and industry with or
                        without capital come from where they may, will be welcome.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Herald is the best political barometer in this country, and it
                        is gratifying to note that it sees the tide is turning in the North. In its
                        issue of the 9th, "the prospect and probable political results" of
                        reconstruction under the Military bill, are discussed at length. In speaking
                        "of the harmony and political affiliation, between the late slave-holders
                        and their emancipation slaves" it uses the following language, which we
                        should profit by on the principle that 'it is always best to do exactly what
                        your enemy don't want you to do." It says:</p>
                    <p>"Now this is a state of things deserving particular notice, and which was
                        certainly not expected by the old radical abolitionists of the North. These
                        radicals erroneously supposed the negroes hated the white master race and
                        would take the earliest opportunity to turn against them. The teachings of
                        the war, in which the negroes voluntarily fought side by side with their
                        masters, did not eradicate this error. The radicals have been expecting,
                        since the war closed and the slaves were emancipated, that these people
                        would vote and act in opposition to their old masters. They begin to see
                        their mistake, however, and are in a terrible state of anxiety about the
                        consequences. No tide of Northern emigration, however great, nor any amount
                        of radical speechmaking and preaching can turn the political current in
                        which the blacks and the whites of the South are united and combined for
                        action. They both see their interests are the same and irrevocably fixed in
                        the same section of the country."</p>
                    <p>"We cannot yet see fully where this surprising political and social
                        revolution will end. It will certainly produce an extraordinary influence
                        upon political parties and upon the destinies of the republic. The radical
                        press is dumfounded and knows not which way to shape its course. The fruit
                        of years of agitation is likely to turn to ashes in its mouth. The Southern
                        States, with their eighty or ninety Representatives and twenty Senators in
                        Congress, will hold a large balance of power, and the probability is that
                        both races will remain united in the interests of their own section and in
                        support of the same political party."</p>

                    <p>To see strong, hearty young men, with brains in their heads and strength in
                        their muscles, loafing on street corners, railing at 'hard-times' and
                        whining about "having nothing to do." This whine is occasionally varied by a
                        tirade against the "d n-d lazy niggers," but for whose labor some of these
                        "gentlemen of elegant leisure" would be starving now. Go to work and feel
                        like men.</p>

                    corporation were reappointed. Three Commissioners of Streets were named: Kayser,
                    Bickle and Evans. Kayser, Bunch, and Scherer were appointed the Committee of

                    for permission to construct a plank walk from the front of their store on the
                    corner of Augusta Street to the Lexington road. Many people were exempted from

                    Bagby asking permission to grade several streets near his brickyard. A petition
                    was received from John Stanley asking permission to pump water from the nearest

                    the adjourned meeting, the following officers were sworn in: David Taylor,
                    Superintendent of Water Works; O. K. Jacob Parrent, Chief of Police; John Kurtz,
