<b>Pleasant Homes</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article argues that "the worship of a dollar does more to degrade
                    American homes than all else." The author encourages Americans to put some care
                    and money into building pleasant homes which will ideally stay in the family for
                    generations. It will implant culture and values in youth, and lead to happy
                    family life.<br>

<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial ranges over the political questions of the day. It
                    criticizes the policies and proposed amendments supported by the radical
                    Congress and congratulates the South for resisting them and continuing to
                    progress materially.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is the same old story. We can see now no decided improvement in the
                        article, but we think we see signs of a change for the better, as far as the
                        Southern people are concerned; and who cares for anything else?</p>
                    <p>The proceedings of Congress possess too little variety to justify us in
                        filling up the columns of the Valley Virginian with them. We know our
                        readers will appreciate the kind feelings we have for them, when we only
                        give a synopsis.</p>
                    <p>The Radicals are still hammering away at various and sundry amendments to the
                        Constitution our "rebel" forebears formed and, like all "Jack-legs," they
                        are making a very bad "job" of it. The resolution of a member from Ohio,
                        looking to an impeachment of Mr. Johnson, has been laid on the table of the
                        "Judiciary Committee" and will, probably, lie there, unless the Radical
                        party are fools. The President exhibits no uneasiness on the subject and his
                        veto of the negro suffrage bill, for the District of Columbia, shows he can
                        be trusted.</p>
                    <p>Terrible things--awful penalties, are threatening us, if we don't do exactly
                        as the Radical mob wish us to do; if we don't vote for the "Constitutional
                        Amendment," so called, and swear we were all wrong--"traitors," fools and
                        cowards. Mr. Thad Stevens desires to make the Sovereign States of the South
                        "territories," he proposes to re-organize our State governments, not
                        according to the Constitution we made, but upon the new and original idea,
                        that Congress is all powerful and he is its "Prophet." Many of the smaller
                        dogs, the [unclear] of Congress, are trying to outdo Thaddeus in his brutal
                        talk, and you can hear some of their voices clear, and the barking of the
                        whole pack, but, in the end, that sturdy mastiff, the law and the right will
                        quiet them all. All the thousand and one foolish things said and done in
                        Washington can not influence our future, if we will only work and have an eye single to the material development of our
                        country for<br> "After passion cometh reason--the better spirits wait"--<br> not in
                        childish repinings over what is lost forever, but work in the confidence of
                        the Justice of a merciful Father--knowing that the "laborer is always worthy
                        of his hire."</p>
                    <p>The Radical Congressional Excursion party has returned to Washington from New
                        Orleans. They were feasted, they rode in "special trains," and had a good
                        time generally--hard by and over the graves of our martyred dead. This cost
                        the conciliatory policy men of the South some $30,000; while the widows and
                        orphans of the men they [unclear] death to are
                        starving. We hope it had a good effect on these radical gentlemen,
                        but we can't help wishing (we trust we are not disloyal) our poor had the
                        money spent.</p>
                    <p>The "Silver lining to the Cloud" of our troubles, is the present passive
                        state of the South politically, and its steady, persevering efforts
                        materially. And there is to [unclear] comfort to be delivered [unclear]
                        contentious of the radicals [unclear] in their respective States. When
                        rogues fall out modest men get their dues--let them fight over the bone.</p>
                    <p>The Virginia legislature has showed itself worthy of the State, it has openly
                        and quietly voted to reject the Amendment. Let it act as wisely in its
                        nomination for our next governor.</p>

<b>Building Association</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article describes how a building association would work. The poor
                    would be able to make gradual payments on a house, receiving title in full
                    within a few years. According to the article, rural districts in France and
                    England have had success with such an institution, and Staunton would benefit
                    from it.<br>

<b>Communicate</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter to the editor praises the Staunton Thespians. In addition to
                    being entertaining, they help the town since admission fees go to charitable
                    causes and keep the money in Staunton.<br>

<b>Hard</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Valley Virginian criticizes the Mobile Tribune for calling William
                    Yancy one of the "worst enemies of the South," even "among the Lincolns, Butlers
                    and John Browns."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<b>"A Word To The Wise"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper sarcastically calls the Staunton Town Council "wise," as it urges
                    them to forgo costly improvements to "Gospel Hill" in favor of combatting
                    cholera by cleaning the town, ensuring plenty of fresh water, and providing the
                    Street Commissioner with a salary. "Has any member of the council boldness
                    enough and common sense enough to devise means to effect these much desired
