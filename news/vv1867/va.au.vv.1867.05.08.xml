                    placed under military rule, since "fourteen murders," and "robberies, arson and
                    other crimes without number" have been committed there in the past 18 months.</summary>

                    orphan to itinerant preacher. The editors assert that he became intemperate, and
                    could not support his family. "This dirty dog who drank and gambled off his
                    wife's negroes, pretends to be their friend! Let colored people look to it that

                <head>A Mechanic's Association. Shall We Have One?</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Staunton, we believe, has a body of mechanics not surpassed for intelligence,
                        good morals and a thorough knowledge of their various trades, in the State.
                        Her magnificent public buildings bear witness to what they can do on a large
                        scale, and her private residences, designed and built at home, will compare
                        favorably with any in the South. Her machine and carpenter shops, her
                        printing offices; her tobacco factories; book bindery, shoe shops, harness
                        and carriage manufacturers, &amp;c., are filled by gentlemen of
                        character as well as master workmen. Her mechanics add to her prosperity and
                        have made her the first town in the Valley. Take them out, and all other
                        occupations would languish and die. And still, with a full knowledge of
                        these facts, this important element of our society has no organization; no
                        common center; no union of interests, by which it could protect its own, and
                        greatly increase its power for doing good. We have associations of different
                        kinds: "Medical Associations," "Musical Associations," and "Building
                        Associations," all very good in their place, but no Mechanic's Association.
                        That this is wrong; that the mechanics have done injustice to themselves, as
                        individuals and as a body, by not creating a greater community of interest
                        among the trades, all admit, but, as yet, no one acts.</p>
                    <p>We have all seen and felt the necessity for a Mechanic's Association, and the
                        success of the Danville Association, started June, 1866, should stimulate
                        our mechanics to like action. In June, 1866, a letter from the Secretary to
                        us, says; "a few Mechanics in Danville, feeling the necessity of a union of
                        the trades for their mutual interests, associated, and now number over 100
                        members. There was never a question about 'higher wages,' &amp;c.,
                        debated, its purpose being simply to aid us in cultivating friendly
                        feelings; a taste for the good and beautiful; and the acquisition of
                        mechanical and general knowledge. To which end we founded a Library; have
                        lectures and debates on various subjects tending to that result. Also to aid
                        each other in sickness and distress."</p>
                    <p>In a copy of the Constitution and By Laws of the Association, accompanying
                        this letter, we find the objects of the Association stated as follows: "We
                        the Mechanics and Artisans of Danville and the vicinity, earnestly desiring
                        to encourage industry, advance the Arts, promote virtue, elevate the
                        standard of morality, and cultivate feelings of brotherly love and
                        charity--and feeling assured that these ends can be best attained by
                        associated effort, do hereby adopt the following Constitution and By-Laws
                        for our government." A careful reading of the Constitution and By Laws
                        convinces us that better can not be framed, and we invite every man
                        interested to call and examine them. The membership is divided into four
                        classes: active members 21 years of age, regular mechanics or artisans;
                        Junior members, minors over 12 years, regularly engaged in some trade as
                        their future occupation; Life members, any person in good standing by
                        payment of $25; Honorary members, persons of distinguished reputation,
                        friendly to the Association or such as have rendered important services to
                        it. The officers are President, Vice-President, Auditor, Treasurer;
                        Librarian, Chaplain and Steward, also a board of 5 Trustees. The regular
                        meetings are on each Monday night in October, November, December, January,
                        February and March at 7 o'clock, and in April, May, June, July, August and
                        September at 8 P. M. Every active member of the Association pays a quarterly
                        tax of 75 cents, in advance, and upon the death of a member, whose funeral
                        expenses are to be paid, 50 cents. Junior members pay 50 cents quarterly in
                        advance. It is provided that there shall be but one fund in the Association,
                        which shall not be disposed of, except for actual and necessary expenses of
                        the Association, or for the benefit of sick or distressed members, their
                        wives and children. Members desiring to travel are furnished with cards or
                        certificates for six months, and, in short, all needful rules and
                        regulations are laid down to make an Association of the kind a complete
                        success.</p>
                    <p>And now, mechanics of Staunton, it is for you to say whether you will join
                        hands and aid in working out the problem so successfully started by your
                        brothers in Danville. The few facts we are able to give should be thought
                        over and added to, by older heads than ours. A meeting should be called, to
                        see if an organization, which can accomplish so much good, cannot be
                        perfected in Staunton. As you are now situated, without an organization,
                        without that association so necessary to all great undertakings, you can do
                        little to accomplish the great end and aim of all true Southern men: the
                        elevation and advancement of the mechanic Arts among our people. Then meet
                        at an early day, and, standing shoulder to shoulder, push forwards the great
                        work of regenerating the State.</p>
                    <p>Much can be done in an association of this kind to aid in the great work
                        Virginia now demands of her people. Relying on her hardy sons of toil, the
                        mechanics, the laboring men, to defend her honor in war, she calls on them,
                        with a confidence renewed and increased by their devotion then, to stand by
                        her in her hour of desolation and distress. She calls upon you to leave no
                        stone unturned, to take no step backward in great movement for material
                        prosperity and progress now so necessary. By the association and combination
                        of capitol and labor, she urges you to elevate and educate yourselves to the
                        highest standard of mechanical excellence--and can you resist the call? The
                        times have changed and it behooves every true son of Virginia, especially
                        the mechanic and laboring man, to show they are the strength and power of
                        the State. To this end we must meet together and learn to know each other
                        better; the brave and strong must help the timid and weak; the educated must
                        devote a portion of their time to teaching the young. We must confer
                        together; new improvements in machinery, &amp;c., must be discussed, and
                        the inventive genius of our people stimulated. With the fund that can be
                        raised a Library can be bought, which will be an education in itself. In
                        fact Virginia, destined as she is to be the greatest manufacturing State of
                        the Union, must have educated mechanics and farmers, men who can make her a
                        power never dreamed of by the most sanguine; men who can represent her great
                        working interests in the Halls of Legislation, as well as in the workshop
                        and the field. Then, possessed as she is of the greatest extent of
                        territory, the most salubrious climate, and the major amount of intellect
                        embraced within the limits of the reunited States, she has but to arouse her
                        dormant energies, utilize her master intelligence, and wealth and political
                        power will soon place her, as a State in position as the dominant, rather
                        than the subject portion of the reorganized republic.</p>

                <summary>This editorial calls for formation of a Mechanics Association in Staunton,
                    not to agitate for higher wages, but to create a united and educated
                    manufacturing work force. It holds up an association formed in Danville as an
                    example. If this goal is reached, Virginia can become the leading manufacturing
                    state in the nation.</summary>

                <summary>This editorial comes out against southerners dividing into two political
                    parties. The common threat of Reconstruction should be met with a unified front:
                    "We have been contending against an external force for that very liberty, which
                    would allow us to divide into parties and discuss questions of vital interest to
                    us and the whole country. These facts should make us, white and black alike,
                    stand together until we are free, and we feel confident Virginia people will
                    continue to exhibit their good sense and avoid all political complications
                    whatever."</summary>

                    <p>The fourth anniversary of the death of Stonewall Jackson occurs next Friday,
                        May the 10th. This is the "sacred day" set apart, by common consent in his
                        loved Valley, to pay fitting tribute to his memory and decorate the graves
                        of our honored dead with flowers. There is something peculiarly appropriate
                        and touching in this ceremony, and how any can neglect so sacred a duty, or
                        object to it, seems strange to us, when even our late enemies allow it. The
                        programme of last year will be carried out. The procession will form at the
                        Methodist Church, after Col. O'Ferrall's address and, headed by the
                        Stonewall Band, will proceed to the Cemetery. No person need fear any
                        interference, and Old Augusta should turn out <emph rend="italic">en
                        masse</emph>. Let us devote at least one day to honoring the memory of those
                        who died for us, and let the tribute be paid with full and grateful hearts.
                        The South, in her agony, cries:</p>
                    <p>"Voice after voice hath died away,<lb/> Once in my dwelling heard;<lb/> Sweet

                    <p>Ladies of Augusta, you, whose fair hands tended and whose kind voices
                        cheered, the last moments of so many that lie unnoticed in your Cemetery, by
                        your action next Friday answer. Let the South and the world know that "her
                        beloved" are cherished and held sacred in your hearts, and that your tears
                        shall forever water and revive the flowers with which you decorate their
                        graves.</p>

                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>In response to a most complimentary vote of thanks, by the House of Delegates
                        of Virginia, and after returning his heartfelt thanks, Mr. Baldwin said that
                        he never looked to a future more threatening and less full of promise. He,
                        and all present, had passed through the greatest of civil wars; and in the
                        darkest hour of that disastrous struggle he never saw so much occasion for
                        despondency and depression as at this time. It was impossible for any one to
                        foresee the result of the present dangerous experiment in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Although, said Mr. Baldwin, we cannot claim to be free, nor claim that
                        Virginia is a State, yet we are an organized community, and have a right to
                        expect to be free, and that Virginia will be a State. But the situation of
                        public affairs at this time, with the new element introduced by the United
                        States into the political arena, presents a problem whose solution justified
                        great anxiety for the public tranquility and welfare. This new element,
                        under the most favorable circumstances, would be a matter of concern; but
                        when subject to the maddening influence of party spirit and agitations of
                        partisans, it became a subject of gravest consideration and apprehension.</p>
                    <p>It becomes us, said Mr. Baldwin, to look well into the circumstances which
                        surround us, and to brace ourselves for the duty before us. He anticipated
                        that a people who had passed through such a war as we have had, and had
                        borne themselves with such fortitude and constancy under its severe trials,
                        do not now intend to give way to useless repinings or to timidity and alarm.
                        I take it, said he, that you mean not only to give way, but to perform your
                        duties to the community and the State. He urged them by every consideration
                        of public and private duty, by every obligation that belongs to good
                        citizens, and by their love of order and obedience to law, to forego no
                        opportunity to avert the difficulties which threatened the State, and, if
                        possible, to control and guide her destiny amidst the dangers that lowered
                        upon her. He urged all to avail themselves of whatever opportunities of
                        choice or selection that might be offered. He conjured those who could to
                        register their names among the voters, to advise all others to do the same,
                        and to take such participation in the proceedings relative to the
                        reconstruction of the State as prudence and discretion may suggest when the
                        time arrives. If, said he, we take care to exercise the privileges accorded
                        to us with discretion--with a proper sense of our responsibilities to God
                        and man--we shall at least discharge our duty, and will do the best that can
                        be done for the State in the great emergency in which she is placed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin expressed the hope that he had over-estimated the peril and
                        over-stated the dangers of the situation. But he had said what he thought
                        proper, and with a view to arouse gentlemen to the necessity of the earnest
                        discharge of all the duties devolved upon them at this time. For himself,
                        though he considered the peril great, he was not without hope. Even that
                        element which occasioned apprehension had offered proofs of fidelity and
                        good conduct under excitement that commanded admiration and confidence.
                        Through the darkest hour of the war, amidst all the elements of strife and
                        confusion, and all the contrivances to excite them against their friends and
                        masters, the colored race rose high above those who would have tempted them
                        to deeds of outrage and of wrong. He was not without hope that we shall
                        again find them superior to those who would excite them to outrage and
                        mislead them to their own injury. Mr. Baldwin advised that the whites should
                        practice towards them the same kindness and consideration which had
                        characterized the conduct of our people in their past relations to the
                        colored race.</p>

                <summary>The May session of the Town Council met, Mayor Trout presiding. Crawford

                    down the Greenville road was referred to the Water Committee. The report of the
                    Superintendent of Water Works shows the water depth at 26 inches above the
                    supply pipe. Work done for individuals amounted to $81.95 and for the public,

                    refused. One hundred dollars were appropriated for support of the town poor. The
                    following appropriations were made on recommendation of the street
                    commissioners: $400 to improve Gospel Hill; $1,200 to grade and McAdamize Lewis

                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>A most remarkable comment on the morals of the late Confederate Army, is
                        represented in a recent report to the Trustees of Mercer (Ga.) University,
                        by Rev. H. H. Tucker, D. D., President of the University. The facts set
                        forth will be read with interest by the Southern people, and cannot fail to
                        impress those who are not Southern people with the belief that if we have
                        been sorely chastised of Heaven, we have also been surprisingly blessed. The
                        following is an extract from Dr. Tucker's report. After stating that the
                        University is in full and successful operation, and after some remarks on
                        the general good order of the students, the President reports:</p>
                    <p>In a few instances a number of them together, owing not to evil intent but
                        merely to the natural exuberances of youthful spirits, have been a little
                        too boisterous, and somewhat disorderly. A mere suggestion of the
                        impropriety of this, not accompanied by reproof, has been sufficient to
                        restrain them. As to diligence in study, I have never had occasion to incite
                        them to it; on the contrary I have felt it my duty in some instances to
                        restrain them and advise them to devote more time to recreation. On the
                        whole I may say that a more docile, gentle, tractable and dutiful body of
                        young men I have never seen. A number of these students were soldiers in the
                        Confederate army, and I desire to put it on record as one of the remarkable
                        facts of the times, that these war-torn veterans--veterans in arms, though
                        young in years, who served through the whole or a large part of the war, are
                        not only among the best we now have but among the best that we ever had. It
                        is touching to contemplate the almost incredible combination of heroism and
                        gentleness. They were lions in battle--at home they are lambs. I need not
                        say that it is a luxury to teach such noble youths, and as an honor and a
                        privilege to prepare them for future their career.</p>
                    <p>The facts in the case seem to contradict all our preconceived opinions and
                        theories. We supposed, in common with all, that the influence of the army
                        and of the camp would be in the highest degree hurtful to morals; that mere
                        youths of unformed character, removed from the restraints of home,--away
                        from the sweet influences of the sanctuary, and associating with company the
                        most unselect and witnessing and taking active part almost daily in horrid
                        scenes of carnage and death, would lose all their finer sensibilities and
                        become the victims of the worst passions of human nature. Indeed to the
                        pious parent, the risk to life and limb in battle was less to be dreaded
                        than the more fearful perils of <emph rend="italic">character</emph>. The
                        facts are precisely the reverse of all that our fears anticipated. Whether
                        this is the case in all armies and in all wars, or whether the late
                        Confederate army was an exception, with or without parallel, and if so, what
                        were the causes which made this case exceptional, are questions which I
                        shall not attempt to discuss. It is enough at present to record the
                        surprising fact that the influence of army life seems to have been for good.
                        It should excite our heartfelt and tearful gratitude to God, that if He has
                        slain many of our sons, He has in His compensating Providence improved the
                        character of those that remain.</p>
                    <p>About two-thirds of our present students have been in the army, and about
                        one-third of these, equivalent to one-fifth of our entire number of
