                <summary>The paper publishes some of the secret ceremonies and charges of the Red
                    String Knights, also known as the Heroes of America. The fraternity allegedly
                    sprang up during the war in Virginia and the Carolinas, and was dedicated to the
                    preservation of the Union. Now the editors assert that it is supporting the
                    Radical Republican agenda.</summary>

                    order" of the Red String Knights, which is alleged to be a Radical Republican
                    organization. They call on the governor to use military force to break it up,
                    and allege that some men are tricked into joining. "Northern people should
                    remember that such an organization, in the hands of the Radical party, endangers
                    their lives and liberties as well as ours. We have heard of a few in the Valley

                    <p>The Mobile [Ala.] Register, does not mince words in the following truthful
                        article. The purpose of the Sherman bill was to radicalize the South and
                        make it what Massachusetts is. The accomplishment or failure of this scheme
                        depends upon ourselves. A sluggish cowardice and inaction will ruin us. A
                        bold and manly confronting of the danger will give us a mastery of the
                        situation. Two things are necessary. First, to rescue the black race, armed
                        with the tremendous weapon of suffrage, from the domination of a clique of
                        scoundrels who aim to make their passions the chess-men in their game of
                        lucre and ambition, and to exercise the legitimate influence of old
                        association and present and future interest held by the white man over the
                        newly enfranchised race. It will be a crying shame if a nation of
                        intelligent men, who stand in relation of employees to this people; upon
                        whom all their hopes rest for the meat and bread of life, allow a handful of
                        alien adventures to step in and not only sever their bonds of influence, but
                        set them in deadly hostility to their best friends and safest counsellors.</p>
                    <p>And not only do we owe it to ourselves, but to the unfortunate black race,
                        who have been thrust, all unprepared for it, upon freedom and self-support,
                        to save them from the hands of the leeches and incendiaries who are sucking
                        their poor present substance and leading them to their future ruin.</p>
                    <p>The State of Alabama must not be given up to Radical dominion; and it will be
                        unless every man who loves his country and values the happiness of himself
                        and his family takes an earnest and active part, in the elections to be
                        forced upon us by the Sherman bill.</p>
