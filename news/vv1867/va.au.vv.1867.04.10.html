<b>The Truth of History</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors object to Dabney's life of Stonewall Jackson being regarded as
                    "the only authentic history of Stonewall Jackson," and point out some of its

<b>"No Time For Swapping Horses."</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial celebrates the victory of the conservative party in
                    Connecticut as a harbinger of things to come. There should be no resting an
                    laurels, however; northern conservatives must "push the good work ahead," and
                    Virginians must complete "reconstructing" their state in order to "turn the
                    tide" in the North.<br>

<b>Candidates for the Convention</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article denounces the apathy and misguided principle that induces many
                    talented men to refuse to become candidates for the Constitutional Convention
                    because they fear cooperation may imply acceptance of radical policy.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the rural districts, truly says the Richmond Times, we learn that
                        gentlemen of intelligence and character have announced, in a few instances,
                        and are preparing, in very many cases, to announce themselves candidates for
                        the inevitable Convention. Many gentlemen whose services will be greatly
                        needed are deterred, we learn, from becoming candidates, by a false sense of
                        delicacy and propriety. They say that it is not proper for any Virginian to
                        make himself a voluntary party to the monstrous violation of the
                        Constitution which the Sherman act and the supplement thereto involves.</p>
                    <p>In common with men whose opinions are entitled to a weight which ours do not,
                        of course, possess, we hold this to be a most dangerous and suicidal error
                        of judgement. It is a part and parcel of that dangerous apathy and inertness
                        which menaces us with the most alarming consequences. The acceptance of the
                        situation, to the extent of candidacy and the exercise of the right of
                        suffrage, we hold to be a duty as sacred and important as a defence of
                        family and fireside. Every leading and distinguished politician at the South
                        should labor to dispel the clouds of error which obscure the judgement of
                        our people. But as our people have, for six years, thought little and cared
                        less for their old party leaders, let them respect the sound judgement and
                        intelligence of those great soldiers whose fame misfortune has not disarmed.
                        Let them accept the examples of LEE, JOHNSTON, BEAUREGARD, HAMPTON and
                        LONGSTREET, as worthy of imitation, and exercise with harmony and energy and
                        earnestness every right which the conquerors have left us. Unless we do this
                        we shall be speedily reduced to the condition of serfs and Helots, not of
                        Spartans, but of the vilest and most demoralized renegades and enemies of
                        their own race and lineage. Away with all doubts and hesitancy about voting
                        and becoming candidates. The safety, not only of the State, but of our wives
                        and children, should make every voter follow the example and advice of
                        ROBERT E. LEE.</p>
                <br>

<b>"Want of Respect for Gen. Lee."</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper defends its use of General Lee's name as a supporter of a
                    Convention. Though he dislikes public notice, he is happy to use his influence
                    in such an emergency, the editors assert. They are willing to be tried and
                    condemned by fellow soldiers should anyone think them wrong.<br>

<b>Crime in the North</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This item publishes a list of the crimes reported in one issue of a New
                    York newspaper. They include assault, lynching, "divorces, seductions, rapes,
                    murders, forgeries." "Just imagine what a howl would be raised if a tenth of it

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The census of 1860 gives the whole population of Augusta at 27,764. Whites,
                        22,212; negroes, 5,552. Taking one-fifth of the number of whites as voters,
                        this gives 4,442 white voters, from which deduct about 100 for
                        disfranchised. Averaging the negro vote at the same it gives 1,110 negro
                        votes--making a total of 5,452 voters, or say 5,000, which gives the whites
                        3,000 clear majority; allowing that the negroes will vote against us in a
                        solid body, which we do not expect. Since the census, another has been taken
                        by the Freedmen's Bureau, which gives the negro population of the County at
                        4,700, a decrease of 852. These facts should impress upon the colored people
                        the utter folly of going against their best friends--the majority of our
                        people--and being led astray by designing white men. While it is sacredly
                        our duty to protect them in all their rights, it is none the less theirs to
                        co-operate with us in our efforts to save the State from ruin. Proper
                        efforts on the part of our intelligent white and colored people, will make
                        everything work towards one great end--the welfare and prosperity of all
                        classes.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Rev. J. L. M. Curry, of Alabama, better known as a member of the
                        Confederate Congress, lectured before the Young Men's Christian Association,
                        of Richmond, last week. We ask a careful perusal of the following synopsis
                        of his remarks, which we find in the Examiner, by all of our readers,
                        especially the young.</p>
                    <p>He spoke for about an hour in an eloquent, interesting and instructive vein,
                        giving the rising generation some wholesome advice, and showing great
                        research, extensive reading and careful thought. We do not propose to follow
                        him in his lecture, but merely to touch a few of its salient points. He
                        wished, above all, that the young men of the South should be gentlemen, and
                        in order to be such they must be good Christians; and he counseled them to
                        go to work energetically and labor unceasingly in order to build up the
                        commercial and material interests of the South. The country was not ruined.
                        It still contained all the elements of wealth; and by properly directed
                        industry, its immense resources could soon be developed. It was neither
                        slavery--the basis of a proud aristocracy--nor a rich soil, nor much
                        learning, nor a splendid government, that made a country great; but the
                        industry and energy of its people. There was nothing in this opposed to
                        aristocracy, for it was noble to work. He also cautioned them against
                        fostering a feeling of alienation towards any portion of the people of the
                        country, and told them not to flout the old flag, for it was our fathers'
                        flag and our's.</p>
                    <p>He was earnest in his appeals to the youth of the South to be steadfast to
                        their glorious traditions--to preserve the memory of their forefathers, and
                        to emulate their noble actions and greatness of character; but above all
                        they must labor diligently to build up the country, in order to insure its
                        future wealth, prosperity and happiness. As Christians, they would be
                        gentlemen, and enoble their manhood.</p>
