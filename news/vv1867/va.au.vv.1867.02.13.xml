                <summary>The Rockingham Register urges Thomas J. Michie of Augusta County to run for
                    Governor of Virginia. "While free from every personal vice, he possesses an
                    intellect of rare native powers, which has been cultivated and strengthened by a
                    course of study and an enlarged experience, surpassed by no other man in
                    Virginia. Decided in his convictions, conservative in his views of public
                    affairs, and comprehensive in learning, it would seem that he is really the man,
                    in these troubled times, who should be called to the helm of the State."</summary>

                    <p>Two plans are proposed for "selling out the South." We publish both. One is
                        by the Hon. Gov. Orr, of South Carolina, and the other by Mr. Thad. Stevens.
                        We see that Thaddeus has been defeated in his, and, if there is any manhood
                        left in the South, Mr. Orr's plan will be repudiated.</p>
                    <p>The people of Virginia, and the entire South, have their future in their own
                        hands, and, as far as we are concerned, we prefer Thad Stevens's bill to Mr.
                        Orr's. Mr. Stevens wishes to degrade us by force, by a power we can't resist
                        at present. Mr. Orr and his policy party, propose that we degrade ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The true policy is to reject both <emph rend="italic">and work</emph>. These
                        schemes for a so-called "reconstruction," may suit timid people, on both
                        sides of the line, but the <emph rend="italic">men</emph>, who "know their
                        rights" and maintained them during the war, will reject them. Let us <emph
                            rend="italic">work</emph> and elect men to every office.</p>
                    <p>If it was necessary, in speaking of the Situation, we would ask the people of
                        the Valley and the South, not to be excited over the rumors and big talk
                        that reaches them from Washington and the North. Gov. Orr and Mr. Stevens
                        may compromise, but "let the better spirits wait" and work, and our hopes
                        will be realized.</p>
                    <p>In the Va. House of Delegates, last Friday the Committee on Finance reported
                        against the propriety of submitting the question, of the abolition or
                        modification of the usury law to the people. The people ought to invite the
                        whole party to clear out and give place to men of good sense and business
                        qualifications.</p>
                    <p>A special Washington dispatch says, "a majority of the reconstruction
                        Committee have agreed upon a plan to settle all difficulties, and "the
                        leading Southern men in Washington have agreed to it." The question is who
                        are "the leading men"--Did they ever lead a charge?</p>

                <summary>The paper encourages Staunton's women to follow the "sweet Republican
                    simplicity" of Martha Washington. When a group of finely-dressed English ladies
                    called upon her, they found her knitting in a checkered apron with no sense of
                    embarrassment.</summary>

                <summary>The Corporation Court for Staunton met on February 6th, W. B. Keyser,
                    Recorder, presiding. Mayor Trout, and Messrs. Balthis and Hope were absent. The
                    following indictments were made by the Grand Jury: Craddock and Gallaher,
                    assault and battery; Cornelia Lewis, "colored," assault and battery; C. H.
                    Trayer et al against Sarah Craig, "colored," petit larceny. Albert J. Garber
                    presented commission as Excheator for the town of Staunton and was qualified.
                    The applications for redress against "enormous assessments for the year 1866"
                    were granted to E. L. Edmunson, John B. Engleman, Benjamin Crawford, and A. M.
                    Garber, Jr. The cases of C. H. Trayer, et al., Craddock and Gallaher, and
                    Cornelia Lewis were dismissed on payment of costs. Five cases were brought
                    against Paul Richter for selling malt liquor without a license; all were
                    dismissed. George Harland, the town jailor, was allowed his $17,75 account for
                    boarding prisoners. The Attorney for the Commonwealth entered a nolle prosequi
                    in nine cases against J. A. Chowpin for selling liquor without a license. The
                    case of Sarah Craig was dismissed. The court delivered a lot of silver spoons
                    and plated forks to the Rev. G. B. Taylor. They had been stolen from him. Stolen
                    towels were returned to W. H. Peyton.</summary>

                    assume a tangible shape, and the prospect is now more encouraging than at any
                    time since the assembling of the Legislature." A house member reported that the
                    Manassas Gap Railroad is willing to sell out the Orange and Alexandria if a road
                    is made up the Valley to Harrisonburg.</summary>
