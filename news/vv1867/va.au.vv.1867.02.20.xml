                <transcript>
                    <p>Throughout the entire South, both with whites and black, there are
                        wide-spread and unmistakable evidences of discontent. The feeling to which
                        we allude is not so much in reference to political question, says the
                        Richmond Times, though these may have stimulated and kept it alive; the
                        South feels no interest in, or excitement about politics. But the
                        discontent, to which we have adverted, arises out of the change in the
                        social and domestic relations of our people, consequent upon the volcanic
                        upheavals of the war, and the subsequent continuance of revolutionary
                        disturbances. Plunged suddenly into poverty, and compelled to grapple
                        unexpectedly with hardship; unable to command labor for agricultural
                        purposes, or capital for commercial enterprises, it is not strange that the
                        whites are restless and actuated by a desire to leave the scenes of blighted
                        prosperity and happiness, to seek success and fortune on fields that shall
                        not perpetually remind them of the calamities of the past.</p>
                    <p>It is nothing new for poverty, distress and misfortune to enforce a change of
                        locality, as a cure for bruised hearts and broken hopes; and the desire of
                        multitudes of the Southern people to emigrate to some other section,
                        indicates a belief that some change would be an improvement, no matter to
                        what quarter the wanderer may direct his step. As we have intimated, this
                        feeling is not confined to the whites. The black participate in it to an
                        equal, if not greater extent. They are moving towards Texas, towards the
                        Mississippi Valley, Florida, and even towards the bleak and inhospitable
                        North. In their case the discontent and the desire for change has been so
                        marked, and so pregnant with future ruin, that even their great prophet,
                        General Howard, has been attempting to dissuade them from leaving, by
                        speeches delivered at various points, characterized by no very great
                        ability.</p>
                    <p>The exodus of the blacks furnishes no sufficient reason for the whites to
                        follow their example; but on the contrary, supplies the latter with many
                        very sound arguments for remaining where they are. How can we expect to do
                        better elsewhere than here, particularly after the departure of the negroes
                        shall have invited an influx of white immigrants? That man is little less
                        than a simpleton who becomes a "rolling stone" at this juncture.</p>

                    blacks leave, and invite white immigrants to the South.</summary>

                    <p>A highly important case came up before the N. Y. Supreme Court on the 15th,
                        which will decide whether Pierpont is a Governor or not, and whether
                        Virginia is a State. One Olney was arrested on a requisition from Pierpont,
                        and he claims his release on grounds that Virginia is not a State. Olney was
                        arrested on the requisition of Governor Pierpont, charged with running off a
                        vessel under an attachment for debt. The proceedings are looked for with
                        great interest, as bringing vital questions squarely befor the Supreme Court
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Congressional proceedings are still "muddled," but we see no reason to be
                        alarmed yet. <emph rend="italic">Work and watch</emph>. The situation we are
                        in now cannot be described, but of one thing our people may be assured, if
                        they are only true to themselves and their past history; if they <emph
                            rend="italic">work, watch and wait</emph>, they can defy the radical
                        power, let it do its worst.</p>
                    <p>When we are "Territorialized," probably we will know it, but the "end is not
                        yet." Until some definite action is taken, we forbear comment, simply
                        warning our people to pay no attention to idle rumors; to recollect that the
                        best plan is always to "keep a stiff upper lip," and show they were "not
                        born in the woods to be scared by the owls," now assembled at Washington, no
                        matter how loud they may "screech."</p>
                    <p>We think we see some chance of the rebels getting their rights in Congress.
                        The Washington <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph>, of Thursday says that
                        on the preceding day, when the Executive appointments were considered in the
                        Senate, that body "made a general sweep of the entire West, rejecting
                        everybody who was engaged in suppressing the rebellion."--<emph

                <summary>This letter to the editor from "a Soldier" expresses the belief that in
                    endorsing John B. Baldwin, "the Valley's favorite son," the paper has overlooked
                    Gen. John D. Imboden, "another noble son of Augusta." The writer endorses him
                    for Lt. Governor. "It is needless to recount his valuable services to his
                    country, and particularly to his native Valley, when with a hand full of men, he
                    acted as a bulwark between the people in the peaceable pursuits of life, and
                    danger. Let us in the coming election cast our votes for men who fought and bled
                    for Virginia, and whom we trusted in 'times that tried men's souls,' and when
                    the waves of radicalism and fanaticism are rolling high and threatening to
                    engulph us, let us have true and tried men at the helm of State."</summary>

                    to withdraw the Freedman's Bureau from the South. The paper was informed by "one
                    of our most worthy and respected colored men." He argued "that even with the
                    best intentions on the part of its officers, it could only create trouble
                    between the whites and negroes, and that it was a useless expense. We could live
                    together and do better left alone."</summary>
