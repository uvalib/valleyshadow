<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On our first page we publish the able and exhaustive report, of Engineer
                        Randolph to President Garrett, of the Balt. &amp; Ohio Railroad, on the
                        surveys made for Great Valley Railroad--the productiveness of the
                        Valley--the importance of the road to Baltimore and the country, &amp;c.
                        This report must convince the most sceptical in Baltimore that it is
                        absolutely necessary to that city's continued prosperity that this road be
                        built. The consolidation of the O. &amp; A. and M. G. Railroads has been
                        completed and every thing is working properly for the furtherance of this
                        great work. The people of Augusta can aid the Valley Railroad, by a heavy
                        County subscription to build this great road to the Ohio: for it once
                        completed, the interests of Baltimore makes the Valley R. R. a certainty.</p>
                    <p>The contract has been signed, giving the Central Railroad the power, if our
                        people sustain it, to build the Covington &amp; Ohio Railroad. We have
                        seen a private letter, from President Fountaine, which shows that active
                        measures will be taken at once to complete this great work, and to use this
                        Iron Salvation for Virginia. To secure the rich fruition of our hopes; to
                        lift our impoverished State to the highest point of commercial and
                        manufacturing greatness, requires the aid of every man and every County on
                        the line. A public meeting will be held at next County Court, and the County
                        of Augusta will be asked to make a large County subscription to aid in the
                        great work. Here is the true road to freedom and wealth. Let every man do
                        his duty--give his mite--and a few years will see Radicalism, the Military,
                        and all such trammels upon the energies of a free people, removed.</p>
                    <p>The citizens of Augusta will meet, on next Monday for the purpose of
                        considering this most important subject. We are much gratified at the deep
                        interest already manifested by our people in this great work, and the
                        disposition to render it material aid. Some may think, that the road being
                        already completed through the county, we have no especial interest in its
                        extension to the Ohio River. The people of Augusta will derive greater
                        benefit from the completion of the road, than they have already realized
                        from its construction through the County. The charges on the Central
                        Railroad are now excessive, and cannot be reduced with its present amount of
                        business. The competition of the James River Canal and the Orange Road, for
                        the limited business of the district penetrated by these works; the corps of
                        officers and heavy expenses of repairs and transportation, which have to be
                        maintained, renders a high tariff of charges necessary. The charges can only
                        be reduced by an increase of business, which alone can be secured by tapping
                        the Valley of the Ohio.</p>
                    <p>The last annual report of the Virginia Central Railroad shows, that the
                        average charge for the transportation of tonnage is six and a half (6 1/2)
                        cents per ton per mile, and of passengers 4 1/6 cents per passenger mile.
                        These are about double the rates which prevail on Northern and Western roads
                        which have a full business. Estimating the tonnage, to and from Augusta, at
                        only 5,000 tons, carried a distance of 140 miles, at a charge of 6 cents per
                        ton per mile, and this would amount to $42,000. Suppose the travel paid
                        one-half of this sum or $21,000 this would make $63,000 paid by the County,
                        one half of which sum would be $31,500 saved annually to the County, by a
                        reduction of charges, which can alone be secured by the completion of the
                        road to the Ohio River.</p>
                    <p>Therefore Augusta, upon its present business, would save, at least, $50,000
                        per annum, by this reduction of charges. A reduction of fifty per cent in
                        the charges would, probably, much more than double the production of the
                        County, which would duplicate its wealth. The real wealth of the County, its
                        immense deposits of iron ore, is now undeveloped and will remain so, until
                        access is had to the coal fields of Kanawha. Complete the Chesapeake
                        &amp; Ohio Railroad, and the coal of Kanawha (unequaled by any in the U.
                        S. for the manufacture of iron,) can be delivered in Augusta at less than
                        five dollars per ton. We will then see iron furnaces dotting the Central
                        Railroad, along its entire length in the County, and instead of producing,
                        as now, 2,000 tons or less, worth $80,000, we may anticipate a production of
                        50,000 tons annually, worth $2,000,000. Rolling Mills and Foundries will
                        also spring into existence and work up the same iron into the various
                        fabrics for which it is adapted. It is safe to estimate that the wealth and
                        population of Augusta will be quadrupled by the full development of her
                        latent wealth.</p>
                    <p>Our people are among the most intelligent and enterprising in the State and
                        are, probably, better adapted than any other community of the State, to
                        engage successfully in the many new enterprises which will open up before
                        them. Our sons need not then go abroad, to find a suitable field in which to
                        employ their energies. There will be work, and more than enough, to employ
                        all at home.</p>
                    <p>Richmond and the Counties of West Virginia are now about to make a gallant
                        effort to secure the completion of this work, in which they are so vitally
                        interested. To do this, they must make large subscriptions, and also obtain
                        aid from other quarters. Richmond, with a taxable property of about
                        $25,000,000, proposes to subscribe $2,000,000, and the counties of West
                        Virginia, having about the same wealth, it is expected, will subscribe this
                        same amount. The counties of Henrico, Hanover, Louisa, Orange, Albemarle,
                        Rockbridge, Bath and Alleghany, through which this road passes, have,
                        probably a taxable property of forty millions of dollars. Can't each of them
                        subscribe to this stock? This is not a contribution from which no dividends
                        are to be expected. There is no question, that as soon as the work is
                        completed to the Ohio River, the dividends received by the Counties, will
                        not only pay the interest on the loans, which are made to pay for the stock,
                        but will, in a few years, pay the principle.</p>
                    <p>In order that our readers may form an estimate of the probable business that
                        will be done on the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. R., we give the results on

                    <p>In our last issue we asked our people "shall we live?" and dwell upon the
                        great questions the war had settled, forever, and our duties under the
                        changed circumstances in which we are placed, by the overwhelming and
                        crushing defeat our defence of a great idea, that of a free, Constitutional
                        Government, had met with. It strikes us that, having decided to live and be
                        a part of this great, stirring age, "how to live" and do our part, is the
                        question of the greatest moment before our people now. The war overthrew our
                        whole labor system and found us the poorest and most God-forsaken people on
                        earth. The lessons of the war, its privations; its sufferings; its hard
                        labor and enforced self-denial, taught us many things, and the wonderful
                        recuperation of the country is but an earnest of what can be done, if we, as
                        a people, continue to look matters squarely in the face and work out of our troubles. To do this, there are
                        many old prejudices to be thrown aside and many new ideas of life and its
                        duties adopted. In short, as we said before, "there is but one path of
                        safety--one road to wealth and power. Stand together--accept the conquering
                        idea, mould it to your purposes, use it and live."</p>
                    <p>"Use it and live!" Ah! there's the rub--the bitter pill the followers of a
                        "Lost Cause" must swallow, if they would live and prosper. In a short time
                        the tide of immigration will commence to pour its numbers into our country.
                        This immigration will bring with it new ideas and new modes of life. It will
                        require a system of free schools, and it will have it, (Right here, at once, we should perfect such a system and
                        control it.) This immigration will require small and well cultivated farms,
                        and it will have them. It will require a liberal system of internal
                        improvements, and they will come. To live, to retain any of our peculiar
                        characteristics as a people; to continue to impress the seal of our moral
                        and social natures upon this new South, we must conform our laws to our
                        changed condition, and control this new life that is to be forced upon us.
                        We must educate our children to labor--make them master-workmen in every
                        branch of business, in the mechanic arts as well as professions, if we would
                        have their superior intelligence play its destined part in the great working
                        future. And is it not better to do so, to cease useless repinings over lost
                        ideas, and bravely submit to the inevitable? We think so, hard as it is, and
                        we would be recreant to our duty did we not urge upon our people the
                        absolute necessity of "accepting the situation" and making the most of it.
                        We feel that we strike the key-note of the new Southern idea in what we say,
                        and our heart swells with pride as we see, in the mighty future, our loved
                        South rejuvenated, prouder, stronger, freer than of old--the pride, the
                        glory and the ruler of this Continent.</p>
