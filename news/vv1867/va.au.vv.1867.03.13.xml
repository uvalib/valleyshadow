                <summary>The Baltimore Gazette disagrees with the New York Time's admonition that
                    the South accept military reconstruction "lest a greater evil should befall
                    them." Instead, the Gazette councils complete passivity. "The fortitude that
                    meets oppression calmly, baffles and confounds the oppressor," and captures the
                    "sympathies of civilized nations."</summary>

                    <p>Since the South's rejection of the "Constitutional Amendment," says the
                        Richmond Times, there are those who deplore that it was not promptly
                        accepted. Undoubtedly our failure to ratify it has resulted in legislation
                        still more infamous; <emph rend="italic">but, as we were then left the
                            alternative of acceptance or rejection of the amendments, we could not
                            aid in a change of the organic law which disfranchised our best
                        men</emph>.</p>
                    <p>And, although much more infamous, cruel and flagitious legislation has ensued
                        as the bitter sequel to that rejection, <emph rend="italic">still the whole
                            dishonor, infamy and disgrace of what we are now required at the point
                            of a bayonet to perform, must forever rest at the door of our unfeeling
                            conquerors</emph>.</p>
                    <p>If, by reasons of brutal legislation, the United States, despite its
                        greatness, shall be hanged in chains by history alongside of England, Russia
                        and Turkey, we may be permitted to thank God that the brave and unhappy
                        Southern victims of these outrages will not share the load of dishonor which
                        will rest heavily upon the nation.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * * *</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">But such outrages as these do not disgrace and dishonor a
                            helpless people</emph>, of whose valor the world is still talking.</p>
                    <p>As the appropriate climax to all these outrages of 1865-66, we have now to
                        endure a measure of iniquity called "Sherman's Bill," which after it has
                        been passed "into a law" over the veto of the President, will be enforced in
                        Virginia by a Brigadier General and a sufficiency of soldiers to crush us
                        into obedience. <emph rend="italic">And as we have heretofore, when we have
                            had any option, preferred a military government, pure and simple, to
                            negro suffrage and representation, the Sherman amendment forces negro
                            suffrage upon us whether we call a Convention or refuse to call a
                            Convention, force the vile outrage upon us whether we stay out of the
                            Union or enter it under protest</emph>.</p>
                    <p>This invention of the Devil allows us that humane choice which pirates offer
                        to their prisoners. We are told <emph rend="italic">Gentlemen, take your
                            choice</emph>. Shall we shoot you through the head, or will you walk the
                        plank?" Whether you resolve to meet the emergency by preparations for
                        defence or passively submit to this insult, <emph rend="italic">the negro
                            shall vote at the elections in April and May next</emph>. And, whether
                        you go to the polls or stay at home, the elections must take place, and this
                        law shall be enforced to the letter. Convention or no Convention, the negro
                        votes. State or Territory, the negro votes. If you who are in the majority
                        refuse to go to the polls, the negro shall elect officials to rule over you.
                        If you muster in all your strength, the negro shall still vote. Taxes may be
                        avoided, but death negro suffrage cannot be escaped."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We publish two letters, from gentlemen of talent and respectability, on this
                        question, to-day. Both parties arrive at the same conclusion, from different
                        stand points; both are good and true men, and have proved themselves so on
                        many hard fought fields. The general idea of our people is to act when the
                        time comes for holding a Convention and to control it. There is some
                        difference about who should call it, but the vast majority are for action.
                        Mr. Wilson's amendment to the Force Bill settles this question for us, and
                        we should now turn our thoughts to the best means of carrying the elections.</p>
                    <p>It is no use to dodge the issue; negro suffrage is a fact and we must accept
                        it. We think that some of our most intelligent citizens should call the
                        negroes together and explain the question to them, and our most respectable
                        colored people think so too. By prompt action in every County and
                        neighborhood the colored vote can be thrown for our side; by "inaction" it
                        will go radical. It is a fight now for our local Governments, and no man has
                        a right to shirk so plain a duty. <emph rend="italic">Work</emph> and this
                        infernal scheme of the Radicals, for our ruin, may be turned into a weapon
                        to crush the most odious tyranny that ever disgraced a country once free.</p>
                    <p>Our experiences, in fighting the Yankees, should teach us that, in "union
                        there is strength," and if it was ever necessary for a people to have
                        concert of action, that <emph rend="italic">necessity</emph> exists now. It
                        was upon this principle we advocated the calling of a Convention by the
                        Legislature, where we could, by proper action, concentrate and use all the
                        available talent in the State. Divisions among our people, during the war,
                        destroyed the brightest promise LIBERTY has seen since the creation of the
                        world, and any dissensions among us <emph rend="italic">now</emph>, will be
                            <emph rend="italic">ruin to all, white and black</emph>. We must have no
                        such folly as conservative people exhibited in the Alexandria election. True
                        men must stand "shoulder to shoulder," and act as one.</p>
                    <p>Our people are gloomy and depressed. They see no "silver lining to the
                        cloud," but they should remember that after "winter quarters," (whose dreary
                        monotony only a soldier can realize,) comes the "spring campaign." The grass
                        will grow, the flowers bloom, the birds sing, and a kind Providence bless us
                        with "good crops" at the next "Harvest Home."</p>
                    <p>Never despond; devote every energy to recuperating our country; be
                        economical, and take every advantage you can of our and the country's
                        enemies. The world knows we are powerless, and no "dishonor" can be attached
                        to a disarmed people, with "bayonets at their breasts," for using every
                        means left them to defeat the hellish designs of their enemies. It is a good
                        rule, and one always followed by "Stonewall Jackson," to "do what your enemy
                        didn't want you to do." They don't want us to accept the "situation." Accept
                        it and <emph rend="italic">work</emph>, and the history of this world has
                        been badly written, if we, the Southern people, do not realize our most
                        sanguine hopes.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Dear Virginian</emph>:--In these great and momentous
                        times, when the voice of the Statesman is no longer heard upon the hustings,
                        counselling and advising the people, a free and independent press is to be
                        valued more than ever. Indeed an open and manly course now by the press is
                        what we want.</p>
                    <p>And we find that regardless of public clamor you have spoken, with the voice
                        of thunder, in favor of a State Convention. There has been no cringing, no
                        waiting for the development of popular opinion, but untrammeled and like a
                        free born American citizen, you have uttered the honest convictions of your
                        heart. You have spoken too, the voice of a soldier, one which finds an echo
                        in the hearts of nine-tenths of the soldiers who served their native South
                        in the day and hour of trial, <emph rend="italic">in the field</emph>.</p>
                    <p>They are fully aroused to the importance of the hour; they feel that the
                        crisis is upon us; that the angry waves of radicalism and the billows of
                        malignant hatred are rolling high, about to engulph us. That Virginia with
                        all her prestige and renown has been reduced to a Military District--the
                        home of Washington, Jefferson and Madison is to be made a patrol ground for
                        armed soldiery. The mighty thunder of Northern wrath and scorn is heard, and
                        the hail of hatred is about to descend. Shall we lie supinely upon our backs
                        and fold our arms in unconcern until the storm bursts upon us in all its
                        fury? No! we will <emph rend="italic">act</emph>. We met the enemy in deadly
                        conflict for four long years, battling for the cause of justice and right;
                        but our armies, after displaying Spartan valor and courage, overpowered and
                        overwhelmed by numbers, one by one succumbed to the Military power of the
                        United States, and with sad and depressed hearts we returned to our homes
                        and the bosom of our families, with the heart-rending tale. The cause was
                        lost, and now as a <emph rend="italic">conquered</emph> people, we are <emph
                            rend="italic">required</emph> and <emph rend="italic">compelled</emph>
                        to comply with the mandates and edicts of our conquerors.</p>
                    <p>We all took the Amnesty oath and the oath to support the Constitution of the
                        United States after the surrender, because we were <emph rend="italic"
                            >compelled</emph> to do so--now we are <emph rend="italic"
                        >compelled</emph> to obey the requirements of the Sherman-Shellebarger bill.
                        If we do not accept it, we will be made to drink of the still bitterer cup
                        of confiscation. But, if <emph rend="italic">we</emph> call a Convention,
                        frame a Constitution, conformable to the provisions of the Sherman bill, we
                        will be admitted into the Union, (they say we have been out,) entitled to
                        representation in Congress, and thereby place ourselves in a position to
                        exert some power--<emph rend="italic">now</emph> we have <emph rend="italic"
                            >none</emph>, but are at the mere beck and call of the most relentless
                        foe, that ever disgraced the name of humanity and civilization. We will
                        thwart the designs of the low, groveling spirits among us who term
                        themselves "loyal" men, who with the assistance of the negroes would call a
                        Convention and thereby force upon us laws, as odious as their evil, corrupt
                        and hellish minds could conceive.</p>
                    <p>But "lost honor" seems to rise before the visions of some of the leige lords
                        of creation, when you talk to them upon the subject of a Convention. They
                        say "let us lose all, rather than honor." And who are these "honor"
                        gentlemen? Let us examine their credentials.</p>
                    <p>Credential No. 1, (1861.)--Secession feeling rampant. Everybody urged to join
                        the army, but the "honor" gentlemen "stand off."</p>
                    <p>Credential No. 2, (1863.)--Confederate cause dark. "More men" called for.
                        "Honor" gentlemen get old very rapidly. Hearty and robust yesterday; sickly
                        and delicate to-day. <emph rend="italic">Heart disease</emph> is very
                        prevalent among the "H. G's." and soft places are sought with great
                        eagerness.</p>
                    <p>Credential No. 3, (1864.)--Cause still darker. Many details applied for. "H.
                        G's.," of the Medical fraternity, consider their services necessary at home.
                        Money coming in fast. Soldier's families charged $1,000 per barrel for
                        flour.</p>

                    <p>Here then, Dear "Virginian," are the credentials of these "honor" gentlemen,
                        and with this record they oppose a Convention!</p>
                    <p>Honor indeed! It was all absorbed in gout, rheumatism, disease of the heart,
                        &amp;c., or else a desire to attend to the wants of the "dear" people at
                            <emph rend="italic">home</emph> during the war. But soldiers understand
                        all these things, and they feel that this cry of "honor" comes with bad
                        grace indeed from these gentlemen, with such a budget of credentials; from
                        men who urged the secession of the State, and yet never shouldered a musket
                        during the long and bloody war, but remained at home around warm
                        hearthstones, during the cold and bitter blasts of winter, and cooled
                        themselves beneath the shades of Mountain fastnesses and retreats from the
                        scorching rays of the summer's Sun.</p>

                        degenerate sons of your Mother State. The soldiers who faced the enemy and
                        shed their blood, look upon you with scorn and derision. The ashes of the
                        noble and heroic dead command Silence! Silence!!</p>
                    <p>Let us reflect for a moment. Where are those great nations; those mighty
                        monuments of human skill, of human ingenuity, of human ambition which arose
                        in such majesty on the face of the earth, and have rendered antiquity so
                        venerable? They once stood forth in such grandeur and magnificence, that we
                        might suppose time would have lingered long and been loath to apply the
                        finger of decay. They have faded and perished. And why? We reply that the
                        causes are to be traced for the most part, to those elements in the human
                        character which are at war with all that is truly great and noble. Ambition
                        and selfishness, with their kindred spirits, on whose altars nations have
                        been cruelly sacrificed, were their great enemies--their real murderers.</p>
                    <p>And as it was with Corinth, Athens and Rome, so it was with the Southern
                        Confederacy. Whilst around her clustered the hearts of the masses of her
                        people, and in her soldiery were combined all, that makes up an army of
                        valor and heroism, yet demagogueism and selfishness were the rocks upon
                        which she was wrecked. She is gone--glimmering like a school boy's tale, the
                        wonder of an hour." We mourn over her downfall, but we have consciousness of
                        having done our duty, and, whilst we expect to hate a yankee as long as time
                        lasts, and to teach our posterity that of all odious titles, that of
                        "yankee" must be the most odious, and glorying in the reflection of having
                        been a soldier in the "Lost Cause," yet the "H. G's.," or those who failed
                        to do their duty, after urging the war, will be looked upon with
                        contempt--derided and scorned.</p>
                    <p>"Till wrapt in flames the realms of ether glow,<lb/> And Heaven's last
                        thunder shakes the world below."</p>

                    <p>The Charlottesville Chronicle talks sensibly in the following article, and
                        comes straight to the point. Have we learned nothing from the events of the
                        past six years? Are we still in doubt as to the character of the men and the
                        party who are directing the present revolution? Have we forgotten West
                        Virginia, and Missouri, and Tennessee, and Maryland? and the passage of the
                        Louisiana bill by a two-thirds vote in the late House of Representatives,
                        and the approval given to that measure by Wm. Cullen Bryant and Horace
                        Greeley, two of the most humane philosophers at the North? That bill was
                        generally endorsed by the entire Republican press of the North. Do we not
                        know that those people are as cold and as hard as the flint--and that they
                        will put their foot upon six millions of a noble race with as little
                        reflection as a man in his morning walk will tread on a nest of ants?</p>
                    <p>Have they not already <emph rend="italic">done the deed?</emph> Have they not
                        in one moment emancipated three millions of slaves, many of whom know not
                        their right hand from their left? And have they not in another moment, by a
                        parliamentary edict, conferred on this race with no qualification of
                        intelligence or property, without requiring even the payment of taxes,
                        universal suffrage?</p>
                    <p>But we are to lean on the Supreme Court! As if the people of La Vendee had
                        appealed to the civil tribunals against the National Convention; as if the
                        old blind king of Hanover should appeal to the Prussian Courts to give him
                        back his crown. The position of Congress is that reconstruction is a
                        political, and not a legal question--and the courts have nothing to do with
                        it--that it is an extra-constitutional question; and whether their view be
                        sound or unsound, they will act on it.</p>
                    <p>Will the President help us? Can we live on his veto messages?</p>
                    <p>Will the Northern Democracy help us? They make capital exhortations <emph
                            rend="italic">to other people</emph> to fight; and when whipped to <emph
                            rend="italic">endure</emph>;</p>
                    <p>But <emph rend="italic">honor</emph> is involved: a brave Southern soldier is
                        captured after a desperate fight and carried in chains to Point Lookout; it
                        is the depth of winter, and the prisoner is sick and weary: he is shown to
                        his quarters: an apartment with two beds, one in one corner for a negro, the
                        other in another corner for him. He shudders; but must <emph rend="italic"
                            >honor</emph> make him lie out in the cold? The sentinel gives him his
                        choice--with an intimation that if he makes much difficulty, the negro may
                        be put <emph rend="italic">to sleep with him</emph>. Who is dishonored
                        here--the soldier who takes what is offered him--or the prison authorities
                        who force this? If you are given the alternative of being hung or shot--is
                        there any dishonor in making a choice?</p>
                    <p>We think the Southern people have done enough in the way of <emph
                            rend="italic">honor</emph>: it is time now to get bread to eat, and
                        shelter, and rest.</p>
                    <p>But to return: is there any hope that this radical wave will ever ebb, as did
                        the French Revolution in a sense? will not the country come to its senses
                        after a while? Perhaps so, and then--<emph rend="italic">if we are not
                            ruined in the mean time</emph>--we can correct anything that has gone
                        wrong. We certainly make nothing by making ourselves more uncomfortable in
                        the interval. Losing our property and having the State governed by Fred.
                        Douglass will not put us in a better position for welcoming the incoming of
                        that happy day.</p>
                    <p>The trouble of our people is that they cannot accept the inevitable. If negro
                        suffrage is <emph rend="italic">a determined fact</emph>, why struggle
                        against the fiat of God? When the pitcher is broken at the fountain, why
                        protract one's tears? Is there not a silver lining to the blackest cloud?
                            <emph rend="italic">May</emph> it not be that we do not take in the
                        whole of this business? May it not be that there is a blessing hid in all
                        these thunders? May it not be that our colored friends will continue to be
                        our friends, and that thousands of them will seek the assistance of their
                        "old masters" in throwing their votes? May it not be that the whites here
                        will control the colored vote without serious difficulty? And in Virginia
                        have we not nearly two hundred thousand more whites than blacks? And will
                        not the white population be a constantly increasing, and the blacks a
                        constantly decreasing number? Will there not in a few years be three our
                        four millions of whites in Virginia--the blacks proportionally diminished?
                        Above all, may not God be working in this matter, we know not how, to evolve
                        a result that will be gratifying when the work is complete?</p>
                    <p>One thing is certain, He has a hand in all that is going on. <emph
                            rend="italic">And</emph> if we do our <emph rend="italic">duty</emph>,
                        there is a prosperous future for us in the womb of these events that is
                        bound to come to the birth. We understand that some persons have had their
                        faith weakened in God, because we lost the Southern Confederacy. Their faith
                        was small: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p>

                        <emph rend="italic">Messrs. Editors:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>The crisis is upon us, and we must meet it like men. It is vain to think of
                        propitiating the party which now controls the Legislation of the country. It
                        is as intent upon keeping open the breach as it first was in driving us out
                        of the Union. This is the whole scope of its measures. It demands of us
                        impossibilities. It requires everything, while it promises nothing. Should
                        we yield, we confess a guilt, we disown, discard every plea of right and
                        justice in our bloody struggle, and bow our necks as criminals to its mercy.
                        Shall we do it? No--no--our manhood forbids it--conscience forbids
                        it--justice to our martyred dead forbids it. We were driven into the
                        conflict reluctantly in defence of great principles, and although
                        overpowered, come what may, we can still sustain our self-respect and
                        personal honor. What could be a greater calamity to us than the death of the
                        State? Yet this is the condition required of us.</p>
                    <p>And to what end is the sacrifice to be made? What evils are we to escape by
                        it? None are promised, and none are to be expected. Other measures of
                        oppression even now are in process of preparation. Then let us bear as we
                        may, calmly and patiently, the wrongs which we have not power to avert, and
                        look to Providence for our final deliverance. We shall thus at least
                        preserve our honor and escape contempt. We should remember, moreover, that
                        gloomy as our present condition is, it is not altogether without hope.</p>
                    <p>"Man's extremity is God's opportunity." The whole trouble is the work of a
                        factious, usurping majority in Congress, who trample under foot the
                        Constitution, and openly avow their purpose to clear the way of all
                        obstructions, Executive or Judicial, which may hinder their designs. <emph
                            rend="italic">This is Revolution</emph>, and must be arrested, sooner or
                        later, or the liberties of the whole country will be lost. Then why should
                        we despair? The battle is not ours alone. The citadel of American freedom is
                        attacked. Every citizen of the Republic is interested in the issue, and if
                        the spirit of liberty has not become extinct, ere long we shall hear the
                        thunders of popular indignation coming up from every part of the land, which
                        are to sweep the usurpers from their places, and herald our deliverance.</p>
                    <p>The whole world knows that Reconstruction was an accomplished fact under the
                        liberal policy of President Johnson. Nothing was wanting but the admission
                        of our Representatives to their seats in Congress. But here the Radicals
                        check-mated them. A restored Union was not what they wanted. It is the
                        retention of Power which they fear may be lost by the admission of the
                        Southern States. Here is the whole secret. They don't want us in the Union,
                        and never will, under any circumstances, admit us, as long as they can
                        prevent it.</p>
                    <p>There is one thing, Messrs. Editors, that I think we could do, and ought to
                        do now--as to all else, perhaps inaction would be our best action. And that
                        is hold County meetings and appoint Delegates to a State Convention for the
                        single purpose of preparing an Address to the People of the United States,
                        setting forth our true feelings and the condition of things amongst us, with
                        such other matter as they may see proper. The gross aspersions which are
                        cast upon us, and assumed by the Radicals as <emph rend="italic">the
                            necessity</emph> for their oppressions, ought to be met. We know them to
                        be false, and it is due to ourselves and to the country that we should show
                        them to be so. "Every where (as President Johnson justly remarks,) there is
                        a tendency to substitute "the <emph rend="italic">Government</emph>" as the
                        source of Power instead of the "<emph rend="italic">People</emph>," and it
                        is against this tendency that the measure I here propose is addressed.</p>

                <summary>This editorial argues that divisions between conservative white Southerners
                    in an Alexandria election serve as a warning to the entire white South to avoid
                    disagreement; instead, all should maintain a unified approach to politics. "The
                    commitment of the destinies of these States into the hands of hundred of
                    thousands of ignorant, depraved blacks, utterly incapable of comprehending a
                    political principle, without any training, and devoid of any qualification," is
                    an emergency that must be met by the white South. "Those who framed the villainy
                    desired to see repeated here the horrors of Hayti. It would delight the heart of
                    Republican leaders to see every Southern city in flames, and every hearth
                    desolate; every Southern parent and every Southern child starving, and the
                    entire population given over to the unbridled rage and passions of a drunken
                    mob."</summary>
