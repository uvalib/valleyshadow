<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our issue of August 8th, 1866, we talked to the colored people as follows,
                        for which we were called "foolish" by some of the "over wise." Now that
                        suffrage has been given the colored people, we repeat the advice given them,
                        and again urge upon all classes the necessity of harmony, in order to defeat
                        the devilish schemes of the radicals for our destruction. And most earnestly
                        do we appeal to the intelligent whites to allow no foolish prejudice to keep
                        them from impressing the truths given below, upon the colored people.</p>
                    <p>In a few words we will try to state the case to the colored people. You are
                        here, a part of the great body of the Southern society, and you have several
                        questions to ask yourselves. 1st. Who are you and how did you get here? 2d.
                        Who brought you here and sold you, and who has taken care of you since? 3d.
                        What is your true policy for the future? In answer to the first question you
                        know you are black, a negro, and that your forefathers were brought by force
                        from Africa, a land of darkness and barbarism. To the 2d, we can answer that
                        the immaculate and freedom loving Yankees, of New England, kidnapped you and
                        brought you here, sold you to Southern men, and then set up a howl about the
                        "brutality of Southern slavery," after these same Southern States forced
                        them to abolish the "slave trade" in 1808, sorely against their will--for it
                        was very profitable. These Southern people took your forefathers, ignorant
                        and naked, and by their kindness, patience, judgement and love for you,
                        brought you to your present state of civilization, which no other portion of
                        your race has reached. In return you gave them your labor, and that you
                        loved them was shown by your noble conduct during the war. Circumstances
                        beyond your control freed you from the restraints heretofore put upon you,
                        and an all-wise Providence allowed this same Yankee, who sold you into
                        slavery, to free you--not for the love of you, but to
                            gratify his infernal hatred to the Southern whites--your friends.</p>
                    <p>Such is the true state of the case? you have accepted the freedom forced upon
                        you by Radical Yankee hatred of Southern men and no one blamed you for it,
                        any more than they would blame a school boy for taking holiday, when the
                        teacher is "barred out." And what are you to do? Ah! there's the rub--your
                        dispositions and education prompt you to do right; prompt you to cultivate
                        friendly feelings with your best friends, our people, but foolish people
                        among us, and designing Yankees, tell you to carry out the same spite a
                        Radical Yankee will always have. They urge you to believe that we are no
                        longer friends and they are--and the promptings of vanity make some of you
                        agree with these poor creatures--Now look matters square in the face. You
                        are here forever unless you die out like the Indians, as the Yankees
                        predict. How to do your part for society is the question. It is to trust
                        your white people; to be prompt and energetic; to comply with all contracts;
                        to work and study, and make up your minds that only by hard work and by
                        trusting to the kind and affectionate feelings of those who raised you, can
                        you exist on this Continent. Do this; show yourselves worthy of the position
                        you are placed in, as you heretofore showed you could be trusted and your
                        future is clear before you--always recollecting the great fact, the position
                        of the honored dead and respected of your class exemplifies, that "you must
                        respect yourselves to be respected." Listen not to fools or worse, who tell
                        you about social "equality" and all that, for that's your ruin and
                        extermination. Be honest, be faithful; make yourselves necessary to the community and the devilish schemes of the
                        Radical Yankee to ruin the Country, through you, will be thwarted and your
                        race saved.</p>

                        African Church pow-wow, at whose request we publish the subjoined preamble
                        and resolutions which were offered by him in that body and were unanimously
                        and contemptuously voted "under the table." Mr. H., who seems to be sensible

                        and designing (white) men for their own selfish ends. He will take care, in
                        the future, not to be caught in any such company. The following is the paper

                        State to the faith of our fathers, while differing with the advocates of
                        secession from the commencement of the political strife to the present time,
                        yet we recognize them as friends and fellow citizens of a common country;
                        and as all classes should work harmoniously together for the purpose of
                        building up our dilapidated country and perpetuating the interest of our
                        beloved State, we hereby ask the Congress of the United States, in the name
                        of the loyal citizens of Virginia, and in behalf of our misguided friends,
