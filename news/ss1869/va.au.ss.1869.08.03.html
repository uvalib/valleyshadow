<b>For the Spectator</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Orpha Swink writes to the Spectator about the harm caused by alcohol. She
                    expects that God will soon take his vengeance upon the State that supports the
                    sale of alcohol, and asks those in authority to stop the trade.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR: -- I wish to say a little through the columns of your excellent
                        paper (of which I lately had the perusal) on the subject of Temperance, and
                        first I will tell you that I am a woman -- not a ranting "woman's rights"
                        woman -- not a strong-minded woman, contending for a seat in the
                        Legislature, but a woman with a woman's heart that can feel for the
                        distress, the anguish of others -- that can appreciate the scanty wardrobe
                        and desolate, comfortless home, made so by the cups of a drunken husband. A
                        heart, also, that can loathe, and despise the traffic, and were it not for
                        the love of Jesus, the men who carry on this traffic for the promotion of
                        such things as these. Neither am I a literary character, and it is only the
                        great weight that this subject has upon my mind, that now impels me to write
                        that I may possibly say something that may lead some one who has the power
                        to do something that will annihilate the Dram-shop, and all its concomitants
                        from our land.</p>
                    <p>When I see men of wealth renting their houses for this business, and giving
                        them favorable notice -- when I see the dram-seller, putting bread into the
                        mouths of his family by taking it from those of his neighbor -- when I see
                        him garnishing his own home by desolating the homes of others -- when I see
                        a dozen men enter this dram-shop on the Sabbath day -- when I see the blood
                        relative holding literally the bottle to his brother's lips -- when I see
                        the blear-eyed and bloated-faced wretch, stretched with shabby garments,
                        bare-footed, and bare-legged, upon a rude bench, forgetful of everything but
                        the fatal glass, whiling away the precious golden hours that ought to be
                        bringing food, clothing, and happiness to his family -- when I see his
                        pale-faced wife turn sadly from the door of her miserable home, whither she
                        has so frequently gone to look for the form of which she was once justly
                        proud but which she now is so often forced to meet with sickening horror. He
                        is not coming, and as she turns again to her plain duties and her children,
                        she lifts her eyes once more heavenward, and exclaims with the dying
                        crucified One, while the last drop of life-blood seems to be ebbing from her
                        crushed and withered heart -- "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me."
                        When I see all this, it seems to me that were I to hold my peace, the very
                        stones would cry out.</p>
                    <p>The worst of all is, that these things are either disregarded entirely, or
                        treated lightly, by those in authority. They have failed to plead the cause
                        of the widow and the afflicted. To them we look for light, but behold
                        obscurity -- for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</p>
                    <p>Shall this continue? Something in my inmost soul seems to tell me it shall not. It seems to me God will not bear much
                        longer with the proud nation, whose land is indeed a land of milk and honey,
                        of countless mercies and luxuries. We have called the God of Heaven our God,
                        a being of infinite Purity and Justice. Can we be a pure people when such
                        impurity is practiced by us? Can we be a just people while we thus tempt our
                        fellow men by making and selling that which will ruin both his soul and his
                        body? Will not this great God, whom we have thus mocked avenge his own
                        elect, who cry unto him day and night? and if we do not as a people cease
                        from this sin, have we not reason to expect, that by reason of the prayers,
                        groans, cries and tears of those afflicted by it, God will come and will not
                        keep silent, that a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very
                        tempestuous about him. -- He may come suddenly and smite the earth with a
                        curse. Then may not even my feeble voice be heard calling for judgment and
                        pleading for truth? May I not plead with those whom we have been proud to
                        call our rulers, and to whom by a vote of the people we have given the Power (mighty word for good or for evil) to turn
                        back this rapid tide of iniquity.</p>
                    <p>Oh, may we not hope that the time will soon come when the nets for the feet
                        of the youthful and unwary will be broken and made to cease their dark
                        doings. Then shall many, very many, both old and young, both rich and poor,
                        rise up to call you blessed.</p>

                    <p>Messrs. Editors: -- As my ministerial labors as
                        pastor of the First African Baptist Church here, will close before the issue
                        of the first number of your paper in August, and I, in all probability,
                        already under instruction in the missionary school of the Baptist
                        denomination. I beg leave now to say, through your precious columns, I never
                        parted with a community, without regard to color, with so much reluctance in
                        my life. The countenance uniformly shown me by the whites, and the valuable
                        instructions I have received from many members of the legal profession,
                        together with the support I have received from my own color, lay me under
                        obligations of lasting gratitude, and whatever may be my destiny in the
                        future, whether favorable or unfavorable, I shall, with however much
                        humbleness, humility and meekness, ever bear the sweetest recollection of
                        the thousand kindnesses shown me by all.</p>
                    <p>May the Lord, in his tender mercies, bless all, old and young, composing the
                        entire community, is and shall ever be, my sincere prayer. HENRY DICKINSON,</p>
                    <p>Pastor First Baptist Church, Staunton.</p>
