<b>Wells, Chandler and Jenkins</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Ridiculed a recent Radical meeting held in Staunton, claiming that all the
                    speakers managed to do was rally Virginians behind the Conservative banner.
                    Called all Conservative men to action in defeating the Radicals in the upcoming
                    election.<br>(Names in announcement: Maj. John A. Harman)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday last, the Court House was filled with whites and blacks from half
                        past 11 o'clock till 4 o'clock listening to Radical speeches delivered by
                        H.H. Wells, (Governor so-called) L. H. Chandler of Norfolk, and Jno. W.
                        Jenkins of Winchester. The gallery was filled with blacks and the body of
                        the Court House with whites who listened patiently to the harangues of these
                        speakers till near the close of the meeting when Jenkins insulted the white
                        race, and particularly the soldiers of the Federal army, by asserting that
                        treason was unconquerable till the "cloud of blacks was hurled against the
                        ramparts of treason when they fill," at which time many whites
                        left the house.</p>
                    <p>Each of these speakers was severally introduced by Maj. Jno. A. Harman, who
                        has strangely connected himself with the extremest and vilest
                        wing of the Radical party. If conscious of the part now acted by his chief
                        quartermaster, how deeply must be grieved the sainted spirit of Gen.
                        Stonewall Jackson!</p>
                    <p>We took notes on the speeches made, but consider that it would be a waste of
                        space to publish reports of them in our columns, which should be devoted to
                        better matter.</p>
                    <p>If the effect instead of the motives constituted the merit of actions, we
                        would thank these gentlemen (?) for delivering the speeches they did for we
                        believe, that they have rendered valuable service to the Conservatives of
                        the county--that though they came as enemies they served us as friends--that
                        out of intended evil, good will result--for they did for us that which was
                        most needed, to wit: Arouse our people from lethargy and supineness.</p>
                    <p>Like careless sentinels, they were sleeping upon their posts, not even
                        dreaming of danger; but the harsh notes of the brazen trumpets of the enemy, sounded in their midst, have not only
                        awakened, but aroused them to a proper
                        appreciation of the imminent perils of the situation and now the whole camp
                        is in commotion, and each and every one is buckling on his armor and getting
                        ready to fall into line and fight the good fight of patriotism, and to stand
                        boldly and unflinchingly upon the perilous edge of battle as soon as the
                        conflict shall be joined on the 6th day of July next.</p>
                    <p>The watchword is now "ACTION." From this time to the day of election there
                        will be no more sleep--for, as Macbeth said, sleep has been murdered.
                        Figuratively speaking, no true friend of the State and the rights of the
                        people will give sleep to his eyes or slumber to his eyelids from this time
                        till the close of the polls on the day of election. That day will mark an
                        important epoch in the history of our beloved Old Commonwealth--from it will
                        date the period of her salvation, or sad decline and fall into ruin
                        inconceivable and irretrievable. It will be a day which will be remembered
                        with joy or with sorrow. Woe, woe, to the citizen who shall fail to do his
                        duty on that day. History will impale him, his children reproach him, and
                        posterity curse him. Woe unto him!</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor commented on how few white people in Augusta could vote or serve
                    on juries if the Underwood Constitution was passed intact.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If the Underwood Constitution is adopted with all the disfranchisements and
                        test oaths, there will not be one hundred white voters in Augusta. And there
                        will not be one hundred white men in Augusta who would be competent jurors.</p>
                    <p>Do you ask, how is this? We answer no man can vote, or serve on a jury, or be
                        elected to any office who cannot take the iron-clad oath.</p>
                    <p>Look at the oath! No man who gave any aid or comfort to the Confederate
                        soldiers during the war can take it honestly. No father that gave his son a
                        horse or a blanket--no little brother who contributed to fill a box to be
                        sent to his elder brother in the army, can take it!</p>
                    <p>They are all denied the privilege of voting or serving on juries. What sort
                        of elections and what sort of juries would we have under such a system. What

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Scared readers with visions of a corrupt Radical regime for four years,
                    with blacks holding all key positions over whites while passing high taxes.
                    Supposedly, the only way to avoid this was to register and vote for Conservative
                    men for the Legislature and Governor. If that happened, it didn't matter what

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Four more years of Governor Wells, with a legislature of the same complexion,
                        says the Enquirer and Examiner, would be
                        positively despair. We do not see how our poor
                        people could bear it. And if the returns shall come in unfavorably from the
                        election on the 6th of next month, we really do not know what is to become
                        of us.</p>
                    <p>Think of the Underwood constitution (expurgated) administered by that crew of
                        hungry carpet-baggers and the negroes for four years. The first step would
                        be to give us in its most rigorous form the County Organization article. Its
                        details would be prepared in the spirit in which the outline was conceived.
                        In our heavy negro counties we should have immediately a swarm of negro
                        officers. Negro constables and policemen would come down with their official
                        batons on the white race. Negro magistrates would try their late masters for
                        imaginary offences. Negro assessors would get your property list; and negro
                        supervisors would rate it for taxation; and negro collectors (this is one of
                        the new county offices) would collect the taxes. You will pay over to the
                        negro collector the few greasy greenbacks you have left--you will not have
                        many--times will be hard, far harder than any you have seen yet. Whether he
                        will apply your taxes to build school-houses for his children, and a
                        poor-house for himself we leave to conjecture. His official bond will be
                        like that of the sheriff referred to by Mr. Wallach, candidate for Congress
                        in the 7th district, the other day--who collected about $90,000 of taxes
                        &amp;c., and whose securities paid about 93 cents taxes.</p>
                    <p>The next provision of the constitution to be carried into execution will be
                        the Education Article, under which you will be taxed about $3,000,000
                        probably to educate your children and theirs. You will have a nice little
                        school house about a mile from your house (if you have a house at that time,)and there will be some of those
                        colored gentlemen whom you will know as the School Trustees, who will
                        appoint a teacher--a hungry-looking fellow from Connecticut who talks
                        through his nose and says dooty or perhaps an
                        educated colored gentleman. This functionary will whip your children. Perhaps the colored Legislature will by virtue of
                        the authority delegated to it by the constitution, provide for mixed
                        schools, and your boys and girls will go to school with the black children
                        of the neighborhood, and bump their heads against theirs on the same
                        form.--This is the law under the reformed state of things in Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>Then they will have to see at once about the Militia. You know Brownlow could
                        not keep the Tennesseans straight until he got his loyal militia. It has
                        been suggested that Lindsay will be commissioned to run this part of the
                        machine.</p>
                    <p>They will then enforce by "appropriate legislation" the clause of the bill of
                        rights which provides that "all citizens of the State are declared to
                        possess equal civil and political rights and public privileges," and when
                        you go to the Circus, the crowd will be mixed.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature will then proceed to lodge the judicial power of the State in
                        the hands of men like Underwood and Bond and Chandler. They will elect all
                        the county judges (for each county is to have a judge,) all the circuit
                        judges, and the judges of the court of appeals. They will also have the
                        Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Auditor, the Treasurer, the Board of
                        Public Works, and the Board of Education.</p>
                    <p>In 1871, they will re-apportion the State for the Legislature, and
                        consolidate their power for ten years longer.</p>
                    <p>You will be arrested by a negro sheriff on the
                        complaint of a negro, committed on negro evidence by a negro justice,
                        convicted by a negro jury, and lodged in the penitentiary under a negro
                        jailor, and not be pardoned by Governor Wells or
                        Governor Harris.</p>
                    <p>As your schools will be managed by negro trustees, your roads will be kept in
                        order by negro overseers, and your poor houses will be governed by a negro
                        board--you footing the bills.</p>
                    <p>Your University, your Military Institute, your Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb
                        and the Blind, your Lunatic Asylum, will be destroyed, or kept up for the
                        benefit of the blacks at your expense. The colleges of the State generally
                        will probably be closed under the clause about "equal public privileges."</p>
                    <p>You will have all this in a few months, if you permit the negroes to elect
                        Wells and carry the Legislature. By registering and voting you can avert all
                        except the expurgated constitution. Securing the Governor and the
                        Legislature, you secure the Judiciary, the Board of Public Works and the
                        Board of Education. You control the militia, the school system the county
                        organization, the whole field of State taxation, and can regulate the
                        selection of jurors. You elect two United States Senators; you reapportion
                        the districts for the Legislature; you hold the veto power and the pardoning
                        power. In other words, you administer the
                        Constitution. "Let me make the songs of a nation," some one has said,
                        "and I don't care who makes the laws." With more truth it may be said, "Let
                        me make the laws of a State, and I don't care who makes the Constitution."
                        The power of a legislative body is illustrated by Congress; what does the
                        Constitution amount to? It has no vigor.</p>

                        influence the conduct of true Virginians. We appeal to your sense of right
                        and justice--justice towards your fellow citizens, who will be involved with
                        you in the same common ruin. If you are willing, for the sake of
                        consistency, or principle, or anything else to dare this ruin for
                        yourselves, is it right, is it just to invoke it also upon others without
                        their consent, and contrary to their wishes?</p>
                    <p>On the question of the adoption of the expurgated constitution the
                        Conservative voters of Virginia are divided. Many will vote for it.
                        Therefore we think it most likely that we shall be "reconstructed into the
                        Union" under the Underwood Constitution, and we shall elect a Governor and a
                        Legislature on the 6th day of July. Is there not here a field of action for all? We have so often contrasted the
                        opposing candidates, Walker and Wells, and we are so thoroughly convinced
                        ourselves that it seems to us almost incomprehensible that any patriotic
                        Virginian can refuse to choose between them. With Wells and a Wells
                        Legislature we shall despair of any good for many weary, weary years to
                        come. With Walker and a Walker Legislature we shall work with a will and
                        with hope to meliorate our condition in a short time. Our salvation is yet
                        in our own hands, if we will but wisely use our opportunities. Then let us
                        all work, work, WORK, incessantly till the sun
                        goes down on the 6th of July to secure the best possible results.</p>

                        than is imagined provide a tolerable government, and be in a condition, as
                        necessity and propriety may suggest, to build a new foundation.</p>
                    <p>Because they have forced this constitution on us, shall we surrender to the
                        negroes the administration of it? Because we are to have a bad constitution,
                        shall we have worse laws?--Because we are thrust into a dungeon, shalt we
                        refuse to get possession of the keys which unlock its gloomy doors? Because
                        we are to have public schools, shall we permit them to be mixed schools?
                        Because we are to have a "militia," shall we give Lewis Lindsay the command
                        of it? Because the constitution delegates to the Legislature the power to
                        levy enormous taxes on our property, shall we send negroes there to give
                        efficiency to the provision?</p>

                        majority--suppose it the 1st of August--and that
                        much settled--and suppose then you had to
                        choose between Walker and a white Legislature and Wells and a negro
                        Legislature? Get close to the dilemma: realize it: that is precisely all
                        that is left us now--and you can take your choice. Do you know Wells?--Do
                        you know how he hates us? Do you know his lieutenant, Harris? How did you
                        like the Black Crock convention? You stood off then in sullen disdain: did
                            that stop the course of events or disperse
                        the convention? Now, we shall have Wells and just such
                            another body in that Capitol in about two months unless you vote. There is no commodity under the sun which we
                        can command that will turn that black current except votes. These you have; these will turn it; with these, after the

                    <p>For the Spectator.</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Colored Voters of Augusta County:
                    </p>
                    <p>FELLOW-CITIZENS--I am a plain spoken white man. I am in the habit of saying
                        what I think and doing what I say. I wish now to say a few plain words to
                        you. I will express my sentiments and what I believe to be the opinions and
                        purposes of nine-tenths of the white people of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>They have no unkind feeling toward the colored people. They have no
                        disposition to deprive them of any of their rights. They wish to deal fairly
                        with them and to cultivate kind feelings between the two races. They believe
                        that the interests of both races will be promoted by this condition of
                        things. The colored people want employment to enable them to earn wages, and
                        the land-holders want to employ labor to make their farms productive. The
                        two races can thus play into each others hands as long as kind feelings are
                        preserved. Each can supply to the other exactly what that other wants.</p>
                    <p>But there are certain mischievous people going through the country, trying to
                        deceive the colored people, and to array them against the whites. They wish
                        to persuade them to vote against the white people, and to prevent them from
                        having the right to vote or sit on juries, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Now I am a quiet, peaceable man. I wish to have no unpleasant feeling, or
                        controversy, with any body black or white. I wish to deal fairly
                        with all. I have never refused to employ a black man because of his color,
                        nor do I ever wish to do so.</p>
                    <p>But I am like all other men. I have a good deal of human nature in me. And
                        one of the promptings of that nature is, if a man hits me to hit him back!
                        If a man seeks to do me an injury, or to take away my rights, I will defend
                        myself in the best way I can.</p>
                    <p>Let us now see to what the counsels of these bad advisers of the colored
                        people will lead.</p>
                    <p>Suppose the colored people, choose to set themselves up against me, is it not
                            natutal that I should set myself against them? If they seek
                        to disfranchise me, is it not natural that I should wish to retaliate?</p>
                    <p>How then will the matter end? It can hardly be expected that I will
                        patronize, and employ those who show themselves to be my enemies. And if
                        this kind of a contest comes, who will be the greatest sufferers, the whites
                        or the blacks?</p>
                    <p>Suppose the white people say to the blacks: "I have no occasion for your
                        services so long as you are doing all you can to injure me. I will neither
                        rent property to you nor employ you as tradesmen, nor as farm hands, nor
                        have any dealings with you." What would be the condition of the colored
                        people? Ninety-nine hundredths of the land and other property, is in the
                        hands of the whites. They are the only persons who can give employment to
                        the colored people and pay them wages. If they refuse to do so, the only
                        alternative left to the colored people will be to move away or starve. And
                        where will they get the means to move with?</p>
                    <p>It may be said that the whites can't do without the blacks--that their labor
                        is necessary to them. This is a mistake. It is very easy to get white labor.
                        With a few scrapes of my pen, I can have half a dozen or a dozen Irish or
                        German laborers here in a week. Others can do the same. And do you doubt
                        that they will do it, if the colored people are soft enough to array
                        themselves in hostility to the whites?</p>
                    <p>I am one of those who wish to avoid this thing. I have kind feelings for the
                        blacks. I wish to see them prosper. I wish to see harmony and good feeling
                        in the country. Hence I counsel them to cultivate kind relations with the
                        whites, who are disposed to be friendly with them.</p>
                    <p>But if they choose to take a different course; if they prefer to array
                        themselves against the whites, let it be hardest fend off! If
                        blows are to be given, blows will be returned. If an attack is to be made,
                        defence will follow; and in the conflict the weaker party will go to the
                        wall. Which that weaker party is, time may show.</p>
                    <p>Colored men! You now see the ground you stand on. If you choose the path that
                        leads to your injury, you will have none to blame but yourselves. AN OLD
                        FARMER</p>
