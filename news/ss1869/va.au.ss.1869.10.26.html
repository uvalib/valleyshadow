<b>Deaths</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Susan Ella Hite, wife of W. F. Hite, died near Churchville on September
                    26th. "Scarcely 15 months had passed since the deceased had been wedded to him
                    who now mourns her early death. Little did those who witnessed their marriage
                    vows and sympathized in their connubial joy imagine that the union, then so
                    auspiciously formed, was destined to be so soon severed. Ere a single year had
                    finished its course, the very event which brought to their hearts the appearance
                    of parental joy, proved to be the first of a train that terminated their earthly
                    companionship. Thus was the fondness of a mother's love for months mingled with
                    bodily pain and prostration. But in all her patience and her native amiability
                    of temper made it a privilege in the estimation of her friends to minister to
                    her comfort. Naturally, for her husband's sake and that of her child, she clung
                    to life, but when convinced that the Lord willed otherwise, she began to set her
                    house in order. Her religious interest, however, was not the offspring of
                    death-bed fear. More than 18 months ago she sought and found a hope in Christ."<br>(Names in announcement:  Susan Ella Hite,  W. F. Hite)</blockquote>
