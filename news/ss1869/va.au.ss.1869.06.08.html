<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday last, Gilbert C. Walker of Norfolk, candidate for Governor,
                        accompanied by Maj. Beverly B. Douglas of King William county, one of the
                        canvassers at large, appointed by the Executive Committee of the
                        Conservative party, and Wm. Gilman, reporter for the Richmond Whig, arrived here at 10 o'clock A. M. by the
                        Western train. They remained here, the guests of Mr. Robt. W. Burke till
                        Sunday, when Douglas went to Spottsylvania Court-House to fill an
                        appointment and Walker and Gilman took the Valley stage for Woodstock, at
                        which place Mr. Walker had an appointment to address the citizens on Monday
                        -- yesterday.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday afternoon it was announced by posted bills that Maj. Beverly B.
                        Douglas would address the citizens of Staunton at the Court-House at 8
                        o'clock that evening.</p>
                    <p>At the hour appointed, Judge H. W. Sheffey introduced Maj. Douglas to the
                        audience, who then arose and addressed them in behalf of the election of
                        Walker, and the adoption of the Constitution expurgated of the test-oath and
                        disfranchising clauses. Twelve months ago, he said, the Conservative party
                        was rallied in a solid phalanx against the adoption of the abomination,
                        known as the Underwood Constitution, because at that time there was no
                        alternative except the adoption or rejection of that instrument unchanged.
                        Now an opportunity was presented of striking out two of its worst features.
                        We are not in a position where we could get what we wished, but must be
                        governed by the circumstances in which we were unfortunately placed, and
                        should not fail to secure the best that circumstances and opportunities
                        would allow.</p>
                    <p>He did not like much to support Walker till he had met with him, and heard
                        him express his views and sentiments in a speech the day before at Lexington
                        -- he had not loved Walker much, but he had loved Wells less. He now takes
                        pleasure in supporting Walker and deems it the duty of all true Virginians
                        to do so, for he (Walker) is with them heart and hand. If Virginians cannot
                        support Walker, they had as well give up the contest, and consent to be
                        slaves, and to see their State utterly and irretrievably ruined. Not to
                        support Walker is to support Wells and that abomination of abominations --
                        the unchanged Underwood Constitution. He appealed to the white cohorts in
                        the Valley to register and vote and come to the rescue of their brethren in
                        the East, many of whom would, if they could, flee from their section as from
                        a city on fire. Register every vote, relieve your best citizens from
                        disfranchisement, and ninety-five per cent of the white adult male
                        population from exclusion from office, and rescue your country from
                        impending ruin. An opportunity is now offered to secure a majority for the
                        white citizens. The worst enemy we have to contend against at this time is
                        General Apathy. He quoted and happily applied a proverb of Solomon: "The
                        diligent hand shall bear rule -- the slothful shall be under tribute."
                        Everything is at stake and none should fail to do his duty. Wells is
                        confident of election, because he believes that many conservatives will fail
                        to vote. Those who fail to vote, will be practically, allies of Wells.</p>
                    <p>If Wells should be elected, the condition of Virginia would be like that of
                        Tennessee, which, even the Radicals now say, is "Hell organized on earth."
                        An opportunity is afforded to dash away the poisoned chalice now presented
                        to the lips of Virginia. If not availed of, she will sup full of horrors.</p>
                    <p>As Wells occupies the high office once filled by Jefferson, Tazewell, Wise,
                        McDowell, Letcher, and other distinguished sons of Virginia, he would like
                        to be able to speak of him with respect -- but who can respect Well? He is
                        the enemy and vilifyer of our people -- his lips are so foul with falsehood
                        that living fire from the sacred altar could not purify him of his iniquity.
                        No one, white or black, can trust him. He possesses an impudent audacity
                        which none other could rival. "He goes back" on his black friends and writes
                        his Garland letter. If he speaks truly to the whites the negroes will be
                        cheated -- if truly to the negroes, the whites will be cheated. He (the
                        speaker) believes that he will cheat both.</p>
                    <p>He said if the negroes and whites would work together as they should, like
                        horses in a good old fashioned team, with a white horse on one side and a
                        black horse on the other, both pulling in the same direction, that the good
                        old wagon, Virginia, might get along very well; but if the black horse would
                        hold back when the white horse pulled, or the white horse should hold back
                        when the black horse pulled, that we should have a balky team, and the wagon
                        (Virginia) would be left in the mire.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Maj. Douglas's speech, Judge Sheffey announced that
                        Gilbert C. Walker was in the audience and called upon him to take the stand
                        and show himself to the people. In response to clamorous calls by the
                        audience, Mr. Walker walked upon the stand, greeted cordially by the
                        audience, and was introduced by Hon. A. H. H. Stuart. He declined to address
                        the citizens at that time, as he had an appointment to address the citizens
                        of Staunton and Augusta county on the 28th inst. -- County Court-day.</p>
                    <p>He had just traveled by stage from Bonsack's to Fincastle, thence to
                        Buchanan, thence to the Natural Bridge, thence to Lexington, and thence to
                        Goshen, where he struck the Railroad for Staunton, and those who had ever
                        been tossed and bumbed in the stages over the route would know something of
                        the fatigue he was then suffering and know that he could not be in a
                        condition to make a speech. He said that, if Col. Harman did not soon have
                        the Valley Railroad built, the citizens of Staunton ought to ride him out of
                        town on a rail. -- (Col. Harman occupied a seat directly in front of the
                        stand at the time.) He thanked the audience for their cordial greeting, and
                        said that he had been cordially greeted wherever he had been in Virginia,
                        and that, if he should be elected Governor, he would do what he could to
                        advance the interests and prosperity of the State, and endeavor to merit the
                        generous confidence reposed in him by the voters of Virginia.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We invite attention to the address issued by the State Executive Committee of
                        the Conservative party published upon the first page of this issue. It sets
                        forth the reasons why every man, who has the honor and interest of Virginia
                        at heart, should register and vote against the disfranchising and test-oath clauses,
                        and for proper persons to the Legislature, and
                            for Walker for Governor.</p>
                    <p>These votes, every one will be sure to cast whether he will choose to vote
                        for or against the Constitution, or not to vote at all upon that
                        proposition.</p>
                    <p>Remember that it is the duty -- the imperative duty -- of all to REGISTER AND
                        VOTE. This is a contest in which our dearest interests are involved, and in
                        which no skulking should be tolerated. Every one has a solemn duty to
                        perform, and none should prove recreant. Virginia expects every man to do
                        his duty.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Saturday last was observed by the people of Staunton and Augusta as "Memorial
                        Day." -- The early hour of 8 o'clock had been named for assembling at the
                        Soldiers' Cemetery. It was not intended to have any formal procession or
                        public ceremonies on this particular occasion, and no programme had been
                        arranged.</p>
                    <p>But at 8 1/2 o'clock, an impromptu procession formed on Main street, composed
                        of the old Stonewall Band, the Augusta Fire Company, the Sons of Temperance,
                        the Fire Company of the D.,D. &amp; B. Institution, and the Brass Band
                        of the Institution; following these were the pupils of the Augusta Female
                        Seminary, and of the Virginia Female Institute, bearing wreaths of beautiful
                        flowers; citizens on foot, in carriages and on horseback filled the rear.</p>
                    <p>Under the conduct of Col. Bolivar Christian, as Chief Marshall, assisted by
                        Maj. J. Marshall Hanger, Capts. Bumgardner, Berkeley, Arnall, and Ranson,
                        the procession moved to the Cemetery under the inspiring music of the bands.
                        -- Here an immense crowd of the citizens of the county had assembled -- all
                        bearing the touching tributes of flowers to decorate the graves of their
                        fallen defenders.</p>
                    <p>After music by the Stonewall Band, the following ode, adapted by Dr. J. L.
                        Brown for the occasion, was beautifully sung by members of the Staunton
                        Musical Association:</p>
                    <p>Strew flowery wreaths upon the graves</p>
                    <p>Of those who shed their blood and died</p>
                    <p>In freedom's cause; though 'twas in vain,</p>
                    <p>Their deeds olate our hearts with pride.</p>
                    <p>Strew o'er them flowers; mid battle's din</p>
                    <p>O think how hard their fate to die.</p>
                    <p>No mother dead, no sister there,</p>
                    <p>Nor friend, to close the death-dimmed eye.</p>
                    <p>A while they rest within the tomb</p>
                    <p>In sweet repose, till morning come,</p>
                    <p>Then rise, we trust, to meet their God,</p>
                    <p>And ever dwell in his abode.</p>
                    <p>Celestial dawn! triumphant hour,</p>
                    <p>How glorious that awakening power</p>
                    <p>Which bids the sleeping dust arise</p>
                    <p>And join the anthems of the skies.</p>
                    <p>His weary life will soon be past,</p>
                    <p>The lingering morn will come at last,</p>
                    <p>And gloomy mists will roll away</p>
                    <p>Before that light unfading day.</p>
                    <p>After the singing was concluded, the Band of the D. D. &amp; B.
                        Institution played two sweet and appropriate airs, and the ladies then, with
                        tender care, strewed their floral offerings over the two thousand lowly,
                        sacred mounds where lie all that is mortal of so many of the true and brave
                        of our Southern land.</p>
                    <p>The beautiful ode of Collins comes familiarly to our memories:</p>
                    <p>"How sleep the brave who sink to rest</p>
                    <p>With all their country's wishes blest,</p>
                    <p>When Spring with dewy fingers cold</p>
                    <p>Returns to deck their hallowed mould,</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>William Clayton died at his residence near Deerfield, Augusta County, on
                    June 2nd. He was 83 years old. "About 40 years ago he professed religion and
                    joined the Methodist Church. From that time to the day of his death he led the
                    life of an earnest, zealous christian. He was a bold and able advocate of the
                    peculiar doctrines of his church, and, indeed, of any cause he espoused: a kind
                    neighbor, a good citizen, and a man not easily swerved from what he believed to
                    be right, either by friends or foes, especially the later class. About 20 years
                    ago his nervous system commenced failing, which continued gradually year after
                    year, until it terminated his earthly career. For the last 8 years he was
                    confined to his house, and for 6 years to his bed. A great sufferer, he often
                    wondered why God prolonged his day, but never was known to complain or murmur at
                    his affliction."<br>(Names in announcement:  William Clayton)</blockquote>
