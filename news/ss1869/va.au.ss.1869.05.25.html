<b>To Arms!</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Issued a call for all Conservative party organizers and canvassers to stump
                    the state and gain support for the defeat of the test-oath and other
                    objectionable sections of the Underwood Constitution.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Conservative Executive Committee on yesterday adopted the following
                        important resolution. It is the trumpet call to arms! and can it fail to
                        summon to the field the gallant leaders in their country's defence? Never
                        was there a period of such peril in the history of the State -- never a time
                        when the heroism of her sons was more imperatively necessary for the public
                        welfare. The heroism of the sacrifice of feeling, opinion, and self, for the
                        general safety -- the heroism of devoting time and self incessantly and
                        rigorously to the common cause.</p>
                    <p>The leaders, we are sure, will respond. The committee propose to add to the
                        spirit of the campaign by inducing prominent speakers to canvass the State
                        at large, and have invited that able debater Mr. Patrick Henry Aylett to do
                        so. He has consented and will soon set out on his important mission. Such is
                        the imminence of the danger that the State should be even now in a blaze of
                        excitement with preparation for the day of battle. It needs but to arouse
                        the public mind to save Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The resolution is as follows:</p>
                    <p>Resolved: that the county and district canvassers
                        of the Conservative party are earnestly exhorted to renewed and redoubled
                        exertions both in preparation for the approaching contest and the
                        prosecution of it. The paramount importance of voting down the 'test-oath'
                        and the 'disfranchising' clauses cannot be overestimated; neither can we
                        overestimate the necessity of securing a good Legislature and the best man
                        we can for Governor. These considerations should call forth our earnest
                        endeavors and arouse us to enthusiastic efforts in behalf of our glorious
                        old Commonwealth."</p>

<b>The Duties of Election Day</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Declared that all eligible voters have the duty to vote on election day to
                    ensure the defeat of certain sections of the Underwood constitution and to elect

                    <p>The election which will take place on the 6th day of July next, by
                        appointment of the President, will decide whether the people of this State
                        are to be cursed with the Underwood abomination, called a Constitution, as
                        it came from the hands of the Molungeon Convention, or whether it will be
                        modified by having the test-oath and disfranchising clauses stricken out --
                        whether Walker or Wells will be our Governor, and whether proper men will be
                        elected to represent the State in the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>This election is as important as any which has ever been held in this State
                        -- its result will determine most momentous questions. Those who have the
                        right to vote should allow nothing to prevent them from attending the polls
                        and casting their ballots on the day of election, and those who have not
                        registered heretofore should be sure to attend to that duty before the day
                        of election, and on that day be sure to vote. Those who will fail in the
                        performance of their duty may live long, but they will never live long
                        enough to cease to regret their culpable remissness. It will be a black day
                        in the calendar of their remembrance. It will haunt them like an evil
                        spirit, and its memory will be a source of unceasing regrets and unremitting
                        pain.</p>
                    <p>The time is short, and the whole of it should be devoted to preparations for
                        the duties of the day of election. See that every man shall register and
                        that all shall vote.</p>
                    <p>All should vote, of course, for striking out the test-oath and disfranchising
                        clauses which will be submitted separately. There is no apology or excuse
                        for any one, white or colored, who will vote to retain those clauses in the
                        Constitution. Those who will do so understandingly will thereby proclaim
                        themselves the enemies of the people, and they well deserve to be treated as
                        enemies by the people among whom they live. The number in Augusta of this
                        kind will be few, if any.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that any colored man, who understands the effect of such
                        vote, will vote to retain those clauses. If he has any sense he will know
                        that by so doing he will be gaining nothing, but will be losing the good
                        will and friendship of the people among whom he lives, and upon whom he is
                        dependent for employment and support. It is the duty of the whites to
                        explain their matters fully to the colored voters, that they may vote
                        understandingly. Teach them their duty in the premises, and then if they
                        vote for such iniquity understandingly, let them suffer the effect of their
                            inexplicable conduct. If they act the part of
                        enemies, let them be treated as such.</p>
                    <p>All can unite in voting against the test-oath and disfranchising clauses, it
                        matters not how widely their opinions on other subjects may differ. And no
                        complaints should be made against any who willingly vote, however they may
                        vote upon the body of the Constitution, whether for its ratification or
                        rejection. All who vote against the clauses submitted to separate votes
                        should be considered as friends and patriots whether they vote for or
                        against the ratification of the other parts of the Constitution. Upon the
                        [section unclear] the patriotic effort to save the State from the horrors
                        consequent upon the adoption of the unmodified Underwood Constitution. The
                        pressing, overriding duty now is, to vote against the clauses submitted
                        separately. In this duty none should be remiss. The performance of this
                        duty, like the mantle of charity, will hide many political sins.</p>
                    <p>We think that all should vote for Walker, and that all should do their utmost
                        to secure a good Legislature. The fact that the Constitution, though
                        modified as proposed by striking out the clauses submitted separately, will
                        be very objectionable, furnishes the strongest reason why we should, if
                        possible, elect the better man for Governor, and elect the best men for the
                        Legislature. The Governor will be invested with the veto power, and can,
                        consequently, protect the State against unjust and oppressive legislation on
                        the part of the Legislature. If we have a safe man for Governor, and can
                        secure a good Legislature, we can live under the Constitution in its
                        modified form, till we can secure the call of a Convention which will frame
                        a better one.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time see that all register and vote. They should vote against the
                        test-oath and disfranchising clauses, for Walker for Governor, and for the
                        best men for the Legislature.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Voters of Augusta:
                    </p>
                    <p>You will soon be called on to vote for a Senator and three Delegates to the
                        General Assembly. The range of your selection has been very much curtailed
                        by the 14th Amendment. The men who served you in former days are no longer
                        eligible. No man who held office before the war, either as Congressman,
                        Legislator, Justice, Sheriff, Constable or Postmaster, can now occupy a seat
                        in either House. This drives you to make your selections from among the
                        younger men who have not held such offices.</p>
                    <p>The next session of the Legislature will be one of transcendant importance,
                        and we must therefore make use of the best materials we we can
                        find, to secure an able and faithful representation of our interests. Mr. A.
                        Waddell has already been nominated for the Senate, and Mr. A.B. Cochran for
                        the House. They are both good men and true. Two more are required to
                        complete the ticket. Fortunately Maj. H.M. Bella and Capt. James Bumgardner
                        are both eligible. Tried by the true tests of fitness, "is he competent and
                        is he faithful to the Constitution?" no better men can be found. They will
                        do honor to the county, and advance the General interests. In my judgment
                        the people ought to elect them, whether they wish it or not. Men must make
                        sacrifices in times like these. These gentlemen may object, and say it does
                        not suit them. That is not the point. They suit us, and we the people, must elect them, and
                        require them to serve.--No man is at liberty in the present crisis of our
                        affairs, to set up his interests and his wishes against the wishes and
                        interests of the whole community. ONE OF THE DISFRANCHISED.</p>

                    <p>In voting for candidates at the coming election, the people should be careful
                        to cast their ballots for no one who is not clearly eligible--If they vote
                        for those who fall within the prohibitions of the 14th amendment, there is
                        strong reason to apprehend that all such votes will be regarded as null and
                        void. If, therefore, an ineligible candidate should be chosen his election
                        will be of no avail, and the seat given to his carpet-bag competitor. This
                        is no time to gratify personal or party preferences. Our first duty is to
                        rescue the State from the power of our oppressors and we should sacrifice
                        all our likes and dislikes, to accomplish that end.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing the necessity of selecting only those candidates who are
                        eligible, Mr. Shackelford of Fauquier, Mr. Cox of Chesterfield, and the
                        Senatorial and Legislative candidates from Campbell, have withdrawn to give
                        place to others who are eligible.</p>
                    <p>As long as the question of eligibility remained an open one it was well not
                        to surrender. But now that the Constitutional amendment settles it, beyond
                        all question, it is folly to vote for those who cannot hold the position if
                        chosen. A vote for an ineligible candidate, is half a vote for the radicals.
                        Other papers are requested to take a note of this fact.</p>

                    <p>"I have read the Presidents proclamation with great
                        disappointment, as I supposed we would be allowed a separate vote on several

                        polls, as the sovereignty of the people at the polls being secured by the

                        tolerable, and the constitution, itself, speedily amended. If I remember

                        difficult or impossible for many years. But the Rhode Island case settled
                        the principle that all that is essential to constitutional changes is the
                        clear ascertainment of the mind of the sovereignty of the people. Suppose
                        that the legislature should call a convention, the people respond to the
                        call and elect delegates, the convention take action to amend the
                        fundamental law, and that action be approved by a popular vote. Now is such
                        a determination to be set aside?</p>

                        as to a quiet settlement of affairs in Virginia. This confidence tends
                        vastly to the advantage of Virginia, in many ways which need not be
                        suggested to you. And a different result will be proportionateless
                        injurious, will cause exasperation, and probably induce a recourse by
                        Congress to extreme measures."</p>

                    <p>The Friends of Temperance, of this place, had a public demonstration on
                        Saturday last. The two Staunton Councils, and a number of visiting brethren
                        from adjacent Councils turned out in the morning, at 11 o'clock, and heard
                        an address by the Rev. James Young, the State Lecturer of the F. of T., in
                        the lecture room of the Methodist Church.--His labors for the advancement of
                        the "cold water army," in the lower Valley, have been very successful--he
                        having organized several new orders, and induced large numbers to sign the
                        total abstinance pledge. The heavy fall of rain, in the morning, having
                        prevented the Councils from traversing the streets, they turned out again in
                        the evening, at 6 1/2 o'clock, and marched through the principle
                        thoroughfares of the town, headed by the band of music from the D.D.
                        &amp; B. Institution. The procession was quite a large one and they
                        presented an imposing appearance and handsome display. After the procession
                        had finished its serpentine course it entered the town hall, where the Rev.
                        Dr. Young again addressed a crowded house in a most happy and entertaining
                        manner. He also preached a temperance sermon in the Methodist church on
                        Sunday night. Upwards of one hundred ladies and gentlemen signed the pledge.
                        He will address the people of this county, during the present week, at the
                        following places, at 7 1/2 P.M. each day.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is evident to the least observant mind that the first duty of the
                        Conservative press of the State, is to urge the non-registered voters to
                        come forward as soon as an opportunity is offered them, and register. The
                        fact that something like twenty thousand of the white men of Virginia, not
                        disfranchised by the reconstruction acts of Congress, refused or failed to
                        apply for registration, indicates unmistakably the existence of a feeling of
                        indifference on the subject, and a disregard of public weal, which cannot be
                        too strongly reprehended.</p>
                    <p>Unless registration be attended to, we cannot defeat the most obnoxious
                        provisions of the constitution--we cannot--elect a Conservative
                        Legislature--we cannot prevent the control of State by the ignorant negroes
                        and the malignant carpet-baggers, into whose hands it is so likely to fall.
                        Obviously, then, it becomes a high and important duty that every white man
                        in the State should place himself in a position to wield all the influence
                        possible to exert.</p>
                    <p>We should register every voter; we should see to it that each one is at the
                        polls; we should unitize if possible the vote of the State against the
                        Constitution, and in favor of good men for the Legislature. As for members
                        of Congress, we are more indifferent, because, satisfied that no true
                        representative man will be allowed to fill the place if elected, it is with
                        us of little moment whether we are misrepresented by a negro, a scalawag, or
                        a carpet-bagger. But it is possible that the effects of a new registration
                        may enable the whites in some counties, hitherto under the hand of negro
                        supremacy, to elect good men to represent them, and it is above all things
                        desirable that we shall retain control of our State Legislature. This
                        consideration alone should suffice to induce every true hearted Virginian,
                        who has hitherto neglected to place himself in a position in which his voice
                        may be heard in the government of the State to repair the neglect, or
                        rectify the error by a prompt registration.</p>
                    <p>We would say and do nothing which may animate and encourage our enemies or
                        dishearten and depress our friends, beyond what our duty as a public
                        journalist demands. But we should deem ourselves culpable, did we, with our
                        convictions, join in the fervid predictions of easy triumph in which some of
                        our jubilant journals indulge. The best intelligence we can command, and the
                        soundest opinion we can form, alike indicate that if we succeed in defeating
                        even the most obnoxious features of the Underwood Constitution, and in
                        preserving Virginia from the ruin involved in the election of Wells, such
                        result is only possible at the cost of unceasing labor and untiring
                            zeal.--Lynchburg News.</p>
