<b>Brief Thoughts on the "New Movement."</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors object to the idea of submitting two Constitutions to the
                    voters of Virginia, on the grounds that it will force voters to choose between
                    two documents that both allow "negro suffrage."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If the distinguished gentlemen who compose the "Committee of Nine" at
                        Washington, or any other number of gentlemen from Virginia in whose
                        intelligence, integrity, and patriotism the citizens generally could as
                        confidently rely, had gone there for the purpose of inducing Congress to
                        modify the Underwood Constitution, by striking from that diabolical
                        instrument its most objectionable features, and relieving the citizens from
                        all disabilities save those imposed by the 14th amendment of the
                        Constitution, their mission would have had the cordial approval and hearty
                        "Godspeed" of most of the conservatives of the State. The opposition to the
                        action of those who inaugurated the "New Movement," as it is called, rests
                        upon the two propositions which form the foundation of their announced
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>1st. To enter into a compact with Congress by which the citizens of Virginia
                        would agree to accept negro suffrage in
                        consideration of being relieved from disfranchisement and ineligibility.</p>
                    <p>2nd. To have a constitution, framed in accordance with the nature of this
                        compact, submitted as an alternative at the same time with the Underwood
                        Constitution unchanged.</p>
                    <p>The Conservatives object to the first on the ground that it abandons principle, and yields it for questionable temporary
                        expediency, which, in the end, would be found to be a very grievous bargain.
                        In a word, they think it is "paying too dearly for the
                            whistle."</p>
                    <p>They object to the second, on the ground of policy, believing that, if the attempt be made to defeat the
                        Underwood Constitution by voting for an alternative one
                            guaranteeing negro suffrage, the almost inevitable result would
                        be the adoption of the Underwood Constitution with all of its accumulate
                        horrors. -- Thousands of Conservatives would feel that they could not conscientiously vote for such a
                        Constitution, and thousands more would not. --
                        The result would be, the adoption of the Underwood
                            Constitution unchanged. The propositions above stated should, in
                        our humble opinion, be abandoned by the "Committee of Nine," and they
                        should, in lieu thereof, exert their influence to induce Congress to modify
                        the Underwood Constitution so that it would not be more restrictive than
                        would be necessary to make it conform to the 14th amendment, and make it, in
                        other respects, free from objection.</p>
                    <p>Then there would be but one Constitution submitted, and no necessity would
                        exist for any man to vote in favor of negro
                        suffrage who did not believe it to be both right and expedient. If
                        that Constitution should be so modified, it might, in that shape, be
                        adopted, though thousands, like ourselves, might vote against it, not only
                        because of its objectionable character, but because the Convention which
                        framed it was an unconstitutional body, and its action was not only
                        violative of the rights of Virginia, but, in the eye of the Constitution of
                        the United States, null and void.</p>
                    <p>P.S. -- Since the expression in brief of the views above, we observe by the
                        last papers received that the "Committee of Nine" are now seeking to secure
                        a modification of the Underwood Constitution. We hope that they may succeed
                        in having it modified to the degree indicated above -- more might be hoped
                        for, but even that cannot be confidently expected. -- Blessed are they that
                        expect little, for they will not be disappointed.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We heartily approve of the tone, temper and spirit of the articles of the
                        Alexandria Gazette in reference to the "new
                        movement," as it is now generally called. We published one of its articles
                        in our last issue, and now publish another which appeared in that journal of
                        the 14th. It is as follows:</p>
                    <p>We are sorry to see the subject of the recent Conference at Richmond made
                        matter for rather, in some instances, acrimonious discussion, in some
                        quarters of our State; for strife can do now no good and may do much harm.
                        As we have repeatedly said, for ourselves, much as we regret the course of
                        the gentlemen who composed that Conference, and however unfortunate and
                        wrong we think the movement has been, we are perfectly willing to hear them,
                        and to pause awhile for the results of their proceedings. A difference of
                        opinion will not prevent us from doing them justice -- or induce us to do
                        them injustice. Indeed, we have never believed that their mission to
                        Washington would amount to much, one way or the other -- certainly nothing
                        likely to result to the benefit of our citizens. We may be mistaken -- but
                        this is our opinion. When we know exactly what they have said and what they
                        have proposed, and what they have endeavored to effect, we will be all the
                        better prepared to measure, censure, if any has been incurred, or bestow
                        praise if any has been deserved. This much in hope of 'pouring oil upon the
                        troubled waters.'</p>
                    <p>And now again, with all the lights before us, with all the recollections of
                        the past, and as far as we can judge of all the prospects of the future, we
                        hold on to the recorded and oft repeated declarations of our people not made
                        to suit a political purpose dependent upon any party results of a
                        Presidential or any other election -- and to principles and organization of
                        the Conservative party of Virginia. -- We believe those principles to be
                        true, constitutional, and in strict accordance with our duties, under the
                        circumstances in which we are now placed, and entirely consonant with our
                        obligations as citizens of the United States, acknowledging legal authority
                        of the government and the laws. If "universal suffrage" as it is called, is
                        upon us, or is to be forced upon us, we must submit. But, we never want to
                        have it proposed, bargained for, or committees sent to Washington to effect
                        in Virginia, upon "terms" or otherwise. In the meantime, let our people keep
                        cool, and keep united. Let us obey the laws -- vote upon principle, upon
                        such measures as those having the power may allow us to vote upon -- and as
                        we think best conducive towards the honor and integrity of our State. This
                        will, at least, command the respect of the best of those who are driving
                        measures upon us, and however much we may suffer temporarily, will, in the
                        end, be the best for our true and lasting interests. If we are to have
                        before us first of all, the Underwood Constitution, let us all stand
                        together to defeat that. If we succeed, and other things are submitted to
                        our choice, let us meet them also, in accordance with our cherished
                        principles -- and trust to an overruling Providence to support and sustain
                        us or to enable us to endure what we may be called on to beat.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The question to be determined by the voters of this county, on the 6th of
                        February, is not one of taxation or no taxation.
                        But the real issue is, shall we tax ourselves, for our own benefit, or
                        permit other persons to tax us for the benefit of strangers. Taxation for
                        the latter purpose is inevitable, in the form of high charges for freight
                        for all time, by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. R. unless we agree to
                        contribute for the extension of the Valley Road that is, impose a temporary
                        tax upon our own property for our own benefit.</p>
                    <p>This result will be made evident by a consideration of the following facts:</p>
                    <p>The Balt. &amp; Ohio Rail Road is at this time transporting flour from
                        Wheeling to Baltimore, a distance of 380 miles, for 72 cents per barrel, or
                        a fraction under 2 mills per mile. Whilst the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio
                        charges from Staunton to Richmond, a distance of 138 miles, 60 cents per
                        barrel, or 4 1/2 mills per mile. Now when the latter Road reaches the Ohio
                        River, it will come into direct and active competition with the Balt.
                        &amp; Ohio Road for the trade of the North West. And in order to compete
                        successfully with that great Road, it will have to put its charges at the
                        same rates. For example, instead of charging for the transportation of a
                        barrel of flour 4 1/2 mills per mile, as it does now for the flour of
                        Augusta, it will have to carry Ohio flour at the Balt. &amp; Ohio Rail
                        Road rates, or less than 2 mills per mile per barrel. This low rate of
                        charges for the transportation of flour at the Balt. &amp; Ohio Rail
                        Road is the result of competition. But it must be borne in mind that the
                        completion of the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Rail Road will create no competition
                        for the transportation of the surplus products of this county. The farmers
                        will be left, as they are at present, "cabined, cribbed, and confined" to
                        the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Road; the only difference being that the road will
                        be burdened by the increase of transportation consequent on its extension to
                        the Ohio, and we all know the chance of way
                        freight, in competition with through, when the
                        trains are crowded. We will thus be left to the tender mercies of the Chesa.
                        &amp; Ohio Rail Road, and the measure of the charges upon the freights
                        of the county, will be the necessities, or rather the cupidity, of that
                        corporation.</p>
                    <p>But in order that the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Rail Road may compete
                        successfully with the Balt. &amp; Ohio, it will have to keep up the
                        charges on our productions; that is, upon all way freight. For the higher
                        the charges, and the larger the profits derived from these, the better able
                        will it be to compete with its great rival for the carrying trade of the
                        fertile, and prosperous, the rich and radical, North West. And thus too, may
                        any loss, it will sustain in this contest, be reimbursed to its coffers. It
                        is evident that as long as we have but a single line of railway in our
                        county their will be no motive for the reduction of our freights.
                        But on the other hand whenever the Chesa. &amp; Ohio reaches its western
                        terminus, the strongest and most influential motives will be brought into
                        operation, not only to keep up, but actually to increase the present high
                        charges. It is evident that the excess of charges for carrying Augusta
                        flour, over that charged for Ohio flour by the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Road,
                        will measure the amount of tax the farmers of this county will have to pay
                        for the benefit of the farmers of Ohio. I feel fully warranted in the
                        conclusion that if the Valley Road is extended, the charges for the
                        transportation of flour from the county, will not exceed the present rates
                        of the Balt. &amp; Ohio Road. Because we will then have active
                        competition between rival roads for the freights of the county, and the
                        effect of competition is the same the world over, and cannot be different in
                        the county of Augusta from what it is upon the banks of the Ohio. The effect
                        of competition in the reduction of Rail Road charges can have no more
                        striking illustration than in the fact that the Balt. &amp; Ohio Road
                        carries flour from Wheeling to Baltimore over a road whose grades at some
                        points exceed one hundred feet to the mile, at less than two mills per
                        barrel per mile, whilst the Chesa. &amp; Ohio charges 4 1/2 mills per
                        mile from Staunton to Richmond, over a Road whose grades do not exceed 75
                        feet to the mile.</p>
                    <p>Now the completion of the Valley Road producing these results, let us examine
                        their effects upon the interests of this county.</p>
                    <p>I have already stated that the Balt. &amp; Ohio Road transports a barrel
                        of flour from Wheeling to Baltimore for two mills per mile, and that the
                        Chesa. &amp; Ohio Road, from Staunton to Richmond, charges 4 1/2 mills
                        per mile. A difference of 2 1/2 mills per mile. Now the extension of the
                        Valley Road securing to us the transportation of our flour at the rates of
                        the Balt. &amp; Ohio Road, the result will be the saving of 2 1/2 mills
                        per mile upon every barrel of flour sent from the county by Rail Road, and
                        will save upon every barrel sent from Staunton to Richmond 32 cents, and
                        estimating the surplus flour of the county at only 60,000 barrels a year, we
                        will have an aggregate saving to the county on the single article of flour
                        of $19,200, a sum greater than the annual interest upon the amount we are
                        called to subscribe. -- But if we fail to secure the extension of the Valley
                        Road, which we will certainly do if we refuse to make this subscription,
                        this sum of $19,200 will just measure the annual tax we will be paying on
                        our flour alone for the benefit of the good people of Ohio and other States
                        of the West. I will not stop to estimate the enormous sum to which this will
                        be swelled if we take into the account all the other products of our
                        industry exported from the county, and then add to them what is imported for
                        consumption, such as plaster and other fertilizers, salt, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>These benefits resulting from competition between rival roads will enure
                        equally to the advantage of every part of the county, and not be confined to
                        that section through which the road may happen to be located. For every cent
                        taken off the cost of getting a barrel of flour to market, adds just that
                        much to its price in the hands of the producer. Hence, although A, may not
                        be brought really any nearer a depot than he is at present, yet this
                        reduction in the cost of transportation will enure as much to his benefit as
                        it will to that of B, who happens to have his farm adjoining a depot.</p>
                    <p>The beauty of this honorable emulation between two or more competing Rail
                        Roads is, that the large benefits flowing from it diffuse themselves over
                        every part of the community, and are not confined to favoured localities.
                        The reduction of freight consequent upon the extension of the Valley Road
                        will be enjoyed equally by New Hope and Parnassus, and the interests of
                        Barterbrook will be promoted as much as those of Spring Hill. So that there
                        is no ground for any feeling of opposition on the part of the "East Side"
                        because the Road may possibly be located along the "West Side." The truth
                        being that the great and permanent benefits which the extension of the
                        Valley Road into our midst, will confer upon the county, will be felt "from
                        the centre all round to the circumfrence." And therefore there is no
                        foundation for any feeling of local prejudice or jealousy, in regard to this
                        great work, for in the countless benefits it will confer, all our people,
                        and every part of our noble old county must participate. It is true there
                        are certain casual and incidental advantages, which will be unequally shared
                        by the people, but this is always inseperable from such undertakings and
                        ever will be so, and to hesitate or wait until they can be equalized is
                        forever effectually to clog the wheels of public enterprise and improvement.
                        I have forborne to say anything in reference to the benefits the county will
                        derive from the reductions of freight upon articles of export other than
                        flour: neither have I referred to the incalculable advantages, of even a
                        small reduction, upon the immense amount of merchandise, of every kind and
                        description, brought into the county for consumption, in which all the
                        people must equally share; because I design this article to be suggestive,
                        and not exhaustive. My chief motive in writing it is to direct the attention
                        of the people to the immense importance of securing two Rail Roads that will
                        compete for the carrying trade of this populous county. I will omit anything
                        more than a simple reference, to the advantage we will derive from this road
                        in securing a direct and quick connexion with the large and
                        growing city of Baltimore. Those who send freight there know all about the
                        high charges, vexatious delays, and general annoyance of frequent transfers.</p>
                    <p>There is one other matter to which I wish very briefly to direct attention.
                        The length of the road from Harrisonburg to the Rockbridge line is near to
                        forty miles. The construction of this road will cost some forty thousand
                        dollars per mile -- making an expenditure in our midst of nearly two million
                        dollars. The benefits of this large expenditure can scarcely be
                        over-estimated. It will infuse new life and activity into every branch of
                        business -- lighten our burdens, and in every way cheer, enliven, and
                        invigorate the energies of our people. The benefits we would derive from
                        this large expenditure of money amongst us would go far to warrant the
                        subscription, on the part of the county, even if no other advantage was to
                        accrue from the building of the Road. I trust, therefore, that all mere
                        local interests, prejudices, and jealousies will be discarded, and that this
                        good old county, always heretofore characterized by an enlightened
                        liberality and public spirit, will present an undivided front, upon this,
                        the most important question to her interests that she has ever been called
                        upon to decide.</p>

<b>Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"X" writes a letter to the editor arguing that the Valley Railroad will not
                    be built without Augusta's subscription. He argues against another anonymous
                    author's opinion that Mr. Garrett will build the railroad anyway and provides
                    reasons why such an assumption is erroneous.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A writer in the last Spectator, who "admits that
                        the Valley Railroad will be a benefit to us" -- objects to the subscription,
                        because he says, Rockingham lost her subscription to the Manassas Road;
                        because the B. &amp; Ohio R. R. will build the Valley Road for us; and
                        advises us therefore to be patient!</p>
                    <p>His admission implies that, when the road is built, our farmers will have,
                        first, a choice of markets where are the highest prices, second, a
                        competition reducing the charges of carrying their produce to market, and
                        bringing back their supplies cheaper in return; hence an immense saving of
                        profit on the produce of the county, and every cent saved off the cost of
                        getting into the last market goes directly into the pocket of the producer,
                        instead of to the pockets of railroad officials. Therefore, our lands will
                        rise in price, because the produce sold will bring that
                            much more profit to the farmer. This will attract more capital to
                        come among us. And while the road is building, will at once add to the money
                        now in circulation, the $1,000,000, which will be spent in its construction
                        along the whole length of the county.</p>
                    <p>Now, what, if Rockingham "lost" her subscription to the Manassas Road --
                        (which we do not admit) -- does Augusta, therefore, necessarily lose her
                        subscription to a different road, and under different circumstances?
                        (Augusta did not "lose" her subscription of $20,000 to the Central Road, in
                        fact the land damages paid to a few of her citizens amounted to more than
                        the whole county subscription, and the money spent in the county and put in
                        circulation for that construction of the road, amounted to more than a
                        million of dollars.) But, Rockingham lost her subscription to Manassas,
                            because the war destroyed the Manassas Road, and
                            broke up the Company; just as thousands of citizens lost their
                        horses, wagons, crops, &amp;c. -- Yet do they absurdly decline to put
                        any more money in stock, horses, wagons, crops, &amp;c., and sit down to
                        starve for fear they will now lose their money thus again? The same pretense
                        of argument would persuade any one never to engage in any business for fear
                        he might break and lose money!</p>
                    <p>Why will "Mr. Garret build our road and pay for it?" His road already sucks
                        the Valley effectually. He enters its very mouth at Harper's Ferry, and
                        pushes up all along the Shenandoah, almost to its head at Harrisonburg; he
                        reaches its heart at Staunton, via the Orange
                        Road and Blue Ridge Tunnel; and at Salem, via
                        Lynchburg, he taps its great Western water shed. Can the Valley be more
                        completely in his grasp, even if it cost him nothing of the $5,000,000
                        necessary to "build and pay" for the Valley Railroad?</p>
                    <p>Indeed, as matters now stand, it is to the interest of Mr. Garrett not "to build and pay for our road." From
                        Harrisonburg, through all the lower Valley, he now has a monopoly of the
                        transportation; if the railroad is extended by building the Valley Road,
                        there will be a competing railway route created against Baltimore from far
                        below Harrisonburg in the direction of Richmond and Norfolk, via Valley Railroad and the Central from Staunton
                        Eastward. -- When the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad is completed, Mr. Garrett may then find it to his interest to "build and pay for our road;"
                        not until then, and that only, after this generation has died off, in the
                        vain delusion, with which we have been lulled to sleep for thirty long years
                        already, waiting for "somebody" to "build and pay for our road."</p>
                    <p>The last reports of the B. &amp; O. R. R. Company show that it is now
                        engaged in spending and pledging all its surplus capital in works of far
                        more immediate importance to it than in building and paying for "our" road
                        to create a competition against itself! It is now making a double track and
                        shortening by straightening its line at enormous cost along its main stem;
                        it is building a costly iron bridge over the Ohio River at Parkersburg;
                        another over the Ohio near Wheeling; (these bridges costing more than the
                        whole road through Augusta;) it is constructing branch roads (longer than
                        the whole Valley Railroad) to Pittsburgh, via
                        Connellsville; to Washington City, via Point of
                        Rocks; to Hagerstown, via Frederick City; and to
                        Strasburg, via Winchester; it has leased and is
                        working at heavy cost the Central Ohio R. R., and the Marietta &amp;
                        Cincinnati Railroad; and it is establishing lines of Ocean Steamers to
                        Liverpool, and another to Bremen, and others to Charleston, New Orleans,
                        &amp;c. Until these vast and pressingly important works are completed --
                        requiring not only all the surplus capital but the creation of a heavy debt
                        besides -- how futile is the hope that "Mr. Garrett" will undertake to
                        "build and pay for the our road!" It may be soothing to say "it will be done
                        anyhow" -- but we will awake to the delusion when it is too late, for at
                        least this generation, to repair the mistake. Already we are in danger of
                        losing even the present chance; already even Rockbridge, discouraged by the
                        apathy of Augusta, is mediating a proposition to divert its subscription to
                        a short track connecting with the Orange to Baltimore, thence the Southside
                        to Richmond, and then the Valley Railroad fails, and we are left at the
                        mercy of a single Railroad monopoly for an indefinite future. Oh for a tithe
                        of the ancient spirit and generosity which pushed Old Augusta to the head
                        and lead of all great enterprises in the past! X.</p>
