<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reported on the vote of Virginia for Governor, broken down by
                    race. Dismissed Republican assertions a reliable constituency in Virginia for
                    their party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The registered vote of Virginia is: White, 144,545; colored, 118,768; total,
                        263,313. -- The vote cast at the late election was: for Walker, 119,492; for
                        Wells, 101,291; aggregate 220,783, being 42,530 less than the registered
                        vote.</p>
                    <p>There has been much bragging here over what is called the solid and
                        ever-reliable Republican vote of 101,291, and we observe that the
                        Philadelphia Press echoes the boast. Now, of what
                        material is this composed? Of a a handful of whites and the
                        remainder of negroes. Who does not know that the negroes, who, as yet, are
                        uneducated politicians, were organized by white managers rather on the basis
                        of race and color than of State or Federal politics? The calculation of the
                        white managers was that by so organizing them and by calling the mixture
                        "the Republican party," they would secure the Washington influence and carry
                        the election in their own interests. -- But a considerable number of the
                        blacks chose to think for themselves. Some voted for Walker, others did not
                        vote at all. Had the canvass lasted a fortnight longer, it is more than
                        probable that half of the blacks would have abandoned Wells. Since the
                        election, there has been, and without "intimidation or bribery," a perfect
                        stampede of the blacks from the Wells leagues and it threatens a clean
                        sweep. They feel that they have been fooled by the name of Republicans,
                        while they have been arrayed against the whites only on the ground of race
                        and color. They feel that they can be as good Republicans under Walker as
                        under Wells, and by acting with white men as by acting against them. --
                            Whig.</p>

<b>Conservative Party of Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Enquirer and Examiner described the Conservative party in Virginia that
                    elected Walker as governor. Claimed that this party is not corrupted by partisan
                    concerns, and urged the Republicans to win over their support through a kind and
                    conciliatory policy.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Referring to the party in the State which elected Walker so triumphantly, the
                            Enquirer and Examiner says: "As this party
                        was not organized with reference to any participation in Federal politics,
                        and as it is neither embarrassed nor trammeled by any conception with either
                        the Democratic or Republican parties, it will not permit itself to be
                        compromised by either. Its mission is to accomplish the
                            speedy return of Virginia to the Union upon the basis of universal
                            suffrage and universal amnesty, and its future support will be given to
                            the party which, regardless of dead issues and old party lines, shall
                            prove most generous, liberal and efficient in restoring our political
                            liberties and in promoting the prosperity of Virginia and of other
                            States.</p>
                    <p>Acknowledging the claims of neither of the political parties of the North
                        upon us, it will be the policy of Virginia, when she is restored to the
                        Union, to affiliate with that party which possesses sufficient sagacity to
                        discover that kindness may win the support and esteem of a brave people who
                        cannot be driven by proscription and merciless legislation.</p>
                    <p>It is in the power of the administration of General Grant, by a mild, just
                        and conciliatory policy to elevate, purify and strengthen the Republican
                        party, and the signs are indicative of such a course upon his part.</p>
                    <p>Here in Virginia everything presages an era of good feeling, conciliation and
                        political reconcilement of differences of opinion among honest men.</p>
                    <p>The only disturbers of the peace at this time are the despairing and
                        disgraced remnant of the carpet-bag body-guard of Wells. These Parians
                        having deluded the negroes, attempted the blackest treason towards Grant's
                        administration, and become deserved objects of general contempt and
                        loathing, are howling and gnashing their teeth like the damned when they
                        first feel the tortures of eternal punishment. For a while these poor
                        wretches will squirm, yell and make night and day hideous by their false
                        accusations of those whom they vainly attempted to intimidate and proscribe,
                        but as their foul rebellion against Grant and the Republican party has been
                        crushed out, they are as incapable of mischief as fangless serpents.</p>
                    <p>One by one their wretched organs will die of starvation and neglect, their
                        shameless partisans will be silenced by public scorn, and the last
                        carpet-bagger who committed treason against Grant and the Republican party
                        will soon sneak off and be heard of no more. And if it is ever vouchsafed to
                        us to hear the horn of the much "scratched" Lewis Lindsay again, it will be
                        when he sounds a note of triumph at the departure of the vagabonds who
                        sought to array the negroes of Virginia against the policy of Grant and the
                        Republican party.</p>
                    <p>And when we remember that these incendiary adventurers lost, when they were
                        routed, everything but the luxury of abusing their conquerors, we can listen
                        with complacency to their impotent calumnies and abuse. If it does the poor
                        creatures good, why let them howl."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 29th, there was a brilliant assemblage at the White Sulphur Springs,
                        over 800 in number, to witness the presentation of the resolution of the
                        southern visitors to Mr. Peabody. The liveliest interest was manifested in
                        the purpose of the occasion. Mr. Peabody appeared duly attended by several
                        personal friends. Hon. James Lyons addressed the distinguished
                        philanthropist as follows:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Peabody: The Southern men assembled at this fountain of health and
                        pleasure, have for a time, forgotten their pains as well as pleasures to
                        perform a holy duty -- in rendering homage to the most distinguished
                        philanthropist of this or any other age. I know, sir, that some whose nerves
                        are delicate and vision imperfect do start, while others affect to start,
                        when they hear of a meeting of Southern men, and pretend to suppose that the
                        Union is in danger. To such disturbed and disturbing spirits I take leave to
                        say that down-trodden and oppressed as never a Christian people were before
                        -- placed below the negro and stripped of all their constitutional rights --
                        the Southern men, nevertheless, retain their lofty instincts which made
                        their soldiers brave and their women more than Spartan wives and mothers,
                        and to-day they assemble in the highest interests of peace and fraternity to
                        do honor to the noblest friend of the Union -- a gentleman of Northern
                        birth.</p>
                    <p>Sir, you will hear testimony for us, and when you shall have heard the
                        resolutions, which I shall have the honor to read to you, will say of the
                        people of the South that they love virtue, and justly appreciate a good
                        spirit, whether of the North or South; that all good men are received by us
                        as brothers, come from what clime they may, and the vicious from every clime
                        rejected. In this spirit we approach you sir, to-day, to render homage to
                        one who has distinguished himself above all other men by his unexampled
                        beneficence, and to render thanks for the aid you have extended to the cause
                        of education in the South. A great Roman, one of the profoundest thinkers
                        and wisest moralists the world has produced, whose mind was a deep fountain
                        of thought and learning, which his tongue poured out in a stream so pure and
                        limpid that all who tasted received new life and vigor -- he whom a grateful
                        people first proclaimed "Father of his country" -- said, long years ago,
                        "nothing is more noble, more exalted, than to despise riches if you have
                        them not, and if you have them, to employ them in beneficence and
                        liberality." And the most learned man of modern times, of whom it was said
                        that he was the wisest and greatest of mankind, said "Riches are to virtue
                        like baggage to an army, the necessary impediments which hinder the march;"
                        that of the greatest riches, the only real use of them is in the
                        distribution. You, sir, of all men known to us, alone have united the wisdom
                        and philanthropy of the great men of the ante-Christian and the Christian
                        era, and in your noble conduct combine the wise philosophy of the heathen
                        with the benignity of the Christian; and the rare spectacle is exhibited
                        that while in one hemisphere royalty unveils the statue which is to hand
                        down to after ages the likeness of the great American philanthropist, in
                        another hemisphere a nation pours forth its plaudits of him, and all say
                        "God bless him." Your beneficence is no afterthought of declining years and
                        miserly ambition, for I happen to know that many years ago, while justly
                        applauding the generosity of another distinguished American to a suffering
                        nation, this great purpose which you have executed was avowed as the end for
                        which wealth was sought. Rare man, rarely endowed -- rarely, but justly
                        honored. Who may so well say "Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto." But
                        sir, I forbear. My theme has led me too far. We have heard with deep regret
                        of your ill health, and all of every clime and sex unite in heartfelt prayer
                        for your restoration. With your leave, I will read the resolutions.</p>
                    <p>The resolution having been read and presented to Mr. Peabody, that gentleman
                        responded as follows:</p>
                    <p>Mr Lyons and gentlemen of the Committee: I beg to thank you most kindly for
                        the sentiments you have expressed towards me. They have affected me most
                        deeply, and are such, followed as they are by the resolutions you have
                        presented, that it is impossible for me to reply to them as I would. I can
                        only answer briefly, and feel that even then I must claim your indulgence. I
                        can but say, as regards the kind and flattering remarks of your chairman,
                        that I trust the remainder of the time I have to live may not do otherwise
                        than justify good opinion.</p>
                    <p>I should be glad if my strength would permit to speak of my own cordial
                        esteem and regard for the high honor, integrity and heroism of the Southern
                        people. But that, too, I must leave for the present.</p>
                    <p>But I must not omit to say that of all the kind words you have spoken, those
                        referring to the Southern educational funds have been sweetest to my ears.
                        Coming, as they do, from such a distinguished and intelligent body, they
                        corroborate the opinions already expressed by other eminent men of the
                        South. The fibers of my heart are interwoven with its success, as I am sure
                        are yours, and those of all good men everywhere.</p>
                    <p>The enterprise is still very young -- only three years old -- but it is
                        growing with every year, and under the superintendence of the trustees,
                        eminent agent, and under the guidance of distinguished gentlemen of the
                        trust, and with the warm co-operation experienced throughout the South, it
                        cannot do otherwise than prove a success, and I am confident will serve as
                        an auxiliary in restoring the South to a state of higher prosperity and
                        happiness than ever before. God grant it may be so.</p>
