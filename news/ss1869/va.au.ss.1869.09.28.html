<b>The Memory of our Deceased Soldiers</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"W. H. T." asked Virginians to remember and honor their brave soldiers,
                    even though this may be a painful memory to recall. Closed with a poem.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Whilst we are contemplating upon the passing scenes of life, marking each
                        moment as it flies, and recording upon memory's pages the changes incidental
                        to our animated existence -- may we not forget to pause a moment to reflect
                        upon those illustrious dead who fell in vindication of their native soil.
                        Both the ties of nature, and the bonds of affection, demand that we should
                        cherish with high veneration the memory of our brothers, our relatives, our
                        friends. We do not think it at all probable that those dead ones have been
                        forgotten; for how can we erase from memory the mental images of those brave
                        and noble patriots who chose death rather than submission.</p>
                    <p>Some one may say that this subject is too painful to be recalled to mind, and
                        others perhaps, that it is a matter of little consequence whether the dead
                        are remembered or forgotten; but I would think it much more painful to know
                        that we were to die and be forgotten. -- Let us then in our minds' eye
                        review the battle fields where the heroes who fought for justice are
                        sleeping their last sleep of death. Our dead! where are they? Would you seek
                        their last resting place? Then go to the plains of Manassas and you will
                        find them there sleeping in all the honor and glory of the slain soldier.
                        Visit the battle-fields of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and you will
                        find them there. Go to the banks of the James and call for our dead, and the
                        murmuring waters of that stream as they glide swiftly along, on their way to
                        the sea, will respond to your call, and gently proclaim that our dead are
                        resting there. Survey the fields of a thousand battles, and you will
                        perceive there, where many of our friends and comrades are quietly reposing.</p>
                    <p>Sleep on, brave soldiers, and take your rest where the battle-cry disturbs
                        you not, and the clash of arms is never heard. You have fallen in defence of
                        your homes and firesides, and we humbly trust that high Heaven will reward
                        you for your gallantry, and in memory of the slain may it be inscribed upon
                        the hearts of the living, Dulce et decoran est pro
                            patria mori.</p>
                    <p>Sleep on, brave soldiers, take your rest</p>
                    <p>Where the din of battles cease,</p>
                    <p>And the war trump's sound disturb you not,</p>
                    <p>THERE MAY YOU REST IN PEACE.</p>
                    <p>The winds a tale of you unfold--</p>
                    <p>The stream lets murmur too--</p>
                    <p>The leaflets tremble in the breeze,</p>
                    <p>IN MEMORY OF YOU.</p>
                    <p>We'll not forget to mourn your loss,</p>
                    <p>And speak of you with pride;</p>
                    <p>Brave soldiers of the southern cross,</p>
                    <p>HOW NOBLY YOU HAVE DIED.</p>
                    <p>Sleep on brave soldiers! sleep in peace,</p>
                    <p>As quiet as the dove;</p>
                    <p>Till Heaven's trump shall call you home,</p>
                    <p>TO BETTER WORLDS ABOVE.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR: -- On all hands it is acknowledged that the construction of the
                        Valley Rail Road is the greatest enterprise upon which the future of our
                        Valley is based. Without it we languish -- with it, and the advantages we
                        would derive from it in the development of our resources, agricultural,
                        mineral and manufacturing, it would be difficult to estimate the amount of
                        wealth which would fall into the possession of the present owners of the
                        lands of the great Valley. Column after column of your sheet might be
                        exhausted in telling the well understood tale, but at last we know that the
                        construction of the Road is dependent upon the raising of the necessary
                        capital, and that again upon the names and reputation of the men who, as the
                        leaders and conductors of the enterprise, are to disburse it. The writer has
                        nothing to say in disparagement of the gentleman who up to this time has had
                        charge of the fortunes of the Road. He has done his part well and faithfully
                        in arousing attention to the claims of this Road to general and local favor.
                        It is believed that his efforts in that behalf have assured the subscription
                        of the necessary capital, and now the question arises who shall be the
                        leader in the prosecution of the work to its completion -- upon whom shall
                        the meeting of Stockholders, convened for the 12th of October next, devolve
                        this important duty. We have in our own Valley a great and mighty name -- a
                        name famous throughout the civilized world in its connection with science
                        and works of practical utility -- a name which commands the respect of all
                        interested in our great work and which would call forth the necessary
                        contributions of capital -- a citizen of our neighboring county of
                        Rockbridge, which by her liberality and promptitude in voting $400,000 to
                        the stock of the Road has entitled herself to a foremost position in its
                        organization. I nominate for President of the Valley Rail Road Company,
                        Commodore Matthew F. Maury, of Lexington. What says the Press and people of
                        the Valley? AUGUSTA.</p>
