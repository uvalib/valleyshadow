<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday night last, a meeting composed of many colored and a few white
                        Radicals was held in one of the negro churches of this place -- the "African
                        Church." The meeting, we learn, was of the character of a political
                        love-feast. The following white persons were present: Maj. Jno. A. Harman,
                        during the war, "Stonewall" Jackson's Chief Quartermaster; A. T. Maupin,
                        Post Master of Staunton; Wm. L. Herr, U.S. Assessor; Geo. A. Smith, disciple
                        of St. Crispin; Rev. E. P. Phelps, Presiding Elder, M. E. Church North; and
                        Wm. Brown, the only lamb belonging to Mr. Phelp's flock in this place.
                        These, we believe, were all the white persons present.</p>
                    <p>We understand that special invitations to attend this savory love-feast were
                        extended to others. They considered the compliment of a doubtful character;
                        at any rate, did not avail themselves of the privilege to attend.</p>
                    <p>During the meeting, remarks were made, we have been told, by Maj. Jno. A.
                        Harman, Rev. E. P. Phelps, Geo. A. Smith, Rev. Jos. Bowzer, Oscar Morris and
                        Phil. Rozelle -- the last three colored.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Harman, we have been informed, reiterated with increased emphasis and
                        force, with the fervent zeal of a new convert, his previously expressed
                        purpose to unite, heart and hand, soul, mind and strength, with his colored
                        friends in laboring to secure the ends aimed to be accomplished by the
                        Radical party.</p>
                    <p>O tempora! O mores! "Nuff ced."</p>
