<b>The Legislature of Virginia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reported on the meeting of the Legislature of Virginia, which met for the
                    purpose of ratifying the 15th amendment. The Legislature will also elect United
                    States Senators, though the editor disagreed with the decision to hold such an
                    election.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On this day the Legislature of this State meets in Richmond for the purpose
                        of adopting the 15th amendment. It appears from Attorney-General Hoar's
                        opinion, which will be considered tantamount to an order, that the
                        Legislature will be required also to adopt the 14th amendment -- though that
                        is not "nominated in the bond" -- and to elect United States Senators. We
                        think it unfortunate that the papers in Richmond agitated at all the
                        question of the election of Senators. The result has been that they have
                        extorted an opinion which amounts to an order that such election should be
                        had at this session. This question should have been allowed to sleep. The
                        mischief has been done and it is useless to repine.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Lynchburg Republican reported that, although Virginia remains
                    politically disfranchised, she has done great work on internal improvements.
                    Asked Northerners to judge the South on the basis of her conduct after the war.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Lynchburg Republican says that, "much as there
                        is for the South, for Virginia to do, the Southern people have already done
                        much and that under trial which commend their patience, their energy, and
                        their fortitude to the admiration of the world. Virginia is already
                        beginning to work for railroads, and all great works of internal
                        improvement. Her people are pointing the attention of capitalists to the
                        richest mines in the country; to the splendid rivers in the State capable of
                        turning many thousand water-wheels, and to a soil which will grow, or can be
                        made to grow, crops which the most enterprising and ambitious farmer would
                        delight in.</p>
                    <p>Virginians are not yet politically free, however; and that they are not, is a
                        shame and an outrage, for which those who now perpetrate it will, at no very
                        distant day, be held to a strict account, and made to render full atonement.
                        We appeal to the people of the North to judge the people of the South by
                        what they have done since the war; to examine and learn how much this
                        oppressed people have done for the prosperity of a country in which they
                        were outlawed and proscribed. Let the Northern people ponder over these
                        things, and judge whether justice, magnanimity, or expediency even, does not
                        demand that the Southern people be relieved of all further political burdens
                        and military oppression, and be welcomed back to labor, as before, for the
                        glory and prosperity of a common country?"</p>
