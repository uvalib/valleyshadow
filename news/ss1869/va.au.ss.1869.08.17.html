<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator claims that, since Virginia has already complied with all the
                    provisions of Reconstruction, the Republican party can accomplish nothing by
                    failing to fulfill their end of the bargain by re-admitting Virginia into the
                    Union. This course of action would simply prevent the Republican party from
                    every becoming a strong party in the South, and will hinder its national
                    ambitions.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Republican party can make nothing, says the Enquirer, by violating faith with the people of Virginia. They can
                        protract our State of unrest and prolong the embarrassments and vexations
                        under which we have suffered for four years. They can annoy and harass us,
                        but they cannot help themselves as a party by tampering with the compact
                        which has just been executed on our side, but which remains unexecuted on
                        theirs. We are amazed that the sagacious men who lead that party should
                        permit any anxiety for a moment to exist as to their intentions in the
                        premises. But it is unquestionably true that a portion of the party and some
                        of those leaders have seriously calculated the advantages of breaking faith
                        with us. The entertainment of such a thought is a blunder, no matter whether
                        it is never realized or not. It leaves a stain behind it, and impairs the
                        moral force which constitutes the vitality of the party.</p>
                    <p>Should, however, such a breach of faith be actually practised, it
                        would, so far as Virginia is concerned, inflict an immediate and palpable
                        injury on the party of a different kind. The exaction of the test-oath of
                        the members of the Legislature, the dictation of individuals to that body as
                        the recipients of office, any hesitation next winter about the admission of
                        the State (the fifteenth amendment being ratified), would be remembered to
                        the disadvantage of the party which perpetuated such outrages. -- The
                        Republican party never can be a vigorous and healthy party in the Southern
                        States until it abandons every vestige of its disabling and proscriptive
                        policy, and appeals to the judgment and moral approbation of the whites. --
                        We say this deliberately, and every intelligent Republican must feel it to
                        be true. Proscription, most infamous proscription, has been tried in
                        Tennessee, and the mere force of public sentiment all over the country has
                        burst the unnatural bands. It was attempted here in Virginia, and it
                        defeated the party that attempted it. And now any chicanery and dishonesty,
                        any armed fraud, while it may carry some immediate point, will recoil upon
                        the party which practises it -- will inevitably be punished in
                        the future. The Republican party is not only disliked in the South; it is in
                        disrepute. We believe that it has dealt treacherously with us. -- Intensify
                        this impression -- add to it by some unworthy act -- and it will take in
                        proportion a longer time for the Republican party to have any real strength
                        in the South.</p>
                    <p>When hereafter -- and we presume it looks to the hereafter -- it comes before
                        the Southern voters, it must, if it wants to succeed, come with some show of
                        character, with words of kindness, and with appeals to interest. The period
                        for the lash is passed. The whole South will soon be in the Union, and will
                        have a good many votes. Its alliance must be courted by any party. It must
                        command as much respect as the Irish or the German vote.</p>
                    <p>The question which we shall ask, will be:-- Can we trust you? Will you be
                        friends with us? Will you help us?</p>
                    <p>An affirmative answer to all these questions will build up a Republican party
                        in the South. Any further persecution or treachery will delay that work.</p>
                    <p>Now let us be understood: we do not want any Republican party here, but you do. We want smooth
                        water and rest at present, and therefore we tell
                        you that you help yourselves by giving us no further trouble. It is a mere
                        selfish calculation.</p>
                    <p>Now we say the people of Virginia have complied to the
                            letter -- and more -- with the
                        requirements of Congress. We have not only ratified (we, the whites) a
                        constitution which goes far beyond the Reconstruction acts, but we have
                        elected a New Yorker and a Republican our Governor; we have chosen two
                        Republicans for our Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General; we have chosen
                        Joseph Segar for our Congressman at large; we have elected Booker, Milnes,
                        Ridgway, Gibson, McKenzie, all Republicans except Mr. Ridgway, and all Union
                        men, to Congress. We voted for Hunnicutt in this Richmond district; but he
                        was beaten. We expect to ratify the fifteenth amendment. And now we ask you,
                        What more do you want? and we warn you to keep faith
                            with us.</p>
