<b>The Valley</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor heaps scorn and contempt on the radicals of the state who have
                    organized black voters against the whites. Claims these radicals actually care
                    nothing about the blacks except to use them to get into office. He also says the
                    Valley, despite appearances, will suffer as much as any other section of
                    Virginia from Republican policies.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Valley apparently will not suffer like the East by the operation of the
                        Underwood constitution and its county organization article. But this
                        advantage of the Valley over us is only apparent, as will be obvious in a
                        moment. The taxes under this constitution will fall almost exclusively on
                        the whites, and the Valley counties, having a largely preponderating white
                        population, will be taxed tremendously. Augusta will pay double the taxes
                        that Pittsylvania will have to pay, although Augusta has only three members
                        of the House of Delegates, and the fraction of a senator, while Pittsylvania
                        has four delegates and a whole senator. It is therefore in this point of
                        view particularly the interest of the Valley that the Conservatives shall
                        secure the Legislature, which will lay the taxes. This is as plain as the
                        nose in a man's face. Unless the Valley counties are willing to be taxed to
                        death, let them do their full duty in this election.</p>
                    <p>But again: if the Radicals carry this election, and get the control of the
                        State government, it will be their policy to strengthen the negro element in that section. How will they do it?
                        -- They will quarter as many negro officers as possible in those counties.
                        The Legislature will give them Radical county judges, Radical circuit
                        judges, and the Radical courts will give them Radical commissioners in
                        chancery, and whenever the Governor or the Legislature or the judiciary can
                        make their influence felt, they will make it felt for the purpose of
                        strengthening and sustaining their party in that quarter. Let our Valley
                        friends remember West Virginia and Missouri. -- Enquirer
                            and Examiner.</p>
                    <p>There never was a more perfect organization than that which the Radicals have
                        banded in this State. A few venal, shameless white men have organized the
                        poor negroes into leagues, and banded them by paths, to support the measures
                        and candidates of the party. Every species of terrorism that can be imagined
                        is exercised over these poor deluded creatures to hold them in firm concord
                        with the wicked wretches who care nothing for them except to get their
                        votes. The negroes seem to be impervious to arguments of any kind. They only
                        know that the leaders of the leagues require them to do thus and so, and
                        they blindly obey the word of command. There is no reason in them, and
                        therefore no appeals to that faculty can lie with them. They willingly
                        accept the leadership of the vilest white reprobates, and spurn the counsel
                        of the best men among us. To what danger is the public welfare not exposed,
                        when such a condition of things as this is found to exist in the State? --

                        Church. The Church was much crowded and delighted, and moved to tears in
                        listening to a most appropriate and very touching address from the orator
                        selected for the occasion, Capt. Jno. Paul of Harrisonburg. The congregation
                        then repaired to the churchyard and covered the twenty-six graves of the noble boys who fell, as the immediate
                        representatives of this vicinity, in the unequal strife, with beautiful
                        floral offerings. Afterwards they returned to the Church and listened to a
                        brief address from Mr. Alex. B. Cochran, on the same subject.</p>
                    <p>At night Messrs. Harrison, Effinger, Cochran &amp; Echols addressed the
                        citizens of Mt. Solon and vicinity, on the political condition of the
                        country. Their very interesting speeches were listened to with more than
                        ordinary interest, by ladies and gentleman, and a small attendance of
                        colored voters, up to a very late hour. It is to be regretted that the
                        people towards Sangersville, Emmanuel's Church and North River Gap were not
                        represented in the meeting. Our speakers ought to take more pains to inform
                        the people of the necessity of seeing that their names were correctly registered before, and if in different
                        precincts or counties that they get certificates in
                        time to place themselves on the list where they will now vote. -- Many are ignorant of this necessity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jno. J. Cupp addressed the voters of Mt. Zion last night, on the subject
                        of the present canvass. TOM.</p>

                    <p>It is agreed on all hands, that the constitution will be adopted, in one
                        shape or another, and it behooves you to reflect most seriously upon what
                        will be our condition, if the constitution shall be adopted in its present
                        shape, with a large class of our most intelligent citizens excluded from
                        voting, and almost the whole white population excluded from all the offices
                        and from serving on juries. The taxing power, too, in the hands of the black
                        man, who having but little property to be taxed, it would not be manifest to
                        them, that they would suffer by high taxes; and those who would have control
                        of them, and would hold most of the offices, would have a direct interest in
                        high taxes to lavish the money upon themselves.</p>
                    <p>Can you live under such a Government as that? It almost takes the breath to
                        think of it. And we appeal to you, as you regard your own interest, and the
                        welfare of your children, not to stand idly by whilst we are struggling, but
                        to come forward in all your strength, to help us to avoid this great
                        calamity. You can have no higher duty than that of self-preservation, and if
                        you stand off now, and for want of your aid, this constitution with the two
                        clauses, which we now have it in our power to strike out, shall be fastened
                        upon us, you will reproach yourselves as long as you live. If we strike out
                        these two objectionable clauses, and elect a conservative Governor and
                        conservative legislature to administer the Government, we can live under it,
                        and in a short time, we may ameliorate it so that we may prosper.</p>
                    <p>Some thinking men are very apprehensive that this constitution, in its
                        present shape, will be fixed upon us. I do not, and I will not despair. If
                        the white men of Virginia do their duty, the Conservatives will not only be
                        successful, but they will be triumphant. But to do our duty, every man must
                        register, who can register, and he must vote.</p>
                    <p>No man must think that his single vote is not important. The result is made
                        up of individual votes, and though we may be in the middle of harvest, that
                        must not stand in the way; better, far better, that the whole harvest should
                        be lost, than that the Constitution should be fastened upon us in its
                        present shape. Let us amend it, and then adopt it."</p>

                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS:--I wish you would urge all the colored people of the county
                        to register promptly. The Commissioner of the Revenue will soon be making
                        out his lists of persons liable to taxation and to work on the roads. He
                        often finds it difficult to ascertain which of the colored people are liable
                        to tax, and to do road duty. Now if they will proceed to register at once,
                        the Commissioner will know exactly in what district they live, and when the
                        Sheriff goes around to collect his tax, he will know exactly where to lay
                        his hands on the men who are liable to be called on to pay.</p>
