<b>Speech of Colonel Baldwin Before the Reconstruction Committee</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An extract from the Dispatch, remarking on the comments of Mr. Baldwin
                    before the Reconstruction Committee. Mr. Baldwin spoke on the desire of the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>[Extract from the Editorial Correspondence of the Dispatch.]</p>
                    <p>After giving Colonel Baldwin's explanation (made at the request of the
                        Committee) touching the church property question, the writer reports his
                        remarks in reply to Wells:</p>
                    <p>This argument was about as clear, frank and forcible as any I have ever
                        heard. It was uttered in a manner that carried conviction of its sincerity
                        and truth. Generally he asseverated the earnestness of the people of
                        Virginia in their desire for restoration and peace. They were tired and sick
                        of strife, and the delay in the restoration of order and harmony was
                        disastrous to their interests and those of the nation. He pronounced a
                        eulogy upon the fairness and justice of the courts of Virginia and the
                        purity of her judiciary, and declared that nowhere on earth was justice
                        administered with more impartiality and integrity. Contending that this was
                        a sufficient guarantee of the fair and just disposition of the public mind,
                        he declared his solemn conviction that there was no disposition in Virginia
                        to harm or injure any one through denial of justice under the law, and he
                        believed that if Virginia were restored according to the plan of the
                        committee no mortal being would suffer from such a thing as partiality and
                        malice in the administration of law.</p>
                    <p>Virginia had (immediately after the war) through her Legislature accommodated
                        herself to the new order of things produced by the war, and had voluntarily
                        accorded to the negro his rights as they were accorded by the State
                        Constitution of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and other Northern States; and
                        if there had ever been an attempt to impair the rights of the negro he had
                        never heard of it. -- He begged that if anybody thought differently with
                        regard to what he had stated they would say so. He felt that what he said
                        could not be contradicted, and would not.</p>
                    <p>Virginia having had no voice in national affairs, was not divided by national
                        parties. True, her people had had their opinions, and had sympathized with
                        those who had offered them the most liberal terms of readmission into the
                        Union. Therefore they had desired the success of the Democrats in the recent
                        election; but when that party was defeated they considered the question
                        settled, and now were anxious for restoration, submitting to the national
                        judgment, which they could not evade. True, they had opposed negro suffrage
                        -- a thing not considered probable at the expiration of the war in any
                        quarter -- and they even now stated frankly that they did not consider the
                        negro qualified for voting, ignorant and just out of slavery, as he was. To
                        the people of the North, where the negro stood as one in twenty thousand,
                        negro suffrage was a matter of no consequence, but in Virginia we had
                        400,000 negroes. To admit so many uneducated whites suddenly into the
                        constituent body might justly be considered perilous to the State. The
                        experiment would not give rise to less apprehension because it was made with
                        blacks.</p>
                    <p>But notwithstanding all this, they were unwilling to continue a contest on a
                        settled question, and regarding it so, were anxious to return to the Union
                        and to see and end of strife and bitterness. They were earnest, and would
                        act in entire frankness and good faith.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin, in much that he had to say which was in direct opposition to
                        what Governor Wells said yesterday, alluded to the statements of that
                        gentleman in very plain terms. -- He showed them to be not only unjust, but
                        at variance with the wishes and sentiments of some of the more reliable and
                        influential of his own party. Alluding to Governor Wells accusations
                        touching the disposition of the people towards Northern men, Mr. Baldwin
                        stated that there were two kinds of immigrants into Virginia -- the
                        immigrant proper and the "carpet-bagger," whose motives and conduct had
                        affixed that name to him everywhere. The former the people respected; the
                        latter they execrated. There was, just after the war, a large number of
                        deserters from the Confederate army, and degraded men, who came forth from
                        their hiding places, and a large number of camp followers and others, the
                        debris of the Federal army, who were thrown in the convulsion upon the
                        South; and no country was cursed with so ravenous and unscrupulous a set of
                        men. These had rapaciously seized upon the offices of the South, brutally
                        driving out gray-haired and dependent occupants. These persons were regarded
                        with detestation. But the sincere and honest immigrant was held in respect
                        and confidence. -- All who thus came to live with us and cast their lot with
                        ours were heartily welcomed. They would be ever received with open arms, and
                        would always be respected and valued as useful members of society. The
                        carpet-baggers could never be regarded except with contempt in Virginia.
                        Hurt him we would not, in his person or in his rights. He could be safer in
                        these nowhere else. But we claimed the right which belonged to the meanest
                        creature on earth -- to withhold from him our respect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin called the attention of the committee to the patent
                        triple-acting, self-feeding machinery explained yesterday by Governor Wells.
                        It consisted of a committee to three in each county. (Mr. Baldwin wondered
                        that it was not four, as there were four principal offices in each county.)
                        This committee was to receive the application of every man in the county who
                        wanted to have his disabilities removed, and pass upon it; but no man holding an office could have his
                        application considered. He must disgorge -- resign; that was a sine qua non. The office was wanted. Now, after
                        receiving and passing upon an application, it was sent to the Central
                        Committee, and if it was fortunate enough to get through there, it had
                        finally to receive the endorsement of General Wells himself before it was
                        forwarded, duly recommended to Congress; and that body had been informed
                        that it would be highly imprudent for it to relieve any one from
                        disabilities who had not run the gauntlet of these committees and obtained
                        the final approval of Governor Wells. He would make no comment on such
                        extraordinary machinery as this. He left it to the judgment of the
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin was interrogated briefly only by Mr. Boutwell, who stated that
                        the Government felt obliged to Union men in the South, and would not be
                        willing to place them in a position of danger. They must be protected. He
                        saw the difficult of exacting any guarantee of the people of Virginia with
                        this view, or rather, he saw the difficulty of giving guarantee; but he
                        desired Mr. Baldwin to state what he could say on the point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. B. replied in substance, with an earnestness and fervor that must have
                        impressed even Mr. Boutwell, that he believed the people of Virginia were
                        incapable of partiality or cruelty in the administration of justice, and
                        that those called "loyal" or Union men would be safe in Virginia as they
                        could be anywhere on earth. He believed that a large majority of the people
                        of Virginia sustained the movement attempted to be carried out by this
                        committee, and speaking upon his honor as a Virginian, and a gentleman, he
                        believed they were acting in good faith, without qualification or
                        reservations and would carry out the laws in all fairness and quality to all
                        men and classes. Their past conduct, their patience, and respect for law
                        that had maintained the most perfect order in the recent period of agitation
                        and irritation were, he thought, the evidence that they were to be fully
                        trusted.</p>

<b>The Underwood Constitution and the Test Oath</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Based on the account in the Journal of the Convention, the Conservatives
                    voted unanimously to defeat the provision on the Test Oath, and were unable to
                    reject or modify it. This contradicts a report of the Richmond State Journal,
                    which claimed the Conservatives had every opportunity to defeat the Test Oath
                    provision.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the Richmond State
                            Journal (Radical) states that the Conservative members of the
                        Convention which framed the Underwood Constitution, had it in their power to
                        defeat the test oath so much objected to, but would not do it because, by
                        retaining it, the Constitution would be made so odious as to make its
                        rejection by the people certain. "This statement," he says, "was made before
                        the Reconstruction Committee by Governor Wells, and evidently made a deep
                        impression. And the impression will not soon wear off."</p>
                    <p>The Journal of the Convention tells a very different tale. When the section
                        of the Constitution requiring all office-holders to take the test oath was
                        adopted, every Conservative member of the Convention
                            voted against it, and it was carried, against their votes and
                        earnest wishes, by the Radical majority. And there was no time, then nor
                        afterwards, that they "had it in their power to defeat the test oath."
                        Towards the close of the session it was rumored that Mr. Thomas, of Henry
                        county, a leading Radical, intended to propose some modification of the
                        oath. As we happen to know, the matter was a subject of frequent
                        conversation amongst the Conservative members. They unanimously and
                        anxiously desired to have the test oath stricken out of the Constitution,
                        but it was understood that Mr. Thomas did not propose to do that, but only
                        to modify it in some way not now recollected. A few of the Conservatives
                        took the ground that, while they would gladly vote to strike out the oath,
                        they would not vote for a modification of the section merely exempting the
                        inferior and less important office-holders from the necessity of taking the
                        oath, but still requiring it of Governor, Judges, members of the Legislature
                        &amp; c. They argued that such a proposition was insulting to the great
                        body of our people, and was only intended as a bribe to the multitude of
                        aspirants to petty offices to vote for the Constitution. -- Most of the
                        Conservatives, however, determined to vote for whatever amelioration should
                        be proposed.</p>
                    <p>In pursuance of his plan, Mr. Thomas, on the 16th of April, "moved that the
                        rules be suspended, for the purpose of modifying the oath of office." (See
                        Journal, p. 379)</p>
                    <p>The chair decided that it required a two-thirds vote to suspend the rules,
                        and the Convention sustained the decision. This decision seems to have been
                        perfectly correct, although most of the Conservatives voted against it. --
                        The question then recurred upon the motion made by Mr. Thomas, and it was
                        rejected for the want of a two-thirds vote in the affirmative. Five
                        Conservatives voted against the proposition, but if all of them had voted
                        for it, there would still have been less than the two-thirds necessary to
                        carry it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Platt next moved that the rules be suspended "for the purpose of
                        modifying the oath in regard to county offices." Eight Conservatives voted
                        against this proposition, but if all had voted for it, it would still have
                        failed.</p>
                    <p>On the same day Mr. Williams moved that the rules be suspended "for the
                        purpose of offering a resolution to strike out
                        the sixth section," which prescribes one of the oaths of office. The chair
                        ruled the motion out of order, and was sustained by the majority; every
                        Conservative voting for the proposition.</p>
                    <p>It thus appears that the Conservative members of the Convention unanimously
                        opposed the test oath when it was inserted in the Constitution, that they
                        unanimously voted to strike it out, and that if all of them had voted for it
                        they could not have obtained even a modification of the oath.</p>
