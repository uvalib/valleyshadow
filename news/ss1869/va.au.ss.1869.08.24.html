<b>Sad Occurrence--Jacob Scherer Killed</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Account of the death of Jacob Scherer, who was a member of a party that
                    broke into the home of a "Cyprian quadroon" woman who had been co-habiting with
                    John M. Stanley. Stanley allegedly fired a pistol as the party entered and
                    killed Sherer.<br>(Names in announcement:  Ginnie Sorrels,  Jacob Scherer,  John B. Scherer,  Jacob Parent,  John M. Stanley)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday night last, about 12 o'clock, a party of young men of this place,
                        some disguised as colored men, went to the house on Market street occupied
                        by Ginnie Sorrels, Cyprian quadroon, with the view of ducking a man whom
                        they suspected of co-habiting with her, and whom they expected to find there
                        at that time. Several entered the house; a pistol was fired, and Jacob
                        Scherer (son of John B. Scherer, Esq., of this place) one of the party
                        disguised, was almost instantly killed. The ball entered the left side broke
                        a rib and passed through the heart and both lungs. A man was seen to run
                        from the house as soon as the shot was fired. After some time had elapsed,
                        the chief of Police, Jacob Parent, accompanied by others, went to the house
                        of John M. Stanley, and arrested him as the party charged with firing the
                        pistol which caused the death of Jacob Scherer.</p>
                    <p>On the evidence adduced at the Coroner's inquest on the same night, Stanley
                        was committed to jail to await his trial before an examining court this
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the saddest occurrences that has ever taken place in this
                        community. There was no malice, not even ill-will, on the part of either
                        party. They were mutual friends, and the friends of both parties are the
                        friends of each other. -- The friends of Stanley, in common with the whole
                        community, deeply sympathise with the sorely distressed relations
                        and many friends of the deceased, so unexpectedly and suddenly cut down in
                        the full vigor of health and in the prime of life.</p>
