                    <p>FELLOW CITIZENS: -- The general confusion in our town on Wednesday last, and
                        the rumor freely circulated to my injury, that I had withdrawn as a
                        candidate for Congress in this District, renders it necessary that I should
                        issue from the press this additional card.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis has withdrawn, and although unexpressed publicly, I believe in my
                        favor, I did agree with him to withdraw, provided the people of the District
                            <emph rend="italic">would</emph> have a candidate with disabilities; and
                        provided that the gallant Confederate soldier, F. W. M. Holliday, of
                        Frederick county, with his disabilities, would consent to run. He is a
                        gentleman and a scholar. He shed his blood in the Southern cause, and was
                        rash in his desire to shed it, and if you <emph rend="italic">will</emph>
                        have a man with disabilities, in God's name, have a man that you know where
                        to find, and who served you faithfully in your hour of trial. For such a man
                        I will withdraw, and he can depend upon my support.</p>
                    <p>In my card of Wednesday, words were used in speaking of John F. Lewis,
                        perhaps under momentary excitement, which I desire to here, unsolicited to
                        withdraw, and to commend him to you as a candidate on your State ticket in
                        every way worthy of your enthusiastic support.</p>
                    <p>I wish you all to understand that for you I am fighting all along the line. I
                        am the Conservative Walker ticket, <emph rend="italic">white man's</emph>
                        candidate, and will not withdraw unless a convention rule me off, or for
                        Holliday, who is in every respect <sic>worthy your support</sic>, and not a
                        man like Harris, who during the war, and now, will not let his friends or
                        foes understand him. Is he anxious to secure the Wells and negro vote? Let
                        him have them! I neither ask, expect, nor desire the vote of a single Wells
                        man in the District. I would rather be defeated with the white Conservative
                        vote, than elected with the vote of the Wells white men and the Wells
                        negroes. I am an enthusiastic Walker ticket man; the white man's candidate
                        for the public good. I have by this action willingly thrown off possibly
                        four thousand votes. I have a right to expect the white Virginia men to
                        rally around me. I have a right to expect the undivided Walker ticket vote
                        of the District; and I tell you, if I don't receive it, a Radical or a negro
                        will represent your interests in Congress. Men of Shenandoah, Rockbridge and
                        Botetourt, where I have been, listen to what I say, and believe me. I am
                        your friend, because I believe you are willing to do the best you can, and
                        rescue the old Commonwealth from the hand of the barbarian, and her citizens
                        who just now are in danger of being welcomed "with bloody hands to
                        hospitable graves"</p>
                    <p>Tell me, some friend of John T. Harris, what was the result of his private
                        interview with Wells on yesterday when I and others were honestly casting
                        flowers upon the Confederate graves as the graves of brave men? Was he
                        seeking the negro vote, or was he simply getting into Wells' good graces
                        that he might get the radical influence toward the removal of his
                        disabilities by Congress in the event of his election? Or was he calculating
                        upon the election of the Wells ticket, and a Radical Legislature, and
                        thinking how important it was to be on his right side, as he would have to
                        nominate the Judges? Would he take the Judgeship through Wells and the
                        Radical Legislature? Does he desire that the Radical league shall not make a
                        nomination now for Congress, so that they will treat him as their nominee? I
                        answer every question asked me; why won't he? The people have a right to
                        demand it. It was demanded as a right of Cataline when he stood with a
                        dogged silence before the Roman Senate.</p>
                    <p>Men of this District! Have a Convention, if you choose. All I ask, is that
                        you nominate a white man, a gentleman and a Virginian. I promise to give him
                        an enthusiastic support, be he Holliday, Baldwin, Stuart, Skinner, Jas. B.
                        Dorman, or any other good man that you can produce in the District. I tell
                        you Gray is all right, and his text is "for the public good." Still if I am
                        not to your fancy; if I cannot give you satisfaction, have a convention,
                        throw me aside, and take a better man.</p>
                    <p>It may be important for us to have a representative to protect Virginia's
                        interest. Don't elect a man who is of doubtful position, or who cannot be
                        sure of his seat, who may be sent back by his disabilities, and the place
                        given to some extreme Radical. If the Radical leagues don't make a
                        nomination, it is equivalent to a secret nomination of Harris by them, and
                        will be so understood. If the Conservatives don't make a nomination, it
                        should be considered as equivalent to a nomination of Gray by them.</p>
                    <p>I am perfectly willing that between Harris and myself, John F. Lewis shall
                        decide, upon a fair statement of all the facts, which shall withdraw. I am
                        perfectly willing that Col. Gilbert C. Walker shall decide; and that I may
                        not be misunderstood, I am perfectly willing that all the facts may be
                        fairly represented, and that Gen. Lee may decide which and what is best for
                        that public good; but I am not willing that Wells and the negro shall
                        decide.</p>
                    <p>White men of the district, elect Robert A. Gray, and he will do the best he
                        can for you; this is a fair contract, and Gray promises to carry out,
                        faithfully, his part of the contract.</p>
                    <p>My position, briefly stated, is this; the great doctrine of "Post 19," for
                        peace and good will, early reconstruction, and future development, flowers
                        to be scattered by woman's hand on every soldier's grave in the land,
                        whether North or South, whether Union or Confederate, as the grave of a
                        brave man who died for what he thought was the right.</p>
                    <p>Under the sod and the dew.</p>
                    <p>Waiting the judgment day;</p>
                    <p>Love and tears for the blue,</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Tears and love</emph> for the gray.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>R. A. GRAY.</p>
                    <p>Harrisonburg, June 11th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>P.S. -- Many respectable colored people having applied to me since the
                        appearance of the above card, to know whether I had reference in it to any
                        colored man who thought of voting the Walker ticket. I answer,
                        unhesitatingly, no. I only spoke of the <emph rend="italic">Wells</emph>
                        negro, and am therefore induced to make some slight corrections in my card,
                        to be understood as I desire it to be, and to make a very few remarks to our
                        colored friends, which I will take pleasure in doing more at length on the
                        stump. No people in the world ever behaved better than the colored people
                        during the war. I believe they are willing to do right now, if the situation
                        is explained, and they can understand what is right and best. I look upon
                        the colored man, who has made up his mind to vote for the Walker ticket, as
                        a well meaning colored citizen, entitled to our respect, and the votes of
                        all such, of course, I would desire to have.</p>
                    <p>I say to the colored man, as I have said all the time, publicly and
                        privately, that their true interest is identified with the Walker ticket. --
                        They have always looked upon me as one who would not willingly deceive them.
                        I tell them now that they lose no right by going for Walker that Wells or
                        even Grant could give; and they gain by voting for Walker what neither Wells
                        or Grant could give -- the good will of the white people among whom they
                        were born and raised. But if ruled by Wells and the leagues they vote <emph
                            rend="italic">en masse</emph> against the White people of the State.
                        Will the white race (when the time comes; as it probably will come,)
                        generously forget and forgive such action? That is an important question for
                        the colored man to consider. Won't some friendly white man talk with him
                        about it? Colored man, if you can vote for the Walker ticket you can vote
                        for Gray; if you can vote for Gray you can vote the Walker ticket. Both
                        will, I hope, do you justice. It has become Wells' interest to array the
                        black against the white race. I believe that single interest (even if that
                        were all) endangers the peace of the Commonwealth, and the safety of her
                        citizens; hence I encourage you in all honesty to give the vote I recommend,
                        for your own and the public good. R.A. GRAY.</p>

                <summary>Letter from R.A. Gray seeking to clear up a misconception that he had
                    withdrawn from the congressional race. He said he would only do so if a
                    convention formed to nominated another candidate. Otherwise, he asks for the
                    votes of all conservative men to prevent the election of any supporter of Wells.
                    Also, in his postscript, Gray told black voters that voting for Walker served
                    their own interests as well as those of whites.</summary>

                    <p>We hope and expect that Augusta will be the banner county. She must beat
                        Loudoun and Rockingham. She should give a majority of 2500 for Walker. She
                        can do it, if all her citizens do their duty next Tuesday. Will any be
                        remiss? We hope not. Come out, one and all, and aid in rescuing your mother,
                        Virginia, from ruin. She appeals to all her sons to do their whole duty on
                        Tuesday next. She is threatened with violence -- has she a dastard son who
                        will not rush to her rescue -- if so, let him be anathema marenatha. He
                        should be driven from her household as one unworthy a place in it. Such in
                        this good county we hope and believe will be few. There should be none, but
                        unfortunately there are some such.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The fact that the rights of the colored citizens are secured to them whether
                        Walker or Wells be elected, and whether the Constitution be adopted in its
                        unexpurgated or expurgated form has been made manifest to them, and it has
                        been time and again demonstrated that it is their interest to cultivate
                        friendly relations and vote with the great mass of the whites among whom
                        they live, and upon whom they are dependent for shelter and employment. In
                        establishing these propositions so clearly as to be understood by the
                        colored voters, the whites have discharged their duty to themselves and to
                        the colored people. They have enabled the colored voters to understand the
                        effect of their votes, and they will, consequently, be held responsible for
                        them. They will not be able to say, after the election, that they would have
                        voted differently if they had known that they were denying rights to the
                        whites which the whites had accorded to them; that whilst they made nothing
                        for themselves they voluntarily imposed disabilities upon the whites. The
                        whites have done their duty -- they have instructed the colored voters so
                        that they will be able to vote understandingly. The colored voters will not
                        be able to plead ignorance in excuse for voting to disfranchise the whites.
                        The response to such a plea will be: "Ye knew your duty, but ye did it not."</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday night last, Alex. B. Cochran delivered a speech of an hour and a
                        half in the Court-house, a considerable portion of which was addressed to
                        the many colored persons who were present, and he was followed by Maj. H. M.
                        Bell, who delivered a short speech which was exclusively addressed to the
                        same class of voters. Both of these gentlemen made good speeches and gave
                        good counsel to the colored voters. They were made clearly to understand
                        what it was their interest and their duty to do. As Mr. Cochran told them,
                        "if they sinned, it would be against light and knowledge."</p>
                    <p>On Saturday night last, in response to a written call upon him by a number of
                        colored men, Col. Jno. B. Baldwin delivered an address to them in the
                        Court-house. It was frank, plain, pointed, sensible, practical, and marked
                        with that degree of ability which distinguishes his speeches generally. We
                        think it was one of Col. Baldwin's best, and that is saying not a little. It
                        should have the effect of causing the colored voters present to vote not
                        only understandingly, but right. If it does not, it clearly shows that they
                        are so deaf to friendly counsel and unmoved by irrefutable arguments, and
                        that they assume a position of hostility to the whites among whom they live
                        voluntarily and knowingly, for which the whites will be justified in holding
                        them responsible. We hope that a number of them will have the good sense to
                        vote for Walker and against the disfranchising test-oath clauses or the
                        Constitution. As the registration shows that Walker can be elected without
                        their votes, it is more to their interest to vote for him, than it is for
                        ours, as they should be able to see now, and as they will see in a short
                        time.</p>

                <summary>The editor reiterated all the reasons why blacks will benefit if they vote
                    for Walker instead of Wells. Reminded them that supporting Wells, against the
                    wishes and warnings of conservative whites, would bring an expected backlash
                    against African-Americans once white Virginians regained power.</summary>

                    <p>The fortunes of this State, says the <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph>, are
                        now imperilled by the depravity of a few thousand recreant white men greedy
                        for plunder however secured, and the contrariness of another few thousand
                        reckless white men, ready to risk all to enjoy the privilege of pouting. --
                        The great mass from the sea to the Alleghanies, from the Maryland to the
                        North Carolina line, stand ready to answer the summons to the polls. The
                        first "few thousands" to which we have referred also await that summons.
                        They fully intend to vote; but it will not be to save, but to make shipwreck
                        of the State. They go to the polls reeking with the odors of the "Union
                        League," shunning the observation of all respectable citizens, and
                        stealthily deposit their ballots, for Wells and Harris and negro candidates
                        for the Legislature. They will vote to retain the test-oath in the
                        constitution, thereby excluding all the whites in the Commonwealth from
                        office -- so that vile creatures like themselves may batten on the carcass
                        which they seek to make.</p>
                    <p>With these scavengers of society the other "few thousand" to which we
                        referred have made so far common cause quoad results. -- These too are
                        assisting in the election of Wells, and the handing of this fair
                        Commonwealth over to the foul embraces of the negroes. In a death struggle
                        between the white and the black races -- a decisive conflict for power
                        between them -- they wrap the drapery of their stainless gentility around
                        them, and superciliously announce that there is "no difference." They see
                        the wavering standard of the white race rise and fall in the alternations of
                        battle, and not one blow of theirs is yet exerted to steady it -- not one
                        word of "God-speed" is uttered to give fresh heart to the over-strained
                        champions.</p>
                    <p>Who that recognizes in the slightest degree the ties of kindred, in such an
                        hour as this, can see that balance tremble with the fate of a gallant people
                        -- and stand unmoved? Who can see all the precious remnant of Virginia's
                        hopes, set up as a common prize to be scrambled for by negroes, without
                        making one effort to preserve so rich a treasure? Shall such a one look
                        coldly on and see these pleasant homes abandoned to the wild carnival of
                        negro domination -- see the high-spirited boys of Virginia forsake, with
                        broken hearts, the cherished scenes of their love and their valor -- see the
                        gentle daughters, dragged down by the remorseless hand of poverty, the prey
                        of lousy adventurers, and objects of pity even to negroes -- see their aged
                        parents, bowed down with an over load of sorrow, hurried to the grave with
                        the tottering steps of despair? Men may talk about "honors" -- about
                        "sentiment:" -- as well quote Tom Moore in a fire -- as well simper about
                        the moonshine in the shock of battle. It is no time for wire-drawn
                        sensibility, nor vain retrospect, nor "idle tears." The body politic of this
                        Commonwealth is in the relentless embrace of the Radical Python, and every
                        thew and every sinew must perform its functions, to resist that fatal coil,
                        and disengage the victim. Shall the foot say to the rest of the body, "I am
                        weary" -- or the hand, "I will not defile myself with the slimy monster?"</p>
                    <p>The time is short. The canvass will close in a few days. We believe we shall
                        triumph; but the enemy is boastful and at least affects confidence. There
                        are complicated influences at work, and we must look to every joint in the
                        harness and see that not an arrow is missing from the quiver. We fight under
                        every disadvantage -- with the sun of power blinding our aim -- against
                        malice, against craft, against the compact organization riveted by secret
                        oaths, and wielded like a machine by able and unscrupulous men. With so much
                        at stake, we cannot spare a squadron from the field, or issue even one
                        solitary leave of absence. These few days must be passed in earnest, busy,
                        persistent work, day in and day out, by officer and by private -- that <emph
                            rend="italic">all</emph> may be ready, and every soldier at his post,
                        when the trumpet shall sound the final charge.</p>

                        power, which we can save from the general wreck; and unless we can secure
                        the next Assembly and Governor it is plain to the meanest understanding that
                        the government of Virginia will become a hideous engine, for the torture of
                        our people, and the ruin of the State.</p>

                        by our friends, and its abuse by our open and avowed enemies. The
                        Constitution is now a sheathed sabre. If drawn by a Wells Legislature they
                        will cut you down without remorse. See to it, then, that they never grasp

                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>STAUNTON, June 25th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>DEAR SIR: -- I suppose there can be no doubt that the Walker party have it in
                        their power to elect a representative to Congress from this District, but I
                        fear they are about to let the Radicals take control of the District, almost
                        without a struggle.</p>
                    <p>The whole Walker movement is founded, if I understand it, upon a
                        determination, frankly and fairly to accept the situation, and in all
                        respects to make the best of it.</p>
                    <p>To elect a man to Congress who, by the Constitution and laws of the United
                        States, is prohibited to hold any office State or Federal, would seem to be
                        flying in the face of the national authority, and would give Congress a
                        substantial reason not only to reject our Representative, but to disregard
                        all votes cast for him, and to give the place to his Radical opponent.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Conrad, or Judge Harris were eligible to Congress there would be no
                        objection to either of them, though there would be a serious objection to
                        the running of both at the same time. The election of either now, would be
                        simply to hand over the District to the Wells Radicals, for it could hardly
                        be supposed that Congress would remove the disabilities of a Conservative in
                        order to let him take a seat in Congress which a Radical wanted. I had hoped
                        that the Convention called to meet in Harrisonburg, on Monday last would
                        settle this matter by giving us one eligible Candidate for which all the
                        Walker men could vote, and I have abstained from any agency in the matter
                        for the reason that Mr. Robert A. Gray, the only candidate who is eligible
                        under the Constitution is a near connection and personal friend in whose
                        behalf I dislike to make any public demonstration. As matters now stand, I
                        can see no course left for the Walker men of the district, but to elect Mr.
                        Gray, and to give him such a united vote as to insure the defeat of any
                        Wells Radical who, at the last moment, may be sprung upon us. I have already
                        said that Mr. Gray is a near connection and personal friend of mine. It may
                        not be improper for me to say in addition that while I have not concurred in
                        his opinions, or approved his course during the war, I have always known him
                        to be earnest, and consistent in his union sentiments, and that he is one of
                        the few men in the State who can honestly take the test-oath. Since the war,
                        he has, though a Republican in his politics, been earnest, and outspoken in
                        his Virginia sympathies, and he was one of the first to fall into the Walker
                        movement. He has the capacity to make a good Representative, and, if
                        elected, I do not doubt that he would truly, and fairly represent the
                        feelings and wishes, and interests of the real people of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>I hope it will be the pleasure of the people of the District to solve the
                        difficulty in which we are placed, by electing Mr. Gray.</p>
                    <p>Yours truly, JOHN B. BALDWIN.</p>

                <summary>In a circulated letter, John Baldwin advised conservatives to only support
                    candidates who are qualified to hold office, lest Congress reject an unqualified
                    conservative candidate in favor of a Radical. For this reason, Baldwin threw his
                    support behind Robert Gray, even though he is a Republican, and called on all
                    conservatives to do the same.</summary>

                    <p>The Petersburg <emph rend="italic">Index</emph> thus castigates Wells over
                        the shoulders of Maj. Jno. A. Harman. -- It says:</p>
                    <p>"MAJOR HARMAN, a Valley renegade, introducing WELLS to one of his motley
                        audiences, is reported to have said of the latter that he was the "<emph

                        of agreement between Major HARMAN and ourselves. WELLS is not only the most
                        generally, but the <emph rend="italic">best</emph>, the most naturally, most
                        truthfully, most easily abused man that does, that ever did, or that ever
                        will live in this State. Because to abuse, one has only to describe him --
                        what would be slander of almost any other individual, is history of WELLS.
                        The Prince of Carpet-Baggers, the organizer of the "powers of darkness," the
                        Monte Cristo of mysterious accumulators of wealth, the genius of the whisky

                    <p>Shall this be said of any colored man in this community who lives by the
                        favor of white men, whom the Radical party would disfranchise and despoil?
                        Can it be possible the colored men will be so blind to their interests as
                        not to see that they are alienating their best friends while following the
                        lead and obeying the behests of the vile creatures that the North has spewed
                        upon our soil? Will these black men who were born and reared among us, make
                        idols of those roving carpet-baggers, and associates of the baser whites,
                        native and to the manner born, who are willing to betray their own race? The
                        blacks know the social status of the men to whom we refer. They are
                        perfectly aware that these men never had any positions among us, and could
                        not engage the services of those whose votes they now seek, without some
                        other guarantee than their word of honor, that such services would be
                        required. How strange it is! -- how passing strange! -- that they can be
                        seduced by such wretched, miserable creatures! While they would not trust
                        such men in matters of contract, involving money; they will implicitly obey
                        their nod, and rush pell mell into the political trap which has been set for
                        them! Are they determined to be joined to such political idols? If so, God
                        pity them; for they are doing themselves incalculable injury, and, after
                        awhile, will hear the solid, respectable men of these Southern communities
                        say of each of them: "Let him alone!" And they will be let alone severely.
                        We will do them no harm for the injury they are attempting to inflict upon
                        us; but in obedience to that instinct which the great Creator has implanted
                        in the human heart, we will keep clear of our enemies and stand by our
                        friends. Thousands of white men in Virginia have solemnly pledged themselves
                        to this course of action; and they will be true to themselves and their
                        pledge. -- <emph rend="italic">Lynchburg Virginian.</emph></p>

                    <p>The registered vote of this county in 1867 was 3579 whites and 1362 colored,
                        making a white majority of 2217, which, added to the 747 net white gain from
                        the registration of last week, makes the majority of registered whites
                        amount to 2924. We hope a few more names will be added on to-morrow and next
                        day. This county should give Walker a majority of 2500.</p>

                <summary>The Masonic Fraternity of Staunton celebrated St. John's Day on Thursday.
                    They were joined by lodges from the Valley, from east of the Blue Ridge, and
                    from Bath and Allegheny Counties. An extra train arrived from Charlottesville
                    with 100 masons who were received at the depot by a Staunton committee and led
                    to the hall by the Stonewall Band. The day was marked by processions, music, and
                    addresses.</summary>

                    <p>On yesterday, Court-day, on being introduced by Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Gilbert
                        C. Walker, candidate for Governor, addressed the citizens of this county at
                        considerable length. We have not space to notice his address more at length.
                        We have room only to say that it was a good address and made a favorable
                        impression, and that he will get the almost unanimous vote of the white
                        citizens of the county.</p>
                    <p>He was followed by Maj. J. B. Dorman of Rockbridge, who made an effective
                        speech in favor of the Walker ticket, and against the disfranchising and
                        test-oath clauses of the Constitution. Thos. J. Michie, Esq., being called
                        upon made an able and feeling speech, addressed chiefly to the colored
                        citizens present. He urged them to act like freemen and not to be the slaves
                        of the loyal Leagues. Being called upon to speak, the following delivered
                        short and interesting speeches in the order named: Col. Jas. H. Skinner,
                        Col. Bolivar Christian, Maj. H. M. Bell, Maj. Thos. C. Elder, Col. Geo.
                        Baylor, Wm. S Gilman, reported for the Richmond <emph rend="italic"
                        >Whig</emph>, and Col. Jno. B. Baldwin. We sincerely regret that the want of
                        time and space prevents us from saying more of this glorious meeting.</p>
                    <p>Augusta will speak with a potential vice next Tuesday -- election day.</p>

                <summary>Sarah Margaret Hanger, wife of Dr. D. W. Hanger and daughter of Col.
                    Franklin and Nancy A. McCue, died in Augusta on June 2nd after "a very painful
                    illness of nine weeks." She was 31 years old. "We have good hope in her death,
                    and thus the best of all consolation. The parents who weep at this grave have
                    the deep sympathy of their neighbors and friends, for they have been greatly
                    afflicted. A little more than twelve years ago they had a family of seven grown
                    children, four daughters and three sons, and now the last olive plant has been
                    removed from around their table. The three elder daughters who were married and
                    who were mothers died within the short space of about eight months. Then the two
                    unmarried sons, within a shorter space of time, came home from camp to linger a
                    few days in delirium and fever and to die. Not long after the eldest son was
                    suddenly called away; and now the last child, leaving five little children to
                    the care of her mother."</summary>
