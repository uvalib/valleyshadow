                    <p>LEWISBURG, GREENBRIER COUNTY,</p>
                    <p>West Virginia, Jan. 8th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>Government of West Virginia -- Boards of Registration -- Outrageous
                        Proceedings.</p>
                    <p>If it be true that "misery loves company," it would be well for other
                        citizens of Virginia, like ourself, to pay occasional visits to West
                        Virginia. As one simply under military arrest, guarded by soldiers, feels
                        that his condition is not as bad as it might be when he and another not only
                        bound but gagged by infamous scalawags, so a citizen of Virginia whose State
                        has been degraded by Radical rule to a mere military District, governed by
                        the bayonet, feels that the condition of his fellow-citizens, or rather
                        fellow-subjects, is fortunate when compared with that of the citizens of
                        West Virginia, who are bound, gagged and tortured by the most tyrannical,
                        diabolical and fiendish set of scalawags whoever established their titles in
                        fee-simple to homes in the torrid regions of the damned. The condition of
                        the better part of the citizens in West Virginia shows what that of the
                        citizens of Virginia would be, if the present military Government should,
                        unfortunately, be exchanged for that under the Underwood scalawag
                        Constitution, or one similar, in obnoxious restrictive features to it,
                        except that in Virginia the ills attending the black plague of negro
                        suffrage would be super-added, which would operate present degradation and
                        injury to the whites, and ultimate ruin to the negroes. If the deluded
                        negroes had the prescience to foresee what the ultimate effect of the
                        exercise of the franchise by them would be upon their fortunes, they would
                        shun it as the worst curse which could be visited upon them -- they would
                        rather be clothed with the spirit of Nessus than with the privilege of
                        franchise.</p>
                    <p>Though Virginia is a territory, denied the rights of a State, and governed by
                        a military commandant, yet the citizens of Virginia are fortunate as
                        compared with those of West Virginia, though the latter are citizens of a
                        loyal State, so-called, in the Union. No benefit attaches to being in the
                        Union, if the State Government be in the hands of scalawags, and Virginia
                        had better remain a territory out of the Union and be governed by military
                        authority till the "last syllable of recorded time" than to be in the Union
                        as a State governed by scalawags. The Government of West Virginia
                        establishes this fact beyond controversy.</p>
                    <p>The scenes which have been enacted here this week show with what kind of a
                        Government the people of West Virginia are cursed. The proceedings of the
                        Board of Registration, composed of three members -- two being present and
                        acting -- which were had in the Courthouse of this place this week need no
                        comment -- they bespeak most forcibly and eloquently in their own outrageous
                        character.</p>
                    <p>Any attempt to give such a description of the proceedings which took place as
                        would give those who did not witness them anything like a correct idea of
                        their character would be futile, and I will not attempt to do so. I will
                        only furnish such a sketch as will enable the readers of the Spectator to form some idea of the manner in which
                        the rights of the citizens, are registered, loyal
                            citizens, of West Virginia are ruthlessly and outrageously
                        trampled upon by the Boards of Registration. I will confine myself simply to
                        a plain, unvarnished, unembellished statement.</p>
                    <p>To enable the readers better to understand the character of the action of the
                        Board of Registration here, I will state that, by the laws of West Virginia, adopted by the Legislature in violation,
                        I believe, of the Constitution of the State, Boards of Registration are
                        responsible to no power or tribunal whatever -- their action is final -- no
                        appeal under the laws can be taken to any other tribunal, however arbitrary
                        and outrageous their action may be. They wield a power unprecedented in the
                        annals of Republican Governments, having the power to prevent any citizen,
                            however loyal, from voting and holding
                        office, and, being irresponsible bodies, and the members of them being
                        generally unscrupulous men, who have no respect for the rights of others,
                        they abuse their power in the most shameful and outrageous manner.</p>
                    <p>Though citizens may have taken the iron-clad oath and been registered as
                        voters -- though they may have served throughout the war in the Federal army
                        and been honorably discharged therefrom at its termination -- though they
                        may have been consistent members and office holders of the Republican party,
                        yet if, on any occasion, they should fail to vote for the members of the
                        Board of Registration for such offices as they may aspire to, or vote in any
                        way or for any person that suits not the members of the Board, they are
                        liable to be summoned by the Board to appear before that body to establish
                        their "loyalty" in the sense in which that body
                        construes the term. The test of that kind of
                        loyalty is, voting for the members of the Board of Registration, or for such
                        other candidates of the extreme wing of the Radical party as may be
                        supported by the members of the Board. The registered voters thus summoned
                        are required to establish that kind of loyalty by
                        the testimony of witnesses who are themselves recognized as loyal by that test. They are required not only to
                        establish a negative -- that they have never done any disloyal act, or felt
                        a throb of disloyal sympathy -- but they are required to establish it by
                        witnesses who vote to suit the Board of Registration! All others are
                        considered disloyal, whose testimony the Board will take against, but not in favor of the party thus summoned for trial.
                        This rule of conduct in these trials was publicly proclaimed and officially
                        announced by the President of the Board of Registration here this week: --
                            The testimony of unregistered men will be taken
                            AGAINST, but NOT IN FAVOR of the party on trial.</p>
                    <p>The party accusing the voter of disloyalty is not made known to the party
                        accused, and all knowledge of the specific charges preferred against him is
                        withheld, so that the party accused is denied both the rights of meeting the
                        charges preferred against him, and of confronting his accuser. What chances
                        has the accused to get justice before such a body? None whatever. The reader
                        will now be able to form some idea of the character, or rather want of
                        character of these trials.</p>
                    <p>As some of the registered voters in this county did not vote, in the recent
                        election, to suit the Board of Registration, a considerable number -- about
                        150 or 160, I have been informed -- were summoned to appear before the Board
                        in this place on Monday last, the 4th inst., to establish, to the
                        satisfaction of the Board, their loyalty, of the character and in the manner
                        above state, or have their names stricken from the registration list, and be
                        disbarred from voting or holding office.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday evening last, the 3rd. inst., the day before the trials of those
                        summoned would commence, the citizens of Lewisburg were surprised to see a
                        squad of fifteen or twenty armed United States soldiers marching, under
                        command of Lieut. Flood, into their peaceful town. For a while the citizens
                        could not understand why their town had been invaded on the Sabbath with
                        United States soldiers, but soon learned that they had been sent in
                        accordance with the request of Dr. Jos. F. Caldwell, President of the Board
                        of Registration of Greenbrier county. This squad of soldiers was a
                        detachment from the troops stationed at Union, Monroe county, near the body
                        of Judge Nat Harrison. The President of the Board of Registration is
                        familiarly called here "Old Joe," and as frequently and appropriately "Old
                        Scratch" -- the latter both from his resemblance in diabolism to a
                        distinguished character to whom that appellation is applied, and from his
                        habit of scratching names of voters from the list
                        of registration when they fail to vote for him,
                        or some of his special personal and political friends.</p>
                    <p>When the Board met on Monday morning to proceed with the trials, the
                        following scene was presented:</p>
                    <p>"Old Scratch," with a stick in his hand as long as that carried by Meg
                        Merrilles, occupied the Chair as President of the Board, with his associate
                        member, the notorious Dr. Thatcher, by his side on the right, near Wm. H.
                        Sampson, the clerk, and near him on his left sat in full uniform, with
                        epaulets on shoulders, and bayonet girded to his side, the Orderly of the
                        Lieutenant commanding the squad of soldiers. This, be it remembered, was in
                        territory governed by military authority, but in a loyal State in the Union.</p>
                    <p>When parties were on trial the chief question asked them by the President of
                        the Board was, "How did you vote?" If they answered the question, and their
                        answer showed that they did not vote to suit the President of the Board, it
                        was evident that that was considered sufficient by the Board to erase their
                        names from the list of registration. If they refused to answer, claiming
                        that, as the ballot in this State was secret, no one had a right to know how
                        they voted, it was equally evident that the Board inferred they voted for the Conservative candidates and would
                        decide that they were disloyal, and would scratch
                        their names off the list of qualified voters.</p>
                    <p>Though but few were tried, the Board announced on Wednesday that they had
                        disposed of all the parties summoned, but refused to say what disposition
                        they had made of them. Many were present anxious to have their cases tried,
                        but the Board had disposed of them in secret council without any testimony.
                        Such is the mockery of trial had by this Board.</p>
                    <p>When I commenced this letter, I intended to give a sketch of the proceedings
                        during the trials, but find that my letter has already occupied so much
                        space that I must abandon that purpose or postpone it to another time. The
                        scenes were, at times, such as to beggar description, and a faithful sketch
                        of them would not be credited, but would be considered exaggerated and
                        highly colored. R.M.</p>

<b>Valley Railroad Subscription</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of a letter to the editor speaks favorably of Augusta's decision
                    not to subscribe to a debt of $300,000 for the Railroad. He believes the
                    subscription would have plunged the county into uncontrollable debt and that the
                    railroad will still be constructed even without this investment.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The people of Augusta have acted wisely in refusing to encumber themselves
                        with a debt of $300,000 for the Valley R. R. This is no time to incur new
                        and heavy obligations. We are not able to pay what we owe now, and it would
                        seem to be rash, if not reckless, to run still further in debt. With what
                        face can we ask Gen. Stoneman to extend the stay law, in regard to old
                        debts, if we forthwith incur new ones?</p>
                    <p>Let us take warning from the example of Rockingham. That county contracted a
                        debt of $150,000 to pay for stock in the Manassas Gap road. Her bonds were
                        issued and sold, and are now outstanding. The road was built, mainly, on
                        credit, and a deed of trust was given to secure the money spent in its
                        construction.-- When the debt became due, the company was unable to pay, and
                        by some compromise the road, with its franchises, has been sold, nominally
                        to the Orange &amp; Alexandria company, but really (as is generally
                        supposed) to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. company. The result is that
                        Rockingham does not own a dollar's worth of the stock of the road, though
                        she has incurred, and now owes $150,000 of principal, and three or four
                        years of interest on account of her subscription.</p>
                    <p>If Augusta subscribes $300,000 to the Valley R. R., she will soon find
                        herself in a singular condition, only aggravated in proportion to the larger
                        amount subscribed. The road will be built, on credit, and matters will go on
                        swimmingly for a while, but when pay day comes, we cannot meet our
                        obligations -- the road will be sold out under the mortgage. The Baltimore
                        &amp; Ohio R. R. company will step in and buy it for a trifle, and Mr.
                        Garrett will have the satisfaction of owning the road built with our money,
                        and we will be left with our fingers in our mouths.</p>
                    <p>I do not find fault with Mr. Garrett. He is pursuing a wise policy in getting
                        other people to rebuild roads for him if he can. But we will be very soft if
                        we allow ourselves to be the victims of his policy.</p>
                    <p>I admit the road will be a benefit to us. But when Mr. Garrett looks to the
                        interest of his company, let us look to our own. The matter is in our own
                        hands if we know how to improve our opportunities. The question is not as to
                        the construction, or non-construction of the road. The only question to be
                        settled is, who is to build and pay for it. The construction of it is
                        inevitable. Mr. Garrett has already spent millions on the road up to
                        Harrisonburg. He will soon find that it will not pay until it is extended up
                        the Valley -- until it intersects the great through lines. He will find
                        himself in the condition of a man who has built a bridge nine tenths of the
                        way across a stream. He will therefore be obliged, in order to make his
                        other expenditures available, to finish the road to Staunton, and ultimately
                        to Salem.</p>
                    <p>Let us then be patient. The tendency of events is in our favor. Instead of
                        spending money for the benefit of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R.
                        Company, let us spend it in our own county, and for the benefit of our own
                        people, by making good well graded McAdam roads from Staunton and other
                        points, stretching in to all parts of the county so as to give our people
                        ready access at all seasons to their county, town, and the R. R. Depots.
                        This course will contribute much more to the enhancement of our lands, and
                        the advancement of the public interests, than the proposed subscription to
                        the Baltimore road.</p>
                    <p>The great difficulty with our people is, now, in getting to the R. R. with
                        their produce. -- In the latter part of the winter and early spring, our
                        county roads are almost impassable to any kind of vehicle. Let us improve
                        them so that our farmers can at all times have fine roads and the country
                        will soon wear a new aspect.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Voters of Augusta County:
                    </p>
                    <p>Our leading men are giving themselves great concern upon the subject of
                        political reconstruction, forgetting that the best plan for obtaining good
                        terms with the Northern section of the Republic, is by building up the material interests of our own section -- after
                        which political power, which is population, would follow as the necessary
                        consequence. Witness the experience derived from the past. Whilst we of the
                        Southern States were speculating in Federal politics, the North and West
                        were biding their time and giving their immediate
                        attention to the increase of their population, by improving and constructing
                        their highways and harbors, and affording as many as possible of the
                        facilities for rapid communication not only with all portions of the outside
                        world, but with every part of their own territory. They realized the fact
                        that population was political power, -- that population followed Railroad
                        lines, -- and we now see the result. Population has centred upon the
                        Railroad lines of the North and West, and wealth, and the control of the
                        offices and policy of the Federal Government has passed out of our hand into
                        theirs, to be used for our oppression and their aggrandizement. This
                        condition of facts exists and will continue until we have turned the tide in
                        our own favor again by using the same means to invite population to our
                        territory. In the meantime we must submit to the operation of the Commercial
                        laws established by the dominant section in their own interests, which in
                        the instance of cotton, the great staple of the South, shows this remarkable
                        result -- that the same article of New Orleans cotton, which is quoted at 11
                        3/8 d. in the markets of Liverpool and London, equal to about 25 cents per
                        pound in American Gold, is only quoted at 25
                        cents per pound in our paper currency in New York
                        and Boston. Upon the estimated crop of 1868 of 2,700,000 bales, this
                        difference in price is equal to a net loss to the southern producer of the
                        staple of upwards of $75,000,000 and a net gain to the Northern speculator
                        and spinner of the same sum. With this instance of the smartness of our
                            cute Yankee brother in legislating the
                        proceeds of our industry out of our pockets into his own, is it not high
                        time that we should awake to the necessities of our situation, and dropping
                        politics for the present, lend all our energies to the development of our
                        resources by opening up every portion of our otherwise favored land, to an
                        influx of population -- the influence of which would result in the increase
                        of our wealth, and political power as a section for our own protection
                        against repressive and unfriendly legislation.</p>
                    <p>We of this Valley have our part to perform in the race of improvement. It
                        will not longer do to add valuable time to the year already losts before the
                        construction of our Valley Railroad is commenced, as our contribution to
                        this general result. Patriotism and public spirit aside, no other people on
                        the face of the continent, with such natural advantages and accumulated
                        means as we possess, would consent for a moment to be tied to one market by
                        one solitary line of communication, when by the exercise of a little
                        enterprise they would reap the immense advantage of the competition arising
                        between several competing lines, communicating with various markets -- to
                        say nothing of the many collateral advantages arising from the construction
                        of this Road, which I have not now time to elaborate.</p>
                    <p>The opportunity is again offered to our citizens, by the vote which is to be
                        taken on the 6th of February next, to hasten this "consummation so devoutly
                        to be wished," and the object of this communication is to add to what has
                        already been said, answers to some of the objections to the subscription
                        which I have heard were urged against it when the vote was taken in December
                        last.</p>
                    <p>The first and leading objection to the subscription which I have heard was
                        that "Our taxes would be so much increased," that it would "add $18,000 to
                        our annual taxes," and would "encumber the county with a debt of $300,000
                        which would have to be ultimately paid by its citizens." Nothing is truer
                        than each of these propositions -- yet in view of the immense
                        counter-advantages which would result to the citizens of the county, their
                        value as objections utterly fails.</p>
                    <p>The annual tax, it could be readily demonstrated, were your columns open to
                        great arrays of figures and statistics, would be saved two or three times
                        over by our reduced freights upon every thing which we either sold or bought
                        -- for as you know, freight becomes a part of the cost of every thing which
                        we buy or consume or use -- beside which would be our advantage in buying in
                        competitive markets what we had to buy, at prices reduced in consequence of
                        such competition (and here let me say that the people of Augusta would be
                        astonished if they had as good opportunities as the writer of learning how much they did buy in the outside markets and
                        what a large sum a small centage on that aggregate amounts to) and selling
                        our productions in competing markets, at prices enhanced by the same cause.</p>
                    <p>Upon the article of Plaster alone, which is so largely used in and so
                        necessary to our agriculture, a saving of $2 per ton, which could now be
                        readily effected but for the monopoly of the one line of road we are tied
                        to, would amount to an annual saving of $10,000. But if we add to that all
                        the savings of freight and cost upon the other heavy articles such as salt,
                        fish, iron, fertilizers, machinery, &amp;c., &amp;c. so largely
                        consumed in our county, it will readily be seen that those savings upon the
                        articles alone named would nearly if not quite pay the tax on the county
                        interest in the Road.</p>
                    <p>The debt would surely have to be ultimately paid -- but consider what immense
                        means the Road, if constructed, would give us to pay with. In the first
                        place we would have our stock interest as a county in the capital of the
                        Road; which, by the time the debt matured, would probably be worth more than
                        it cost the county. Add to that the aggregate savings of the citizens above
                        the tax in reduced prices, freights &amp;c. for twenty years, as above
                        stated, and then consider what immense increase in the market value of our
                        Real Estate in consequence of the favorable commercial position of the Road
                        would give us, inviting a large influx of valuable population -- creating a
                        demand for our lands in small tracts -- developing our resources,
                        agricultural, mineral and manufacturing, and the fear of pay-day coming 20
                        years hence, should not affright us. Why sirs, before the arrival of that
                        time our Real Estate, now estimated as worth
                        $18,000,000 would have more than doubled in value -- but if the construction
                        of the Road only insured an increase of 25 per cent in the value of our Real
                        Estate, that alone would add $4,500,000 to our wealth, to pay $300,000 with.</p>
                    <p>Again, sirs, the proposition is not to pull $300,000 in cash out of our pockets now, to spend
                        beyond our limits to be spent. It is, if possible, to convert our county
                        credit into cash, to be expended here -- at home
                        -- among us -- to our great present advantage and
                        profit. Some 35 miles of this Road lies within the limits of our county,
                        which will cost about $30,000 per mile -- say $1,100,000 to construct -- the
                        most of which sum would be expended among us. --
                        If we can induce the expenditure of any thing like such a sum as that among
                        us, by pledging our credit for so small a part of it as $300,000, the writer
                        fails to see the good judgment of refusing to do so.</p>
                    <p>Some object to voting the subscription because it will, they say, be located
                        on the Eastern route, and some because they say it will run on the Western.
                        To say the least of it, this is a very selfish, dog in the manger policy,
                        and no objection at all -- considering the fact that as yet the Road is not
                        located, and that no living man knows what line it will be located upon. My
                        decided impression is that if ever located it will be upon that line which
                        presents the greatest advantage in character of county and cost of
                        construction, after the most careful survey of all the possible routes. --
                        and that whether it is ultimately located on the Eastern route or the
                        Western route or a Middle route or any other routes, the benefits and
                        advantages of the Road will be reflected upon every portion of our county to
                        its remotest limits. The foregoing answer to objections as to refute will
                        apply equally well to another class of opponents of the subscription who,
                        without knowledge of how or where the Road will run, assume that it will
                        certainly run through their farms to the injury of the same. I answer their
                        objection by asking them how they know it will.</p>
                    <p>Another class, I am told, oppose the subscription because they object to the
                        Officers and Directors in Office in the Company. This is  which
                        has substance, for the stock holders are in control of their own property,
                        with power to elect such Officers and Directors as suit them. Were Augusta a
                        leading stockholder in this company, her voice would be potential in a
                        general meeting, in making and deposing officers. Beside which, I know it
                        would be safe for me to say there is not one Officer or Director of the
                        Company who would not cheerfully vacate his position if he thought he
                        imposed one obstacle to the existence of the Road. As it is, I believe, they
                        only retain their positions to give the semblance of vitality and
                        organization to the company.</p>
                    <p>Another and most unworthy objection, which converts some into opponents and
                        more into luke warm friends who stay away from the polls, is the delusive
                        and fatal idea that we can save our money and some one else will, out of
                        love for us, build the Road at their own expense. They do not know exactly
                        who, but rather surmise that the Balt. &amp; Ohio Railroad is the
                        amiable and liberal party who will do this great kindness to us. My good
                        friends, do not cling too long to this idea, or you will be mouldering in
                        forgotten graves long before this event occurs. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio
                        Company MAY at some future day desire a connection with our Chesa. &amp;
                        Ohio Road, but it is not her desire and is contrary to her interests, for
                        many and obvious reasons, to effect that connection in this county or at any
                        point further East than Covington. This you may rely upon -- the writer
                        states it as not only the speculation of his own mind, but upon information
                        derived through parties connected with the Balt. &amp; Ohio Road.
                        Neither need we expect State aid -- the State will never in our day
                        appropriate another dollar to an internal improvement system. The fact is,
                        old Augusta has been so long used to being provided for by others -- by
                        Providence with a fertile soil and genial climate, and by the State and
                        other outside barbarians with Railroads, turnpikes and noble institutions of
                        learning and charity -- over and through which to convert her production
                        into cash -- that she had neglected to provide herself with even a good and
                        sufficient system of county roads -- in the expectation, probably, that even
                        these would be supplied to her at somebody else's expense. Good people,
                        discard these delusions as fatal to your prosperity and progress. Come up to
                        the work and help yourselves, for once. You will
                        then find that "the God's help those who help
                        themselves." Rely upon it that no help in this behalf will ever reach you
                        except such as you give yourselves. No Railroad will ever traverse the
                        length of Augusta county in your generation unless you provide the means to at least start it. And, such being the
                        case, go to the polls on the day appointed, and with unanimity vote the
                        subscription -- provide the means to promptly construct your Road, and you
                        will assuredly find a flood-tide of wealth and prosperity setting in upon
                        you which will at no distant day make yours most favored of this favored
                        land.</p>
                    <p>A RAILROAD MAN.</p>
