<b>"Don't Give up the Ship"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial from the Mobile Register encouraging Democrats to remain hopeful.
                    It claims that the Republicans face many dangerous obstacles, and that the
                    Democrats should patiently wait for them to make an inevitable mistake.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Mobile (Ala.) Register says that, "in the
                        battles of war, or politics, or life, men who fight without hope cannot hope
                        to win. Nor is the divine inspiration which drives noble souls on to
                        struggle in storm and adversity, to be quenched by one or a hundred
                        reverses. The great soul rises from defeat, and a great cause broken and
                        forced to earth, gathers up its fragments, like shattered battalions, to
                        reform and renew the battle of freedom which man cannot afford to lose and
                        live. Those who despair of the final triumph of the Democratic party and of
                        the cause of our constitutional liberty which it bears on the points of its
                        spears, it seems to us, are at sea without chart or compass, on an aimless
                        voyage. The motto of such should be that which is written over the portals
                        of Hell:</p>
                    <p>"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here!"</p>
                    <p>For our part we can see nothing in the signs of the times to push men to this
                        despairing extremity. These on the contrary indicate that the Jacobin power
                        has reached its culminating point, and has in it abundant elements of rapid
                        decline and disintegration. Corrupt and incompetent, the leaders of this
                        party have raised a storm they cannot guide, and all political experience is
                        at fault if it is not their doom to be swept away by it. A powerful and
                        united Democratic party is calmly watching events and stands ready to seize
                        what it seems must be the inevitable opportunity to strike its enemy
                        staggering under administrative difficulties, torn by intestine squabbles
                        for place, and angered by bitter recrimination. Situated as the Jacobin
                        party is, it would be a miracle if it should pass through the four years'
                        term of Gen. Grant, with its organization unbroken. Meantime, the great
                        public is looking on, groaning under taxation, alarmed at the daily increase
                        of the national debt, and either dreading or hoping for a collapse of the
                        paper finances. Every million of debt-increase augments the ranks of the
                        repudiators. Radical policy and necessity command the increase to go on, and
                        the repudiators will grow accordingly. Repudiation is death to the party
                        that is responsible for the debt, and that death seems imminent, when the
                        party seems utterly incapable of managing it. Here is hope enough to keep
                        the friends of freedom out of the "portals" of despair. -- And yet this is
                        but one of the rocks and shoals that lie thickly in the path of the Jacobin
                        party. The spoils question, wherein a hundred are soured and disappointed
                        where one gets place; the tenure-of-office question, threatening an open and
                        bitter rupture between the President and Congress, and, of course, a
                        division of the party in Congress; the gold payment bond question; the
                        question of the assumed power of Congress to fix the qualifications of
                        voters in all the States, are but a few of the dangers which threaten the
                        Jacobin party, and give the looked-for opportunity to the Democracy. There
                        is no need or room for despair. Responsible for none of the public evils of
                        the land, the Democratic party is to be the attacking party, and it
                        patiently waits for the gaps to sure occur in the enemy's line of battle, to
                        break through and overthrow him. Why not, then, stand by our arms, and wait,
                        if only in the hope of victory, when that victory
                        will bear the fruits of Southern liberation from carpet-bag tyranny and
                        scalawag treachery."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Senate voted down a proposal to enfranchise those Southerners
                    disfranchised for their service in the Civil War. The Lynchburg News interprets
                    this to mean that any efforts at compromise will ultimately fail to secure
                    universal amnesty.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>During the contest in the Senate on Tuesday, over the universal suffrage
                        amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Vickers, of Maryland, submitted an
                        amendment looking to the restoration to the exercise of the elective
                        franchise, of all those now disfranchised by reason of participation in the
                        rebellion. The proposition was rejected, the vote
                        standing 21 ayes to 32 nays.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that the majority of the controlling party in the Senate is
                        not disposed to concede amnesty for political offenses to the disqualified
                        citizens of the South.</p>
                    <p>There is now, says the Lynchburg News, no shadow
                        of reasonable calculation that the mere concession of negro suffrage will
                        induce Congress to extend amnesty to political offenders in the South; and
                        there are many circumstances which justify the conviction that Congress is
                        unwilling and afraid to remove disabilities except on the condition of party
                        service.</p>
                    <p>Since the Radicals have determined to withhold amnesty except on the
                        condition of party service, it only remains for all classes of Virginians to
                        quietly await the result, uncorrupted, unawed by the demoralizing
                        circumstances and influence of these evil times. Our advice to the people,
                        now as always, is, wait in patience and faith the
                        deliverance to be wrought out eventually from these present troubles. Vote
                        for nothing and sustain nothing that does not meet with the fullest approval
                        of your conscience and sense of honor.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>All cities that are not possessed of a regularly organized and efficient Fire
                        Department, deeply feel the need of this property and Life Saving
                        Institution. Staunton is almost a city. It has at least approached nearly
                        enough to that epoch in its history to feel the need of a regularly
                        disciplined Fire Company, supplied with all the equipments and appliances
                        requisite to a vigorous and successful prosecution of its work. The Augusta
                        Fire Company is not as perfect in discipline as it might be, yet all will
                        admit that it is composed of the nerve and sinew of our mountain Town. Were
                        we not personally acquainted with its members, we should wonder at the
                        promptness and energy they display, with no pay, very little thanks and a
                        worthless apparatus. Cannot our Town Council appropriate three or four
                        thousand dollars for the purpose of purchasing a good Steam Fire Engine and
                        Hose?</p>
                    <p>If the funds in the Treasury are inadequate for such purchase, or if it be
                        deemed imprudent to use them in this way at present, I doubt not that our
                        citizens would cheerfully consent to pay a special and proportionate tax for the purpose. The taxable real estate of
                        Staunton is valued at $914,737, and the personal property is assessed at
                        $136,441. Property has appreciated materially since this valuation was made
                        as there has been no general assessment since 1850. So we see at once that
                        the tax would be insignificant indeed in comparison with the advantage
                        derived therefrom.</p>
                    <p>Property holders should look to their interest and guard against the
                        devouring element before it is too late. For such precaution is even more
                        important than insurance, which is neglected by
                        no prudent man.<br>MERCHANT.</p>
