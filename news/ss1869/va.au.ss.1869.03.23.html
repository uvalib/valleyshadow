<b>Patience, Vigilance, Caution</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors recommend caution with regards to the apparent split within the
                    Republican party over the issue of their State ticket. The editors fear that the
                    Republicans may be using this split as a ruse to attract Conservatives to their
                    party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some surmise that the apparent breach in the Republican or Radical party is a
                        mere ruse -- that the Walker party are merely
                        recruiting, drawing forces from the Conservative party of the State, and
                        that the purpose is, when sufficient recruits have been thus obtained, to
                        declare a truce in the mock battle, and to reorganize their combined forces
                        by agreeing upon a common ticket. Conservatives should keep aloof, and avoid
                        all "entangling alliances" till they are better enabled to see what course
                        duty and patriotism dictate they should pursue. In a word, they should
                        patiently await, as a respected French lady, who enunciated the English
                        language with some difficulty, was wont to say, further "devil-up-ments." Patience, vigilance, caution should now be the
                        watchwords of the Conservatives. In the great drama now being enacted the
                        scenes swiftly change. No man can tell what a day will bring forth, or what
                        his duty on tomorrow will be. Watch and pray, and wisely await further
                            "devil-up-ments."</p>

<b>? ? ? ?</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The recent split in the Republican party has left the people of Augusta
                    with many questions, and few answers. This article enumerates some of these
                    questions, especially the question of whether the split is genuine or a ruse to
                    snare conservative voters.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>These strange times have made our people strangely catechetical. There were
                        many persons in town yesterday, and their conversations were almost
                        exclusively in the interrogative style. There were many to ask questions,
                        but few to answer them. These few would have anxious and curious inquirers
                        to the right, left, front and rear of them, whilst questions thick, fast,
                        and furious volleyed and thundered. Chief among the questions were the
                        following: What means the apparent split in the Radical party? Is it a ruse? Are the seceders from the Wells-Harris ticket
                        really disgusted because a mulatto has been put on the ticket, or are they
                        afraid only that it will result in the defeat of their party? Is the
                        Walker-Lewis party really favorable to the repeal of the test oath and the
                        county organization, or is it fishing with that bait to catch conservative
                        voters? Is it to the interests of the conservatives to strengthen the white
                        wing of the Radical party? Would they effect any good by adding to the
                        strength or respectability of that party -- would it not be doing more harm
                        than good? Should not the conservatives remain united to a man, having
                        nothing at all to do with either wing of the Radical party? Should they not
                        be prepared to unite shoulder to shoulder when the time for action shall
                        arrive? If, in the course of human events, it shall become necessary to
                        unite conservative strength with that of the white wing of the Republican
                        party, should not Mahomet go to the mountain instead of the mountain going
                        to Mahomet?</p>
                    <p>Which wing does Grant favor? Which does Congress favor? What good can we
                        expect from either or both? What influence has Grant? Has he any or not?
                        What indication has he given of conservatism? What is his mode of effecting
                        reconciliation and establishing peace? Has he any policy, and would it make
                        any difference whether he has or not? Are all the signers to the Republican
                        circular, published in the papers, "earnestly desirous
                            of adopting the great principles enunciated by the Republican party of
                            the country," as that document declares? Did they read it before
                        signing it? Do they consider themselves Republicans?</p>
                    <p>When did Jno. F. Lewis acquire the title of Colonel? What has become of the
                        "New Movement"? Are the Committee of Nine still hopeful? Have we anything to
                        cheer us? Is there not a ray of light somewhere? Is not the split in the
                        Radical party like a rift in the black cloud which has darkened our
                        political horizon -- does it not show gleams of light -- does it not furnish
                        ground for hope, that, with the conservatives united and the Radicals
                        divided, victory can be won by the conservative
                        party? Should we not be faithful to principle and steadfast in the right? Is
                        not "honesty the best policy"? When will the election be held? Do you think
                        that Congress will order an election till the breach in the Radical party be
                        healed? Will not these antagonistic wings be united on a common ticket
                        before the day of election? Can we rely upon the promises or professions of
                        liberality of either wing? Is not our only hope in the unity of the
                        conservative party? Should we not be ready to act together when the time for
                        action shall arrive? Should we not wait for further developments? Does not
                        Grant's administration promise to be a failure?</p>
