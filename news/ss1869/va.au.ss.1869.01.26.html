<b>The Valley Rail Road Subscription</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"A Farmer" responds to a letter to the January 12th Spectator. This letter
                    argued that subscribing to the Valley Rail Road would be a waste of money, for
                    the Company would build it even without Augusta's investment. "A Farmer" argues
                    that this is incorrect, and that the Company will only construct the Rail Road
                    if Augusta accepts some of the cost.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the last "Spectator" I presented some reasons in favor of the proposed
                        subscription by this county to the capital stock of the Valley Rail Road.</p>
                    <p>I now propose to examine an objection which has been urged with some
                        earnestness and apparent sincerity. The objection is, that the interests of
                        the city of Baltimore, and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail Road, are
                        sufficient to secure the extension of this Road to Salem, passing through
                        the entire length of our county, without any contribution upon our part, and
                        that we may thus enjoy all the advantages which will flow from it, and incur
                        none of the burdens of its construction. The people of the county are
                        therefore advised to fold their arms in listless inactivity, and wait until
                        (according to a correspondent of the Spectator of
                        the 12th), "Mr. Garrett finishes the road to Staunton." This "masterly
                        inactivity," so vehemently recommended by the opponents of this
                        subscription, calls to mind that Hero of Greek fable, who coming to a rapid
                        and deep stream which poured its dark floods athwart his pathway coolly and
                        deliberately seated himself upon its banks to wait until the turbid waters
                        should flow by, and permit him to pass over dry shod. And had he not,
                        according to the philosophy of the Spectator's
                        correspondent, reason for his conduct; for "tendency of events was surely in
                        his favor" -- the current being rapid. Now, is the interest of the city of
                        Baltimore in this enterprise, sufficient to justify her in incurring the
                        expense necessary to its completion? Let us examine this question, briefly,
                        in the light of facts.</p>
                    <p>Baltimore has already secured the trade of the Valley as far South as the
                        county of Rockingham. She is likewise connected by the Alexandria &amp;
                        Orange, and Lynchburg and Tennessee Roads with all the Valley South of
                        Salem; these roads also connect her with that system of railways running
                        through Tennessee, Northern Georgia, Alabama &amp;c. The only country
                        then whose trade she can hope to secure by this extension is that of the
                        counties of Augusta, Rockbridge and Botetourt. And in these she will have to
                        share with Richmond, by means of the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Road, in this
                        county, the North River improvement in Rockbridge, and the James River
                        &amp; Kanawha Canal in Rockbridge and Botetourt.</p>
                    <p>So that all the advantages Baltimore can secure is a part of the trade of the three counties I have named. (It must be
                        remembered that the extension of the Valley Rail Road to Salem will secure
                        to the to the city of Baltimore no new railroad connection, for
                        she is already connected with the road Southwest of that point). Now is this
                        sufficient to justify, on her part, the very large outlay necessary to carry
                        the Valley road to Salem? As fertile, prosperous, and enterprising as these
                        counties are, would not the certainty of securing their entire trade be purchased at too high a rate, if she should pay
                        for it -- the whole cost of building a railroad from Harrisonburg to Salem?</p>
                    <p>That the city of Baltimore has a large interest in this extension is evident,
                        but it is not enough, by a great deal, to justify her in undertaking it
                        alone; nor to warrant us in depending upon her in a matter so vital to our interests. Yet it is enough to secure her
                        hearty co-operation, valuable assistance, and liberal contributions of
                        money. In fact, without her aid the counties immediately interested cannot
                        build the road.</p>
                    <p>But in order to secure that aid we must put our own shoulders to the wheel.
                        If under the advice of the opponents of this subscription we do nothing but
                        fold our arms and call upon Hercules, we will be left sticking in the mud
                        for all time. The only way in which we can secure the extension of this
                        Road, so essential to our interests, is by a just and fair contribution of
                        our own means. I think I may well ask if it comports with the high spirit,
                        and just pride of an honorable and chivalrous community to be influenced by
                        appeals, to such a narrow and heartless selfishness as is involved in the
                        objections I have been considering? Addressed to a narrow-minded and
                        penurious people they might have influence, but with the citizens of this
                        noble county, who have always been characterized by generous and public
                        spirited conduct, they will, I feel sure, have less weight than the lightest
                        down that floats upon the summer breeze.</p>
                    <p>There is another branch to the objection I have been considering which I wish
                        briefly to notice. It is that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio road will extend
                        the Valley road, at least as far as Staunton, in order to "tap" the
                        Chesapeake and Ohio. A brief consideration of this matter will show, I
                        think, that there are no grounds upon which to build such a hope. The great
                        object in constructing the Ches. &amp; Ohio road is the trade of the
                        Northwestern States. And for this she must compete with the Baltimore
                        &amp; Ohio on the banks of the Ohio river; and if she can there, at the
                        start, offer such advantages and facilities, as to secure that trade by what
                        process is the Balt. &amp; Ohio road to deprive her of any part of it by
                        "tapping" at Staunton, or any other point on her line? The Ches. &amp;
                        Ohio road can effectually prevent any diversion of trade from her line by
                        discriminating in her charges against all freight for the point "tapped" by
                        her rival.</p>
                    <p>The correspondent of the "Spectator," referred to before, has quite a
                        jeremiad over the fate of Rockingham in reference to her Rail Road
                        subscription, and says she now owns the stock in the Manassas Road, but her
                        bonds are still unpaid. This may be true for aught I know to the contrary.
                        But this I do know, she has the road, which is
                        much better than the stock, and I venture the assertion that Rockingham
                        would not to day exchange the road for her bonds. She will receive every
                        year two or three times the amount of interest she has to pay in the
                        enhanced price of her corn crop alone. A FARMER.</p>

<b>The Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>

                    the Valley Railroad. He argues that the money spent in taxes will be made up in

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Baltimore" writes to oppose the funding of the Valley Railroad on the
                    grounds of common business sense. He argues that Baltimore can, should, and will
                    fund the road. Augusta's small contribution can do little to get it built, and
                    putting the county and its taxpayers in debt cannot be justified by freight

<b>The Rule of Radical Policy</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    political interests of the Radicals.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish in this issue the memorial of the Conservative "Committee of Nine"
                        to the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, which will enable our readers to
                        see what the "Committee of Nine" has done, and the character of the
                        amendments they propose to the Underwood Constitution. The next, and more
                        important thing, is to know what Congress will do
                        in reference thereto. And yet, it is impossible to predict with any degree
                        of certainty what action Congress will take. If we knew what the opinions of
                        the majority of the Congressmen were in reference to the effect the adoption
                        or rejection of these amendments would have upon the Radical party, we could, with confidence, predict what course
                        they would adopt.</p>
                    <p>If they were satisfied that the Underwood Constitution unchanged would be
                        adopted, and would not injure their party, they would reject any
                        propositions of amendment.</p>
                    <p>If, on the contrary, they believe that it will be rejected unless modified,
                        they will agree to modify it to the extent merely which is necessary, in the
                        opinion, to secure its adoption and protect their party against injury.</p>
                    <p>They care not a fig about the rights of either the white or colored citizens
                        of the South. -- They look alone to the interests of their party. If they
                        thought the negroes would not vote with their party, they would not allow a
                        negro to vote. If the whites of the South would vote with their party, they
                        would not allow the negroes to vote, even if they would vote with their
                        party, for then they would not need their votes.</p>
                    <p>They care not for the rights of either color in the South. They would
                        enfranchise or disfranchise either race as the supposed interests of their party would dictate.</p>
                    <p>The alpha and omega of the policy of the Radicals is the supremacy of their
                        party in power. When relief to the Southern people from outrageous
                        oppression will redound, in the opinion of the Radicals, to the interest of
                            their party, they will be willing to grant
                        such relief, and not before.</p>
                    <p>The Underwood Constitution is of such a horrid character that the more
                        sensible of the Republicans believe that it injures their party by exciting
                        the disgust of all respectable persons, and this class of Republicans are in
                        favor of having it modified.</p>

                    <p>The chief struggle so far between the Conservative "Committee of Nine,"
                        laboring to secure a modification of the Underwood Constitution, and the
                        Radical committee from Richmond striving to prevent it, has been before the
                        Reconstruction committee of the House of Representatives. Gov. Wells heads
                        the delegation of Radicals from Virginia who are working like beavers to
                        prevent Congress from assenting to any change of the Underwood abomination.
                        He is accompanied and aided by Whittlesey, Fields Cook, Geo. Rye, Clements,
                        and others.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday last, Gov. Wells and Geo. Rye made statements on their side of
                        the question before the Reconstruction committee.</p>
                    <p>As reported by Cowardin of the Dispatch, Gov.
                        Wells said that he did not believe that loyal men would be safe from wrong
                        and outrage if the white people of Virginia were all enfranchised; he
                        believed that the only mode of protecting them would be to adopt the
                        constitution made by the Underwood convention as it was; he was satisfied
                        that the adoption of the plan of the committee of "nine" would break down
                        the Republican party and destroy the last hope of "loyalists" in Virginia;
                        he was sure the people, whatever they might say now, would in a few years
                        take away the rights of the negro unless the Republican party became strong
                        enough to protect them; and the only way to secure strength to that party
                        was to give it power to direct the restoration of the State -- none but the
                        Republican party could secure justice to all classes and rebuild the State
                        -- there could be no justice, no education, no prosperity, save through the
                        Republican party -- that party would invite immigration, insure the safe
                        investment of capital, and put Virginia in a way of rapid improvement. He
                        assured the committee that there were ten millions of dollars ready at this
                        time to be brought into the State under Republican auspices to build
                        railroads, etc., etc. He declared that the new movement had not the support
                        of Virginians -- that he did not believe that ten thousand white people in
                        Virginia would support it; that if it was carried it would have to be
                        carried by Republican votes; but the Republican party would not vote for it
                        -- they were opposed to reconstructing Virginia in that way; they would be
                        willing to see the whites enfranchised after a few years, when it could be done safely; but not now. It was
                        asked whether, if the plan of the nine succeeded, the loyal men would have
                        anything to compensate them for the concession that would be made. He
                        replied, "None whatever."</p>
                    <p>Geo. Rye endorsed the statements of Wells; though he had previously declared
                        that he differed widely from him. The old man could not withstand the
                        pressure that was doubtless brought to bear upon him by his fellow radicals.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after these proceedings, one L. C. Tibbetts, hailing from
                        Virginia, filed with the Reconstruction Committee charges against General
                        Stoneman. They were received by Mr. Boutwell, who remarked that the subject
                        was beyond the jurisdiction of the committee, yet the committee would look
                        into it. The charges may be put under the general head of disloyalty to the
                        reconstruction acts and thwarting the "loyal" plans in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>On the next day, Friday last, Col. Baldwin, as the Representative of the
                        Conservative "Committee of Nine," addressed the Reconstruction Committee.
                        His address was of considerable length and was very able. The following is
                        the account of the days' proceedings before the Reconstruction Committee as
                        furnished by the Associated Press despatch:</p>
                    <p>"Colonel John B. Baldwin, of Staunton, at the request of the committee, first
                        explained fully the legal aspect of the Methodist Church Property question,
                        and the bearing of that question on the peace and harmony of society in
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Phelps, representing the Methodist Episcopal Church North, was present;
                        and began his reply, but gave way to allow Colonel Baldwin to state, on
                        behalf of the Virginia committee, their views in regard to the constitution
                        of Governor Wells and the means of successful reconstruction. Colonel
                        Baldwin spoke eloquently for an hour, and was listened to with marked
                        attention. In reply to questions of the committee, he expressed his
                        confident belief that the people of the State would support and carry out in
                        good faith the plan which he advocated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Boutwell, the chairman of the committee, said that Congress and the
                        people of the North were anxious to remove political disabilities at the
                        South as soon as they should feel it could be safely done. He could not see
                        how guarantees could be given by Virginia that loyalists would be protected,
                        but would like to hear Mr. Baldwin on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin, in reply, said that, upon his own responsibility as a Virginian
                        and gentleman, they would be safe in Virginia as anywhere in the world, and
                        that the people and courts would give full force to the laws and perfect
                        protection to all men and all classes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Franklin Stearns, of Richmond, at the request of the committee, spoke on
                        the subject. He said that since the defeat of the Democratic party the
                        people of Virginia were ready to comply with the reconstruction laws, and
                        that more than half of the property-holders were ready to restore the State
                        on the basis proposed by the committee of nine. If the State was restored
                        under the pending constitution, with disfranchisement and county
                        organizations stricken out, she would immediately have her prosperity
                        revived, and rapidly grow in wealth and population. So restored, justice
                        would be impartially administered, and all classes completely protected. Mr.
                        Stearns was listened to attentively, and his statement made a decided
                        impression."</p>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent "E" of the Balt. Gazette gives the following in reference to the statements of
                        Baldwin and Stearns -- the latter a consistent Union man whose "loyalty" has
                        not been questioned:</p>
                    <p>"The Hon. J. B. Baldwin, of Virginia, addressed the Reconstruction Committee
                        of the House this morning at considerable length, elaborating the views
                        which have already been published by authority of the Richmond committee,
                        and maintaining that the people of Virginia were honest in their purposes,
                        but that a very large majority were in favor of the committee's programme.
                        In these views Mr. B. was vigorously sustained by Franklin Stearns, Chairman
                        of the Radical State Central Committee of Virginia. Mr. Stearns condemned
                        the Underwood Constitution, and said that it would be defeated by an honest
                        vote of the people, but that its defeat would leave the State still without
                        a civil government, and subject to all the whims and caprices of military
                        rule. Hence, as the representative of the Radical party of Virginia, he
                        favored the programme of the Conservative Committee, which did offer the
                        people some prospect of a stable civil government. Mr. Baldwin did not
                        conclude his argument, but will return to it next Wednesday morning. The
                        Radical members of the committee intimated no opinion, but listened with
                        great attention to the statements submitted. The belief, as expressed by a
                        gentleman who was present is, that the committee was favorably impressed
                        with Mr. Baldwin's remarks. Nevertheless, the "outside" Conservatives, who
                        are here from Virginia watching the progress of events, predict an utter
                        failure of the Richmond programme, particularly in view of the violent
                        action of the House of Representatives in retaining a Radical member in his
                        seat after the Committee on Election had twice reported against his right to
                        be there.</p>
                    <p>A special telegram to the Alexandria Gazette dated
                        Friday last says:</p>
                    <p>"The Virginia Committee are still laboring for their plan. Col. Baldwin this
                        morning, addressed the Reconstruction Committee in a speech which occupied
                        an hour and a half, which was listened to with marked
                        attention and great interest, and is regarded as an able effort.</p>
                    <p>The Judiciary Committee of the Senate have as yet done nothing in reference
                        to Virginia and the Radicals from Richmond and other parts of the State are
                        stirring to prevent any action.</p>

<b>Vote for the Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Well-wisher" writes a letter to the Spectator in favor of the Valley
                    Railroad subscription. He focuses on the effects it would have on freight costs
                    and property values.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Augusta County will stand deplorably in her own light should she refuse to
                        assist in building the Valley Railroad. If our people will take a calm view
                        of the question divested of all passion and prejudice, they will not fail to
                        see how greatly they must be benefitted by this Road. Our County already
                        stands foremost in wealth of all the counties of
                        the State; this is abundantly shown in a late article in the Enquirer and Examiner, which the Spectator will no doubt republish. But great as her
                        wealth already is, it is small in comparison with what it will be if her
                        people will only display a proper energy and enterprise in developing her
                        magnificent resources; they owe this to themselves, to their children, and
                        to the kind Providence who has given them such a good land for their
                        inheritance.</p>
                    <p>We have already a Railroad running East and West across our County, giving us
                        the advantage of the markets of Richmond and Norfolk; what we now need to
                        complete our prosperity is a Road which shall cross it North and South, and
                        connect us directly with another and greater market, that of Baltimore. We
                        would then have the advantage of two markets competing by direct lines for
                        our products, and two Railroads competing for the carrying of them. Now,
                        does not the veriest simpleton know, that if he has anything to sell, he can
                        generally get a better price for it if there are two persons wanting to buy,
                        than if there were but one; and can any one doubt that the rival cities of
                        Baltimore and Richmond will bid against each other for our trade? Again, it
                        takes not a very wise man to understand that if he has anything which he
                        wishes carried to market, that he can get it cheaper, if there are two
                        parties who are eager to carry it, than if there were but one man who had
                        this monopoly of the carrying business, and who could therefore say, "If you
                        want any carrying done you must pay me what I choose to demand, for there is
                        no one but myself who can do it for you." Now Baltimore owns an interest in
                        a great part of the line from here to Baltimore, and Richmond owns a large
                        interest in the line from here to Richmond, so that it will be manifestly to
                        the interest of the these cities, when they are brought into direct
                        competition, to put the freights on their respective roads down to the
                        lowest possible figure, in order to get our trade. But these cities will not
                        only be each desirous of buying from us, but each will also be eager to sell
                        to us, and therefore will find it to their interest to have the freights on
                        dry goods, groceries, plaster, artificial manures, and indeed everything we
                        buy from them, put as low as possible in order to induce us to buy. So that
                        with two competing cities, and two rival Roads, we will sell everything we
                        need to buy, on better terms than at present. Now if the farmers of Augusta,
                        under the advantage of two roads, will be able to get their flour to market
                        cheaper by 25 cents per barrel than they do at present -- and that this will
                        be the case, has been and can be demonstrated -- the saving on the freight
                        of flour alone will every year amount to nearly
                        or quite the whole yearly tax that will be imposed on the county in
                        consequence of its subscription to the Valley Road. If, for instance, a
                        farmer owns land valued at ten thousand dollars, the Railroad tax on his
                        land would not exceed twenty dollars, and if this same farmer had a surplus
                        of 750 barrels of wheat, or 150 barrels of flour, for sale, he would get it
                        taken to market at 25 cents per barrel cheaper than at present, by which he
                        would save $37.50, which would pay his tax and leave $17.50 of clear gain in
                        his pocket. But, as we have already argued, he will save not only on the
                        transportation of his wheat, but on the transportation of his corn, rye,
                        oats, cattle, hogs, and everything else he sends to market, or if he sells
                        these same things in Staunton the merchants can afford to give him better
                        prices for them, just in proportion as the freights are lower.</p>
                    <p>The building of the Valley Railroad will also greatly enhance the VALUE of
                        our lands. A rise in the price of lands naturally and invariably follows
                        whenever any section of county is penetrated by a Railroad. A late issue of
                        an agriculture paper speaking of "Farming Lands near New York," remarks,
                        "nearness to a railroad, or close proximity to water communication, in all instances exerts more influence in fixing a
                            high price on land than any other one
                        consideration." The reason is obvious; the greater the facility and the less
                        the cost to the farmer of getting his surplus products to market, the larger
                        are his net profits, and, of course, the larger
                        the profits which can be made from land, the greater will be, not only the
                        price, but also the real value of the land. -- Let us suppose the case of
                        two farms of equal fertility, one so near a railroad that it costs only 30
                        cents to market a barrel of flour, the other so distant that it costs 60
                        cents to get a barrel to market; now let us suppose that on each of these
                        farms fifty acres are in wheat, and that each of them produces 150 barrels
                        of flour. In the one case it will cost $45 to market the flour, in the other
                        it will cost double, that is $90 to do the same. One farmer therefore
                        pockets $45, every year from his fifty dollars, more than the other does.
                        Now this $45 represents the interest at 6 per cent on $750. Is not therefore
                        the fifty acres in the one case worth $750 more than the fifty acres in the
                        other or, which is the same thing, ought not the one tract to sell for $15
                        more per acre than the other tract?</p>
                    <p>Or, let us suppose the case of a farmer who every year cultivates fifty acres
                        of land in wheat, and raises 750 bushels, or 150 barrels of flour. He has
                        been in the habit of paying (at 60 cents per barrel) the sum of $90 yearly
                        to get his crop to market; but another Railroad comes along -- the Valley
                        Railroad for instance -- which will carry his floor at 35 cents per barrel,
                        and he thus saves 25 cents on each barrel which amounts to a savings of
                        $37.50 every year on his wheat crop. In other words, in consequence of its
                        costing him less to get his flour to market, his fifty acres now yield him,
                        every year, $47.50 more than they did before; now $37.50 is the interest at
                        6 per cent of $625; ought not then the fifty acres to sell for $625 more
                        than they would have sold for before, or, which is the same thing, are not
                        the fifty acres REALLY WORTH $12.50 more, per acre, to the farmer than
                        formerly?</p>
                    <p>Many men admit that the Radicals raise the price of land; but then they say,
                        "we don't want the price of our lands raised, because we don't want to sell.
                        But the truth is, as shown above, Railroads raise the price of lands, because they really add to
                            their VALUE, and that increased value is the same whether a man
                        continues to hold his land and to pocket the additional profits, or whether
                        he chooses to sell it at the advanced price. If one should propose to any
                        man owning a ten-thousand dollar farm, that he should spend twenty dollars a
                        year for five years in manuring it, offering him a reasonable certainty that
                        at the end of the five years his land would, by this means, be worth, in the
                        market, twelve thousand dollars, he would
                        scarcely refuse to do so. Why then should the same man refuse to be taxed
                        twenty dollars a year for five years, for the purpose of building a Railroad
                        through his county, which will make his land equally worth at least twelve
                        thousand dollars, whether he holds it himself, or sells it, or wills it to
                        his children, with this difference in favor of the Railroad, that it will
                        last forever, while the effects of the manure would speedily disappear under
                        careless cultivation.</p>
                    <p>Want of space forbids me to say any more, but I will be glad hereafter to add
                        a few other considerations in favor of this Road, hoping that meanwhile my
                        country-men will come to the same conclusion with their</p>
                    <p>WELL-WISHER.</p>
