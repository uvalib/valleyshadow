<b>Glorious Victory</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor congratulated Virginia voters on the outcome of the recent
                    elections.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since Tuesday last--election day--our citizens have experienced not only that
                        calm and serene enjoyment which springs from the consciousness of duty
                        faithfully performed, but also the more active pleasure and even ecstatic
                        joy consequent upon rescue from threatened and impending ruin. It is
                        impossible to estimate the evils we have escaped by the glorious victory won
                        at the polls on Tuesday last. Though that victory will not secure us all
                        that we desire, nor all to which we are justly entitled, yet it has saved us
                        from "woes unnumbered," and this good old State from ruin absolute and
                        irretrievable.</p>
                    <p>No people ever won a more important victory, and no people ever had greater
                        reason to rejoice at the result of their patriotic efforts to save their
                        beloved State from a "living death." It appalls the soul to contemplate what
                        the fate of Virginia would have been if victory had perched upon the
                        standard of the Radical party in the recent contest. Many do not realize the
                        vital importance of success in that election--they have never reflected
                        sufficiently upon the subject, and are not aware of the fate with which we
                        were threatened. We hope that we may never again be similarly environed with
                        perils so direful.</p>
                    <p>The escape has been made, the rescue secured; for which we should be duly
                        grateful.</p>

<b>Noble Old Augusta</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gleefully reported that Augusta ranked first among Virginia counties for
                    support of the Conservative ticket. Also praised the "patriotism" of Augusta's
                    citizens for their efforts.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As we had hoped and expected, this noble old county has not only acquitted
                        herself with credit, but has covered herself with glory as with a mantle.
                        She is the banner county of the State. Rockingham is a great and patriotic
                        county, and she did her duty noble. She stands second on the roll of honor,
                        being excelled only by Augusta. When we predicted, before the election, that
                        Augusta would give Walker a majority of 2,500, some thought that we were
                        extravagant in our expectations, and that we would be sadly disappointed.
                        The result shows that our confidence in the patriotism of the citizens of
                        this good old county was well founded, and that our anticipations have been
                        more than realized. It is no small honor to excel in a contest in which all
                        acquit themselves with great credit. In the recent election, all the
                        counties in the State did well, yet Augusta excelled all others--she was
                            primus in primis--and stood amid her noble
                        sisters "proudly eminent." The citizens of Augusta have good reason to be
                        proud of their county. When a great and patriotic duty is to be performed,
                        Augusta can always be confidently relied upon. Whether in the calm of peace
                        or the storm of war, in response to the call of patriotic duty, she acts
                        with prompt alacrity and potent power. She knows when and how to act--her
                        intelligence being commensurate with her patriotism. The disc of the sun is
                        not without spots, and Augusta has the misfortune to have a few sons at whom the slow unerring finger of scorn
                        should be pointed--they form the exceptions which establish the rule--they
                        testify to the patriotism of the great majority, and, by the contrast, make
                        it the more conspicuous.</p>

<b>Conduct of the Colored Voters--How they Should be Treated</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor applauded the conduct of blacks who voted for Walker. He said
                    they acted in their own interests by not making enemies of the whites. Also
                    called on voters to be magnanimous towards blacks and others who voted for
                    Wells, claiming they were deceived by Radicals.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the late election, the colored voters in this section of the State did
                        much better than was expected. Many of them had the good sense and
                        patriotism to vote the Conservative ticket straight and a majority of them
                        voted against the disfranchising and test-oath clauses of the Constitution,
                        even when voting for Wells.--Their conduct in this election was such as not
                        to forfeit the friendship of the whites, as most supposed they would do, by
                        voting, en masse, for Wells and the excepted
                        clauses. This course, on the part of the colored voters, is very gratifying
                        to the whites, who have none other than kind and friendly feelings towards
                        them, and it has had a marked and happy effect which will redound to the
                        great benefit of the colored population. It is our candid opinion that, as
                        much reason as the great mass of the whites have for rejoicing at the result
                        of the election, the colored have more reason to rejoice. By the election of
                        Walker and the defeat of the excepted clauses they secure perfect equality
                        of political rights with the whites, and what is much more important to
                        them, the retention of the friendship of the whites, upon whom they are
                        dependent for employment, shelter, and subsistence.</p>
                    <p>By the election of Wells and the incorporation into the Constitution of the
                        clauses voted upon separately, they would not have added anything to their
                        political rights, and would have forfeited the friendship of the
                        whites.--They would have alienated the races, and have occupied an attitude
                        of hostility to the whites, who have all the advantages over them embraced
                        in the possession of superior numbers, intelligence, money, and property,
                        and, as before remarked, upon whom they are wholly dependent for employment,
                        shelter and subsistence. If they had perpetrated that outrage upon the
                        rights of the whites, it needs no prophet to tell what the conduct of the
                        whites would have been, and consequently, the condition of the perpetrators
                        of such outrage.</p>
                    <p>As we have none other than the kindest feeling for that class of our
                        population, we heartily rejoice, for their sakes, that they have acted so
                        wisely, and that the election resulted as it did. We would counsel the
                        whites to exercise charity towards the colored, and, remembering the
                        circumstances in which they were placed and the influences brought to bear
                        upon them by more guilty parties wearing white skins over black hearts, to
                        make due and liberal allowances for them, and not to visit upon them the
                        punishment due to those who deceived and misled them. Though many did wrong
                        on this occasion, we do not believe that they will do so again. In future,
                        they will do better. "Having won a great victory at the ballot box, it now
                        remains for us to secure its legitimate fruits, and this can only be done by
                        moderation in the use of it. The colored people, it is true, have suffered
                        themselves to be deceived, and have voted almost in solid column, against
                        our interests and their own; but will dismissing
                        them from employment, refusing them assistance, &amp;c., mend the
                        matter? Let us be magnanimous,--as we can afford to be. They are, for the
                        most part, very ignorant, and it was natural that the carpet-baggers, coming
                        among them with specious promises, while we stood aloof from them,
                        politically, should have been able to deceive them, and to persuade them
                        that their interests and ours were antagonistic, but the days of
                        carpet-bagging are numbered, and if we  their delusions and forget
                        their error, we will be able in time, to satisfy them, that the white man

                        but, conscious of our strength, let us use it calmly and wisely and we will
                        secure peace and prosperity which it will be beyond the power of
                        carpet-baggers or scalawags ever again to disturb.</p>
                    <p>In the language of the Dispatch, "we must not
                        thrust them out of our doors to prey on society and to become the outcasts
                        of the earth--the ready instruments of crime. They are here among us, and,
                        as far as we can discern, the providence of God will continue them, at least
                        during our day, part of our civil community. If we deprive them of all means
                        of an honest support they will of necessity have recourse to every crime.
                        Christianity, humanity, and policy, alike dictate to us to show to the
                        colored man by our conduct that we are superior to those who have so long
                        misguided him, and that his happiness depends upon his maintaining relations
                        kindly and harmonious with us."</p>
                    <p>In a speech in Norfolk, on the day after the election, Gov. Gilbert C. Walker
                        used this language:</p>
                    <p>Let us be grateful to God for our great victory, and, fellow-citizens, let us
                        not, in the pride of our victory, forget charity. The great mass of those
                        who voted for Wells yesterday knew not what they did, but the vile crew who
                        led them on deserve the execration and condemnation of the civilized world,
                        and let them sink into the insignificance which God Almighty intended they
                        should occupy."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have fought the battle bravely, says the Lynchburg
                            Virginian, and victory has perched upon our banners. We have
                        broken the backbone of Radicalism, and the monstrous thing lies helpless and
                        bleeding at our feet. It can never again, on this soil, consecrated to
                        Liberty and Truth, by the Fathers of the Republic, who sleep beneath the
                        green sward of the Old Dominion, exert the strength it did on Tuesday last.
                        Never again shall we see such a vote polled by such a party, for such
                        principles, in Virginia. The Conservative party, the True Republican
                        party,--or whatever else that aggregation of individuals, opposed to the
                        diabolism to which the Radical party was committed, may be called,--will, in
                        the next trial of strength, have one hundred thousand majority in this
                        State. Mark the prediction! Indeed, it is doubtful whether the Radical party
                        will ever make another fight here. The major part of its supporters, the
                        poor deluded negroes, whose ignorance and credulity were taken advantage of
                        by the base, venal, self-seeking adventurers who came here in quest of
                        office, will leave the sinking concern and array themselves once more on the
                        side of their old master and best friends. They will see that men of whom we
                        have spoken would, as we have often told them, lure them to ruin. The result
                        of this election will tend to open their eyes. They will see that we were in
                        earnest, and that our statements to the effect that the white people of this
                        State have a controlling majority, are true. They will, therefore, desert
                        the beggarly pack of vagrant adventurers and native scalawags who have
                        seduced them to the worship of false gods, and ally themselves once more
                        with their ancient friends.</p>
                    <p>And now, what is the policy we should observe towards these poor people? We
                        answer: Treat them kindly. Forgive the erring. Pity the infirmities of the
                        weak. Show them that the hour of victory is the opportunity for magnanimity.
                        They have been misled by the artful and the designing. Hold the leaders
                        responsible, but excuse those who have been deceived.</p>

                    <p>Modest, unpretending Craigsville has the distinguished honor of being the
                        banner precinct of the banner county. That precinct gave a unanimous vote for Walker. Though thirty-two
                        colored citizens voted at that precinct, yet there was not a single vote
                        cast there for Wells. The colored as well as the whites in that precinct had
                        the good sense and patriotism to vote for Walker in preference to Wells.
                        Such unanimity in such a cause is as admirable as it is rare. It presents a
                        noble spectacle. It may be equaled, but it cannot be surpassed. Nine cheers
                        and a tiger for the Craigsville precinct! The colored citizens who voted
                        there will neither be forgotten nor go unrewarded.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR:--Virginia is redeemed--Augusta has done well, but Craigsville is
                        the banner precinct, not of the county, but of the State. Let me suggest
                        that the ladies undertake to have a suitable banner prepared to erect not on
                        the 4th, but the 6th of July, hereafter, on Elliott's Knob--within the
                        precinct. An anecdote is told of a Michigan Regiment, (it must have been
                        organized by Wells,) that was found weeping bitterly around an old saw mill somewhere in Arkansas, during the late
                        war. On enquiry as to the cause, they said it was because they could not steal it, it being the last thing
                        left they had not stolen. It may be well for R.T. Daniel, as chairman of the
                        Executive Committee, to look after the Governor's mansion or its contents,
                        to see that Wells does not steal it or them.</p>
                    <p>As we will have an immediate exodus of
                        carpet-baggers and scalawags from Virginia, I would suggest that a big thing
                        might be made out of them, in colonizing them at the Sinks of Humboldt
                        River, where they might enter into the manufacture of soda, potash and other
                        alkalis. This precinct will furnish a brisk, cute, active son of Crispin,
                        who belongs to the old issue of Cuffee, a white scalawag, who will do the
                        milling of the colony, and will not neglect the taking
                            of toll. He can have the mill-wrighting all done in the family. We can also spare an
                        experienced shingle and stave getter, who will also aid in defending the colony from the
                        grizzlies. The Union Pacific will accommodate the colony, at low rates of
                        fare, for fear Wells will have the road sold out.
                        He (Wells) will not care to go further West, for fear he may meet Stoneman.</p>
