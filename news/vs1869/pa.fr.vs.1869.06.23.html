<b>"Temperance"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the rhetoric and tactics of temperance fanatics. Especially has
                    trouble with the fanatics' call for punishing the makers and sellers of liquor,
                    makes a counter-argument that asks why they don't call for the punishment of gun
                    manufacturers. Appreciates the work of moderate temperance reformers but can't
                    stand the fanatics.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>They had a model temperance meeting in Washington the other night, just after
                        the mild African man and brother had bullied and butchered his way into the
                        municipal control of the American capital. It is very odd that people who
                        drink no ardent spirits should be so full of fire and -oil as these
                        teetotallers usually are. One of them desired a prohibitory law which should
                        punish liquor-selling with "five hundred years imprisonment and a passport
                        to hell." The audience thought this a charming rally of wit.
                        Less, an English "apostle," who, having run himself down
                        to his name in Great Britain, has recently been diverted upon these shores,
                        was also present. The hall was decorated with "portraits of Victoria and
                        General Grant." This was exquisitely appropriate, as the Queen is known
                        never to touch bitter beer, while the President's dislike of Bourbon amounts
                        to a positive mania!--N. Y. World.</p>
                    <p>There are signs of a revival of the "temperance" mania that afflicted a
                        considerable portion of this country twenty years ago, when nasal-twanged
                        Yankee loafers and dilapidated old topers were hired at low wages to squeak
                        their studied speeches and exhibit their red noses wherever they could find
                        a small squad of men and women to listen to them or look at them. We
                        remember their railing and their red noses. Those who did the railing
                        denounced manufacturers and sellers of liquor as murderous. The slobbering
                        brutes who showed the red noses endorsed this and attempted to prove it by
                        confessing that they had killed their wives and children while under the
                        influence of intoxicating drink. Instead of slinking away from public gaze
                        and praying in scores for the forgiveness of their crimes, these blear-eyed
                        wretches stood up in our churches, in our halls and in our public streets,
                        and laid their own enormous sins on other people's doors and asked us to
                        applaud them for doing so.</p>
                    <p>We yield to no man in respect for the individual who passes through life with
                        his "head level" all the time. We claim no place in the ranks of temperate
                        men and we have no words of encouragement for those who addict themselves to
                        strong drink. But we have something to say against charging the liquor-manufacturers and liquor-sellers with the offences committed by the liquor-drinkers. When one man kills another with a
                        Bowie-knife, nobody proposes to give the seller of the knife "five hundred
                        years' imprisonment and a passport to hell." It is the murderer who bought
                        and used the knife who is held to deserve punishment.--So when one man
                        shoots another with a gun or a pistol, it is not the manufacturer or seller
                        of the gun or pistol who is held accountable, but the purchaser and user of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>If our modern reformers wish to set the world right through the
                        agonny of pain and penalties upon manufacturers and sellers, why
                        do they not propose to enact laws for the punishment of makers and sellers
                        of guns, pistols, knives and other deadly weapons? They may answer that
                        guns, pistols and knives are useful in war and for purposes of self-defence.
                        We unhesitatingly assert that they are less useful than
                        visous and spirituous liquors, which are of great value
                        in medicine and the mechanic arts.--The science of medicine and the mechanic
                        arts are among the blessings of mankind, whilst war is a curse to any people
                        upon whom it comes.</p>
                    <p>As for the use of guns, pistols and knives for purposes of self-defence, that
                        does not amount to much. They serve the thief and the murderer as well as
                        the honest and sociable man. In fact they serve him
                        better, for with their aid he commits his robbery or murder more readily
                        than would be possible without them. Going prepared with his knife and
                        pistol, he takes his intended victim at such disadvantage that resistance is
                        out of the question.</p>
                    <p>Now if the maker and seller of a gun, a pistol or a knife ought not to be
                        held accountable for the injury done by it in the hands of some person to
                        whom it may have been sold, why should the maker or seller of spirituous or
                            visous liquors be held to account for any injury that
                        the buyer thereof may do to himself or to others? Is it more criminal to
                        call an article with which a man may kill himself by slow degrees if he
                        chooses, than to sell one with which he may take his own or another's life
                        instantly?</p>
                    <p>We say nothing against those good people who exhort their fellow man to be
                        temperate. They do well. We commend all those members of the various
                        temperance organizations who seek out the intemperate and strive to reform
                        them. They do a godly work. But the temperance fanatics who will be
                        satisfied with nothing short of the death and damnation of all makers and
                        sellers of liquor, are a different set of men. As a general thing they are
                        bad men and ought to receive no countenance from good people. The language
                        they use shows that they are swayed by passions worse than those from which
                        they profess so ardent a desire to save the drunkard.</p>

<b>Is He Afraid?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gloats that a Republican legislator from Franklin county is not seeking
                    renomination. Attributes this action to his vote in favor of the 15th amendment,
                    claims the voters will voice their displeasure with it at the polls in the next
                    election.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We hear that Capt. Walker, our last member of the Legislature from this
                        county, declines a nomination. Why is this? Is he particularly averse to
                        spending another winter in the midst of the harpies and vultures that infest
                        the capital at Harrisburg, or has he detected, in the deep and dissonant
                        mutterings of a betrayed, insulted constituency, the reward that awaits at
                        the polls, his perfidious acts as representative? We are inclined to believe
                        that the latter is the more correct reason. We feel that the Captain's
                        refusal to be a candidate is not owing to his aversion to the office, but to
                        a fear of going before his people on the record he made for himself in a
                        single session. We know that he had hardly been out of his seat in the last
                        House a week, before he was found at Waynesboro' trying to heal a slight
                        breach made in his party ranks there. If the Captain, as he now says, had at
                        that time determined not to be a candidate, why should he trouble himself
                        about healing up the petty dissensions occasioned by his support of a local
                        measure. The truth of the whole matter, we opine, is this. The Captain,
                        brave and fearless as he may have been when facing the deadly missiles of
                        his country's enemies, has not the moral courage to "face the music"
                        occasioned by his vote on the Constitutional Amendment. Indeed we have
                        learned that in the Captain's own home, his course in this particular is so
                        strongly condemned that those who so persistently sought and obtained his
                        nomination by the last convention, are even afraid to advance his standard a
                        second time, and have now nothing but cold and weak assurance for the man
                        whom they induced to cast his vote for a measure alike degrading to himself,
                        and those who made a catspaw of him in the attainment of their own selfish
                        ends. They have used you, Captain, you can now go. It would be impolite to
                        renominate you, especially when they can nominate one, who, while he is in
                        full sympathy with the most outrageous acts of his party, can avoid the
                        issue of a direct vote on any of them. With such a candidate they can go
                        before the people and report the assurances and false promises of former
                        years--namely: that they are opposed to Negro Suffrage, or only in favor of
                        it by a direct vote of the people. After the action of a Republican
                        Legislature last winter, will they be believed? We shall see what we shall
                        see.</p>
