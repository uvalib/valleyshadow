                <transcript>
                    <p>Congress convened on Monday. Our information is of course very limited as to
                        their proceedings at the time we go to press. It can safely be assumed,
                        however, that they have begun this session as they left off the last. We
                        must have still further patching of the work of reconstruction, and it is
                        altogether probable that the session will end and one State at least be left
                        "out in the cold." Texas, by electing a Conservative Governor, has put
                        herself beyond the pale of recognition as a State, and she will be allowed
                        to stay out until she chooses to degrade herself so as to conform to the
                        requirements of the reconstruction measures. Inasmuch as Mississippi seems
                        to have elected a Radical Governor, she will be likely to be allowed
                        representation at once. It is said that Grant intended to recommend the
                        immediate admission of Virginia, and if so, her prolonged anxiety and
                        suspense will be at an end.</p>
                    <p>We must expect, too, any amount of tinkering at the financial question. Every
                        member will be likely to have some theory of his own as to the best way to
                        make times easy and keep the Radical party afloat. The session will be
                        consumed with long and dry and many of them senseless arguments on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>We shall have still further propositions for the protection of the negro in
                        his newly vested rights, and further demands for the concession of other
                        rights. In fact, if the party in power advances as rapidly during this
                        session as it has done in the past, it may be advisable to get up petitions
                        memoralizing them to turn their attention to the protection of <emph
                            rend="italic">white</emph> men from the arrogance of those who are being
                        rapidly changed from <emph rend="italic">Sudras</emph> into <emph
                            rend="italic">Brahmins</emph>, under the progressive ideas of
                        Radicalism.</p>
                    <p>We shall have also any quantity of bluster and <emph rend="italic"
                        >show</emph> of sympathy for the struggling Cubans without any substantial
                        aid or encouragement.</p>
                    <p>We shall have also frequent repetitions of former disgraceful outrages, in
                        the decision of all contested election cases in favor of the Radical
                        candidates. We expect to see the terrible iniquity consummated of giving the
                        seat in the 21st Pennsylvania district to that next to the prince of
                        humbugs, (the Prince being Geary) John Covode, or Govode, as he says it used
                        to be spelled.</p>
                    <p>We can only say, at this the beginning of the session, from all contemplated
                        Radical outrages, Good Lord, deliver us.</p>
