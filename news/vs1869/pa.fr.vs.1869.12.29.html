<b>A State Thrown Out</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes with outrage Congress' plan to refuse Georgia representation unless
                    the state passes the 15th amendment. Believes Congress is acting with
                    dictatorial power and is alarmed that people seem unaware of it. Also points out
                    how Congress has plans to stifle the Supreme Court if need be in order to ensure
                    passage of the 15th amendment.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The facility with which the Radicals take a State into, or throw it out of
                        the Union, is really surprising. To some few old fogies like ourselves, it
                        seems somewhat startling, but the great body of the people keep no account
                        of it. They have come to look up on the whole action of Congress as a sort
                        of sleight-of-hand performance which can possibly do no good and, under the
                        care of Providence, no harm. Bills have been introduced in the Senate and
                        House of Representatives, which might well cause the bones of Washington,
                        Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson to rattle in their coffin. Were they in full
                        life to-day, to witness the encroachments which the legislative department
                        is making upon the other two branches of the government, they would warn the
                        people in more impressive language than any ever employed by them, against
                        the dangers which threaten their liberties. And, then, looking up the apathy
                        which characterizes the American people in relation to the destructive
                        legislation emanating from the National Capitol, they would be apt to
                        concede that the spirit of '76 had ceased to animate American citizens and
                        that the present generation are degenerate sons of noble sires.</p>
                    <p>In 1861, eleven States seceded from the Union. The whole military power of
                        the remaining States was called into requisition to force them back. Four
                        years of bloody war ensued, waged upon the basis of the celebrated
                        Crittenden resolutions. The North triumphed. The Rebels threw down their
                        arms, and since then, no act of hostility to the government has been
                        committed. Four years have passed since the war closed, and yet Virginia,
                        Mississippi and Texas have never been readmitted, while, greatest outrage of
                        all, the State of Georgia, which had been re-admitted on terms prescribed by
                        Congress, has been thrust out again.</p>
                    <p>The adoption of the fourteenth amendment was secured by notifying Georgia and
                        other Southern States that they could not be admitted to representation in
                        Congress until they would ratify it.</p>
                    <p>Next came the fifteenth amendment and, finding that there are not sufficient
                        States willing to ratify it so as to make it a part of the Constitution,
                        Congress has had recourse to the novel and shameful expedient of excluding
                        Georgia until she agrees to ratify the fifteenth
                        amendment also. Was ever such disgraceful legislation conceived of before?
                        And shall all this tyranny be exercised in the name of liberty, and under
                        the very pretence of securing a republican form of government to that State?
                        Oh Liberty! What crimes are perpetrated in thy name! The consequences of
                        this step do not attach to Georgia alone. They affect her less than they do
                        Pennsylvania. In Georgia, the negro votes already. In Pennsylvania he does
                        not. Let this system be carried out of throwing States out of the Union
                        until they adopt the fifteenth amendment, and in that way, negro suffrage
                        will be forced upon the unwilling people of this State. Congress thus, in
                        fact, will regulate the suffrage in this Commonwealth. This is an assumption
                        of power on the part of the legislative department which no Congress would
                        have dared to attempt before the war. Shall we get back to the days of
                        constitutional government, or are we doomed to submit to the despotism of a
                        Congressional Directory?</p>
                    <p>And, through fear that this scheme will be thwarted at some future day, by a
                        decision of the highest judicial tribunal that such acts are
                        unconstitutional and, therefore, void, the Chief Magistrate is engaged in
                        selecting men for the Supreme Bench who will be the tools of Radical
                        Congressmen and hold, from their seats of justice, that Congress "can do no
                        wrong."</p>
                    <p>And, lest the Supreme Court might prove obstreperous and still feel inclined
                        to interfere with Congressional action, Congress is about to lop off from
                        the Supreme Court the power to pass upon the constitutionality of any of its
                        acts. A more ingenious plan was never devised to force such an obnoxious
                        measure as this fifteenth amendment upon an unwilling people.</p>
