                    <p>One of the best evidences of the unpopularity of negro suffrage in Franklin
                        county, is the fact that the Radical candidates are
                            positively trying to persuade the people that they are opposed to
                        it. To hear them talk, when no Radical leaders are near, you would
                        think that they entertained a perfect abhorrence of negro equality. Do not
                        let them "pull the wool over your eyes," Conservatives. They are keeping the
                        negro in the back-ground until after they are elected. They are in hearty
                        sympathy with the principles of the party that nominated them.</p>
                    <p>Keep thinking of it until after you have voted, that
                            McKnight will vote to sustain the revolution which is forcing negro
                            suffrage upon the people of Pennsylvania against their will. Let
                            repeal be your watchword, and support the
                        Democratic candidates.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals were wont to tell us that if Slavery were abolished "the negro
                        question would be settled." Slavery has been abolished. Is the negro
                        question settled?</p>
                    <p>They tell us now, let the negro vote and "the negro question will be forever
                        settled." But this is not so. Already the further demands of the negro have
                        reached your ears. Already have a few Radical extremists intimated that
                        still further concessions must be made by the whites. Already have they told
                        us that the privileges and rights of the negroes must be extended. In the
                        District of Columbia, which is under the immediate control of Congress, the
                        negro has not only been clothed with the right of suffrage, but he has been
                        elected to official positions. He has become a member of
                            the City Council. He dispenses justice as an
                            Alderman. He decides upon the rights of life, liberty and
                        property of the white citizen, as a juror. The
                        common schools are thrown open to his children just as they are to the
                        whites. The demand is made that, not only must they be allowed to enter the
                        same schools, but they must be instructed together, and there must be no distinction of any kind made on account of race or
                            color.</p>
                    <p>In the Southern States, the same demands have been made and enforced under
                        penalty of permanent exclusion from representation in Congress. Hence, there
                        the negro votes, holds office, is a juror and assists in making laws.</p>
                    <p>Do you suppose that Radical demands will fall anything short of this in the
                            loyal States? Inasmuch as they have
                        deliberately violated their plighted faith on the fifteenth amendment, can
                        they be trusted now, when they say that if you give the negro the ballot,
                        that will be a settlement of the negro question?</p>
                    <p>The Radical party expects to make the negro an element of strength in all
                        future elections and, for this reason, will demand for him perfect equality
                        with the whites. Once give him the ballot, and they will claim for him the
                        right to hold office here. They will make him a juror. He will not only take
                        his seat alongside of whites in railroad cars, but he must go into the
                        common schools and into the same classes with the whites. Your Colleges and
                        Seminaries will be thrown open to blacks and whites alike. Not only will
                        your Colleges and Seminaries for young men be forced to admit negroes, but
                        your female Seminaries will be subject to the same rules and your daughters
                        will be thrown into association and companionship with the daughters of
                        negroes. Give the Radicals the power, and they will soon supply the
                        legislation necessary to accomplish this.</p>
                    <p>Conservatives, your only safety lies in stopping this fanaticism at the point
                        which it has now reached. Elect men to your Legislature
                            who will vote to repeal the resolution ratifying the fifteenth
                            amendment, and, if the negro is prevented from obtaining the ballot, the
                            demands for his elevation to political and social equality will
                        cease.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Democrats keep you eyes open. The Radical candidate for Assembly is a shrewd
                        politician. He has been in the Legislature before. He has been moving about
                        among the people of this County giving his views privately to the Democracy.
                        We have heard of him in St. Thomas township. One of the most reliable men in
                        that neighborhood has given us the substance of a conversation with him. He
                        has been soliciting the votes of the Democrats there. He tells them that he
                        is conservative--that he is opposed to negro
                        suffrage--that he believes in hiring negroes to labor, but he wants them to sit at a different table from
                        him. And then, he urges that he is particularly anxious to secure
                        payment of the border claims.</p>
                    <p>Don't put any confidence in these statements. They are
                            made for the purpose of obtaining votes. Wm. H. McKnight will never vote
                            to repeal the resolution ratifying the fifteenth amendment. If a vote
                            should be taken upon that question, he would vote to sustain the
                            resolution which forces negro suffrage upon the people of Pennsylvania,
                            notwithstanding all his palaver about conservatism, and opposition to
                            negro suffrage.</p>
                    <p>Vote for Skinner and Milliken. They are both
                        Democrats. They are openly opposed to negro suffrage. They have no
                        hesitation in expressing their opinions publicly or privately. They make no
                        statements to Radicals in private differing from the platform on which they
                        were nominated.</p>
                    <p>And as to the border claims, they are just as anxious to secure the payment
                        of them, and just as able to do it, as Mr. McKnight. Dr. Milliken has his
                        heart in this business. He will not only vote, but he will exert all his
                        influence to procure the passage of a bill to pay the border sufferers. He
                        is an active, influential gentleman and may be relied on with perfect
                        safety. Capt. Skinner's interests are identified with the interests of the
                        people of this County. He will seek to serve his constituents, faithfully
                        and effectively, by urging with all his energy and ability, this act of
                        justice to our plundered people. Elect your own candidates, Democrats, and
                        let us have a repeal of the iniquitous resolution
                            forcing negro suffrage upon us, and let us have payment too, for the
                            border losses.</p>

<b>Candidate for Assembly</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Dr. D. B. Milliken, the Democratic candidate for Assembly in this Legislative
                        District from Perry County, paid us a visit last week. He is a very pleasant
                        gentleman and evidently a man of more than ordinary ability. Little Perry
                        has made a selection which it gives us great pleasure to endorse. The Dr's
                        visit was necessarily a somewhat hurried one, but he made the most of his
                        time while here. He visited Greencastle, Fayetteville, St. Thomas, and
                        mingled freely with the people of these places. He made the acquaintance of
                        a large number of the citizens of this Borough and impressed them all
                        favorably. We found him sound to the core in the principles of the
                        Democratic party, exceedingly hostile to all the negro suffrage and negro
                        equality notions of the Radicals, and earnestly enlisted in the cause of the
                        border sufferers. We feel sure that, if elected, he will labor for the
                        interests of our people, faithfully and energetically, and we know that
                            he will vote to repeal that infamous resolution
                            ratifying the fifteenth amendment.</p>
