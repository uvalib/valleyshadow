<b>The Tenure of Office Law</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Comments on the Senate's hesitation to repeal the Tenure of Office Act.
                    Says a lot of Republicans, even Grant, join Democrats in demanding full repeal
                    but others hold out because they don't want Grant to have total patronage power.
                    Feels those who favor repeal will ultimately triumph.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Congress does not make haste to relieve Grant of the shackles which a former
                        Congress put upon Johnson. And Grant, stubborn, unyielding, bull-dog like,
                        refuses to make any removals on political grounds until the obnoxious law
                        which gave rise to the great impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson is blotted
                        from the statute books. He has determined to be free, or else to disappoint
                        the whole horde of office-seekers.--But the Senate will not come to a vote.
                        Some of the Radical Senators are in favor a an absolute repeal--others
                        desire merely a suspension until the meeting of Congress in December.
                        Senators Morton and Sherman lead the repealers, whilst Edmunds, Sehurs,
                        Scott, and Carpenter are the most prominent against the repeal of the
                        law.--The Democrats go for absolute repeal on the ground of the
                        unconstitutionality of the law. They attempted to prevent its passage when
                        it was enacted to cripple Andrew Johnson and they now favor its repeal for
                        the same reasons that induced them to object to it then.</p>
                    <p>The real reason for the refusal of the Radicals to repeal the law, is,
                        certainly, a distrust, or fear of General Grant. They do not know whether or
                        not they can rely on him. He is such a self-willed creature that he is just
                        as likely to pull the wrong way in the traces as the right way, if he takes
                        the notion. They are anxious to have him turn out the majority of present
                        office-holders, but they fear that he might desire to throw out some of his
                        own appointees hereafter without consulting them, and this is where the shoe
                        pinches.</p>
                    <p>Besides, there is an apprehension that if Grant is allowed to act as he sees
                        fit, he will use the immense patronage of the government to secure his
                        re-election. The question of the succession is already troubling the minds
                        of sundry Senators. Some of them are aspirants for the Presidency.--They
                        know very well that Grant would not have abandoned the splendid and
                        lucrative position which he held as General of the Army if he had not
                        thought that he could retain the office for eight years. They know, too,
                        what a wide-spreading influence the President of the United States can wield
                        in favor of his re-election by a careful and shrewd distribution of the
                        Federal patronage. Hence, these Senators who are looking forward to
                        Presidential honors themselves, have no idea of putting this tremendous
                        power in Grant's hands if they can help it.</p>
                    <p>But Grant, we think, is "master of the situation." He has the entire army of
                        office-seekers with him. They are as hungry and as anxious to get at the
                        public crib as they can possibly be. They are bringing a heavy pressure to
                        bear on Senators who are not aspiring to the Presidency to induce them "to
                        let up" on Grant. Their arguments will most likely prove effective in the
                        end, although, just now, it seems as if the suspension party would triumph.
                        The House, it is thought, however, will refuse to concur and will insist on
                        repeal, so that the whole matter will likely go to a committee of
                        conference. We are of the opinion that the Senate will ultimately be forced
                        to yield. If the bill should pass only to suspend the law, it is thought
                        that Grant will veto it, as he has declared that he will not be satisfied
                        with anything but an absolute repeal of the law.</p>

<b>The Negro Monster</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Cites with horror the recent assaults upon three white women by a black
                    youth. Says the attacker was inspired by Radical doctrines of racial equality
                    and subsequent racial hatred of blacks toward whites. Thus puts sole blame for

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The three flagrant outrages of which we give a full account in our local
                        columns are unparalleled in the history of Franklin County. They stand
                        unequaled in their enormity by anything that we have read of in the history
                        of the State, or country, short of absolute murder. In fact, in one sense,
                        the crimes are greater than that of murder. In a thickly settled country,
                        within three miles of the Borough of Chambersburg, and in the broad light of
                        day, a negro has ravished a white girl of thirteen years, and two young
                        white single women, daughters of some of the most respectable people in this
                        neighborhood. To be the victims of such an outrage is a fate worse than
                        death itself. The perpetrator of three such outrages is a monster in
                        iniquity. And yet, if the arrested man be the guilty party, he has not
                        reached his majority. Young in years, he is old in crime. In one day he has
                        ranked himself among the most atrocious criminals of the present age.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult, of course, to ascertain the motive which prompted him to
                        commit these deeds of violence. But we can not believe that these outrages
                        were committed for the mere gratification of his lust. There must have been
                        something more than this. The arrested man is a resident of that sink of
                        iniquity called "Wolffstown." He is one of its shrewdest and most abandoned
                        inhabitants. The Free-loveism which prevails there is notorious. There was
                        no necessity for him to go out of its immediate precincts. This was not the
                        impelling motive.</p>
                    <p>This negro, as we have said, is one of the shrewdest and sharpest of his
                        race. He has been through the streets of Chambersburg and heard Radicalism
                        descant upon the rights of the negro. He has
                        listened to the recital of the long list of imaginary grievances which the
                        poor negro has suffered at the hands of the whites. He has been told what a
                        base thing it is to deprive any of "God's creatures of their inalienable
                        rights on account of the color of his skin." All this blessed doctrine has
                        kindled an enmity in his heart against the whites and he has wreaked his
                        vengeance upon unprotected white women.</p>
                    <p>To such outrages as these are the progressive ideas of the Radicals leading
                        us. So roll us the ball. Lift this degraded, ignorant, bestial race to an
                        equality with the whites, and--"let us have peace."</p>

                    <p>Undoubtedly there are some members of the Republican party who would not like
                        to sit in the jury box with Negroes. There are perhaps some who would not
                        have voted for Gen. Grant if they had supposed he would aid in thrusting
                        Negroes into the jury box. Let all such read the following, and in it read
                        what is in store for the white people of this land if the Radical party is
                        not speedily put down:</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, March 19.--The President informed the Senate to-day that he had
                        approved and signed the bill for the further security of equal rights in the
                        District of Columbia. It is therefore a law and is as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Be it enacted, &amp;c., That the word
                        'white,' wherever it occurs in the laws relating to the District of
                        Columbia, or in the charter or ordinances of the cities of Washington and
                        Georgetown, and operates as a limitation on the right on any elector of such
                        District or of either of the cities to hold any office or to be selected and
                        to serve as a juror be and the same is hereby repealed and it shall be
                        unlawful for any person or officer to enforce or attempt to enforce such
                        limitation after the passage of this act."</p>
                    <p>This law removes the distinctions heretofore existing between whites and
                        blacks in the District of Columbia. It puts Negroes in the jury box and
                        allows them to hold office. If the Black Beast who outraged three white
                        women near this place last week should escape and locate in the District of
                        Columbia, he would, under this law just approved by Grant, be entitled to
                        sit on the jury and pass upon matters in controversy between white men.
                        Throw up your hats for Grant.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our town has been in a state of the most intense excitement ever since last
                        Thursday. The cause of the excitement is as follows:</p>
                    <p>On Thursday, about noon, a negro went to the house of Mr. Wm. M. Oliver in
                        Guilford township about 2 1/2 miles from this Borough. Mr. Oliver and his
                        wife were both away from home. A step-daughter of Mr. Oliver, named Ida
                        Reinhart, who is about thirteen years of age, had also been at a neighboring
                        house, but at noon went home to feed the pigs. She was in the house getting
                        the necessary feed when the negro went there, and had the door locked. He
                        came to the door but she refused to admit him. He pretended to be hungry and
                        demanded bread, threatening to burn down the house, if she would not let him
                        in. Terrified at these threats, she opened the door, when the black
                        scoundrel seized her, threw her upon the floor and outraged her person. The
                        little girl is pretty badly injured. The negro then took with him from the
                        house a razor belonging to Mr. Oliver and a small sum of money which was
                        lying on a mantel. Mr. Oliver's house lies in a South-Easterly direction
                        from town.</p>
                    <p>The negro then left and, crossing roads and fields, got around to the road
                        leading from this Borough to Scotland in a North Easterly direction from
                        town. About a mile from here, a gentleman resides by the name of John
                        Landis. The negro accosted a little boy whom he saw there and asked him if
                        there were any men about. The boy said no. Just then a young lady named
                        Lydia Detwiler was seen passing through a field some distance off, and the
                        negro went over towards her, and caught up to her about two hundred yards
                        from her father's house which is in Green township. He attacked her at once
                        and accomplished his purpose, the young lady resisting him to the best of
                        her ability.</p>
                    <p>From there he went in the direction of Mr. Jacob Fry's house and when within
                        a couple of hundred yards of it, he met a young lady named Miss Leah Lehman.
                        He attacked her also and a most terrible struggle took place. He struck her
                        on the back of the head with a club, on the face so that it is covered with
                        black marks, and choked her so as to leave black and blue marks upon her
                        neck. In the struggle he took a razor from his pocket and drew it close to
                        her throat threatening to kill her. She grasped the razor and broke the
                        handle off, which she still has in her possession. Notwithstanding this
                        heroic resistance, the black scoundrel succeeded in accomplishing his
                        purpose with this lady also. We understand that she is still confined to her
                        bed from the injuries received.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oliver has since seen the handle and blade of the razor used in this last
                        struggle and identifies it as his own.</p>
                    <p>On Friday, a negro answering the description given by the little girl and the
                        ladies, was seen in this town and was arrested by Mr. Frederick Householder
                        and Mr. Nicholas Uglow under the directions of Sheriff Fletcher. His name is
                        Cain Norris and his residence is "Wolffstown." He was taken to the jail.</p>
                    <p>On Friday night, between seven and eight o'clock, the fire-bell tapped and a
                        rush was made for the jail. In about ten minutes no less than eight hundred,
                        perhaps a thousand people were gathered about the building. The crowd seemed
                        wild with excitement and anxious to obtain possession of the prisoner. But
                        Sheriff Fletcher refused to deliver him up and expressed his determination
                        to protect him. Several of our citizens made speeches urging the crowd to
                        desist from the undertaking but the Sheriff still fearing an attack called
                        upon Captain George W. Skinner of "the Housum Zouaves" to come to his
                        assistance. Capt. Skinner brought up some of his men with their muskets in
                        obedience to the Sheriff's requisition, and after the Chief Burgess had
                        interposed his authority also, the crowd left and went to their homes. On
                        Saturday and Sunday nights, similar attempts were apprehended and the
                        Sheriff in consequence, had the jail guarded. It is to be sincerely hoped
                        that no further attempts of this character will be made. The negro
                        unquestionably deserves, if guilty, far more than the severest punishment of
                        the law. But it is the duty of all order-loving citizens to leave him in the
                        hands of the Sheriff to be dealt with by a Court and jury. We know that
                        these sentiments will not meet the approbation of the majority of the people
                        in this vicinity, laboring as they are under the excitement which these
                        gross outrages have produced. But when "the sober second thought" comes we
                        feel sure our people will agree with us. Let us set no such bad precedents
                        in this community as the lynching of this man would be. Let us never allow a
                        mob to constitute themselves the judges as to what offences should be
                        punished with death, and deal out the punishment themselves. Such conduct
                        will undermine the foundations of law and order and give a license to mobs
                        to deal in a similar manner with offenders hereafter. Let us save ourselves
                        from anarchy.</p>
                    <p>We have heard our young friend Captain Skinner very severely abused for the
                        part he took on the night of the riot. We beg leave to lay before our
                        citizens a section of a law of this State with which they do not seem to be
                        familiar. Section 87 of an Act approved 21st April, 1858, reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>In case of any breach of the peace, tumult, riot or resistance of process of
                        this state, or apprehension of immediate danger of the same, it shall be
                        lawful for the sheriff of any county, or mayor of any
                            city, to call for aid from the commandant of the military force of said
                            city or county; it shall be the duty of the commanding officer to
                        whom such order is given, to order out in force, or any part-thereof under
                        his command; and such force shall always remain under command of its own
                        officers; in such case it shall not be necessary for commanding officers of
                        companies to issue written orders or notices for calling out their men, but
                        verbal orders or notices shall be sufficient.</p>
                    <p>The Sheriff called upon Capt. Skinner to aid him, and being a sworn officer,
                        he was obliged to perform his duty without regard to the popularity or
                        unpopularity of his notion.</p>
