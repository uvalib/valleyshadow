                    <p>No County has done better for the Democracy than Franklin County. For eight
                        years we have been struggling to gain the ascendency, but have not had a
                            <emph rend="italic">complete</emph> triumph during that time. We have
                            <emph rend="italic">elected</emph> portions of our ticket at times, but
                        it was reserved for us to make a clean sweep this year. We have done it, and
                        done it effectually. The lowest majority for candidates on the County ticket
                        is one hundred and twenty-five, and the highest is five hundred and
                        ninety-eight. For our candidate for Governor we have given a majority of
                        three hundred and eight.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy of Chambersburg have done particularly well. The North Ward
                        gave but seventy of a majority for Geary, and the South Ward gave a majority
                        of fifteen for Packer, thus leaving the majority for Geary only fifty-five
                        in the Borough. Last October, the majority for the Radical candidate for
                        Auditor General in this Borough was one hundred and fifty-one.</p>
                    <p>The vote cast for Mr. Welsh, the Democratic candidate for Prothonotary, is a
                        very flattering one, especially at Waynesboro'. His neighbors and friends
                        there voted for him with a will, and he leads the State ticket in that box
                        two hundred votes.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Skinner has reason to be proud of the vote which he received in the
                        County. In this Borough, he was most bitterly assailed by Mr. H. M. White,
                        Chairman of the County Executive Committee, who labored from the opening to
                        the closing of the polls to secure his defeat. An indefatigable worker, he
                        succeeded in pulling a considerable number of votes against him and in favor
                        of Wm. C. M'Knight the Radical candidate for Assembly. In spite of this
                        opposition, however, Capt. Skinner leads Packer in the North Ward sixteen
                        and in the South Ward twelve votes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. White's opposition was based upon certain grievances which he alleges
                        that he sustained at the hands of Capt. Skinner.</p>
                    <p>This action on his part, is, in our judgment, wholly indefensible. As a
                        private citizen, he had an undoubted right to vote for whom he pleased and
                        to oppose whomsoever he pleased. But as the head of the party organization
                        in the County, as the Chairman of the County Committee, it was his duty to
                        labor assiduously for the success of the <emph rend="italic">whole</emph>
                        ticket. If he could not do this, he should have resigned his official
                        position.</p>
                    <p>When this defection was discovered, as it was early in the morning, it
                        dampened the ardor of many faithful workers in the party. It was no small
                        discouragement to the rank and file to know that the man who ought to have
                        led the Democratic column was secretly laboring to defeat some of the
                        Democratic candidates. The news of this effort at bushwhacking spread
                        rapidly and for a time had a very depressing influence. But the Democracy
                        soon rallied and the result is a large reduction of the Radical majority in
                        this Borough.</p>
                    <p>We again congratulate the Democracy of the County on this glorious victory.
                        We leave it to the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> and <emph
                            rend="italic">Public Opinion</emph> to explain the causes which have led
                        to this result, so disastrous to them, assuring them that we know exactly
                        how they feel, for we have gone through the same melancholy experience
                        several times ourselves.</p>

                <head>The Registry Law Elects Geary</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>John W. Geary has been re-elected Governor of Pennsylvania. At least the
                        figures, as reported by the Return Judges of the several counties of the
                        State, make his majority about four thousand.</p>
                    <p>That the election was carried fairly by the Radical party, no candid man who
                        examines the operation of the infamous Registry law in Philadelphia will
                        assert. That law was framed for the express purpose of giving the Radical
                        party absolute control of that City. To affect this end, it lodged the
                        registering power in the hands of the Alderman, a large majority of whom are
                        Radicals. Then it discriminated between Philadelphia and the other counties
                        of the State in this, that it allowed the Registration Board to strike from
                        the list registered voters, after the Registry had been completed, the names
                        of those who were, in the opinion of the Board, not qualified to vote. This
                        fearful power was exercised without conscientious scruples by an act of
                        partisans who saw proper to strike off large numbers of Democrats for no
                        good reason whatever. Any party can thus easily manufacture a large majority
                        for itself. Then, too, in Philadelphia the registry was final and
                        conclusive. If a man's name was not on the list of registered voters, he
                        could not vote at all. Thus having the power to register fast when it suited
                        them, and slowly when it suited them, and to strike off any names they saw
                        fit to strike off, and to prevent any one voting whose name was not on the
                        list, the Radical Alderman so managed the whole business as to insure a
                        Radical majority in the City.</p>
                    <p>And after the election, the returns in several divisions were withheld until
                        such time as they could ascertain how much of a majority was needed in the
                        city to overbalance the majority for Packer in the rural districts. The
                        basest frauds were perpetrated. Returns were altered so as to give larger
                        Radical majorities in certain divisions. The majority in the City for the
                        Radical ticket was telegraphed over the country by the Associated Press at
                        three thousand, four thousand, twelve hundred, and finally at near five
                        thousand. Why this discrepancy and long delay in ascertaining the exact
                        majority when the <sic>poles</sic> close there at six o'clock and telegraph
                        lines extend all over the City?</p>
                    <p>The majority for Geary in the City is very probably larger than his majority
                        in the State, so that if the Democracy had not been cheated so terribly by
                        this Registry law, Packer would have been inaugurated as the next Governor
                        of this Commonwealth. Geary and Williams both knew the importance to them of
                        this law and for that reason the one approved it, and the other held it to
                        be constitutional.</p>

                        Radical ticket. The chances of election seem to be all the other way.</p>
