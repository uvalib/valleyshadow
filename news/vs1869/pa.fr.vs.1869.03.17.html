<b>Give it to Him</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Disgusted that blacks in the South are being appointed to public office.
                    Editor lists some men he considers perfect for public office in Franklin county,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>General Butler on Saturday introduced to Secretary Boutwell a colored man
                        from New Orleans, named Jonbert, and recommended him for appointment as
                        assessor of internal revenue in that city. Jonbert said he did not desire
                        the office from pecuniary considerations, but merely asked it to test the
                        disposition of the party in power as to the rights of his race.</p>
                    <p>The negro is like the daughter of the horse leech which cries, give, give. He
                        is not satisfied with emancipation. He is not satisfied with the right to
                        vote. He is not satisfied with sitting in the jury box. He now insists upon
                        the right to hold office. He does'nt want it "from pecuniary
                        considerations." He does'nt need money. He simply desires to know whether or
                        not the Radical party is sincere. Let the Radicals "toe the mark" now.
                        Secretary Boutwell ought not to refuse this "man and brother" his petition.</p>
                    <p>And while Boutwell is making his colored
                        appointments, we would suggest that Chambersburg has plenty of material to
                        select from for the whole District. "Bish" Meade would make a competent
                        Assessor and George Brown an excellent Collector for the 16th District.
                        "Cal" Plowden, John Diggs, "Ned" Thompson, "Brant" Williams, "Jim" Wilson,
                        or a dozen more that we might name, would make trustworthy and able
                        Assistant Assessors and Collectors. If Boutwell insists on having his
                        appointees belong to the Whisky ring, we can assure him in advance that they
                        are all sound on the question. They would'nt suit Cessna with his temperance
                        proclivities, but appointments are not expected to please everybody, as
                        Cessna will no doubt discover in relation to his own appointments very
                    soon.</p>

<b>Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Launches another attack on the proposed 15th amendment. Argues against it
                    on the grounds of states rights and the notion that blacks are not worthy of the
                    franchise. Can't understand why people don't rise up and stop their congressmen
                    and legislatures from approving the amendment.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania Senate has ratified the article proposed as the fifteenth
                        amendment to the Constitution of the United States.--We regard it as a fixed
                        fact that the House of Representatives will follow suit. The Radical
                        representatives and Senators have determined to force negro suffrage upon
                        the people of this Commonwealth as far as their action can assist in doing
                        it. There is not one of them, we venture the assertion, who doubts for a
                        moment, that if the naked issue were presented to the people, this measure
                        would be defeated by a majority of one hundred thousand. And yet, they,
                        deliberately, assume to speak for the people in opposition to their known
                        wishes, on a matter of such vital importance as this. The people, too, seem
                        to have dropped into a state of lethargy and heavy stupor from which it
                        seems impossible to arouse them. They are not in favor of negro suffrage.
                        They are as earnestly and bitterly opposed to it at heart as ever. Their
                        feelings would naturally prompt them to hold indignation meetings and speak
                        in sternest tones of rebuke to the men who dare to thus misrepresent them.
                        But they are held by the trammels of their party. They entertain a sort of
                        blind idolatry for General Grant and they are afraid to utter anything in
                        opposition to his will. He has said that to give the negro the right to vote
                        will settle this vexed question. Certainly it will. There is no profundity
                        of thought in this. The yielding up of any issue will settle it. But brave
                        men do not settle issues in that way. A surrender of vital principles,
                        merely to please one man, as erring, and as liable to err, as the rest of
                        mankind, is base and cowardly. It is a surrender of manhood and honor.</p>
                    <p>If the people had a proper appreciation of the evil results that must
                        necessarily flow from the adoption of this amendment, they would utter their
                        earnest protest against it without delay. Their representatives have assumed
                        to themselves power which the people have not authorized, and would not
                        authorize them to exercise. Nay, more. They have absolutely refused to allow
                        this question to be submitted to the people. In Congress as we have shown in
                        a former article a proposition to this effect was voted down.</p>
                    <p>Our State Senate was the theatre of a similar outrage upon the rights of the
                        people. When this amendment was under consideration, Senator Wallace offered
                        an amendment to submit the whole matter to the people, but it met with no
                        encouragement from the Radicals and was voted down. The ratification was
                        pressed so hastily that the Democratic Senators had no opportunity to speak
                        at length on the question. The gag was put on, and this amendment, degrading
                        the elective franchise and the white people of this commonwealth, was
                        ratified by the Senate in the most indecent haste.--All that the Democratic
                        Senators could do was to record their votes against this infatuous
                        proposition and this they did in solid phalanx.</p>
                    <p>The objection to this amendment is not simply that it is an extension of the
                        right of suffrage to people who are unworthy and unfit to exercise it. This,
                        of itself, ought to be enough to defeat it. But there is another more
                            erious objection. It is an interference with, and violation
                        of the fundamental right of every State to regulate the suffrage within its
                        own limits. This right our forefathers refused to grant to the general
                        government. They dreaded a strong despotic central government. They were
                        jealous of the rights of the States. They guarded these rights with
                        scrupulous care, and among the rights which they reserved to the States was
                        the right of suffrage.--And, ever since the foundation of the government,
                        the States have had the control of the voting privilege.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, it is proposed to take from the States this right and give it
                        to the general government--to take it from them by three-fourths of the
                        Legislatures of the States not elected with reference to this issue at all.
                        Did the framers of the constitution ever dream that such a fundamental
                        change as this could be effected, sweeping away the rights of all the
                        States, one fourth of which protest against it in the most vigorous manner?
                        Never.</p>
                    <p>But see how this proposed amendment conflicts with the constitution of the
                        State of Pennsylvania. We do not doubt that there is a similar conflict in
                        other States. Our State constitution provides that, "In elections by the
                        citizens, every white freeman of the age of
                        twenty-one years, having resided &amp;c. &amp;c., shall enjoy the
                        rights of an elector." Now, the object of the proposed amendment to the
                        constitution of the United States is to make the word white in our State constitution of no effect. It will be
                        asserted that if this amendment is ratified by the Legislatures of
                        three-fourths of the States it will have the same effect in Pennsylvania as
                        if the word white were stricken from our
                        Constitution.</p>
                    <p>But our State Constitution provides the manner of its
                            amendment. Article 10 reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in the
                        Senate or House of Representatives, and if the same shall be agreed to by a
                        majority of the members elected to each House, such proposed amendment or
                        amendments shall be entertained on their journals, with the yeas and nays
                        taken thereon, and the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall cause the same to
                        be published three months before the next election, in at least one
                        newspaper in every county, in which a newspaper shall be published; and if in the Legislature next afterward chosen,
                        such proposed amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by a majority of
                        the members elected to each House, the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall
                        cause the same again to be published in the manner aforesaid, and such
                        proposed amendment or amendments shall be submitted to the people in such a
                        manner, and at such time, at least three months after being so agreed to by
                        the two Houses, as the Legislature shall prescribe, and if the people shall
                        approve and ratify such amendment or amendments, by a majority of the
                        qualified voters of the State voting thereon, such amendment or amendments
                        shall become a part of the Constitution; but no amendment or amendments
                        shall be submitted to the people oftener than once in five years: Provided, That if more than one amendment be
                        submitted, they shall be submitted in such manner and form that the people
                        may vote for or against each amendment separately and distinctly.</p>
                    <p>It will thus be seen that it requires the action of two Legislatures of our State to make an amendment to our
                        constitution valid. And we submit, that the members of our State
                        Legislature, in voting to ratify this amendment to the National constitution
                        in such a manner as to override the Constitution of the State of
                        Pennsylvania in this way? Are the rights of a sovereign State to be held of
                        such small account? Have Pennsylvanians, as
                            Pennsylvanians, no rights which the other States and her own
                        Legislature are bound to respect? Let our people wake up and look this
                        matter in the face. Whilst they are sleeping, some of their dearest and most
                        sacredly guaranteed rights are being taken away.</p>
