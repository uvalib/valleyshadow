                    <p>The Republican party might have made itself strong in the Southern States if
                        it had restored them to their place in the Union at the close of the war. If
                        the Southern people are warm-headed, they are also warm-hearted, and the
                        magnanimity shown them by their immediate and full restoration to all the
                        rights and privileges they enjoyed before the war, would have stirred up a
                        responsive thrill in their breasts. They would have seen and admitted that
                        the war was waged for the purpose announced at its commencement, and not
                        with a view to the destruction of their rights, nor with any intention to
                        degrade or oppress them. Finding that their fears had outrun the reality of
                        their danger, a reaction in their feelings would have taken place and they
                        would very readily have formed an alliance with the party in control of the
                        General Government.</p>
                    <p>But the leaders of the Republican party had not the sagacity to foresee their
                        own real interests. Blinded by passion and thirsting for revenge, the sole
                        thought that occupied their mind was the punishment of the fallen foe. The
                        punishment they prescribed for him was the most galling that ingenious
                        malignity could devise. It was to strip him of his political privileges and
                        confer them upon his late servant. This could not fail to make every
                        respectable Southern white man the enemy of the Republican party. But it did
                        more. A good feeling always existed between the slaves and their masters,
                        and the better portion of the freedmen continued to entertain an
                        affectionate regard for their old masters, and refused to join the
                        carpet-baggers in hunting them down. Hence the defeat of the latter in
                        Virginia and Tennessee, to be followed by their defeat in due season
                        throughout the South. Thus the Republican party has not only failed to
                        secure white support at the South, but has even lost the support of the
                        better portion of the negroes. Born a sectional party, it will die a
                        sectional party, and the signs of the times indicate that the day of its
                        dissolution is near at hand. Now is the time for all who do not wish to sink
                        with the worm-eaten hulk to betake themselves to the life-boat of
                    Democracy.</p>

                <summary>Claims Republicans missed a golden opportunity in not granting the South
                    full restoration and thus securing the white Southern vote. Now they lost not
                    only the whites but also a lot of black voters too. Predicts swift defeat and
                    dissolution of the Republican party in the future.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Before the Radical party came into power, honesty was the rule and dishonesty
                        the exception in the administration of public affairs. If a public officer
                        abused his trust, he was expelled from office and pursued with the rigors of
                        the law he had violated. But abuse of trust incurs no such penalties now.
                        There is scarcely a Bureau in any of the Departments of the General
                        Government that is not tainted with corruption. We are not compelled to rely
                        on Democratic testimony to sustain this charge. One after another, all of
                        the Departments and Bureaus have been admitted to be reeking with corruption
                        by the political friends of those who are charged with their administration.
                        The latest admission of this kind that has come to our notice, is the
                        following from the Washington correspondence of the Philadelphia <emph
                            rend="italic">Morning Post</emph> of the 11th inst:</p>
                    <p>Considerable surprise has been created here on finding that money paid for
                        the past five years to Indian tribes, under treaty stipulations, has been
                        paid in greenbacks, whereas these treaties specify coin as the money in
                        which the allowances shall be paid. It is charged that the Indian Department
                        has from time to time drawn the gold from the treasury, but has always made
                        the disbursements in paper money without allowing for the percentage. Who
                        pocketed the difference is now the inquiry.</p>
                    <p>The "tenure-of-office act" was passed to prevent President Johnson from
                        removing these Radical thieves. Many members of Congress voted for that act
                        merely from partisan considerations, but there were others whose motives
                        were still worse. It would astonish the country and excite the indignation
                        of thousands of honest members of the Radical party, could they but know how
                        many members of the Senate and House have shared the plunder gathered up by
                        dishonest Bureau and Department officials. This corruption has run to a
                        frightful extent--to such an extent that the leading Radical journals have
                        been compelled to take notice of it, reluctant as they may be to expose the
                        misdeeds of their own political friends. Is it not time for a change?</p>

                    <p>Now is the proper time, says the <emph rend="italic">Doyles-town
                        Democrat</emph>, for men who are interested in the welfare and success of
                        the Democratic party to begin work. Our State has been so long subject to
                        Radical domination, that it will require a vigorous effort on our part to
                        overcome the force of the tide. There is always a vast floating vote which
                        is cast upon the popular side for that party which it is supposed will be
                        successful. Men like to think that they have contributed to the success of a
                        candidate, or a party, and naturally too, for success is always more
                        pleasant than defeat. In Pennsylvania there are a great many men who are
                        utterly tired and sick of the Radical programme; men who are sharp sighted
                        enough to see that the party in power is corrupt and wicked, while it is
                        also weak and imbecile; and men honest enough to turn from a rotten party to
                        one which will keep its promise and stand by its principles. Such men as
                        these want only the encouraging, kindly words of advice and counsel to bring
                        them into the Democratic ranks. Then, too, there are thousands of weak
                        Democrats, men whose principles are sound, but who lack the energy or the
                        courage to maintain them either at the ballot box or in discussion. Such men
                        need to be looked after and kept entirely within the ranks. In short, there
                        are many classes of men who will vote the Democratic ticket in October next,
                        if they are properly influenced and encouraged, but not otherwise. Now, how
                        may we obtain these votes? Generally speaking, it is a fact that public
                        political meetings are humbugs. Fuss and feathers, bands and orators,
                        persuade no one; they are necessary, perhaps, to keep up the enthusiasm of
                        the people, but it is well known by all who have ever investigated the
                        matter, that they make no votes. Now, votes are just what we need. Of what
                        value to us is the enthusiasm and devotedness of the people, if,
                        nevertheless, we are beaten? The main matter is to elect our candidates, and
                        this can be done in but one way, vis: by the personal efforts of the
                        Democrats of Pennsylvania. Explain the principles of the party to your
                        vacillating neighbor; tell him who are our candidates; what is their record,
                        personal and political; contrast the strength of mind shown by Packer, with
                        the weakness manifested by Geary; tell of Pershing's proud record, as almost
                        the only member of a corrupt Legislature, who was perfectly pure, a man
                        honest and honorable above reproach. Bring all these facts before the
                        people, fully and fairly, and by this time next year we shall be living
                        under a Democratic Legislature, which will not employ quite so many "pasters
                        and folders" as the last one saw proper to do. Try it; do not wait for
                        political meetings.</p>

                        parties were indicted for attempting to extort money from Mr. John Huber by
                        threats of public exposure of falsely alleged improprieties on his part.
                        Verdict guilty. Branton Williams and Elizabeth Williams were each sentenced
                        to two years, and James Hunter and Andrew Meads, each to one year's
                        imprisonment in Eastern Penitentiary. Diggs was sent to the County jail for
                        six months.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. George Needy and Joseph Hade. Charge of burning a store room or
                        warehouse. Verdict Not Guilty.</p>

                        Elias Zearfoss out of a young bay horse valued at $150 by trading him a
                        glandered horse. Verdict guilty. Motion for a new trial.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs Frederick Smith. Larceny of a table cover worth $1.50. Defendant
                        pleaded guilty. Sentenced to pay costs and 30 days in county jail.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Jacob Spital. Charge of Adultery with Mary Ann Derringer. Isaac
                        Derringer, Prosecutor. Verdict Not Guilty but Def't. to pay costs.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs Frank Jones. Assault on James Wilson, Prosecutor. Def't. pleaded
                            <sic>guily</sic>. Sentenced to 20 days in county jail and to pay costs.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs Same. Larceny of a Bridle, Overcoat and Vest, property of Adam B.
                        Wingert. Def't. pleaded guilty. Sentenced to one year in Eastern
                        Penitentiary to be computed from the expiration of the fore-going sentence.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. John R. Turner, charge of altering a patent right deed. John
                        Russell, Prosecutor. Verdict Guilty. Motion for a new trial filed and time
                        for hearing fixed at October Sessions. Deft. gives security in $2000 for his
                        appearance at that time.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Barnet Long. Seduction and Fornication and Bastardy. Verdict guilty.
                        Owing to the extreme youth of Deft., he being but 17 years of age, the Court
                        imposed a fine of $10 and $20 as lying in expenses and costs of suit. The
                        Prosecutrix was but 15 years of age.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. William Hafer, Frederick Mish and Benj. S. Reisher, Supervisors of
                        Hamilton township. These defendants were indicted for refusing and
                        neglecting to build a bridge across the head race at Brough's Mill on the
                        line of a public road ordered to be opened by the Court of Quarter Sessions.
                        The point in controversy was whether the county or the township is bound to
                        build this bridge. The trial took place on Saturday afternoon, and, owing to
                        the fact that the time was too short for thorough argument, the Court took
                        down the facts, and directed a verdict of guilty, with the intention of
                        disposing of the question involved on a motion of a new trial. The Court was
                        in session until 6 1/2 o'clock on Saturday evening, and then adjourned to 9
                        1/2 o'clock on Monday morning.</p>
