<b>The Income Tax</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Protests against a suggestion to renew the income tax. Calls it
                    unconstitutional and oppressive against certain sectors of the economy,
                    especially salaried professionals like clerks.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is well known that this unjust and inequitable tax, under existing laws,
                        can not be imposed after next year. The President, however, has taken
                        occasion to recommend a renewal of the law for three years, suggesting that
                        the amount be reduced to three per centum. This tax ought to be abolished.
                        The law ought to expire by its own limitation.</p>
                    <p>The Income Tax was one of the alleged necessities of the War. Money was
                        needed in large quantities, and whilst men clearly saw the inequality which
                        the law worked, out of the fulness of their patriotism, they paid
                        whatever was assessed without a murmur. But now that the exigencies of those
                        times have passed away and a renewal of the tax, is recommended, the
                        liveliest discussion is being elicited as to its operation, and a vast
                        majority of the people may clearly be said to be hostile to its continuance.</p>
                    <p>The Income Tax is unconstitutional. The Constitution of the United States
                        provides, that "no capitation, or other direct
                        tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken." This
                        tax is not laid upon property and fixed according to representation.</p>
                    <p>Again, out of the tremendous population in the United States, but 240,000
                        persons pay this income tax. And who are they? They are the men who can
                        least afford to pay it. They are not the men who own a large quantity of
                        real estate. They are not the men who have thousands and hundreds of
                        thousands of dollars invested in Government bonds. This is not a tax on
                        property. The men who pay the most of it are the clerks who draw a salary
                        above one thousand dollars, professional men who have an income over one
                        thousand dollars, and all who are in possession of salaried offices.</p>
                    <p>The farmer eats his eggs, chickens, vegetables, pork, beef, mutton, butter,
                        and drinks his milk and cream, and in making up his income, he is not
                        charged with the value of these articles. But the clerk who receives a
                        salary of fifteen hundred dollars, or the poor person who ekes out a
                        miserable existence on twelve hundred a year and boards all the itinerant
                        preachers who come along, is forced to buy all these articles at high prices
                        and gets no credit for them when he comes to make out his income return.
                        Surely there is no justice or equity in this.</p>
                    <p>Let this law which thus bears with crushing force upon the few, be wiped out
                        of existence forever. Let us have no such glaring, oppressive inequality as
                        this, in a land which boasts that it has made all men equal before the
                    law.</p>

<b>Grant Restless in Bonds</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper denounces the hypocrisy of President Grant who now advocates
                    repeal of the Tenure of Office Act after supporting the removal of Andrew
                    Johnson for its violation.<br>

<b>Tinkering</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Comments on a bill proposed in Congress to prevent any State from
                    withdrawing consent to the 15th amendment once a legislature has ratified it.
                    Says this represents tyranny and usurpation, since the Supreme Court should
                    decide on that issue. Asks the people if they will tolerate such tyranny from
                    one branch of the Federal Government.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As was anticipated, the Radicals in Congress are already engaged in an
                        attempt to patch up their blundering reconstruction policy. Three fourths of
                        the States have not yet ratified the proposed fifteenth amendment. Several
                        of the State Legislatures threaten to withdraw the ratification of this
                        amendment by former Legislatures. They claim the right to do this at any
                        time before the necessary number is procured. This is a question on which
                        people differ, and on which strong arguments have been advanced on both
                        sides. It is a question that ought to be decided by the highest judicial
                        tribunal in the land. But the Radicals are not willing to wait for such a
                        decision. Senator Williams, of Oregon, has made haste to introduce a bill
                        which declares that when a State has once given its assent to a
                        constitutional amendment, that assent is conclusive and all subsequent
                        action of the State as to that amendment is void.</p>
                    <p>Thus Congress is asked, and will doubtless attempt, to settle this disputed
                        point. How can Congress undertake to settle the constitutional authority of
                        the States? Whence does it get this power? Who made it the judge? Surely
                        this is an attempted infringement of the rights of a coordinate branch of
                        this Federal Government that ought to receive the condemnation of every
                        citizen who has any regard for the constitution of the United States, and
                        who desires the rights of the respective departments of the Government, as
                        well as the rights of the States, to be preserved. Or shall the Legislative
                        Department be allowed to exercise the rights which belong to the Executive
                        and Judicial Departments?</p>
