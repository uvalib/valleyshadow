                        ought to be thoroughly cleaned out. The ground is strewn with the dead
                        leaves of last year. Let them be gathered up and burned, or hauled away. Let

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The case of the Commonwealth vs. Samuel Seylar about which the jury had not
                        agreed when we went to trial last week resulted in a verdict of not guilty.</p>
                    <p>The case of the Commonwealth vs. Dr. James W. Robinson, tried for the same
                        offence, was concluded on Thursday morning, the jury finding a verdict of
                        guilty on the second count of the indictment which charged the larceny of
                        Michael Fallon's goods. On Friday morning the Court sentenced Dr. Robinson
                        to three years imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>Josephine Franklin, a colored girl, convicted, during the first week of
                        Court, for stealing some six dollars worth of money, was sentenced to one
                        year's imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>Cambridge Norris, the negro fiend who ravished three white girls about a
                        month ago, was tried on Thursday forenoon on three indictments--two charging
                        him with rape and the other with Assault and Battery with intent to ravish.
                        These cases were all tried before the same jury. The evidence disclosed the
                        same facts that were given in this paper at the time these outrages took
                        place. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty on each indictment whereupon
                        the Court sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment on each of the
                        indictments for rape, and to five years imprisonment on the indictment for
                        Assault and Battery with intent to ravish, making thirty five years in the
                        aggregate in the Eastern Penitentiary.</p>
                    <p>The Court room was crowded during the trial, our citizens manifesting the
                        utmost interest in the proceedings, but no efforts to mete out summary
                        punishment were made as was anticipated by some. The law was left to take
                        its course and universal satisfaction now prevails.</p>
                    <p>The case of the Commonwealth vs. Wm. Gilbert, Wm. Means, James Gilbert and
                        Isaac Burns for Riot and Assault and Battery, and the case of the
                        Commonwealth vs. Hezekiah Hillon for Assault and Battery were in the nature
                        of cross-actions. They grew out of difficulties between the parties at
                        Reuben Bomberger's sale in Southampton township.</p>
                    <p>In the first case the jury rendered a verdict of guilty as to all but Wm.
                        Means, and the Court sentenced each of the three defendants to pay a fine of
                        ten dollars and the costs.</p>
                    <p>In the case against Hezekiah Hillon, the verdict was not guilty but Defendant
                        to pay one-half of the costs and Prosecutor, Wm. Gilbert, the other half.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the Commonwealth vs. Hezekiah Hillon for Surety of the Peace
                        wherein Wm. Means was Prosecutor, the Court sentenced Defendant to pay the
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>The case of the Commonwealth vs. Nelson Stewart, Surety of the Peace on oath
                        of Charles Diggs, resulted in a sentence of Defendant to pay costs.</p>
                    <p>Branton Williams, Henry Gray and James Polk Wilson were indicted for Riot and
                        Assault and Battery over in "Wolffstown." The Grand jury ignored the bill as
                        to Wilson and found a true bill against the other two for Assault and
                        Battery on a man named Wm. Lee, in the house of Elias Butler, the
                        Prosecutor.</p>
                    <p>The verdict was guilty and the Court sentenced Williams to pay costs and to
                        imprisonment in county jail for 30 days and Gray simply to pay costs.</p>
                    <p>Commonwealth vs. Stumbaugh, Harmon and Harmon resulted in a verdict of not
                        guilty but Defendants to pay the costs.</p>
                    <p>A considerable number of cases were settled. In others the bills were
                        ignored. A large number of cases were continued to the August Sessions.</p>
                    <p>Not a civil cause was tried, the entire time of the Court having been taken
                        up with the trial of criminal cases.</p>

<b>Report of the Grand Jury</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Grand Jury made the following report: To the
                            Honorable the Judges of the Court of the Quarter Sessions of Franklin
                            county:</p>
                    <p>We, the undersigned, Grand Jurors in attendance at the April Term, A. D.
                        1869, of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Franklin county, respectfully beg
                        leave to report:</p>
                    <p>That in the performance of our duties we visited the Public Buildings and
                        inquired into their condition. Their general condition is good, but in our
                        opinion some few repairs and improvements ought to be made.</p>
                    <p>In the County Prison there are several sunken hearths that ought to be
                        repaired without further delay. In consequence of the flow of water through
                        these sunken hearths in scrubbing, the plaster of the ceilings below them
                        has fallen off and the laths have been injured. There is danger that the
                        injury will be extended to the joists, and that thus serious damage may be
                        done to the Building.</p>
                    <p>We observed a fissure of considerable extent in the wall that encloses the
                        Prison Yard. This fissure, whilst it does not appear to threaten an early
                        destruction of the wall, might facilitate the escape of a prisoner.</p>
                    <p>We are of opinion that a closet or small room for the storage of bedding when
                        not in use should be constructed in the Prison. There is ample space
                        unoccupied at the end of one of the corridors on the second story for such a
                        closet, and it could be made there at very small expense.</p>
                    <p>We found the Poor House Buildings generally to need painting, and the large
                        Stone House to need a new roof. We were informed, however, that in
                        accordance with the recommendation of the Grand Jury at the last January
                        Term, a contract has recently been entered into for painting and roofing the
                        Stone House.</p>
                    <p>The Physician's office in the Poor House is very poorly furnished. It is
                        without stove, chair, stool or bench, and is not supplied with suitable
                        bottles and jars for keeping and preserving the drugs required for the
                        institution.</p>
                    <p>Interiorly the Buildings are so neat and clean as they can be kept, and the
                        paupers appear to be properly cared for. The surrounding grounds are in good
                        order. We discovered nothing likely to exercise an unfavorable influence on
                        the health of the inmates of the institution, unless miasma should arise
                        from the meadow west of the buildings, which is overflowed to the extent of
                        several acres. The obstructions to the free passage of the water of the
                        spring should be removed and the overflowed land reclaimed.</p>
                    <p>The County Farm is quite large, containing, as the new Steward informed us,
                        two hundred and thirty acres. A very considerable portion of the land is
                        rough and not in a high state of cultivation. In the time at our disposal it
                        was not possible for us to make such investigation as would enable us to say
                        whether this farm does or does not yield a fair return to the county. This
                        could only be determined by ascertaining the value of products of the farm
                        for a series of years and comparing this with the expenses properly
                        chargeable against the farm, including interest on the value of the land and
                        stock.</p>
                    <p>From such information as we have obtained, it has appeared to us that it
                        might be well for those who have special charge of the business affairs of
                        the county to inquire whether the county's interests would not be promoted
                        by the sale of a part of the land now connected with the Poor House. The
                        objections which apply to large farms in general are believed by many
                        intelligent citizens of the county to apply with peculiar force to large
                        farms connected with institutions of this kind.</p>
                    <p>We repeat the recommendation of a former Grand Jury in favor of the
                        construction of a Cistern at the Court House.</p>
