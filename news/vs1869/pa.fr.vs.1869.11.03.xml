                <summary>The paper argues that Republicans are attacking alleged Democratic
                    mismanagement of the Poor House out of frustration at not being in a position to
                    draw plunder and patronage from it. The editors present figures showing that
                    Republican attempts at Poor House management ended in financial disaster.</summary>

                    amount that will be required to construct the road. The Company will supply the

                    <p>In addition to the criminal cases reported last week, the following cases
                        were tried:</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. David Shatzer. Horse stealing. In the month of August, a mare was
                        stolen from Mr. Abraham Sollenberger in Guilford township. On the day
                        following, the mare was sold to Jno. A. Houston, of Antrim township, and
                        Henry Beard from near Leitersburg, Md. Mr. Beard was present at the trial
                        and identified Shatzer as the man who had sold the mare. Other witnesses
                        were examined who testified to having seen him with the mare on the day she
                        was sold. Shatzer had worked for Mr. Sollenberger and was shown to be well
                        acquainted with the premises and the horses. Verdict, Guilty. Sentenced to
                        three years imprisonment in Eastern Penitentiary.--Stenger for Com.' Sharpe
                        and Brewer for Deft.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Joseph Brown. Horse stealing. On the night of the 31st of August
                        last, a dark bay horse was stolen from the stable of Mr. Jacob Flack who
                        lives on the farm of Mr. Jacob Stouffer in Hamilton township. The horse was
                        the property of Mr. Stouffer. On the 8th of September, the defendant was
                        arrested in this Borough charged with stealing the horse. He gave
                        information to Mr. Flack as to where he had disposed of the horse and on the
                        13th of September, Mr. Flack got the animal from Mr. Thos. N. Heskitt, at
                        Sandy Hook, Md. It seems that Brown had worked for Mr. Flack and knew the
                        horses well and also the arrangement of the stables. Immediately on taking
                        him, he started for Virginia and on the 2nd of September, traded him at
                        Stevenson's Depot, five miles from Winchester, Va., to an Irishman named
                        Edward Grant, for an old sorrel horse not worth more than $25. Mr. O.O.
                        Baker, Ticket and Express Agent at Stevenson's Depot, was upon the witness
                        stand and identified Brown as the man who sold the horse to Grant.--Grant
                        sold the horse in Winchester at public auction where he was bought by Mr
                        Jeskett. Verdict, Guilty. Sentenced to three years imprisonment in the
                        Eastern Penitentiary. Stenger for Com.; Stewart for Defendant.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Solomon Piper and Peter Piper. Charge of obtaining $110 from Gideon
                        Varner by false pretences. The Defendants sold a horse to Varner for $110
                        and, according to Varner's statement, represented him as sound. The horse
                        turned out to be weak in the back and was in the habit of falling down. He
                        fell down one day and died.--Varner prosecuted the Pipers for getting his
                        money, as he alleged, by false representations. Verdict, Not Guilty, but
                        Defendants to pay the costs. Stenger, Kimmell and Brewer for Com.; Sharpe
                        for Defts.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Harry Weaver. False Pretences. In June, 1868, a package containing
                        $48.75 was sent by Mr. John Wilson from Hagerstown, Md., to this Borough by
                        Adams' Express Company, directed to Mrs. Wm. Reary. Mrs. Reary was living
                        near Bendersville in Adams county. The Defendant went to the Express Office
                        in this Borough and presented to Mr. Wm. G. Reed, then the Express Agent
                        here, a letter from Mr. Wilson to Mrs. Reary, informing her that this money
                        had been sent, and on the back of this letter, was written an order,
                        directing the Agent to deliver this package and spent the money. The order
                        was forged, Mrs. Reary never having given Weaver any authority to lift the
                        package. The Express Company made Mr. Reed pay the money to Mrs. Reary out
                        of his own pocket, but upon an investigation of the facts, refunded it to
                        him. Weaver had been lately confined in the Hagerstown jail charged with
                        complicity in the murder of Andrew Rowland, but there not being sufficient
                        evidence to convict, the State Attorney entered a <emph rend="italic">nolle
                            prosequi</emph>. Verdict, Guilty. Sentenced to one year's imprisonment
                        in the Eastern Penitentiary. Weaver comes from the neighborhood of Cashtown,
                        in Adams county. Brewer and Stenger for Com.; Duncan &amp; McGowan for
                        Defendant.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Daniel Baker, Receiving stolen horse. On the night of the 16th of
                        April, a black mare was stolen near Strasburg, in Shenandoah county,
                        Virginia. She was the property of Mr. Samuel Stephenson. This mare was found
                        on the 26th of the same month in the stable of Deft., in Antrim township,
                        this county. Mr. Stephenson was not present to prove the ownership of the
                        mare and the fact that she had been stolen, and the case of the Commonwealth
                        therefore broke down. Verdict, Not Guilty. Stenger for Com.; Sharpe and
                        Brewer for Deft.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Daniel Baker. Receiving a stolen horse. A brown horse was stolen
                        also on the night of the 16th of April from the stable of Mr. Lawrence
                        Hamman, near Strasburg, Shenandoah Co., Va. Mr. John Hamman, a son of the
                        owner, came to Pennsylvania and on the 26th of the same month, got the horse
                        from a Mr. Kauffman in Lancaster City. The evidence disclosed the facts that
                        this horse, together with the black mare of Mr. Stevenson, were brought to
                        the stable of Deft. on the night of the 17th of April; that Deft. on the
                        19th brought the brown horse to this Borough and sold him at the National
                        hotel to Mr. Jessie Mecumseh. Mr. Mechumsey took him to Lancaster and sold
                        him to Mr. Kauffman. This horse and mare, it seems, were stolen by Andrew J.
                        Baker, brother of Deft. (who, it will be remembered, escaped from officer
                        Houser and Mr. Kendall near Glen Rock, Md., by jumping from the train of
                        cars when in rapid motion, while being brought from Washington, D.C., to
                        Fulton county, to be tried for stealing the horses of Judge Dickson and Mr.
                        Kendall.) The Deft. alleged that he was to receive $10 per head for selling
                        the horses and that he was in perfect ignorance as to the manner in which
                        his brother had procured the horses. Verdict, Guilty. A motion for a new
                        trial was filed on Saturday and argued on Monday. The Court dismissed the
                        motion and deferred the sentence until Tuesday morning. Stenger for Com.;

                    <p>Com. vs. Isaac Rollins. False Pretence. The Defendant in June, July and
                        August bought groceries from Mr. Alex <unclear>Fahnestock</unclear> in this
                        Borough. On the 17th of August he represented to Mr. F. that he was still in
                        the employment of Messrs. Eyster &amp; Heyser at their paper mill; that
                        he should have been paid at the beginning of the month but that Messrs.
                        Eyster &amp; Heyser were a little "short" and had failed to come to
                        time, but that he would get the money and would then pay his bill. On the
                        strength of this representation he obtained further credit. The truth was
                        that he had been paid at the beginning of the month, and also on the 14th of
                        August when he was discharged. Verdict, Not Guilty, but Deft. to pay the
                        costs. Stenger for Com.; Duncan &amp; McGowan for Deft.</p>

                        Smith was clerking for Elias Butler in a small grocery in Wolffstown. Deft.
                        came in drunk and became very disorderly and indulged in strong "cuss
                        words." Smith tried to eject him from the room and Deft. broke a club over
                        Smith's skull. Verdict Guilty. Sentenced to ten days imprisonment in County
                        jail. Stenger for Com.; DeGolly for Deft.</p>
                    <p>The civil causes tried last week were as follows: Gilds &amp; Startzman
                        vs. George Brewer. This was an action of deceit. The plaintiffs purchased
                        two steers from Deft. in November, 1867, the meat of one of which, when
                        killed, turned out to be diseased and had to be thrown away. The price paid
                        by plaintiffs was $40. They alleged that Deft. had said the steers were "all
                        right." It was shown that the cattle looked thrifty and healthy, and there
                        was no evidence that Deft. knew that either was diseased. The Plffs.
                        suffered a nonsuit.</p>

                    <p>Commonwealth <emph rend="italic">ex-relatione</emph> Charles Gelwicks vs.
                        Alexander Martin. This was an action to decide who is entitled to act as
                        Treasurer of the Poor House. The Board of Directors of the Poor after the
                        election in 1868, re-elected the persons who were then in office to serve
                        another year. When the new Board was organized about the 1st of February
                        1869, it elected other officers, among them Alexander Martin instead of
                        Chas. Gelwicks as Treasurer. Mr. Martin was recognized as the Treasurer by
                        the Board and transacted the business. Mr. Gelwicks claimed to be the
                        Treasurer still, retained the money in his hands that he had at the time of
                        the last election of officers, and commenced this action to assert his right
                        as Treasurer. The case came up on Monday. The Court rendered a verdict in
                        favor of the Defendant, Mr. Martin, reserving his opinion on the point of
                        law which will be announced hereafter.</p>
