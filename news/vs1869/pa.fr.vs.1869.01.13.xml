                <origin/>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We notice that in several counties of the State, Conventions and meetings of
                        the County Committees are being called and held for the purpose of electing
                        delegates to the Democratic State Convention. This early action is because
                        of the supineness or indifference of the State Central Committee in relation
                        to the postponement of the State Convention. We called attention to this
                        matter a few weeks ago, and our article met with the approval of a large
                        portion of the press of the State, and yet the Central Committee has done
                        nothing. Why should a meeting of that Committee not be held for the purpose
                        of considering the question of postponement? We trust that the Chairman will
                        give this matter his early and earnest attention.</p>
                    <p>We are animated by no selfish purpose. We have no axe to grind. We are simply
                        anxious for the success of the Democratic party. We desire to win at the
                        next election. We have no candidate of our own and do not advocate a
                        postponement of the Convention to subserve the interests of any individual.
                        The distinguished gentleman named for the position from the Western part of
                        the State seems thus far to be without a competitor, and we do not regret
                        it. But starting into the canvass, even with his name and influence, at such
                        an early date as the fourth of March, would, in our opinion, be throwing
                        away great advantages which might be gained by delay. In our judgment it
                        would be impolitic to announce a platform in the Spring for a campaign in
                        the Fall. We hope that those of our Democratic friends who think with us on
                        this matter will keep agitating the subject until the object sought for is
                        attained.</p>

                    <p>Governor Geary sent his annual message to the Legislature on Wednesday last.
                        We would publish it if it were worth just half the space it would occupy.
                        But it is really worth nothing at all. The Governor sets out by
                            <unclear>blarneying</unclear> the members of the Legislature. He says:</p>
                    <p>I participate with your constituents in the confidence manifested by them in
                        selecting you to represent their individual interests as well as those of
                        the Commonwealth. On your wisdom, integrity, judgment and discretion, all
                        will undoubtedly rely for the correct determination of every question
                        affecting the largest interests and gravest responsibilities, and for a
                        continuance, and even an increase, of that prosperity which has hitherto
                        been so signally enjoyed.</p>
                    <p>Such stuff as this must be offensive to the few men of wisdom and integrity
                        who hold seats in the Legislature, whilst the "pinchers" and "squeezers"
                        (who constitute the majority) will laugh at the Governor for daubing them
                        with mortar which they have sharpness enough to know will never stick. Geary
                        is a candidate for renomination, and he is weak enough to suppose that he
                        can make friends for himself by slobbering his wishy-washy praises over the
                        members of the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>Next comes the stereotyped exposition of the financial condition of the
                        State. We see but little in this branch of the message for the people to
                        felicitate themselves upon, unless it be their wonderful capacity to bear
                        the most enormous burdens. The statement shows that the balance in the
                        Treasury on the 30th of November, 1867, was $4,661,836.46, and that the
                        amount received into the Treasury from that date till the 30th of November,
                        1868, was $5,216,049.55, making the total in the Treasury for the last
                        fiscal year $9,913,918.01--<emph rend="italic">nearly ten million
                        dollars</emph>. What has become of this vast sum of money? The Governor says
                        loans to the amount of $4,417,463.64 have been redeemed, and there is a
                        balance of $1,018,415.37 in the Treasury. He puts the public debt at
                        $37,704,409.77 on the 1st of December, 1867, but the Auditor General's
                        Report for that year puts it at $34,766,431.29--about three million dollars
                        lower. If the Auditor General's exhibit of the debt was correct, the Geary
                        administration has got rid of about seven million dollars during the last
                        fiscal year, <emph rend="italic">not</emph> including what was paid of
                        principal and interest on the State debt! This is about six million more
                        than it ought to cost to govern Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>The balance of the message is devoted to a great variety of subjects, such as
                        the "State Coat of Arms," (which our Gubernatorial antiquarian informs us he
                        has made diligent but unsuccessful search for,) the "Susquehanna Fisheries,"
                        the "Cattle Disease," &amp;c. We are surprised to find that no allusion
                        is made to the "Hog Cholera," the "Potato Rot," or the "Seventeen Year
                        Locusts," but his Excellency may repair these omissions in a special
                        message.</p>
                    <p>The Governor concludes with a demagogical appeal to the partisan malignity of
                        the baser portion of his political friends. He must be a poor apology for a
                        Pennsylvanian, who can find anything in this message to be proud of. It is
                        the production of a "small-beer politician." Well did Thaddeus Stevens
                        pronounce John W. Geary "an unhappy failure" in the Governor's Chair.</p>

                    <p>The New York Chamber of Commerce, at several meetings held lately, has been
                        discussing the question of a resumption of specie payment. Most of those who
                        have thus far taken part in the discussion have been Radicals. Their remarks
                        have not been very complimentary to their Radical brethren in Congress. Now
                        that the Presidential election is over and the leading motive for
                        concealment is no longer in operation, the Radical merchants and business
                        men of New York are free enough in confessing their want of confidence in
                        the financial schemes of their leaders in Congress.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday last, as we learn from
                        the correspondence of the Philadelphia <emph rend="italic">Ledger</emph>,
                        Mr. Low denounced the policy which locked up gold in the Federal
                        treasury.--He thought it was just as dangerous an experiment as would be the
                        expelling of all the blood from the extremities and locking it up in the
                        heart. Mr. Chittenden expressed similar views, adding that he had no
                        confidence in the present Congress. General Walbridge took exception to
                        these remarks. Mr. Chittenden explained, that the reason he had no
                        confidence in Congress was because the House, which consisted of 220
                        members, had 219 financial plans before it. Senator Morton's plan he
                        denounced as simply ridiculous. Mr. Opdyke objected to Mr. Garfield's plan,
                        because he could not see the wisdom of going over Niagara Falls when he
                        could go down an inclined plane.</p>
                    <p>Radical brethren, what do you think of these honest opinions concerning the
                        measures proposed by your wise men in Congress?</p>

                    <p>A Fight occurred recently between the white and colored soldiers at Central
                        City, New Mexico. Two white and three colored soldiers were killed, and many
                        of both were wounded.</p>
                    <p>Will our Radical friends make a note of this? Will they soberly consider
                        whether we had not better do without negro soldiers, as we did under all
                        administrations previous to that of Mr. Lincoln? A little fight like this
                        one at Central City might lead to a very great fight where there was a large
                        number of troops of both colors. Suppose such a fight to take place at a
                        time when the United States were at war with some foreign power--might not
                        the enemy gain a decisive battle or capture an important fortress while our
                        white and black troops were slaughtering one another?</p>
                    <p>It is time to put an end to this negro farce. The negro is not the white
                        man's equal, and no attempt to force him upon the white man, either at the
                        ballot box, or in the jury box, or in the halls of legislation, or in camp
                        or barracks, can ever be successful. Bad feeling and bloodshed will follow
                        all such attempts.</p>

                <summary>The paper asserts that warrants for government expenses issued by the
                    treasury department in December amounted to $17,667,000. The editors argue that
                    tax-payers pay more per month to run the government than they did per year the
                    last time a Democrat held office.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Annual meeting of the Y. M. C. A. was not held at the Rooms on Saturday
                        evening as had been expected, but will be on Friday evening of this week, at
                        6 1/2 oclock.</p>
                    <p>At this meeting the President, the Treasurer and the chairman of each of the
                        standing committees will give a written report, &amp;c. Officers for the
                        opening year will be elected. All members of the Association and all other
                        persons who feel an interest in its success are earnestly requested to be
                        present.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that much good has already been done by this organization. Its
                        prayer meetings and its reading Rooms are well sustained. Its course of
                        popular lectures offer the public, as well as young men, profitable
                        instruction and pleasant entertainment every two weeks. And in various other
                        ways it is doing a great deal for the young men of the community. It could
                        do much more, if it could gain the hearty cooperation of more of our leading
                        christian citizens. No community can afford to neglect its young men. Here
                        is an institution in profitable operation, the sole aim of which is the
                        benefit of our young men--your sons and brothers. It would seem to me that
                        the mere statement of the object, would be its most eloquent appeal. Nothing
                        will add more to its efficiency, which may be vastly increased, than the
                        election of earnest and energetic officers. Let me then appeal to every
                        member, every father of sons, every christian man to do something for an
                        association that has for its aim and object so noble, the success of which
                        would be crowned with so many blessings. Will you come to the annual
                        meeting, Friday evening, at 6 1/2 o'clock?</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that every member of the standing committees will be
                        present, and each chairman have his report.<lb/> IRVING MAGEE,
                    President.</p>
