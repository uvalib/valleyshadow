<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The circumstances attending the Washington riot will go far to impress white
                        men with a sense of the folly of those fanatics who have put the ballot into
                        the hands of the negro. It has been alleged that the riot did not differ
                        from ordinary election riots--that it was gotten up without premeditation
                        and fore-appointment--that it grew out of the excitement naturally incident
                        to the occasion. Let us see.</p>
                    <p>The Radical club of the Second Ward of Washington City, composed mostly of
                        negroes, held a meeting soon after the election, at which a white man
                        offered this resolution:</p>
                    <p>Resolved: That disgraceful scenes having occurred
                        at some of the voting precincts of this ward at the recent election, well
                        nigh resulting in a fearful and extensive riot, and endangering the life and
                        property of our citizens, the republicans of the Second ward take this early
                        occasion to express their deep regret and earnest denunciation of those
                        scenes and of the patrons who instigated and of the measures that led to
                        them; that those who forcibly resist or control the exercise of the elective
                        franchise are self-constituted despots, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>This was, in effect, a resolution of censure upon the negroes who had
                        attempted to prevent other negroes from voting the Citizens' ticket, for it
                        was universally admitted at the time that this was the cause of the riot.
                        But that body was not prepared to cast any blame upon the men who "forcibly
                        resisted and controlled the exercise of the elective franchise." They were
                        all guilty of that, and they did not feel like denouncing themselves as
                        "self-constituted despots." The introduction of the resolution led to an
                        excited discussion in which the negroes "threatened to kill those of their
                        race who voted the democratic ticket," defended the conduct of the rioters
                        and said it would be repeated under similar circumstances. The foregoing
                        resolution was then laid on the table and the following one adopted.--</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That this body laments the riotous
                        difficulties which tarnished the desired victory in the late elections, and
                        sincerely hopes that necessity will throw upon us no
                        repetition of the scenes of Monday, June 7.</p>
                    <p>What necessity? Why, simply negroes voting the Democratic
                        or Citizens' ticket. That, they are not to be allowed to do under penalty of
                        being lynched by a mob. As long as they vote with the Radicals, all right.
                        But whenever they dare to vote against them, at the bidding of Mayor Bowan
                        and Col. Forney and fellows of that ilk, those black blood-hounds are to be
                        let loose to terrify and murder. How can any citizen of Washington City feel
                        that his life is safe with the government in the hands of such demons. And
                        so it will be whenever the franchise is conferred upon the blacks. They
                        never pause to reason. They "go it blind" at the dictation of those whom
                        they choose to follow for the time. They can always be used as instruments
                        to do the dirty and villainous work of unscrupulous politicians.</p>
                    <p>Let the people wake up and save the country from the anarchy into which this
                        negromania is rapidly plunging us.</p>

<b>Negroes as Jurors</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There seems to be in affinity for the negro among the leaders of the Radical
                        party which values every opportunity to display itself. On Tuesday of last
                        week, in the Criminal Court of Washington City, there being five vacancies
                        in the Grand Jury, Judge Fisher appointed five colored
                            men to fill the vacancies. He then proceeded to congratulate the
                        country that "for the first time in the history of the District, the tawny
                        brown complexion of a race oppressed and degraded by six generations of
                        slavery, has, at length, in the seventh, made its appearance in the Grand
                        Jury box of the Capital of the nation."</p>
                    <p>He then appointed a negro to act as one of the bailiffs. Among the
                            petis jurors in attendance at the court are nine
                        negroes.</p>
                    <p>We put it to our Radical friends of the county, how would you relish the idea
                        of having your liberty, or life, or the title to your property, hang upon
                        the decision of twelve blacks summoned from the enlightened neighborhood of
                        "Wolffstown?" To this you are rapidly driving. Don't blame us for it when
                        you reach that point. We have not failed to utter the notes of warning. The
                        responsibility must rest with yourselves. Prepare for the contest, white
                        men, and resolve that your inalienable rights shall not be entrusted to the
                        keeping of ignorant blacks who are rapidly being pumped full of jealousy
                        towards the whites.</p>

<b>Negroes at Hotels and Theatres</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Remarks with contempt recent measures in Washington to forcibly desegregate
                    theaters and hotels. Claims further government interference will follow. Cites a
                    Republican newspaper from Chicago as evidence that even Republicans are against
                    the measure. Calls on conservatives everywhere to protest this action.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An ordinance has been passed in the City of Washington which annuls the
                        licenses of theatres, unless they shall seat negroes and whites without
                        distinction on account of color. To this extent has negromania carried the
                        men who make the rules and regulations for the government of the National
                        Capital. This is claimed to be in accordance with the principles of
                        equality. "All men are created free and equal" and hence managers of
                        theatres have no right to say who shall or shall not occupy their seats.
                        What irresistible logic!</p>
                    <p>An attempt is also being made to procure a city ordinance which will compel
                        hotel keepers to accommodate negroes on the same terms and at the same
                        tables as whites. This is actually a fact although people may smile at the
                        idea. The next step will be to force them to allow negroes to sleep in the
                        same beds with whites whether they are male or female. Why not? Why is the
                        latter not as justifiable as the former? If the sense of propriety of
                        Radicals revolts at this, let them tell us on what ground it is to be
                        condemned and the other encouraged.</p>
                    <p>This whole business is at total variance with our ideas of equality of right.
                        Neither theatres, nor hotels are government institutions. The former are
                        managed and the latter are kept by private citizens at their own expense.
                        The public pays no taxes to support them. They are places of amusement and
                        entertainment. If any government can interfere with them so as to control
                        their action in matters of this kind, it may proceed to legislate against
                        any particular class of merchants, tradesmen, or mechanics, whenever it
                        pleases so to do. What becomes of the equality of right of men of business
                        to manage their own private business affairs in their own way?</p>
                    <p>This matter is of less account to the proprietors of hotels than it is to the
                        public.--The guests are the persons chiefly interested. As the Chicago Tribune, a Radical paper, truly says,
                        "nineteen-twentieths of these would be white under any circumstances, and
                        the effect of such a measure is to enable one black man, or woman, to force
                        his or her company upon nineteen white men or women who do not desire it.
                        Displeasing the nineteen to please the one, in a matter of mere association
                        and taste, is not equality but the grossest inequality."</p>
                    <p>Conservative citizens of Pennsylvania, it is for you to rebuke this
                        aggressive fanaticism.</p>
