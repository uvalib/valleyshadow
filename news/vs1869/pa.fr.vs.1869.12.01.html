<b>Our Radical President</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on Grant's appointment of a black man as representative to Haiti
                    and his comments on civil rights. Shows how Grant favors black equality and
                    rights to employment everywhere. Infers that Grant will now only appoint blacks
                    as ministers while leaving whites unemployed.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>President Grant recently received from General Tate, the credentials
                        accrediting him to the American Government as the minister from
                        Hayti. Congratulating Grant upon his conduct in sending a black
                        man to his republic he said, "the exalted philanthropy and the readiness to
                        make amends to a race formerly oppressed in this country--those noble
                        principles which have led your administration, Mr. President, to select a
                        man of that race to represent the great and powerful republic of the United
                        States in the republic of Hayti, have awakened in the hearts of all
                            Haytiens, who eagerly desire the advancement and elevation of
                        their race, a just sentiment of admiration and gratitude."</p>
                    <p>Grant being thus tickled, was obliged to tickle the Haytien in
                        return, and so he proceeded to soft sawder the dusky minister in this wise:
                        "If any proof were wanting of the unfounded character of the prejudice which
                        until recently prevailed, at least in different parts of this country,
                        against the race from which you are sprung, it might be found in the high
                        tone and polished style of the remarks you just uttered.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the prejudice existing among Americans in regard to this question
                        of color, or as Mr. Sumner would have it, "caste," he remarked that, "like
                        all similar prejudices, no matter how deeply implanted, it must, sooner or
                        later, yield to the force of truth." This is about the most outspoken
                        declaration the nation has yet had from Grant on the negro question.</p>
                    <p>But he seems to have swallowed the whole nauseous dose of Radicalism, for he
                        asserts the right of the African to hold office anywhere and everywhere.
                        Speaking of the rights and privileges secured to black men as the result of
                        the rebellion, he says that among them "is their right to employment abroad
                        as well as at home, in the public service--a right which, as you say, has
                        been acknowledged in the appointment of one of the formerly proscribed race
                        to represent the United States in Hayti."</p>
                    <p>There you have Grant on the broad platform of negro equality. He not only
                        favors negro suffrage, and negroes in the jury box, but he goes for equal
                        civil and political rights of every kind for the negro. He not only appoints
                        a negro minister to Hayti, but he claims the right to accredit a negro
                        minister to any white government. There is a good time coming for the
                        African. He can aim high now. Nothing is beyond his reach.--He may be sent
                        as Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of St.
                        James, or be allowed, as the representative of the American government, to
                        congratulate the Czar of Russia upon the emancipation of those who were in
                        bondage like himself.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, let white men stand back.--Their day is past. The negro is to
                        "occupy and possess" all public positions.</p>

<b>A Negro Scared</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gives its version of an event in Georgia where a local black official was
                    threatened by an anonymous letter. Says the official reacted too hastily and
                    allowed Grant to send armed troops to a supposedly peaceful town. Tries to put
                    the real blame upon a Radical national government rather than Southerners who
                    threaten black office-holders.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>What a farce this whole business of reconstruction has been! And how
                        accustomed the Government at Washington is becoming to meddling with affairs
                        that do not belong to it.</p>
                    <p>Under the system adopted by the government of ignoring "Caste," the position
                        of Assessor of Internal Revenue for the Third District of Georgia was given
                        to a negro, named Edwin Belcher. Belcher appointed, as Assistant Assessor of
                        the Eleventh division of his district, another negro named James B. Wilson.</p>
                    <p>It seems that on the night of the 14th ultimo, the office of this fellow
                        Wilson was entered, his books and papers were destroyed, or stolen, and a
                        note, of which the following is a copy, left on his desk:</p>
                    <p>"Bloody Moon, Nigger Sub:</p>
                    <p>"SIR: Your visit to this place must end. Your welcome has expired, and a few
                        days will be allowed you to depart. Take due notice and govern yourself
                        accordingly.<br> YOU KNOW WHO.</p>
                    <p>Wilson took no longer time than was necessary to read the note, packed his
                        carpetbag and left, as fast as his legs could carry him, to report to his
                        superior. Belcher at once writes to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
                        The matter is laid before Grant's Cabinet and it is decided to send a
                        considerable force of soldiery down to Georgia to assist in enforcing the
                        revenue laws.</p>
                    <p>It does seem as though the party in power had run perfectly wild on this
                        negro question. Had the poor cowardly darkey remained at his post, there is
                        no doubt that he would have remained uninjured. But in yielding to the
                        terror excited by an anonymous communication, he gives an opportunity to
                        Radicalism to descant upon the rebellious spirit of the Southern people, and
                        to a great government to send an armed force into the midst of a community
                        as peacefully inclined as those of any township in Franklin County. And we
                        must "pay the fiddler."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On last Thursday night, Senator Sumner, according to previous announcement,
                        delivered his lecture on "The Question of Caste," in Repository Hall. We had
                        thought that our Radical friends would rush in to hear the distinguished
                        representative of the Radical party on his favorite topic. But Radicalism
                        seems to be waning at a rapid rate in this section, and very few of the old
                        "standby's" were on hand. It was left to the ladies, and the Democrats, and
                        the "free American citizens of African descent," to make up Mr. Sumner's
                        audience. And, the whole audience numbered about two hundred and fifty.</p>
                    <p>The lecture occupied nearly an hour and three quarters in its delivery. Mr.
                        Sumner has an excellent voice, though he was somewhat hoarse. The first half
                        of the lecture was delivered in rather a monotonous style, but in the latter
                        portion he grew warmer and more eloquent and delivered some passages in a
                        very impressive manner. The charm of Mr. Sumner's delivery is his remarkably
                        accurate and finished pronunciation.</p>
                    <p>The lecture itself has been prepared with great care and is crammed full of a
                        large stock of interesting, and a vast mass of uninteresting learning. His
                        arguments were stated in general propositions and several of them seemed to
                        us to be two-edged swords, cutting both ways. The remarks of eminent
                        scientific men were quoted at considerable length, but the lecturer steered
                        clear of his "distinguished friend, Professor Agassiz."</p>
                    <p>Sumner aims at the perfect brotherhood of man. He believes that all races are
                        capable of the same perfectibility. He is struggling for the equality of all
                        men. It seems to us that the day is very far distant when his dream of hope
                        will be realized.--We hope that it is. We believe in no such doctrine as the
                        equality of the races. We are opposed to such political and social equality,
                        and equally opposed to the amalgamation of the races which will certainly
                        follow the acknowledgment of their absolute equality.</p>
