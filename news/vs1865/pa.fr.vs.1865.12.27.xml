                    <p>Secretary Stanton enters at once into the figures and estimates, without any
                        preliminary remarks, making a point at once by comparing the appropriations
                        of the last Congress for military purposes and those which will be called
                        for this year. The former were five hundred and sixteen millions; the latter
                        thirty three millions. The report then goes on to explain the military
                        situation a year ago and the operations of the year, a record extremely
                        useful for reference but not necessary to reproduce here. The present
                        situation is tersely stated as follows:</p>
                    <p>"All the armies heretofore arrayed against the National Government have laid
                        down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. Every hostile banner
                        has been hauled down; the so-called Confederate Government is overthrown;
                        its President is a prisoner in close custody, awaiting trial; while its Vice
                        President and three of its chief executive officers have been recently
                        enlarged from prison by your clemency.--All the ordinances, laws,
                        organizations created or existing under or by virtue of the so-called
                        Confederate Government, have been swept away, and, by virtue of the
                        so-called Confederate Government, have been swept away, and, by your
                        sanction, the people of the insurgent States have organized, or are busily
                        engaged in organizing State governments, in subordination to the federal
                        authority."</p>
                    <p>It is only on reading this official record of the year that we can realize
                        how tremendous has been the burden of a single twelve-month. A year ago the
                        rebels still held Richmond as their capital; they occupied Virginia, North
                        Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas
                        with parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Their principal army under Lee was
                        entrenched about Petersburg and Richmond; another army under Hood was
                        seeking to invade Tennessee and Kentucky; while another, under Kirby Smith,
                        was threatening Missouri. Sherman was then upon his grand "March to the Sea"
                        with no record in front or rear to tell how, when, or where he was coming
                        out of the great interior which he had boldly penetrated. Truly has this
                        been the year of the century.</p>
                    <p>The standard to which the army is being reduced is small, but the only
                        reasons demanding greater force are a renewal of the insurrection or a
                        foreign war. For either or both emergencies the resources of the nation are
                        ample. These could be gathered with astonishing celerity. After the
                        disasters of the Peninsula in 1862 over eighty thousand troops were
                        enlisted, organized, armed, equipped and sent to the field. And ninety
                        thousand infantry were sent to the field from the five states of Ohio,
                        Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin in twenty days. Many of the disbanded
                        veterans have their arms in the possession ready for instant service.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>It would, of course, be a waste of time and breath to ask the men who are
                        working so vigorously in the cause of disunion at Washington, what has been
                        the object of the vast expense of blood and treasure of the past four years.
                        They would not pause to think of an answer. For them it is enough to seize
                        the opportunity of the hour, and, finding the country in a position on which
                        they may thrive in politics, to keep it as long as possible in that
                        condition. But it is worth the while of their constituents now to ask
                        themselves this question, and to ask it seriously. War is a serious matter.
                        The sweeping away of a million of human lives in the short space of four
                        years, by bayonets and bullets, is no child's play, no commercial
                        speculation, no politician's amusement. There is an account to be rendered,
                        first to God, then to man and to history, for every drop of this blood which
                        has been shed.--What was it for? American citizens, voting at the elections,
                        sustaining their representatives at Washington, counseling with them,
                        approving or disapproving what they do, are individually responsible for
                        this blood.--Let them see to it that they are ready to give the account. If
                        the sacrifice be made utterly vain by the madness of radicalism, if the
                        rivers have run red for nothing but continual strife and long disunion, then
                        the account will be fearful indeed. For it is not a thing past and forever
                        settled. There is a heavy responsibility yet resting on every man in the
                        country to see to it that this treasure of human life is not wrongfully
                        expended.</p>
                    <p>For what was it given? For what did the young men and the old men alike give
                        themselves? If any one be so utterly mistaken as to imagine that this war
                        was for the negro's equality, that these vast sacrifices were to place the
                        black man on a level with the white man, let him stop the first wounded
                        soldier he meets, who survives the conflict, and ask him what he fought for.
                        Let him question those who have made the sacrifices. It will not do to go to
                        the man who has grown rich on the war and its accessories, for he has had no
                        part in the expense, and knows nothing of its objects.</p>
                    <p>From the very outbreak of the strife there were many men who designed to turn
                        it into a revolutionary contest. They taught and preached that the whole
                        social fabric was to be reorganized. They determined to make it a free
                        fight, without much caring what happened so long as they could bring out of
                        it their pet ideas triumphant over all the country, North and South. These
                        men were few, but noisy, and a great many followed them, and believed in
                        them. It is now time to reflect, and see whether it is the intention of the
                        people to reorganize the American social system. We have again and again
                        told our readers that the negro question lay below the slavery question, and
                        that the settlement of the latter was of very small account as compared with
                        the other, It is plain now that the abolition of slavery has but thrown us
                        into the midst of the other question, and the <emph rend="italic"
                        >status</emph> of the negro is to be made the subject of political
                        discussion, turmoil, and future dissension. But for the present, let us, if
                        possible, confine ourselves to the question, what was the object of the
                        war--for what have we shed so much blood? And if we find that that object
                        was the Union under the Constitution--the good old Union of the Fathers, and
                        that we can have it now, at once, without a week's delay, complete, calm,
                        peaceful; if this is within our grasp, let us have it.--Or if the people
                        decide that, having fought for it, they do not want it, and will not have
                        it, but demand some new form of government, some new social and political
                        laws, let those who decide to go forward, to the ruin on their country,
                        forever haunted by the pale faces and sad countenances of the dead who will
                        then have died in vain.</p>

                <summary>Although the war is being trumpeted by the Radicals as having been fought
                    to free the slaves and to make blacks equal citizens, the article dares anyone
                    who adheres to such views to confront an injured veteran and inquire if that was
                    indeed the reason he fought. If the strife was truly caused by a desire to
                    maintain the Union, it argues, then that goal can be achieved immediately. If,
                    however, those individuals presently pressing for black equality and greater
                    government powers try to force their will upon the country, the article hopes
                    that they will be "forever haunted by the pale faces and sad countenances of the
                    dead who will then have died in vain."</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Certain periods of the past are known as the "golden age," "the age of
                        grace," &amp;c. Future historians will find no difficulty in proving
                        that the present is the Age of Fraud. Every newspaper, nearly, contains one
                        or more accounts of frauds--nine-tenths of all of which are upon the
                        Government, and by those "loyal" officers who have frequently blessed God
                        and congratulated their country that they were better than other
                        men--especially "copperheads." Thus, we read of frauds at Washington, by
                        which department clerks, in collision with outside "loyalists," attempt to
                        pass an immense amount of bogus claims for soldiers' arrearages and bounties
                        through the Auditor's office. Then, we read of mustering offices in New York
                        having made a "good thing" out of furnishing individual substitutes at State
                        and Government expense. Then, of revenue officers at Philadelphia, who were
                        too heavily interested in tobacco manufacture for the interest of the
                        Government to prosper. And so on, from chapter to chapter, and from phase to
                        phase--fraud, fraud, fraud! With the exception of a few insignificant
                        scoundrels--just enough to keep the police force in organization--every
                        thief in the country seems to be either in office or to have a bosom friend
                        or a blood relations who is.</p>

                    referred to as "the golden age" and the "age of grace," the present era will be
                    known to future historians as the "Age of Fraud" because of the rampant increase
                    in corruption.</summary>

                    <p>Can any of the Radical presses inform us how it happens, if the Southern
                        States are not now States in the union, that they are permited to vote upon
                        an amendment to the Constitution? If they are not in the Union, they not
                        only have no right to vote but their votes are not necessary to effect the
                        change in that instrument. The Constitution requires the votes of a certain
                        proportion of the States composing the Union to effect an amendment, but it
                        was not contemplated that States not in the Union should be counted on such
                        a question.--Certainly, to participate in the formation or change of the
                        organic law of a nation, is the exercise of the highest sovereign rights,
                        and it is a contradiction in terms to say that the Southern States are not
                        in the Union, and at the same time permit or require them to vote upon an
                        amendment to the Constitution upon the plea that without their votes the
                        amendment cannot be carried by the constitutional number of the States. They
                        are either in the Union or out of it. If they are in the Union, they have
                        other rights than the single one of voting upon an amendment of the
                        Constitution, and if they are out if it, they have nothing to do with the
                        Constitution or anything else pertaining to the Union. We call upon some of
                        the wiseacres of the radical press to crack this nut.</p>

                    D. Watson Rose, Esq., in the matter of the contested election for the District
                    Attorneyship of Franklin County. It will be noticed that the answer says nothing
                    in regard to the Texas vote, for the reason that Mr. Rowe has not amended the
                    petition claiming the benefit of this vote. We presume has not amended because
                    he is doubtless convinced of the fact that the Texas returns are false and
                    fraudulent. The answer raises the question of the legality of the deserter vote

                    </p>
                    <p>The answer of William S. Stenger to the complaint of Jacob I. Suesserott and
                        twenty-four others in the matter of the election of District Attorney for
                        Franklin County--held October 10th, A. D. 1865 and filed in your Honorable
                        Court on the 6th day of November A. D. 1865, humbly showeth--That it is
                        true, as stated, in said complaint, that according to the enumeration of
                        votes made by the Board of Return Judges of the county of Franklin on the
                        27th day of October A. D. 1865, there were cast for D. Watson Rose for the
                        office of District Attorney of Franklin County three thousand five hundred
                        and fifty-five votes, and for your respondent for the same office, three
                        thousand five hundred and fifty-eight votes showing a majority of the votes
                        in favor of your respondent. But your respondent wholly denies that the said
                        election was undue, and that there was a false return thereof--and that the
                        said D. Watson Rowe and not your respondent was duly elected District
                        Attorney of said County, and should have been returned as elected--all of
                        these said several allegations of the said complaint, the said respondent,
                        in this his answer, traverses and denies and your respondent for further
                        answer in this behalf saith--that he is not aware and is ignorant whether or
                        not the following persons cast their votes for him for the said office of
                        District Attorney as stated and alleged in the said complaint, to wit:
                        Curtis Dulelhon and George Miller at the election held at the public house
                        of Jacob Elliot, for the part of the Township of Montgomery--John Tolhelm at
                        the election held at the house of John Adams in the Borough of Greencastle
                        for Antrim Township, and part of Peters and Montgomery Townships, and
                        Abraham Sheely at the election held at the public house of David Taylor in
                        the South Ward of the Borough of Chambersburg, and your respondent further
                        saith--that even if it be true--as is alleged in said complaint (but which
                        your respondent does not admit because he is wholly ignorant of the fact)
                        that said above--named persons did cast their ballots for him for said
                        office, yet your respondent doth aver that the said persons were qualified
                        electors of the County of Franklin and that their said votes were legal and
                        true, and your respondent doth further say, that it doth not appear from the
                        said complaint that the said above named persons were not qualified electors
                        of the County of Franklin--that as to the said supposed disqualification set
                        forth in the said complaint, to wit: "that the said named voters were at the
                        time of the said election, deserters from the military service of the United
                        States having been drafted into said service and having failed to re-report
                        to the Provost Marshal of the 16th District of Pennsylvania, comprised in
                        part of the said County of Franklin, for muster into service according to
                        law and remaining at the date of said election registered in the records of
                        the said Provost Marshal's office as deserters." Your respondent saith, that
                        he is ignorant whether or not the said alleged disqualification was and is
                        true in point of fact, but that if it be true in point of fact, (which your
                        respondent doth not admit, because he hath no knowledge upon the subject)
                        the said supposed disqualification hath no existence under the Constitution
                        and laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And the failure to answer the
                        draft notice of a Provost Marshal does not and cannot under the Constitution
                        and laws of this State, deprive an otherwise qualified elector, of the
                        elective franchise, and all attempts to do so under color of such pretense
                        are unconstitutional and repugnant to the laws of this State.</p>
                    <p>And your respondent doth further allege as additional reasons why the said
                        above named voters were qualified electors--that it does not appear from
                        said complaint, that they were ever adjudged to be deserters from the
                        military service of the United States, by any court, civil or military,
                        which the said Act of Congress, under which the disqualification is supposed
                        to arise, contemplated should be done before the pains and penalties therein
                        prescribed, should be incurred. And your respondent saith that it does not
                        appear form the said complaint, that the right of the said voters to cast
                        their ballots, was challenged at the time they offered their said votes to
                        the proper election officers, nor was the question of the said voters being
                        deserters from the military service of the United States, then raised and
                        tried by the said several Boards of Election officers. And so the said
                        respondent saith, that as to the aforesaid, four votes charged in the said
                        complaint to have been illegally cast for him, the said respondent, there
                        was no undue election and false return.</p>
                    <p>And for further answer to the said complaint, the said respondent saith that
                        the said Board of Return Judges, of the county of Franklin, on the said 27th
                        day of October, A. D., 1865, in enumerating the votes cast for the said D.
                        Watson Rowe, for District Attorney of said county, did count and embrace in
                        their enumeration, which made the number of votes cast for the said D.
                        Watson Rowe, three thousand five hundred and forty-five. The following
                        fraudulent and illegal votes, to wit:--the vote of John Repp, of Antrim
                        township, in the county of Franklin, purporting to have been cast at Miner
                        Hospital, at an election there held on the 10th day of October, A. D., 1865.
                        It not appearing upon the poll book or return of said election, that ten or
                        more votes were at the said hospital on the day of the said election who
                        were unable to attend their company poll, or their other proper place of
                        election. Also the votes of Thomson McGowan, of Green township, in the
                        county of Franklin, a clerk in the Paymaster General's office--of Theodore
                        McGowan, of the same township, Captain and Assistant Adjutant General--and
                        A. M'L. Crawford, of the same township, tow of whom cast their votes for the
                        said D. Watson Rowe, for District Attorney, which said votes, or at least
                        one of them was illegal and fraudulent, because your respondent verily
                        believes that on the said day of this election, and at that time, the said
                        Thomson McGowan and A. M'L. Crawford voted they were not, nor was either of
                        them, in actual military service under any requisition of the President of
                        the United States, or by the authority of this Commonwealth. The said votes
                        of the said Thomson McGowan and A. M'L. Crawford, not having been cast at
                        the proper poll of their place of residence, but as appears from the return
                        thereof, at Camp Fry, in the City of Washington and beyond the limits of
                        Pennsylvania. Also the following fraudulent and illegal votes, to wit:--the
                        votes of William Barker, Hugh Parker and John Avery, who on the said 10th
                        day of October, A. D., 1865, voted for the said D. Watson Rowe, at the
                        election poll in Quincy township, they being at the time of casting their
                        aforesaid votes, aliens. Also the vote of Benjamin Mazingo, Samuel ,
                        [unclear], [unclear], [unclear], Young [unclear], [unclear], who on the said
                        10th day of October, A. D., 1865 voted for the said D. Watson Rowe, at the
                        election poll in Qunicy township, they being at that time disqualified from
                        voting, by reason of not having been assessed and not having paid tax within
                        two years immediately preceding said election.</p>
                    <p>And the said responded further said that by reason of the enumeration of the
                        herein before specified illegal and fraudulent votes by the said Board of
                        Return Judges of Franklin county, on the said 27th day of October, A. D.,
                        1865, in favor of the said D. Watson Rowe for the office of District
                        Attorney. The number of votes cast for him, the said D. Watson Rowe, was
                        illegally and wrongfully increased from three thousand five hundred and
                        thirty to three thousand five hundred and forty-five votes, and the majority
                        of your said respondent was by this said false and fraudulent enumeration,
                        made by the said Return Judges as aforesaid, reduced illegally and
                        fraudulently, from eighteen to three, all of which said several traverses of
                        facts contained in the said complaint, and allegations of new facts
                        contained in this answer, your respondent prays, may be fully inquired of by
                        your Honorable Court, and the questions so raised and involved be decided
                        and determined by your Honors as to truth and equity may appertain, and your
                        respondent as in duty bound will ever pray, &amp;c.</p>
