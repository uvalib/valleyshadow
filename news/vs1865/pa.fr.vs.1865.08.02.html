<b>President Johnson's Inherited Cabinet</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Having assumed the country's helm in the midst of a terrible crisis,
                    President Johnson benefitted from the people's reluctance to criticize a new
                    president. Four months have passed, however, and now, the article contends, it
                    is time for the honeymoon to end. Johnson's decision to keep the cabinet he
                    inherited from his predecessor made sense under the circumstances, but if he
                    chooses to retain those officials, many of whom have brought disrepute to the
                    administration--namely Secretary Stanton--then the president must account for
                    the actions of these individuals as though they were his own selections.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York World</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The country has practiced toward Mr. Johnson a more generous forbearance
                        than has been accorded to any other President since Washington. This is less
                        a attribute to the man, than a patriotic impulse set in action by the
                        appalling circumstances of his accession. Under that sudden shock the
                        country, for the first time, was alarmed for the existence of the
                        government. The instant unanimity with which all parties stood by the new
                        President was a protest against assassination, against anarchy, against
                        attempts to change the personnel of the
                        government or the politics of the country except by the republican methods
                        of free discussion and regular elections. Nothing more creditable has ever
                        occurred in our history. But the danger which struck us all with sudden
                        dismay is past; and henceforward President Johnson, like every ruler of a
                        free people, must encounter the criticism by which responsibility is
                        enforced upon public officers. </p>
                    <p>There has been, thus far, a disposition to discriminate between President
                        Johnson and his official advisers. These advisers were not of his
                        appointment, and it was presumed that their stay in the cabinet was a
                        temporary convenience. If he had intented to keep them, it was assumed he
                        would control them; and it was impossible to believe that the outrageous
                        acts of Secretary Stanton were approved by any honest statesman sworn to
                        defend the Consitution. It was easy to se how, in closing a great war and
                        settling a great mass of unfinished business, the services of an officer
                        familiar with its details might be valuable, especially as the President had
                        no personal connection with the administration of the war. With the great
                        mass of new business emerging, he could not afford to master the unwieldly
                        details of a system that had served its day and was falling into disuse.
                        Shockingly as Stanton had violated the Constitution, it was not difficult to
                        discover possible reasons for his temporary retention. But Mr. Johnson is in
                        his fourth month; and, for aught that appears, the Cabinet is as firmly
                        seated under him as under his predecessor who appointed it. An indulgent
                        country cannot much much longer consent to distinguish between acts of the
                        administration and acts of the responsible chief. If the most conspicuious
                        and offensive heads of the departments are to go with Mr. Johson through his
                        term, or through any large and considerable part of it, the country is
                        justified in concluding that he keeps them because he approves of their
                        conduct; that their acts are his acts; and that he ought to be help
                        responsible for their usurpations.</p>
                    <p>The country will come reluctantly to this conclusion. Even after its
                        confidence is shaken, it will, for a long while, hope against hope. But
                        certain it is, that this people, cradled in liberty, will stand by no man
                        who abandons the principles of the Constitution. The subordintation of the
                        military to to the civil power, goverment by law insted of goverment by
                        arbitrary will, the [unclear] a free press, and free elections, will be
                        resolutely claimed; and no man or party can stand who are faithless to these
                        guarantees. Great allowance was made, during the war, for the difficulties
                        of the situation; but the plea of an over-ruling public necessity will no
                        longer avail. The people now demand that the officers sworn to support the
                        Constitution shall keep their oaths. They they will give their confidence to
                        no public officer who is deliberately recreant to republican principles of
                        government.</p>
                    <p>On one great subject President Johnson satisifies the just expectations of
                        the country. If he stands by his recognition of State governments, the
                        people will support him till that battle is won. But the other great
                        question of the supremacy of the law is too urgent to be much longer
                        adjourned; and considering how the law had been trampled under foot, defied,
                        and spit upon, even since Mr.Johnson's accession, we can see no other
                        suitable atonement than a removal of the offending members of the Cabinet,
                        and filling their places with honest, law-abiding citizens.</p>

                    difficult to solve because they cannot be corrected simply by marshalling armies

                    punishing white southerners. The Spirit alleges that the growing conflict
