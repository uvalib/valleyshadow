                <transcript>
                    <p> If ever there was a record which should condemn an Administration to
                        perpetual infamy, it is the recently published list of our soldiers who
                        perished at Andersonville. The list of Pennsylvanians for one year only,
                        embraces over <emph rend="italic">seventeen hundred</emph> names! Seventeen
                        hundred of our best and bravest left to die by inches, without shelter,
                        without hope, almost without food and why? Simply because the
                        Administration, through that base tool, Beast Butler, refused to exchange
                        prisoners unless the Confederate authorities would acknowlege the black
                        soldier to be the equal of the white one; and because the "loyal" friends of
                        the Administration would not permit an exchange, for fear that the Rebel
                        army, when reinforced by the exchanged prisoners, would be too strong for
                        our forces in the field, and they, the "loyal" men aforesaid, would have to
                        stand their chance in another draft. </p>
                    <p>It is said that when Secretary Stanton was urged to affect an exchange, and
                        thus save our poor fellows from starvation, he replied "I'll be d--d if I'll
                        exchange fat, healthy men for skeletons!" Whether this statement is true or
                        not, it is certain that our government could, at any time during the last
                        two or three years of the war, have relieved our starving men. We had nearly
                        twice as many prisoners as the Rebels had, and the fact that our men were
                        left to perish by thousands when they might have been rescued, cannot be
                        disproved. At one time the prisoners at Andersonville, with the consent of
                        the Confederate authorities, sent four of their comrades to state their
                        grievances to our Government; but these men were kept in New York, where
                        they first landed, the furloughs permitting them to visit Washington were
                        kept from them, and but for the persistent efforts of the reporters of the
                        New York press, who visited the men and had their statement published, the
                        Northern people would never have known anything about their arrival. The
                        Government was willing that thousands of white men should starve, if negro
                        equality could be established by the sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>Yet the Abolitionists, who aided and abetted Stanton, Lincoln &amp; Co.,
                        in their acts of heartless cruelty, pretend to be the friends of the
                        soldiers. That any soldier or any citizen who ever had a relative in a Rebel
                        prison-pen, can endorse the policy of a party which has sacrificed thousands
                        of our soldiers, by the most terrible of deaths, on the altar of negro
                        equality, is strange indeed. Better to have had more drafts, more years of
                        war, than to have thus condemned our brave boys to a lingering death by
                        starvation and exposure.</p>
                    <p>To glance over the list of Pennsylvanians is enough to make one heart-sick.
                        --What then must it be to look over the long list of thousands of names,
                        representing every Northern State, in the grand total? Thousands of
                        half-naked, freezing, starving men, lying upon the bare ground, under the
                        open sky, perishing slowly but surely, while the shoddy "loyalists" reclined
                        in their easy chairs, in the fullness of plenty! The dying soldier turning
                        his dim and sunken eyes appealingly northward, as he murmurs, "Oh, ye who
                        yet can save us have ye left us here to die?" while the bloated
                        nigger-worshipper sips his wine in his gorgeously furnished mansion, and
                        swears that there shall be no exchange until blacks and whites are declared
                        equal; and when even that point is conceded by the Confederate government,
                        declines an exchange because he fears that the rebel army will be too much
                        strengthened by the prisoners in our hands! What did such men care for the
                        soldiers? Absolutely nothing. They wished to use the bayonets and ballots of
                        those in the field--the poor, dying men they were done with they could use
                        them no longer; they might perish for aught they cared.</p>
                    <p>No nation can prosper while its rulers have so much blood and misery to
                        answer for as has the Administration of the Abolitionists, Shame upon a
                        government which would resort to such a mean, cruel, cowardly expedient to
                        keep out of the rebel ranks a few thousands of men, as the starvation of
                        twice that number of our soldiers, while a million or two of "loyal" men,
                        who had never carried a musket, were clamoring for a "vigorous prosecution
                        of the war;" and more shame upon the American people if they countenance
                        such actions hereafter.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p> We publish, on our first page, an address from Hon. Wm. D. Kelley to his
                        constituents, "the Union men of the Fourth Congressional District," in which
                        that gentle man takes occasion to lay open to public view some of the
                        beauties of character for moral and political honesty peculiar to the Hon.
                        Simon Cameron, ex-Secretary of War. For a long time back trouble has been
                        brewing in the "loyal" camp of the <emph rend="italic">Department</emph> of
                        Pennsylvania, which we are pleased to find, has at length broken out into
                        open, irrepressible war. We are pleased at this outbreak of hostilities
                        between the factions, for two reasons; one is the possible realization of
                        the promise of the adage, "When thieves fall out honest men may get their
                        due," the other, that the parties to the conflict will, doubtless, in its
                        progress so ventilate the moral and political delinquencies of each other,
                        as to open to public gaze the rascalities and corrupt schemes of prominent
                        abolition leaders, so long and successfully practiced upon the people of the
                        State. The rank and file of the "union" party will thus learn through
                        strictly "loyal" channels, what a precious set of scamps have been ruling
                        the roost for some years back in the Shoddy camp. </p>
                    <p> We discovered several weeks since, in the columns of our neighbor the <emph
                            rend="italic">Repository</emph> evidences of the approaching fray; that
                        the opponents of the old Winnebago were bent on having an open,
                        straight-up-and-down fight under the "black flag," neither giving or
                        accepting quarter until the other should be completely "subjugated" or until
                        it should be "Simon up" or "Simon down," never more to "wiggle-waggle." </p>
                    <p> The fight has commenced. It is a <emph rend="italic">free</emph> fight.
                        Simon has rallied his clan with his henchmen Berguer and Forney at his back,
                        whilst his adversaries Curtin, McClure, Quay, with Kelley to the fore, are
                        under a vow "to do or to die." The rank and file can fall in with either
                        side as suits their inclinations, while the Democracy look on with a feeling
                        of disgust mingled with amusement, not caring much which whips. Of the
                        principal participants in the opening combat the Philadelpha <emph
                            rend="italic">Age</emph> says: </p>
                    <p>They are each apostates from their early and honest convictions. The are both
                        aspiring and ambitious. Both love money and will venture neck deep into the
                        dirty and disturbed stream of political management to obtain it. Thus
                        kindred in qualities, they have hunted over the same ground, if not in
                        company, and hence the tracks of the Winnebago chief are familiar to his
                        brother. The experienced politiical manager when on the war path might tread
                        on rock or travel in the stream to hide his footsteps, still his younger but
                        not less expert associate would detect them and follow to the end.</p>
                    <p>As we said before, it is a matter of small consequence which whips; the one
                        faction is about as dishonest as the other, and a disgusting expose of the
                        political rascalities of each may be expected as the fight progresses.</p>

                <excerpt>"[Chief Justice Chase] seems to be laboring to create an insurrection in
                    the South rather than anything else."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p> THE President must by this time be convinced that Chief Justice Chase is
                        organizing a regular campaign against the Administration. His stumping
                        through the Southern States and the radical, revolutionary and incendiary
                        speeches which he then delivered, are introvertible evidence of this fact.
                        But, indeed, the Chief Justice has himself avowed his determination in his
                        letters to his western friends informing them that the time had now come to
                        organize a party upon the basis of universal and immediate negro suffrage.
                            --<emph rend="italic">Herald</emph></p>
                    <p> The New York <emph rend="italic">Herald</emph> justly characterizes the
                        course of Chase as "radical, revolutionary and incendiary." It is one of the
                        acts entirely without justification. He does not expect to convince the
                        white people of the South that blacks ought to be allowed to vote--that is
                        not his object. His remarks are not addressed to the whites, but to the
                        blacks whom he harangues in such incendiary arguments as can only lead to
                        trouble. He seems to be laboring to create an insurrection in the South
                        rather than anything else. </p>
                    <p>If any white Southerner was to adopt similar language to the whites, to
                        arouse their passions against the proposed policy of the Government, he
                        would be denounced and arrested. Chase is in no danger because he advocates
                        the claim of the negroes; he might be if he had a word to say in defense of
                        the freedom of the white man. --Now when the blacks are idle and doubly
                        destitute and uncontrollable on account of his newly found liberty, or
                        because there is in our opinion no more disgraceful or dangerous thing than
                        for the Chief Justice to be going around haranguing them with arguments and
                        appeals, urging them to discontent and dissatisfaction; it really looks as
                        if he were anxious to produce a collision between the two races, though
                        perhaps his object is the more selfish one of catering to radical favor to
                        receive a nomination for the Presidency in 1868.</p>

                    <p>THE Abolitionists say that the Democracy charge them with designing to make
                        the negro equal to the white man, and then they try to be witty, as if they
                        were charged with a design to make the negro physically, morally and
                        intellectually equal to the white man. We beg leave to assure them that we
                        are not opposed to this last exploit. If they will accomplish it, we pledge
                        ourselves to vote for the next nomination they make President. It is the way
                        to get rid of the whole difficulty. We never understood why the negro race
                        was made at all, but if the Radicals will invent a plan to improve its
                        capacity, so as to make the negro of equal capacity with the white man, we
                        shall begin to see some reason in it. It was just to give these latter-day
                        saints the opportunity to show how they could transform one race into
                        another. We can only repeat what we have said, if the Radicals will give, by
                        any invention, the higher qualities of the white man to the negro, we are
                        for it. What we object to is the unnatural attempt to treat as equal in
                        human institutions what God has made unequal.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p> Now that the people are beginning to feel the heavy burden of taxation that
                        has been laid upon them, they naturally inquire more closely into the
                        operation of the system, or rather <emph rend="italic">want</emph> of system
                        by which that burden has been imposed. The result of their inquiries lead to
                        one inevitable conclusion--and that is, the great inequality and injustice
                        of exempting Government bonds from State, municipal and county taxation. It
                        amounts practically to the creation of the creditors of the government into
                        a privileged class, whose wealth represented by the bonds they hold, buys
                        their freedom from the local taxes, which under a just and impartial system,
                        should be equally borne by all, in proportion to their means. How much of
                        the wealth of the States has been absorbed in the National securities, may
                        be easily estimated and that it will not be long before the bulk of them
                        will pass into the hands of the rich, who can afford to hold them as an
                        investment, may be taken for granted. The rottenness, therefore, of a scheme
                        which operates so as to relieve from taxation the very individuals who, by
                        reason of their riches should bear the largest proportion, is too plain to
                        need demonstration. Apart from the manifest wrong done to the people at
                        large, by such partial legislation, the question may well be raised, whether
                        Congress did not exceed their powers when they deprived the States of the
                        right which they have heretofore exercised as a necessary attribute to
                        sovereignty in their domestic affairs, of equally taxing the wealth of their
                        citizens respectively, in whatever shape invested. </p>
                    <p> The last Doylestown <emph rend="italic">Democrat</emph> has an excellent
                        article on this subject, which we copy, as an unanswerable argument against
                        the odious species of favoriteism which releases the Government creditors,
                        whose security is of the first class, from the payment of their just
                        proportion of the public expenses. </p>
                    <p>Shall Government Bonds be Taxed.</p>
                    <p>This question will come up sooner or later before the Amercican people at the
                        ballot box. The exemption of Government bonds from taxation for State,
                        municipal and county purposes is a great wrong perpetrated upon the
                        tax-payers generally. It is building up a privileged class, and relieves
                        hundreds of millions of dollars of the wealth of the country from bearing
                        any of the burdens of the Government. What right Congress has to make this
                        distinction in favor of persons who loan their money to the Government,
                        instead of individuals, we have not yet discovered. If I loan money to a
                        farmer, and he gives me his bond or mortgage, it is taxed for State and
                        county purposes. But if a neighbor lends his money to the United States, and
                        receives a bond for its payment that bond is not liable to taxation for any
                        purpose whatever. This is an unjust discrimination in favor of investments,
                        and one which is at variance with our system of government. The Democratic
                        doctrine is that people should pay for the support of the government
                        according to their means; but the abolition Congress steps in and says one
                        class shall be exempt from paying anything if they will only invest their
                        money in a particular kind of securities. We ask our readers if this is
                        always just and right? We say, no; it is class legislation that we must put
                        an end to. It goes to build up an aristocracy, and thows an additional
                        weight of taxation on the farmer and the landed interest.</p>
                    <p>The rich man who has $100,000 invested in government bonds pays neither
                        State, County, Borough or School tax; while the little homestead of the
                        hardworking mechanic, not worth more than 1,000, is taxed for all these
                        purposes. The latter pays for repairing the street, lighting the lamp before
                        the rich man's door, and the policeman who guards his property at night. So
                        far as the capitalists are concerned they have already repudiated our State,
                        County, and Municipal debts, for they bear none of the burdens. It is only
                        necessary for Congress to exempt the farmer, mechanic, laboring man, and
                        merchant when the repudiation will be complete. To tax these securities will
                        no more prevent the government borrowing money than indiviuals, on bond and
                        mortgage. There is no other country in the world where one half of the
                        capital is exmpt from taxation.</p>
                    <p>Congress has perpetrated another wrong upon the tax-payer. Our State banks
                        paid about half a million dollars a year tax into the State Treasury. These
                        institutions Congress has abolished, and established National banks in their
                        place, which are exempt from taxation for state purposes. --Therefore, the
                        five hundred thousand dollars tax which the State banks paid must be raised
                        from some other source. These great banking corporations are relieved from
                        paying their share of the public burdens and the real and personal property
                        of individuals are made to pay it for them. --We need not ask the question
                        whether there is any injustice in this. The thing speaks for itself.</p>

                    <p><emph rend="italic">Messrs. Editors:</emph>--A month has passed since I wrote
                        you. I was then at Beaufort, S.C., ecstatic over shade trees. Embarked again
                        I found the voyage to Texas more pleasant than that to South Carolina, for I
                        had cast off sea-sickness and formed a more intimate acquaintance with the
                        officers aboard. Only once we stopped, that at Key West Florida, waiting our
                        turn to take on coal and water. We were detained three days, Key West is the
                        one name for the town and the island. The town has a population of about
                        3000. The island is said to be seven miles long and nearly as many wide. I
                        devoted the three days to the collection of sea shells, conch shells,
                        starfish, (though I had to row to some of the neighboring islands a few
                        miles off and wade too, for the last two named,) rambling amongst the
                        cocoas, palmettos and olianders, crawling amongst the mangos, admiring the
                        cactus, a hundred times larger than that of the North, studying the style of
                        the Islanders, Spaniards, Scotchmen, Negroes, Yankees, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c., of which the populace is made up. Fruits and nuts only, are the
                        productions. Six days after leaving Key West, constantly steaming onward, we
                        reached Brazos Santiago, Texas. I saw nothing new to note except the Dry
                        Tortugas, where that worst class of all men, deserters, are receiving the
                        penalty of their desertion. Two whales, at a distance of three or four
                        hundred yards crossed our course, spouting water as they moved. </p>
                    <p>We were nineteen days on our voyage from Fortress Monroe, including five
                        spent at Beaufort and Key West, distance nineteen hundred miles.</p>
                    <p>Brazos Santiago is a military post, near the mouth of the Rio Grande, about
                        thrity five miles from Brownsville. Fortunately my regiment was one of the
                        few on duty here, and I was not long in finding it. This limits my knowledge
                        of Texas to this one point socially. I was assigned to duty with the
                        regiment that best suited me, for two thirds of the officers are of my
                        acquaintance, and were at Philadelphia and before Casey's Board with me. Two
                        of them in turn were my instructors. Capt. Leib, once of Hamilton township,
                        Franklin county, Lieut. Heck, of Spring Run reputation, and Lieut. Potter,
                        nephew of A.K. Weir, our ex-Prothonotary, are here. Lieut Stewart, of
                        Philadelphia, once of the Gray Reserves, a class mate is, I find, better
                        acquainted in parts of Chambersburg than I. Perhaps a certain pair of blue
                        eyes will see this.--Franklin county is largely represented in enlisted men.
                        Mercersburg, Greencastle, Chambersburg and Green township are well
                        represented. I reached here on the 15th ult., and was assigned to company
                        "E." In answer to a query I learned that the Captain was detached as A.C.S.
                        of brigade that there was no First Lieutenant; that the company was
                        commanded by a Second Lieutenant of another company, and would soon leave
                        it. In less than two days he was appointed an A.D.C., and the idea of
                        "nothing to do" was dispelled. I found myself suddenly alone with a company
                        whose rolls showed me 83 names. My verdancy mounted up before me like
                        montains, and to add to my mortification I was put on guard the first day.
                        How well I succeeded in guard mounting, I am not at liberty to say, for the
                        truth might not be agreeable. After two weeks' duty with the company, I feel
                        much more at ease, but with no less work. Be it said this is one of the best
                        colored regiments here. The men are nearly all from the Northern States, and
                        they are universally better fitted for soldiers than Southern men. The
                        regiment is well disciplined under a forced rule. Nothing but a forced rule
                        will do. You can't trust to their honor for the faithful performance of a
                        duty, yet handled as they are, they are pretty good soldiers. They are
                        taught to obey instantly any command of the commissioned officers, but
                        detest more than white soldiers the commands of non-commissioned officers.
                        Our regiment performs fatigue duty at the landing here. Your humble servant
                        has been so many as four consecutive days in charge of fatigue, with so many
                        as 175 men at one time. Under the direct supervision of white men they
                        perform much more labor than so many white soldiers, but allowed to the
                        inclination of their dispositions they do but poorly. They are very jealous
                        of their own officers. From 5 P.M. to 1 A.M. on the night fatigue, one night
                        I had fifty men from the First U.S.C. Cavalry, in the first five minutes I
                        had to send one to the guard house for his disrespect and impudence; during
                        the night ten deserted the fatigue. With a guard I proceeded to their camp
                        and succeeded in apprehending six of them quietly quartered in their bunks.
                        They did not like an infantry officer. Most of the non-commissioned officers
                        are incompetent, and yet there are a few very good ones. Three of my five
                        sergeants are good, the first sergeant writing a very fair hand.</p>
                    <p> Brazos Santiago is a sand bank. Three regiments are here. Up to this time I
                        have not been able to see, or to find any one that has seen the beauties of
                        Texas. There is not a tree or bush in all that part I have seen, and, except
                        a few sea weeds, there is nothing grows. It <emph rend="italic">may</emph>
                        be a very fine country away from Brazos, but I have not seen it. Water, the
                        name, that is all! Not a well or a spring is to be found. 'Tis true the Gulf
                        of Mexico is only two or three hundred yards off, but salt water is not
                        quite what I have been used to drinking.--Water from the Gulf is condensed
                        by machinery, a process of steaming I have not studied yet, that is issued
                        to us. Often the condenser is unfit for service, and the water is salt, and
                        then too, our rations are cut down. At no time is there more than one gallon
                        a day issued to each man, and it is sometimes reduced to half that; this
                        includes the <emph rend="italic">whole</emph> for cooking, drinking,
                        &amp;c. All orders for water are filled through the Quartermaster's
                        Dept.; ponder the idea of making a requisition for water! What a relief I
                        have experienced at times to get aboard a vessel to get a drink of water
                        from the Rio Grande or Mississippi rivers <emph rend="italic">without</emph>
                        ice. If our Harrisburg water-mongers will bring us a little Susquehanna
                        water in its primitive coolness, we will <emph rend="italic">buy</emph> it,
                        and forget their patriotism. Ice! what a word. At fabulous prices we can get
                        it in Mexico. At present writing the condenser is in pretty good order, and
                        after a night's cooling the water is fit for drinking. This water <emph
                            rend="italic">may</emph> be healthy but my experience must testify
                        differently. But, like dying we get used to it. Substantials are not high;
                        we buy fresh beef at six cents a pound.--Canned tomatoes, peaches, condensed
                        milk &amp;c., can be had at the commissary of subsistence, at about 40
                        cents a can. </p>
                    <p>This post is commanded by Brevet Brig. Gen. Draper. The appointment of
                        officers from their regiments to positions on staff, reduces our working
                        force considerably. The regiments at best [unclear] complement of officers.
                        The last three or four times I appeared on dress parade I was the only
                        officer on the line, the other companies appearing in charge of the first
                        sergeants. What a dash the Adjutant and I cut advancing to the commanding
                        officer at the close of parade.</p>
                    <p>I fear the 127th will exist but a short time yet; in less than one month the
                        men mustered for one year will be discharged, I shall lose 25 men, some
                        companies lose 60. Many of the officers contemplate leaving the service.
                        Only about 300 three years' men remain. "Yours truly" mustered for three
                        years from July 13. He does not intend staying so long, however, if he can
                        get off in two years or less, though for the present I am content.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sheridan was here four or five days ago; he stayed but a short time.</p>
                    <p>What disposition will finally be made of the 25th A.C. I cannot surmise. At
                        present it is everywhere, Chaplain Wilhelm, of Fannettsburg, and Captain
                        Hasinger, of Chambersburg, are one hundred and fifteen miles up the Rio
                        Grande, at Edinburg with date of July 26. Lieut. Fickes, of Roxbury, is
                        farther up--the former of the 45th and the latter of the 29th.</p>
                    <p>Quite a number of Mexicans are in the employ of the Quartermaster's
                        department. My only effort to talk to one proved worse than vanity; he
                        didn't speak the English language. They are a tall, lean, dark, ugly set of
                        fellows, and are fond of ornament, like bells on their spurs, bead belts
                        about their waists and long loggins of unfinished leather. The women wear
                        their dresses wide, one third wider than they should, with waists only about
                        five inches long.--When I first saw a gentleman from Mexico in his broad
                        brimmed hat, and a lady in her wide, short-waisted dress, I looked on in
                        holy horror. The custom is not solely Mexican, for persons who have been
                        here for some time adopt it.</p>
                    <p>Eight miles from this, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, is a town
                        called Bagdad, where many of the officers go. I have not been there yet, but
                        I have heard so much about it that I fancy I know all about it. For silver
                        [and there are places where we can exchange greenbacks at the rate of sixty
                        cents on a dollar, the people sell lower than our merchants North. For two
                        dollars, we can buy a linen duster or a pair of linen pantaloons, or for
                        about a dollar a gallon of claret. Max's soldiers are there and by our
                        officers are represented as being far inferior to our colored
                        soldiers--dirty, slothful men. The Mexicans too, particularly the females,
                        have certainly never studied Northern etiquette, but they are Mexicans and I
                        am willing that they remain Mexicans and retain Mexican habits. I am not a
                        missionary to Mexico.</p>
                    <p>Before I left Chambersburg I was asked frequently to write if any
                        opportunities offered for enterprising clerkships in the Q.M. or C.S.
                        Department, pay from $75 to $150 a month and one ration. A few good clerks
                        could find employment. This is only a small military post, and hardly
                        affords the facilities for money making that Indianola, Corpus Christi,
                        Brownsville and other towns would. The price of boarding at the hotel here
                        is eight dollars per week. On the whole I think there are positions here
                        worth more than Second Lieutenancies.</p>
                    <p> We get a mail here occasionally. Three days ago we got a large mail. I have
                        lettes from Fannettsburg and the VALLEY SPIRIT of July 5, letters from
                        Greencastle and <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> of the 12th. Two days
                        before that I got letters dated July 4. </p>
                    <p> One of the companies of this regiment is on duty at [unclear] Chico. Among
                        the ordnance is one 12 lb. smooth bore piece presented to the <emph
                            rend="italic">Republic of Texas</emph> with inscription to that effect. </p>
                    <p>I have not seen a thermometer since I came here, I am sure it is not as warm
                        here as it is in Chambersburg. There is almost constantly a sea breeze
                        floating, amounting to nearly a wind. But enough.</p>

                    have resisted retaliating in fear of angering the military authorities.</summary>

                        Petition Against Negro Troops--Jeff. Davis to be cared for.</p>
                    <p> NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 17. <lb/> A special dispatch to the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Times</emph>, from Jackson, Miss., to-day, says that in the State
                        Convention an ordinance was reported ratifying all judicial decisions,
                        judgments, decrees, contracts, sales, deeds and indictments, and also
                        marriages made under the State law during the war. </p>
                    <p>An ordinance was adopted prohibiting the Legislature from passing any law
                        imposing any civil disability or punishment or forfeiture of estate of any
                        citizen engaged in the late war with the United States for his political
                        opinion occasioned thereby. --Both ordinances passed first reading.</p>
                    <p>A memorial requesting the President not to garrison the State with negro
                        troops was referred to General Osterhaus, the General in command.</p>
                    <p>A memorial was presented praying that steps be taken in behalf of Jeff. Davis
                        and Governor Clark.</p>
                    <p>The Committee on Constitution made a report, recommending that such change be
                        made in the Constitution as to hereafter prevent slavery or involuntary
                        servitude, except upon legal authority for crime, and striking out all
                        portions of the old Constitution relating to slavery.</p>
                    <p>An ordinance was also presented providing for the election of Congressmen,
                        Governor, and other State officers, on the first Monday in October, to serve
                        two years, the judicial and ministerial officers to hold office for the
                        remainder of the unexprired term of their predecessors. This will cause all
                        the elections to be held on the same day as before the passage of the act of
                        secession.</p>
                    <p>A second committee was appointed, with instructions to present an ordinance
                        ratifying all the acts of the officers of the State not made in aid of the
                        recent war, and not inconsistent with the courts of the United States or
                        Mississippi. Both reports will be adopted.</p>
