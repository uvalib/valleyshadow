<b>The Political Contest in Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asserts that the political campaign in Pennsylvania "has a much deeper
                    significance than ordinarily attache[d] to State and local contests" because the
                    battle is reflective of the struggle taking place on the national level between
                    the Radicals and Democrats. In contrast to the conservative policies endorsed by
                    the Democrats, the most important being state's rights, the Radicals, the
                    article contends, are promoting an aggrandizement of the federal government's
                    powers and the placement of severe restrictions upon the former Confederate
                    states. The Spirit maintains that the Reconstruction policy adopted for North
                    Carolina should serve as the model for the readmittance of the southern states.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The election in this State has a significance deeper than ordinarily attaches
                        to State or local contests. Its results, be they in favor or against the
                        Democracy, will not be bounded by State lines, or stop at State issues. The
                        principles which have been announced by the Democratic party as the rule of
                        their action at this crisis in the fate of the nation, underlie the
                        government itself, and must constitute the basis of any settlement of
                        existing difficulties between the sections, if that settlement is to be
                        permanent and beneficial. The doctrine that the States never were out of the
                        Union; that their functions were impeded, disturbed, deranged, not
                        destroyed; that when hostility to the constitutional authority of the
                        government ceased, the people of the States whose citizenship had not been
                        destroyed by acts, the legal consequences of which worked a forfeiture of
                        the rights of citizenship--immediately took their old position in the
                        States; that the States became the depositories of their won political
                        power, the rulers of their own destinies under the Federal and State
                        Constiutions, is the only doctrine that will close the breach in the chain
                        of the Union. The equality of the States, will be preserved on these
                        principles. Without such equality the Union will be one of force, not
                        consent, and will never be cordially united.</p>
                    <p>This is the sentiment of the Democratic party in this State, and as the
                        election will take place before the meeting of Congress, it is highly
                        important that it should be nedorsed by the freemen of Pennsylvania. --The
                        radicals have announced their intention to oppose the admission of members
                        of Congress from teh Southern States, unless certain conditions precedent
                        are complied with on the part of the people of those States. One of these is
                        to force the people of the Southern States to bestow upon negroes the right
                        of suffrage. This interference with the right of the people to designate and
                        qualify the depositories of the political power of a sovereign and
                        independent State, is hostile to the very foundation idea of a republican
                        govenrment, and if carried out will create a despotism instead of
                        re-establishing the Union under the Constitution. The President in his North
                        Carolina proclamation adopted the Democratic view of this subject, and the
                        Southern States are now acting in good faith under that proclamation. The
                        work of reorganization is progressing in a most satisfactory manner, and, if
                        not interfered with by the adoption of the radical policy, the whole of the
                        Southern States will in a few months have their State organizations
                        completed, and be in full and harmonious fellowship with the other States of
                        the Union.</p>
                    <p>Now it is to prevent radical interference, and aid in the good work of
                        restoring each State to its old position, that a Democratic triumph in
                        Pennsylvania, at this time, is so desirable and important. If the old
                        Keystone State will endorse at the polls the idea set forth in the North
                        Carolina proclamation, it will have a salutary influence, North and South,
                        that can scarcely be over-estimated. It will strengthen the hands and faith
                        and purpose of the true friends of the Union in the South, and at the same
                        time throw the wieight of Pennsylvania's influence into the scale in favor
                        of conservative and patriotic action on the part of Congress. Stevens and
                        the bands of corrupt politicians who rule the Republican party, desire to
                        keep the Southern States unsettled. --That is their political capital--their
                        stock in trade. They rode into power on the back of the negro; and they
                        still desire to retain him for political equitation. Hence they agitate on
                        negro equality and negro suffrage, and oppose all plans for tranquilizing
                        and reorganizing the Southern States. They are governed by love of power and
                        place, of officers and plunder, not by a sincere desire to re-establish the
                        old political relations between the States; and their success in the pending
                        contest would be a calamity, the extent of which is impossible to estimate.</p>
                    <p> Pennsylvania is for the old Union under the Constitution, and therefore must
                        be in favor of the Democratic plan for the pacification of the country. This
                        plan is now under trial in the South, and is working well. Why should it be
                        disturbed by the partisan and unpatriotic clamor of the radicals? The sound,
                        patriotic, thinking men of this State, the tax-payers and wealth producers,
                        desire union and repose. They are tired of strife. The public debt is heavy
                        enough; the taxes are burdensome as labor can well bear at present. The men
                        of Pennsylvania wish no addition to either. They are in favor of reuniting
                        the country on a just and fair basis, and allowing the stream of trade and
                        business to flow from one end of the land to the other, invigorating and
                        making fruitful each interest that it touches with its refreshing influence.
                        To such the programme of the Democratic party commends itself by the history
                        of the past, and the wants, facts and occurrences of the present. --Age.</p>

<b>the Memorial of the Mississippi Ladies in Behalf of Mr. Davis</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    <p>HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., AUG. 1 1865</p>
                    <p>
                        To his Excellency, Andrew Johnson, President of the
                            United States:
                    </p>
                    <p>The undersigned ladies of Holly Springs, would respectfully solicit Executive
                        clemency for Jefferson Davis, late President of the Confederate States, now
                        confined Fortress Monroe. Occupying, as he did for years before the
                        inception of the late unhappy civil war, prominent positions both in the
                        State and Federal Governments, positions which were cheerfully accorded him
                        by reason of his undoubted ability and unquestioned devotion to his native
                        South, the undersigned deem it not unbecoming to apply to you, sir, Chief of
                        the great representative government of earth, for indulgence in his behalf.</p>
                    <p>It is well known to your excellency that, for years past, sectional strife
                        has been seemingly fostered by extremists both North and South, which led to
                        a general conflict of arms and the shedding of the best blood of the land.
                        One party and section have been forced by the arbitrament of the sword to
                        succomb. To the victors and their success the plaudits of the great North
                        have been given bountifully. Is it asking too much of you to grant the
                        yielding party and its chief the poor tribute of honesty for the changes in
                        government they had in view.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis was but the representative of the defeated party, and called, as he
                        was, by the almost united voice of the Southern people to preside over their
                        councils and guide them through the terrible storms of war, he was but doing
                        their bidding in armed conflict, as he had before represented their views in
                        times of peace; is it therefore right that vials of wrath should be poured
                        upon his head, who, whatever his faults may have been, or the supposed erros
                        of his cause, was devoted and faithful alike to the people and principles he
                        represented?</p>
                    <p>Sir, our once happy and cheerful people have surely suffered enough. Could
                        the tears that have been shed, the anguish borne, the despair which has been
                        our portion during this unhappy war, be brought home to you by a vision of
                        reality, we could not, would not plead in vain for one whom we honored in
                        prosperity, and respect and venerate in adversity.</p>
                    <p>The war is at an end, the people of the South have again become loyal
                        citizens to the Government of the United States, our fathers, our brothers,
                        our husbands, who survived the battle storm, have returned to the bosoms of
                        their families. We submit that the fraternal feeling that should exist
                        between citizens of the same govenrment can be more effectually restored by
                        mildness and clemency than by the punishment of those who by reason of
                        common toil, dangers and privations, are and must ever be dear to every true
                        Southerner.</p>

                        --The Herald says: If Wendells Phillips,
                        Garrison, Sumner, Chandler, Cheever and Beecher could be hung up with Davis
                        and an equal number of Southern agitators, we should be very willing to see
                        the ceremony performed. Then there would be some sense in having a grand
                        trial. The country and the world would be benefited by the execution of
                        these sectional fanatics, who are afflicted with different phases of the
                        same disease--negro on the brain. --They are all traitors together, and they
                        should either die in company or be allowed to escape scot free. The Northern
                        fanatics tried to dissolve the Union to get rid of slavery, and the Southern
                        fanatics attempted the same performance in order to maintain slavery. There
                        is no moral distinction, and not much legal differnce between their degrees
                        of turpitude. We see no reason why one class should be left off and the
                        other made to suffer. It is unfair to hang Jeff. Davis while Phillips is
                        permitted to escape punishment. What is sauce for the abolition goose ought
                        to be sauce for the secession gander. Before Andy Johnson became President
                        he used to coincide with these opinions, and we doubt that he has changed
                        his views ince he entered the White House. If it be possible to try the
                        Northern and Southern disunionists together, let us have the trial and give
                        all the lawyers a chance; but if this be impracticable or impolitic, then
                        let Jeff Davis be sent out of the country so that we may be rid of him, as
                        we were of Benedict Arnold, forever. </p>

                        the coming election. It is not, as heretofore, a question of political
                        economy--of banks, tariffs and the like, but one of more vital importance.
                        It is, in short, whether white men are to be the governing class in theis
                        country, or whether the negro is be allowed to participate in the
                        government.</p>

                        fearing disaster to their cause from a premature disclosure of the ultimeate
                        ends aimed at, are carefully dodging the the issue, until such times as they

                    <p>It is refreshing in this age of offices and office seekers, to find a man
                        upon whom a nomination for Assembly, is thrust unsought and unsolicited. To
                        the citizens of Franklin and Perry counties, we are proud to present such a
                        candidate in the person of Capt. D. L. Tressler.</p>
                    <p>For two years he declined the nomination and not until a united and
                        persistent demand upon him was made by the Democracy, did he consent to take
                        the nomination.</p>
                    <p>For the special benefit of the voters of Franklin county we give the
                        following sketch:</p>
                    <p>Capt. D.L. Tressler is a son of the late Col. John Tressler, so long and so
                        well known as a friend to church and school, and everything good. The father
                        believed in teaching his boys to work as well as in sending them to school,
                        and hence his boys know what hard work is. The subject of our sketch worked
                        his way through boyhood--worked his way to the academy, where he always
                        stood first in his class--worked his way to and through college, graduating
                        at Pennsylvania college in 1860, with the highest honors of one of the best
                        classes ever graduated by that college. Let no one excuse himself, or rather
                        his laziness by crying, "well if my father had not been poor I could have
                        done the same," for Dave, as we always call him, had the misfortune at this
                        time to have a father, though very willing to support his son, was not able,
                        from pecuniary embarrasment. He had invested his all in the large and
                        commodious Academic building which now stands a monument to his munificence.
                        The son, however, never wavered in his resolution to acquire an education.
                        He made brick, carried the hod, followed the plow, late and early when at
                        home and at college. The habits thus acquired enabled him to realize the
                        value of time and industry. Thus by dint of industry and the most rigid
                        economy and self-denial, he went through with his class taking the palm for
                        scholarship and deportment, with the very highest testimonials from all the
                        faculty. Upon leaving college, he took charge of the academy, in the
                        building of which he had done the most of the work, and conducted it for two
                        years with marked success. The interim of his labors in the school-room was
                        occupied in the study of law and general literature under B. McIntire, and
                        theology under Rev. P. Sahm.</p>
                    <p>In the summer of 1862, when the reverses of the Peninsula threatened the life
                        of the nation, he determined to march his school out in defense of his
                        country. In three days after forming this resolution he was in Harrisburg
                        with a full company, leaving a tearful widowed mother, a pleasant home and a
                        lucrative position. The manner in which he discharged his duty as a soldier
                        is best attested by his company and regiment. In camp and field he always
                        did his duty and won the esteem of all, especially by his many acts of
                        kindness did he merit and win the love of the private soldiers. At
                        Fredericksburg, while leading his company in the bloody charge upon the
                        heights, he fell wounded in two places. His brother was by his side and was
                        more fortunate for the ball only passed through his coat. The Capt. received
                        a forty days' furlough and returned to his command at the end of that time,
                        contrary to the advice of surgeons and friends, for his wounds were still
                        running. At Chancellorsville, he went with his regiment through all the
                        action in which they were engaged, and after the regiment had been withdrawn
                        from the front he, overcome by heat, forced marching and hunger, was sent to
                        the hospital. For several days thereafter he was unable for duty and this
                        was the only time his company went upon drill, duty or parade without him at
                        their front. The terrible march to Antietam, who that was there has
                        forgotten it? In all the labors of that memorable night the brave boys from
                        Perry and Franklin went steadily forward. The memory of the eventful nine
                        months is too fresh in the memory of the 126th and 133d to need recital.
                        Upon his return home, the Captain resumed his labors as Professor and law
                        student, and was admitted to the Bar of Perry county where he has since
                        practiced his profession with marked success for a young man. An officer in
                        the Lutheran church his moral character is unstained. He stands upon the
                        principles and platform of the illustrious Douglas who was the first man he
                        supported at the polls. His record is clean and where he is best known he
                        will run the best vote. The office is unsought on his part but the people
                        want him and will elect him. Permit me to admonish the people of Franklin
                        and Perry to look to their own interest. My long acquaintance with him
                        enables me to give the above statement with strict precision. W.W.W</p>

<b>Negro Equality</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In response to arguments that favor granting blacks the vote because they
                    served in the military, a letter to the Hartford Times from a "soldier"

                    made between those blacks who "voluntarily enlisted and those who were forced to
                    don the blue." The soldier claims that over three quarters of the black troops

                    <p> Republicans are arguing in favor of negro suffrage and equality. It is urged
                        that as negroes have been made soldiers "and have fought for the Union,"
                        they should now be permitted to exercise the elective franchise. In answer
                        to this position "a soldier" thus writes to the Hartford Times: "Were this true, should there not be a distinction made
                        between those negroes who voluntarily enlisted and those who were forced to
                        don the blue? The usual mode of enlisting darkies was this: Some officer
                        empowered to recruit would hear that there was to be a negro meeting, or a
                        negro ball near the station. After the darkies had collected, a guard would
                        be sent with orders to arrest all the ablebodied negroes and bring them to
                        headquarters. The negroes would be brought, examined, and forthwith forced
                        into the service. Or the negroes on some plantation would be seized and
                        treated in a similar manner. Of all the negro soldiers in the army, I do not
                        believe that one-fourth voluntarily entered the service. </p>
                    <p>"During our former wars, Indians fought for us. Even at as early a day as
                        during Phillip's War, Colonel Church was assisted to victory by Indian
                        allies. Yet no party was ever foolish enough to declare that Indians should
                        be permitted to vote, and insist that the Constitution of the United States
                        should be so amended as to give them that right."</p>

                    <p> THE News, a little paper published in the
                        neighboring town of Shippensburg, seems very solicitous that this senatorial
                        and representative district should be properly represented at Harrisburg. We
                        were, for some time at a loss to know what induced the News to take so deep an interest in the affairs of this county;
                        whether it was that our neighbor of the Repository lacked either the ability or inclination to properly puff
                        the abolition candidates, and requested the valuable assistanace of the
                        Shippensburg machines; or whether Brother Thrush, in the kindness of his
                        heart, volunteered a few rays from the brilliant torch of his intellect for
                        the benefit of the faithful in this benighted region. We think that we have
                        at length solved the mystery. It will be remembered that a few weeks
                        previous to the meeting of the Abolition County Convention, Simon Cameron
                        was presented by some of his admirers with a portrait of himself at his
                        residence; at which presentation it appears, Col. F.S. Stumbaugh was
                        present. It appears also, that about the time of the Colonels return home
                        (through Shippensburg) an editorial appeared in the News, setting forth his merits, and what a valuable member of the
                        legislature he would make, "if he could be induced to consent" to a use of
                        this name in that connection. The Convention met, and the Colonel, without
                        very great reluctance, did "consent," and is now a candidate. It would
                        therefore have been very bad conduct on the part of the News, after having brought out the
                        Colonel, and induced him to "consent" to drop
                        him; it therefore sticks to him and in its last issue, shows what a proper
                        man he is to strip the "rattles from a viper" and expel the "gas" from the
                        reptiles aforesaid. </p>
                    <p> The News also indulges in a little puff of Mr.
                        McConaughey, under the head of "Senatorial" and attempts to depreciate our
                        candidate Mr. Duncan, calling him a "jevenile political upstart." This is
                        too bad of the old fellow of the News. Mr. Duncan
                        it is true, is but a few years older than that
                        editor but should not be twitted with his jevenility on that account. We
                        would suggest to the News that our people are
                        very well acquainted with Col. Stumbaugh the gallant, Mr. McLellan "the
                        viper," Mr. McConaughey the great lawyer and Mr. Duncan the "jevenile

                        issues now presented to the people:</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That we will give to the Administration
                        of Andrew Johnson, whose past record gives warrant of undeviating patriotism
                        in the future, a generous unhestitating support; and that we believe the
                        President finding his mild method of reconstruction has not been accepted in
                        the fraternal spirit in which it was conceived, but with defiance and
                        hostility, will coincide in the opinion already expressed that they cannot
                        safely be entrusted with the political rights which they forfeited by their
                        treason, until they have proven their acceptance of the results of the war,
                        by incorporating them in Constitutional provisions, and securing to all men
                        within their borders their inalienable right to life, liberty, and the
                        pursuit of happiness; that having conquered the rebellious States, they
                        should be held in subjection, and the treatment they are to receive and the
                        laws which are to govern them, should be referred to the lawmaking power of
                        the nation to which it legitimately belongs. </p>
                    <p>In the above resolution, although professing to give a hearty support to the
                        administration, on the great question of the restoration of the Union, the
                        policy the President has thought best to adopt is pronounced a failure, and
                        unworthy of the support of the people.</p>
                    <p>The resolution charges that the President's "mild method of re-constrution
                        has not been accepted in the fraternal spirit in which it was conceived, but
                        with defiance and hostility." This premises is manufactured for the
                        occasion, and the facts prove the reverse to be the true state of affairs in
                        the South. We have conversed, during the past week, with a number of our
                        most enterprising, observing and liberal-minded business men, of both
                        political parties, who have traveled extensively throughout the South since
                        the cessation of hostilities, and all agree that the lenient policy of the
                        President has been attended with the best results, and that it is accepted
                        by the people in the proper spirit. They go further, and give it as their
                        unhesitating opinion that the true policy of the Government is, to remove,
                        as speedily as possible, every hindrance which is place upon the prosperity
                        of the South, by a general amnesty to the people, and the withdrawal of the
                        confiscations schemes. This would at once restore the confidence and good
                        will of the people, revive the prosperity of the South, open a wide field
                        for Northern enterprise and capital, furnish an immense market for Norhtern
                        productions and manufactures, and better enable both North and South to
                        sustain the enormous burden of debt which war and fanaticism has imposed
                        upon us. An opposite policy will not only paralyze and prostrate the South,
                        but will also, in a corresponding degree cripple the north by diminishing
                        the market for her productions, and by the poverty of the South causing the
                        burden of taxation to fall the more heavily upon the people of the North. By
                        this policy only can we hope for a restoration of the Union, and allaying
                        the animosities engendered by war and kept alive by the radicals for
                        political purposes.</p>
                    <p>The concluding clause of the resolution is so clearly in violation of the
                        whole theory upon which our form of Government is based, that its adoption
                        only proves that the leaders of the Republican party do not desire a
                        restoration of the Union under the Constitution. It sets forth that, "having
                        conquered the rebellious States, they should be held in subjection, and the
                        treatment they are to receive and the laws which are govern them, should be
                        referred to the lawmaking power of the nation to which it legitimately
                        belongs." They would thus destroy every vestige of local government, of
                        State lines, and the reserved rights of the States, and hold the South as
                        one vast conquered province, with no laws except those made by Congress, and
                        no rights except such as might be conferred upon them by the radicals of the
                        North. The proposition is too absurd to bear a moments scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>The entire resolution shows that the party has no position left upon which to
                        plant itself and call upon the people for their support. It has lived by
                        agitation. Its leaders hoped for and endeavored to create a factious spirit
                        and rejection of the President's mild policy by the people of the South.
                        Failing in this, it endeavors to delude the people of the North into the
                        belief that the President's policy is a failure, by the deliberate
                        falsification of the real condition of affairs in the South. For this
                        purpose, to the use the language of Hon. Montgomery Blair, swarms of
                        hireling writers are sent over the South, most of them in the pay of the War
                        Department, whose continuance in the service depends on making the
                        impression that secession is not dead but sleepeth. On the reports of their
                        hireling writers, the platform of the radicals is based, and the Executive
                        is called upon to cast aside a successful policy, desregard the laws, and
                        overthrow our form of government in order to inflict punishment upon them.
                        Verily "whom the gods would destroy they first make mad."</p>

                    <p>DOYLESTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
                    <p>August 29th, 1865</p>
                    <p>
                        Messrs. Jacob Zeigler, William Bennett, Henry S. Mott,
                            Wm. V. McGrath and Robert L. Johnson, Committee;
                    </p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN--I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your letter of
                        the 25th instant, announcing my nomination as Democratic candidate for
                        Auditor General of the State. Although the position was not sought for by
                        me, I accept the nomination, and tender my thanks for the compliment thus
                        paid me. A decent respect for the opinion of the people of Pennsylvania,
                        whose suffrage is solicited, seems to require a frank statement of my views.</p>
                    <p>I was opposed to secession, even when simply a political dogma, advocated at
                        the hastings and the forum; which is proved by my subsequent conduct when it
                        had grown into armed insurrection.</p>
                    <p>I am opposed to negro suffrage, as every white man should be. Nature has
                        erected a barrier against the two races enjoying equal political rights in
                        the same community where they approximate in numbers as in the Southern
                        States. San Domingo is a good case in point to prove the incompatibility of
                        the two races exercising equal political privileges in harmony. There has
                        been almost perpetual warfare between the negroes and mulattoes since the
                        island has been in their possession; --which has been only a struggle for
                        the ruling influence between the pure African and the mixed blood. If this
                        people, of the same race, but of different caste, cannot govern a small
                        island in peace, what are we to suppose would be the condition of things
                        when the negro comes into competition with the pure Caucasian in the
                        struggle for empire in the South? The founders of our government intended
                        that the white should be the governing race in this country, and it will be
                        a calamitous day for both people when the black man is given the political
                        franchise, and entitled to hold office. I am opposed to any change in the
                        State Constitution in this respect; and deny to Congress all right whatever
                        to fix the qualification for suffrage in any State.</p>
                    <p>I am in favor of President Johnson's policy of restoring the States, lately
                        in rebellion, to their constitutional obligations. I cannot admit that their
                        ordinances of secession took any of them out of the Union.--For a time an
                        armed force interrupted their constitutional functions, but did not destroy
                        their identity as States. Hence the States, in their political
                        signification, not having been destroyed, they need no reconstruction, but
                        simply to be restored to their reciprocal rights and duties; when the Union
                        will be made whole as before. Whenever they shall send representatives to
                        Congress who are qualified by the Constitution, and the laws of the
                        respective States, there is no rightful power in body to refuse their
                        admission. I appreciate the peculiar and trying situation of the President,
                        and think he should be treated with forbearance by all parties. His plan of
                        restoration gives evidence that he does not intend to ignore the rights of
                        the States, and be led captive by the radical doctrine of consolidation.</p>
                    <p> The Convention did well to demand an immediate and complete restoration of
                        all civil rights in the loyal States. If there was an excuse for withholding
                        them in the days of actual rebellion, there certainly can be none now. You
                        say to the President firmly, but kindly, restore to the people the habeas corpus, and trial by jury, as fully as they
                        were enjoyed before the rebellion, and abolish military courts except for
                        the trial of persons in the military or naval service of the United States.
                        These things are granted to the people by the Constitution, and withholding
                        them violates it in spirit and in fact. When we ask that they be restored,
                        we only demand what belongs to us. </p>
                    <p>I am in favor of the most rigid system of economy in the administration of
                        public affairs. In view of the heavy taxation there should be retrenchment
                        in every possible way. All officers, civil and military, whose services a
                        state of peace does not absolutely require, should be dispensed with; and
                        our system of taxation should be so amended and equalized, that every man
                        will be obliged to bear his share of the public burden according to this
                        ability.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased that the Convention took action on the subject of equalizing the
                        bounties of soldiers. There is every reason why the patriotic men who
                        enlisted in 1861 and '62 should be placed on an equality with those who
                        enlisted at a later period. Should I be elected, whatever influence I may
                        possess, official or otherwise, will be exercised in obtaining justice for
                        the early defenders of the government. Whatever honor others may have
                        acquired in the contest just closed, the private soldier, who bore the heat
                        and burden of the day, will always remain the true hero of the war, and he
                        is entitled at all times, to our consideration and gratitude. My past
                        history is sufficient guarantee that I shall not overlook his claims. I
                        remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant, W.W.H. DAVIS</p>
                    <p>
                        <br>

                    <p>Letter of Col. John P. Linton</p>
                    <p> JOHNSTOWN, PA., AUGUST 29, 1865. <br> GENTLEMEN--Your favor of the 25th
                        inst., officially informing me of my nomination for Surveyor General "by the
                        Democratic State Convention, which assembled at Harrisburg on the 24th
                        inst.," has just been received. </p>
                    <p>Not only was this nomination unsought and unexpected on my part, but if I had
                        been consulted beforehand I would have urged my friends not to introduce my
                        name before the Convention. Any hesitation, however, in now accepting, might
                        be construed into a want of appreciation of the distinguished honor
                        conferred by the Convention, or a want of faith in the principles
                        promulgated by it. I certainly feel neither. The importance of the position
                        would have been my chief reason for not soliciting it, and the resolutions
                        adopted are but a practical application to existing exigencies of those
                        cardinal principles of Democracy which I have always conscienciously
                        maintained.</p>
                    <p>Accepting, therefore, this nomination and its responsibilities, I remain,</p>
                    <p> Yours truly <br> JNO. P. LINTON <br> To J. Zeigler, Wm. Bennett, Henry S.

<b>Local and Personal--Re-Arrest of Mengel Reed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The report condemns the decision made by the local authorities in Bedford
                    to arrest Mengel Reed for treason. Mengel was arrested, for a second time,
                    immediately following his acquittal as an accessory in the murder of Jacob
                    Crouse. The second charge made against Mengel was based upon his service in the
                    Confederate army, an accusation the Spirit alleges was exaggerated to prevent
                    him from testifying on behalf of his brother.<br>(Names in announcement:  Mengel Reed,  John P. Reed, Judge  King,  Samuel Shuck)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> After the Grand Jury failed to find a bill against Mengel Reed, he was
                        discharged by the Court, but some one having made information in the U.S.
                        District Court, against young Reed, he was arrested on the charge of Treason!!! The officers executing the warrant made
                        the arrest in the court-room whereupon Judge King took occasion to tell them
                        that they had no right to do so. Of course this arrest is a mere farce. By
                        some it is supposed to have been done to prevent Mengel from testifying upon
                        the trial of his brother. If it was right to arrest Mengel Reed, for
                        treason, because he was two days in the rebel army unwillingly, why did not the loyal patriots of this town, who
                        had this arrest made, also have Mr. Samuel Shuck's rebel relations lately on
                        a visit here, taken into custody on the same charge? The meanness of this
                        proceeding, was aggravated by the fact that it had been agreed between the
                        counsel for John P. Reed Jr., and the parties who had Mengel in charge, that
                        the latter should produce him in court next morning. But instead of doing
                        so, they hurried him off, on Wednesday morning, to parts unknown. </p>
