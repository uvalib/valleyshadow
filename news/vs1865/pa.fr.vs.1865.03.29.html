<b>Negro Equality--The Whole Thing Out</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on a debate among members of the US Congress about the meaning of
                    racial equality.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a late debate in the Senate of the United States, Mr. Sumner indicated
                        quite distinctly, that the object of himself and friends in their efforts in
                        behalf of the negro, will not cease till perfect equality is effected--hear
                        him:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson (Rep. Mo.) advocated the proposition, holding that both Houses
                        ought to admit the members from Louisiana, each without consulting the
                        other. In the course of Mr. Henderson's remarks a short dialogue took place
                        between him and Mr. Sumner. Mr. Henderson inquired of Mr. Sumner if he
                        believed the Southern States were out of the Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner (Rep. Mass.) said he did not. They had never been out of the
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson (Rep. Mo.) inquired if that was so, why not let Louisiana be
                        represented in Congress?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner replied because the government of that State had been subverted,
                        and there was really no government there now.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson said the loyal men of Louisiana had recognized the existing
                        government. Then why should not the Senator recognize it?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner (Rep. Mass.) said that when the loyal men, white and black,
                        recognized it, he would do so, not until then.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson (Rep. Mo.) Does the Senator from Massachusetts assert that
                        Congress has the right to interfere with the right of suffrage?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner replied that under the Constitution a Republican form of
                        government was guaranteed to the citizens of every State. It was the duty of
                        Congress to guarantee perfect and complete freedom from all oppression and
                        equality before the law to every man.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson said that if no State government was Republican in form that
                        did not permit negroes to vote, then the majority of the States in the Union
                        were not Republican in form, and Mr. Sumner ought to move for the exclusion
                        of the Senators from Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky,
                        Missouri and Maryland, and many other States. He (Mr. Sumner,) would have a
                        very small Union before he got through. While Mr. Henderson was speaking of
                        the rights reserved to the several States by the Constitution, Mr. Sumner
                        said: May I ask the Senator if he remembers the words of George Washington,
                        when he transmitted the Constitution of the United States to Congress, when
                        he undertook to declare the desire which the Federal Congress had nearest
                        its heart to see these States consolidated into one.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson--"The Union is consolidated," he said, "and that is the Union I
                        am in favor of."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner said the government in Louisiana that Mr. Henderson was in favor
                        of was an oligarchy, and he was opposed to any such thing as this. The
                        trouble in Louisiana was that all the loyal citizens were not allowed to
                        vote.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson--What does the Senator mean by all the loyal citizens?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner--All the blacks of that state.</p>

<b>Impending Battle</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the suppression of the rebellion depends on a successful
                    conclusion to the impending battle between Lee's and Grant's armies.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Before many days have passed a great battle, decisive in its results, will
                        have been fought, between the opposing armies of Grant and Lee. The
                        preliminaries are being rapidly arranged and the country stands spell-bound
                        with awe at its possible results. Silently but surely the storm is
                        gathering. Already is the breeze laden with the preliminary sounds of the
                        great contest about to begin, and before this article reaches our readers,
                        the battle may have been fought and won--or lost.</p>
                    <p>In our opinion, on the approaching campaign depends the complete success, or
                        the entire suppression of the rebellion, as a thing of magnitude. How
                        important is it then that no mistakes should be made by our Generals or
                        reverse sustained by the Union army in the initial contest. The immense
                        force now under the command of Gen. Grant would seem to dissipate any fears
                        which we might entertain as to any such result as a reverse, yet the past
                        history of the existing war admonishes us not to over sanguine, and that
                        defeat is not impossible. The army of the Union,
                        now on the banks of the James and South of Richmond, is the largest ever
                        marshalled [sic] on this Continent. Everything that the government, with its
                        immense resources, could do to render it invincible has been done; it has
                        been supplied with all the material of war required by its commanders; it is
                        composed of the best bone and muscle of the North, many of whom are the
                        veterans of a score of hard fought battles, and all equipped, drilled and
                        disciplined for the fight. And now, to-day, the equal of that grand army, we
                        are fully convinced, exists not on the face of the globe. The Lieutenant
                        General commanding this great army, is recognized, by all, as one of the
                        ablest commanders of the age, possessing in an eminent degree those rare
                        qualities which constitute the great military Chieftain. With such an army
                        thus ably commanded, and in a just and holy cause, can reverse or defeat be
                        within the bounds of possibility?</p>
                    <p>Of the numbers composing the army of General Lee we are in total ignorance,
                        but it is manifest to all that the rebel government has brought everything
                        to bear and strained its resources to the utmost to recruit the thinned
                        ranks of its armies, and to equip and supply them with everything necessary
                        to render them effective, in this last grand struggle. It is known too, that
                        in all former campaigns our armies were met by the rebels with full ranks,
                        well equipped and supplied, ably officered and ready for the fray. It is,
                        therefore, fair to presume that behind those earthworks, in its front, lies
                        an army of veterans, large in point of numbers, who will bring no discredit
                        on their past achievements.</p>
                    <p>Although we cannot be assured of success, let us
                        trust that our commander is thoroughly prepared for the conflict; that when
                        the fight begins our gallant men may not be driven to their deaths in
                        attempts to accomplish an impossible purpose, and that our leaders may prove
                        equal to the task before them. Victory to the Union arms and the defeat and
                        destruction of the army under Gen. Lee, must inevitably soon end this
                        terrible war and peace again bless with her smiles a distracted and
                        afflicted land. Defeat will just as surely prolong the contest to an
                        indefinite period, drenching our fertile plains with the life-blood of our
                        bravest and best, until the mutual exhaustion of the belligerent puts an end
                        to the contest.</p>

                    people of the United States" in the years thereafter.<br>(Names in announcement:  Patty Delaney,  Martin R. Delaney)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Many of our readers doubtless recollect "Old Patty Delaney" and her son
                        Martin, who came to this place from Virginia sometime about the year 1832,
                        and resided here for several years. This son Martin, who was only known here
                        as an insolent, impudent negro, has recently been appointed by the President
                        a regimental Surgeon, with the rank of Major, in the United States army.
                        This negro, as black as charcoal, is now superior in rank to any captain in
                        the service.</p>
                    <p>Delaney was born near Charlestown, Va., and came to this place with his
                        mother and after several years residence here went to Pittsburg [sic], where
                        he worked as a barber, bloodletter, cupper and leecher. Some years after he
                        resided there, he published a small weekly paper, which was marked by a
                        small share of ability, and circulated entirely among the negroes and
                        abolitionists of that vicinity. He occasionally delivered lectures, and
                        during the time the late Geo. M. Dallas was minister at London, Delaney made
                        his appearance there at a meeting of an International Congress, and was
                        introduced by Lord Brougham, when Mr. Dallas withdrew from the convention.
                        After his return to the United States, he engaged in the treasonable
                        conspiracy of the cut-throat John Brown, to excite a servile insurrection in
                        the South. He assisted to draw up the Constitution for the government of the
                        South after John Brown had liberated the slaves. After the failure of John
                        Brown's conspiracy, Delaney fled to Canada, where, along with the mulatto
                        Douglass, and other fugitive negroes, and traitorous Abolitionists, he was
                        engaged in other plots against the peace and safety of the people of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Such is a brief sketch of this full-blooded woolly-headed, jet black negro,
                        who has been elevated by Mr. Lincoln over the heads of the brave and gallant
                        captains in our country's service, who have fought and bled on many a hard
                        fought field, and who must now acknowledge, in this thick-lipped African, a
                        superior officer. Oh tempora, Oh mores!</p>
