<b>Alleged Swindle in the Oil Business</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article asserts that incidents of fraud have increased substantially
                    with the growth of the oil industry in Pennsylvania, as con men descend on the
                    state in search of easy riches.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Home of the of the numerous oil companies, which sprang up like mushrooms
                        during the past year or two, are getting into trouble. Some time ago,
                        several gentlemen engaged in that branch of speculation, were before the
                        courts in New York on charge of quite a number of dupes to the tune of
                        thousands, and recently some of the victims in Philadelphia have waked up to
                        the fact that they have been taken in and done for. Many of the companies
                        were the baldest kind of swindle-um-well company would, in a short time,
                        raise him to the position of a millionaire. The fondly cherished hopes of
                        speedy wealth are no passing away as the morning mist, and those who tempted
                        fortune by investing their hard earned cash in oil shares, are realizing the
                        fact that they have been overreached, and that they will see their money
                        again-no more forever.</p>
                    <p>Since the thing has been brought into the courts it may be expected that a
                        number of these swindles will be thoroughly ventilated, and such a rattling
                        of dry bones, as there will be among the oil stock operators, will astonish
                        the natives.</p>
                    <p>As a specimen of the way things have been done, we give the following
                        developments made at a hearing before Alderman Beitler in Philadelphia, a
                        few days ago, which we clip from the Bulletin. A
                        perusal of which will be quite refreshing to those of our citizens who have
                        invested in "ile," particularly that part of it in relatition where the
                        dividends came from: </p>
                    <p>George H. Ashton, President; Fred. E. Swope, Treasurer; and T.R. Serrill, E.
                        B. Harper, S. C. Hansey and John V. Barton, Directors of the Atlas Oil
                        Company, charged with making a false statement in the prospectus, had a
                        further hearing yesterday before Alderman Beitler.</p>
                    <p>P. W. Wiltbankds, the Secretary of the company was examined among other
                        witnesses, and made some interesting and rich developments. He says: "The
                        Atlas Oil Company, I believe, owns one-sixth of the interest in the Jersey
                        well; it is nearly all paid for; he price was $190,000; I think $120,000 has
                        been paid; there was an agreement in writing; the original is in the hands
                        of the company's attorney (a copy was produced); by that agreement $100,000
                        was to have been paid on the 7th of October, 1864; $100,000 within twenty
                        days thereafter, and $100,000 in forty days; I think that the first and
                        second instalment were paid; I am not sure about the second; the company
                        never received any oil from the Jersey well; there were $100,000 shares of
                        stock issued; the corporators paid $1.50 per share; the corporators took all
                        the stock; the company then sold it to subscribers at $2.50 per share; when
                        parties came to the office I told them it was in the company's stock, and
                        not the corporators; about 20,000 shares were sold at $2..58 per share, and
                        the money was divided among the corporators.</p>
                    <p>The company was divided into 50 corporate interests of 6,000 shares, each
                        being entitled to hold 4,000 shares, making a total of 200,000 shares at
                        $300,000; don't know of any stock being issued which was not paid for; heard
                        of some; think it was 12,000 shares; it was to have been issued by the
                        Treasurer; the dividends were paid out of the money put into the treasury to
                        pay for the Jersey well; there were three dividends, amounting to $45,000,
                        declared; the fifty acres not mentioned in the prospectus is 500 yards from
                        Cherry Run, and is not described; it is more than a mile and half from the
                        Reed well, and is not bottom land; George H. Ashton, the President, received
                        dividends upon 21,600 shares-10,6000 in his own name, and 11,000 as trustee;
                        he originally owned 16,000 shares, which he got at $1.50 per share; don't
                        believe that over 4,000 of Ashton's shares were sold in the office; Serrill
                        and other of the defendants originally held 6,000 shares; at the first
                        dividend Serrill had none; Harker had 5,333 shares originally; at the first
                        dividend he had none; Barton held 4,000 shares; at the dividend he had
                        3,450; Swope had no stock when the first dividend was declared; he had a
                        great deal originally; I think about 20,000 shares.</p>

                    <p>The Philadelphia papers announce that a large number of counterfeit $20
                        greenbacks are in circulation in that city. They closely resemble the
                        genuine. 50s and 100s the same. 5s photographed, paper stiffer than the
                        genuine, and not so good. They have a blurred appearance, while the
                        signature show through more plainly than on the good note. 10s altered from
                        1s; vig. On upper left oval portrait of Chase, 10 below it; 10 on the upper
                        right; the signature of both Register and Treasurer are on the lower right
                        corner; they are well done and calculated to deceive the unwary; although

                        are both on the right end, with two stripes of lath between them. 1s,
                        imitation of genuine. The green ink is somewhat lighter than the genuine;
                        some parts of the note are scratched. The head of Chase is darker. The bill
                        has a coarse appearance. 2s altered from 1s; portrait of Chase on upper left

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"A swindler, named Patterson, it appears, has been recently operating in
                    Lancaster county, pretending to be sutherland to collect money for the poor of
                    this place. The Lancaster Express gives the following
                    account of his operation:"<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For some time past, the citizens of Manor township had reason to suspect that
                        a person calling himself Patterson, who was collecting money to that
                        township ostensibly for the relief of the Chambersburg poor, was an
                        imposter, and, accordingly, A. R. Witmer, Esq., set to work to ascertain
                        whether this man was an authorized agent to collect money for these
                        unfortunate people. He succeeded, after much difficulty, as the sequel will
                        show, in establishing the fact, beyond a doubt, that he was a swindler.
                        Patterson called on Mr. John H. Hershey, about the 25th of September, having
                        previously been collecting about Columbia. He had certificates signed by the
                        Cashier or President, or both, of Chambersburg Bank, the Prothonotary,
                        Sheriff, Judges of Court, and other public men of Franklin county, stating
                        that he was authorized by a committee there to collect for the suffering
                        poor of that place. Patterson is resident of Fawn township, York county,
                        where he owns property, but represented that he was from Chambersburg. Mr.
                        Hershey, who formerly resided in York county, said: "You are Bill Patterson
                        that I used to know in York county." Patterson answered: "No, I never lived
                        in York county, I live in Maryland." He, however, made no attempt to collect
                        more money in the neighborhood. He boasted after he went home, that he had
                        collected $600, in Manor township. He was so independent that he would not
                        take less than $5, in some instances. In other cases, where he was refused,
                        he wold afterards put down $5 or more to mislead others and induce
                        subscriptions. Several persons who had paid him money laid the matter before
                        A. R. Witmer, Esq., Justice of the Peace, who took means to ferret out the
                        matter, and delivered that Patterson still resided in York county; upon
                        which he issued a warrant for his arrest, had it backed by a Justice in York
                        county, and placed in the hands of J. B. Hess, the constable of Martie
                        township, for execution.-Mr. Hess proceeded to the village of Gatcheiville,
                        York county, where Patterson resides, on the 23 inst., and made the arrest.
                        Patterson professed to be able and willing to show that all was right, and
                        produced the certificate from the public men of Chambersburg, above referred
                        to, which Mr. Hess read and said he would keep; when Patterson snatched it
                        from him and a scuffle ensued. This took place in Patterson's house, and
                        Patterson's wife, two daughters and two sons, young men, coming to the
                        rescue, he finally got loose from the constable and ran for a thicket near
                        by, pursued by Mr. Hess, who tired three barrels of his revolver at him, and
                        he thinks hit him once, if not oftener; but his speed was too great to be
                        overtaken, and he got into the woods and made his escape.</p>
                    <p>It appears that there is a respectable man named Wm. Patterson in
                        Chambersburg, and who had authority to collect money for the sufferers , and
                        this man ascertaining this fact, forged the certificate referred to above
                        and personated the authorized collector.</p>
                    <p>A reward of $50 is offered for the arrest of Mr. Patterson.</p>
                    <p>We would say to our Lancaster county friends, that there is no "respectable
                        man named Wm. Patterson in Chambersburg, who had authority to collect money
                        for the sufferers, nor is any person authorized
                        to collect money for any such purpose, at this time. If the Legislature, the
                        coming session, do an act of simple justice to our citizens by indemnifying
                        them for losses sustained through the public enemy, our people will be
                        abundantly able to take care of themselves, without appealing to the charity
                        of citizens of other portions of the commonwealth.</p>
