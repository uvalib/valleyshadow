                    <p>THE REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION.</p>
                    <p>The Republican State Convention which has just come to an end at Harrisburg,
                        was composed of the odds and ends of all the political organizations that
                        ever flourished in this Commonwealth. Radicals, Free Soilers, Humanitarians,
                        Free Lovers, Know Nothings and renegade Democrats made up the body which
                        selected the ticket, and announced the platform of the Republican party in
                        Pennsylvania for the coming contest. Simon Cameron was there with Kelley's
                        letter plastered on his back: Thaddeus Stevens with his life long hostility
                        to the Union and the Constitution occupied a prominent position; John W.
                        Forney, who one day supports the reorganizing policy of the President, and
                        the next is with the radicals, had a hand in the proceeedings; Gov. Curtin,
                        who is scheming and toiling for a seat in the Senate of the United States,
                        put in his oar and helped to speed the boat; John Cessna crawled in and out
                        and left his slimy track on everything, while minor politicians emitted
                        their rush light radiance and then sank into their original obscurity. In
                        all that convention there was not a single representative Pennsylvania man,
                        no one whom even the Republican party would be willing to endorse save for
                        mere partisan tricks and scheming--not one of the leaders of the convention
                        has ever done honor to the Keystone State by his public virtue or left the
                        impress of his talents upon her history or legislation in such a way as to
                        command the admiration and esteem of the intelligent and the good. Not one
                        of these men who have presumed to express the sentiments of even the
                        Republicans of this State, is competent by the elevation of his moral nature
                        to understand the duties of the present hour in relation to the restoration
                        of the civil relations between the States of the Union. They are but
                        partisan sharpers, who cheat and juggle, and throw with loaded dice, while
                        the country is suffering, and the people are calling for honest, open action
                        in favor of conciliation and reorganization.</p>
                    <p>As for the resolutions of this convention they, like the pantaloons of the
                        clown in the circus, have a different color for front and rear. One side is
                        for Radical, the other for conservative admiration. Thus, for instance, the
                        third resolution is said to endorse the restoration policy of the President.
                        But does it do this? Look at the resolution:</p>
                    <p> 3d. Resolved. That the mild and generous method
                        of reconstruction offered by the President to the people lately in
                        rebellion, in the judgment of this convention, has not been accepted ina
                        spirit of honest loyalty and gratitude, but with such evidences of defiance
                        and hostility as to impel us to the conviction that they cannot be safely
                        entrusted with the political rights which they rejected by their treason,
                        until they have proven their acceptance of the results of the war, and
                        incorporated them in constitutional provisions, securing to all men within
                        their borders their inalienable rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of
                        happiness. </p>
                    <p> This resolution, while declaring that the policy of reorganization suggested
                        by the President is "mild and generous," does not approve of it, or of the
                        method by which reconstruction is sought to be effected in the late revolted
                        States. That is not endorsing the plan of the
                        President any more than saying that a note is properly drawn up would be
                        endorsing the note. The Republican party of Pennsylvania has refused to put
                        its name upon the back of the North Carolina proclamation of Andrew Johnson,
                        and that is repudiating his policy and accepting that of the Chase radicals,
                        who declare for negro suffrage in all the Southern States, or no restoration
                        of the Union. Such is the real position of the Republican party in
                        Pennsylbania as officially declared by their State Convention, and the
                        people must be prepared to pass judgment upon it at the polls. </p>
                    <p>The fourth resolution proves that the Republican organization in this State
                        is entirely in the hands of the radicals. It is as follows:</p>
                    <p>4th. Resolved. That, having conquered the rebellious States, they should be
                        held in subjugation, and the treatment they are to receive, and the laws
                        which are to govern them, should be referred to the law-making power of the
                        nation, to which they legitimately belong.</p>
                    <p> How can this resolution be squared with the reorganization policy of the
                        President? The North Carolina proclamation speaks of the States as States under the Consitution. This resolution
                        declares them "subjected" States. The North Carolina proclamation declares
                        that the "laws in force previous to the passage of the so-called ordinance,
                        of "secession" shall continue in force until others are enacted by the
                        elected Representatives of the people. This resolution announces the
                        despotic dogma that the law-making power of the nation" should invade the States and enact all the local laws by
                        which they are to be governed. The carrying out of this doctrine would
                        subordinate every State in the Union to the will of the partisan majority in
                        Congress, and put our government on a level with those of the most despotic
                        kingdoms of the old world. yet such the Republican State Convention of
                        Pennsylvania has pledged the party to support. How can this be called an
                        endorsement of the reorganization policy of the President? </p>
                    <p> We need go no farther into the recorded acts and expressions of the
                        Republican Convention to prove that the party is placed by its
                        representatives upon the most radical platform. To be sure they did not
                            openly endorse negro equality, but the
                        concluding clause of the third resolution is radical enough in its
                        suggestions to cover the whole ground. They will lose no radical votes on
                        that issue. The only question is, will the people of the old Keystone State
                        approve by their votes this attack upon the only policy by which the States
                        can be reorganized in accordance with the principles of our government, and
                        peace and prosperity be speedily returned to the nation. The Republican
                        party have put partisan success, the retention of political power, above
                        patriotism, above the perpetuity of a free form of government, and upon this
                        issue the people of Pennsylvania are called to decide at the coming State
                        election. --Age</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Col. H.S. Olcott, who writes us a letter eleswhere published, is one of the
                        "nine officers, twenty servants, one phonographer and thrity-four horses,"
                        who compose the Doubleday court martial--he being a colonel on detective
                        business of the War Department. We shall briefly answer his points.</p>
                    <p>I. If the expenses of the Doubleday court martial are paid out of the amount
                        reserved from Cozzens contract, who pays the expenses of the United States
                        Circuit and District Courts, in Philadelphia, and the further expenses of
                        officers in the army, who are doing work which these "nine officers, twenty
                        servants, one phonographer and thirty-four horses," should be doing?</p>
                    <p>II. According to Col. Olcott, the govenrment makes enough out of Cozzens to
                        pay the court. If there were no court would not all this be clear gain? The
                        money goes and no adequate return comes from it; and so far as debt and
                        unnecessary expense are concerned, it might as well be in Cozzens pocket as
                        in that of the court. The money most certainly does not go to the Treasury,
                        where it belongs.</p>
                    <p> III. Col. Olcott explains Judge Thompson's decision. That decision was
                        plain. Cozzens was arrested "by order of the Secretary of War," and
                        discharged by the Secretary in deference to the gathering wrath of
                        Pennsylvania. There was no appeal to arms, for the War Secretary showed
                        great discretion. Col. Olcott intimates that any future habeas corpus will be "resisted with arms." Colonel, you are
                        mistaken as well as injudicious in such an intimation. Not a musket will be
                        raised against the writ. The pepole have had enough of musketry. </p>
                    <p>IV. As to the item of forage, to which Col. Olcott objects, we cannot amend
                        it. --We have better evidence than that of a correspondent. This forage is
                        allowed; and when a government allowance is made, the officers always find
                        some way of drawing it. The only way to controvert our bill is to send us
                        the court pay-roll.</p>
                    <p> We have now answered Col. Olcott's statements, and in doing so, the labored
                        defense of the Press in reply to the Tribune. But Col. Olcott and the Press make this mistake: We do not attack the
                        Doubleday court martial, but the whole system of
                            military courts assembling in peaceful States and presuming to
                        administer justice. We take that court as an example to show the people the
                        folly of the practice. The anxiety of the members of this court--their
                        extreme sensitiveness about the just and dispassionat comments of the Tribune--can only be accounted for on the law of
                        nature, which makes the barnacle cling to the ship, or the reptile to the
                        blood yielding body. We do not assail them, but the system, of which they
                        are, we had always hoped, obedient but unwilling members. Court martial pay
                        is good, and the work easy, and (particularly in Thompson's baiiiwick) there
                        is no harm to be dreaded. But it is expensive and absurd. Let the War
                        Department put its "nine officers, twenty servants, one phonographer and
                        thirty-four horses," at soma war duty, or muster them out of the service.
                        The Press reminds us that these officers are
                        gallant, and some of them have been wounded. Granted. But there are ten
                        thousand other soldiers quite as gallant and as severely wounded. Must they
                        be made into court martials? If these courts are to be made into military
                        hospitals or "Homes," let it be announced, and we shall not say nay. As the
                        whole business stands now, it is a scandal--an extravagance and an
                        absurdity. Try a man 140 days; spend $20,675.83 in the work, and have him
                        released in spite of your power-- and then go on and try another man, who
                        will probably cost another $20,000 and be released. If Col. Olcott or the
                        Press can match this in rare humor, we should like to see it. It certainly
                        is very funny, and we would be glad to enjoy it; but unfortunately, it cost
                        so much, and looks absurd, even if it were not mischievous. </p>

<b>Great Excitement in Clark County, Indiana--Indignation Against The Negroes</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the past two days there has been considerable excitement in Clark county,
                        Indiana, caused by the attempt on the part of negroes to commit a most
                        damnable outrage upon the person of an old and respected lady of the county.
                        Within the past two months the recurrences of outrages of this kind in the
                        border counties of Kentucky and Indiana have been of frequent occurrence,
                        and so intense has been the feelings of the citizens against this class of
                        persons, that many of them have been compelled to leave their houses to
                        escape summary punishment, for if they had been captured they would no doubt
                        have been hung on the first tree.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning the body of a negro was found on the Charlestwon road,
                        about 400 yards from where the outrage was committed. At the time our
                        informant left the excitement was intense, and there was no telling what
                        might be the result--a mob against the negroes being anticipated.</p>
                    <p> At latest accounts the negroes were fleeing from Evansville in all
                        directions, being fearful of being killed by the citizens. --The citizens
                        beat them wherever they can reach them, and they seem determined, since the
                        brutal outrage of two negroes upon the person of a white lady on Sunday, to
                        rid the city entirely of them. On Monday night a crowd made a rush for the
                        steamer Carrie to clean out the negroes, but fortunately they were non est. The wildest excitement prevailed when the
                        Lady Grace left there. She arrived here yesterday, and reports that the
                        negroes are scared almost out of their wits. They are coming away in boats
                        and taking to the woods. We hope nothing serious will occur. </p>
                    <p>LATER</p>
                    <p> We learn that the military authorities were attempting to put a stop to the
                        proceedings of the mob. Several negroes have been killed
                            or hung, and an order has been issued compelling all the negroes

                    <p>"This body adjourned last evening, and most of the delegates have left the
                        city. --The principal portion of the afternoon session was devoted to the
                        delivery of addresesin favor of educating the negroes of the South--"the
                        new--born children of the nation" as one of the speakers styled them--and
                        preparing them for good citizenship and for the exercise of the social and
                        polit-rights which they are destined to enjoy in the future, in common with
                        all other citizens. One speaker asserted that there could be no successful
                        or permanent reconstruction of the Union that did not include the extension
                        of a system of popular education throughout the Southern States, and a
                        thorough education of the negro masses, as well as a recognition of their
                        claims to citizenship and the full exercise of the rights and priveileges to
                        which they were justly entitled. Both speakers indulged in severe
                        denunciations of the slaveholding aristocrats and the poor "white trash" of
                        the South, recognized the negro as their superior, and glorified him as
                        worthy of being elevated to a social equality with white men and capable of
                        being educated to an intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage. Two
                        "American citizens of African descent," who occupied seats among the
                        spectators were solicited to sit as honorary members of the association, and
                        one of them was invited to deliver an address, which invitation was
                        accepted. The venerable representative of the African element was received
                        with cordial hand-shaking and escorted to the stand amidst enthusiastic
                        applause. He spoke for about five minutes, and we must confess that his
                        remarks were less fanatical and his language more polished than some of the
                        white speakers who preceded him.</p>

                        of the speakers were of the same ultra and fanatical character as those
                        previously enunciated, and which stamped the convention as a
                        negro-social-equality and negro suffrage assemblage, got together under
                        false pretenses by a set of Yankee agitators who controlled all its

<b>An Eastern Drug</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>

                    narcotic he experimented with while traveling through Arabia.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Bayard Taylor relates the following amusing anecdote in his own experience in
                        Arabia: While in Arabia I had a very remarkable experience. There is a drug
                        in the East whose effect is like that of opium; it is prepared from the
                        Indian hemp. It is much used by the Saracen warriors when about to enter a
                        battle, as a stimulus. It produces the imagination of a double
                        consciousness; one part of the mind seems to study while the other looks on.
                        From motives of curiousity, I was persuaded to try the effects of it on my
                        system. I was in Damascus at the time. Soon after taking the drug, the
                        effect of it began to appear. I saw the furniture in the room, talking with
                        the company, and yet I seemed to be near the pyramid of Cheops, whose blocks
                        of stone appeared to be like huge squares of Virginia tobacco. The scene
                        changed, and I was on the desert in a boat of mother of pearl. The sand
                        seemed grains of gold, though my boat run as easily as on the waves of the
                        sea; the air seemed filled with harmonies of the sweetest music; the
                        atmosphere was filled with odors and music. Before me seemed to be a
                        constant arcade of rainbows through which, for fifteen years, I seemed to
                        glide. The finer senses were developed, and all gratifications was a single
                        harmonious sensation. Hence we can easily conceive the origin of the Arabian
                        Nights; My companion, a huge Kentuckian, tried the drug with amusing effect.
                        After looking at me for a while, he started up with the exclamation, "I'm a
                        locomotive," and began to cut off his words like the puff of an engine, and
                        work like the moving of the wheels. At last he seized the water jug for a
                        drink, but set it down with a yell, saying, "how can I take in water into my
                        boiler when I am letting off steam?"</p>

                    <p>The Democratic State Convention which assembled at Harrisburg on Thursday
                        last did its work well and faithfully. The candidates presented by it for
                        the suffrages of the people of the State are known throughout its borders as
                        two of the bravest of the many gallant Pennsylvanians who rushed to arms in
                        defence of an imperilled nationality. The Convention acted wisely, in
                        selecting from the number of competent gentlemen named for the respective
                        offices to be filled those who, in addition to all requisite qualifications
                        of integrity, honesty and capacity, have so well and faithfully served their
                        country on the field of battle. The nominations are such as we can most
                        heartily endorse and support, and we shall to the extent of our ability,
                        labor assiduously to bring about their triumphant election. The resolutions
                        embrace the true and time-honored principles of the party, and were adopted
                        unanimously with much enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>Col. W.W.H. Davis was born in Bucks county where he now resides, and he is a
                        son of Gen. John Davis, of that county, whose name is familiar to the people
                        of the State. He received his education at, and graduated from the Military
                        Academy at Norwich, and was shortly thereafter appointed Professor of
                        Mathematics and Military instructor at the Military Academy of Portsmouth,
                        Va., in which position he remained for a period of two years, when he
                        resigned and returned to his native county, studied law and was admitted to
                        practice. On the breaking out of the war with Mexico, he enlisted in a
                        regiment then being raised by Hon. Caleb Cushing, was made Adjutant of the
                        regiment, and served with efficiency during the war; participating in all
                        the great battles in that country, which shed so much lustre upon the
                        American arms. He was rewarded for his gallantry by promotion to a
                        Captaincy.</p>
                    <p>In 1853 he was appointed by President Pierce, District Attorney for the
                        Territory of New Mexico. In 1854 he was appointed Secretary of State for
                        that Territory and was acting Governor and Superintendent of Indian affairs
                        until 1857 when he resigned.</p>
                    <p> Of the career of Col. Davis, since the breaking out of the rebellion, we
                        take from the Patriot and Union the following
                        sketch: When the rebellion commenced, in 1861, Colonel Davis immediately
                        volunteered his services, and raised the first armed man
                            in his native county and congressional district. With a company
                        of eighty (80) men he immediately marched to Harrisburg, joined the 25th
                        Pennsylvania regiment, and served throughout the three months campaign in
                        the army of the Upper Potomac, commanded by Major General Patterson. At the
                        expiration of his term of service in September 1861 he was mustered out, and
                        returning to Bucks county, immediately raised a regiment of infantry, 104th
                        Pa., and a six gun battery, under special instructions from the War
                        Department. On the 1st of November, 1861, he proceeded to Washington with
                        his regiment, and was immediately placed in command of a brigade, from which
                        time he continued in active service (except when disabled by his wounds)
                        until the 1st of October, 1864, when he was mustered out, by reason of the
                        expiration of his term of service. </p>
                    <p>His gallant regiment served one year in the Army of the Potomac and was
                        afterwards transferred to the Army of North Carolina, then to South
                        Caroliina. Colonel D. commanded a brigade or division during the greater
                        part of three years. He was severely wounded by a rifle ball in the left
                        elbow at the terrible battle of Fair Oaks, and was also shot in the left
                        breast by a spent ball at the same engagement. The Colonel participated in
                        all the operations before Charleston, commanding a brigade or division
                        during the entire period.</p>
                    <p>From the first day of January to the 1st of April, he had command of the
                        siege operations on Morris Island directed against Charleston, having under
                        his command a division of three brigades, and in July 1864, at the battle of
                        John's Island, S.C., his right hand was carried away by a shell. --While
                        serving in the Department of the South Colonel Davis had, at different
                        periods, command of Folly Island, Beaufort and the District of Hilton Head.
                        The colors of his regiment, now among the archives of the Commonwealth, bear
                        the names of Yorktown, Lee's Mills, Chickahominy, Savage Station, Fair Oaks,
                        Seven Pines, White Oak Swamp, Carter's Hill, James Island, Morris Island,
                        seige of Charleston, and John's Island.</p>
                    <p>Col. John P. Linton, the candidate for Surveyor General, is a citizen and
                        native of Cambria county; a lawyer by profession, honest, upright, and a
                        fair specimen of the incorruptible Democracy of that mountain region. From
                        the same paper we learn of him that in 1861, when the war was [unclear] upon
                        the country, he was a lieutenant of a holiday volunteer company. Mainly
                        through his efforts the organization was retained, the company recruited to
                        the maximum number, and, upon the declination of other officers, he was
                        unanimously proclaimed captain. With his company he faithfully served during
                        the three months' campaign.</p>
                    <p>At the termination of the three months' campaign, Cols. Linton, Campbell and
                        McDermott at once recruited a regiment, (th 54th and the officers were soon
                        after, in August, 1861, commissioned as follows: Colonel, Jacob M. Campbell;
                        (Republican candidate for Surveyor General;) Lieutenant Colonel, Bernard
                        McDermott; (one of the soldiers of the war with Mexico;) Major, John P.
                        Linton. Subsequently Col. McDermott resigned on account of ill health,
                        which, on February 1st, 1863, advanced Major Linton to the position of
                        Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
                    <p>The regiment was immediately assigned to duty the along Baltimore &amp;
                        Ohio Railroad. During the whole of the early period of the war when the
                        mouth of the Shenandoah Valley was the scene of constant alarms and raids,
                        the 54th Regiment was stretched as a cordon of protection to the lower tier
                        of Pennsylvania counties. We have not time nor space in this article to
                        follow the regiment through its later history; this will afford matter for
                        subsequent articles. It is sufficient to say that after about two years of
                        detached service, the regiment was ordered to take part in the active
                        operations up the Valley. During most of this latter and more active period
                        of service, Colonel Campbell was away from the regiment--in temporary
                        command of a division or brigade, it is stated--so that Col. Linton had the
                        honor of leading the 54th in the battles of Newmarket and Piedmont. And most
                        bravely and gallantly he led his regiment on those disastrous fields. In
                        both those battles he was severely wounded.</p>
                    <p>When the 54th was subsequently ordered to the front, before Petersburg, Col.
                        Linton, we believe, still retained direct command and again led his men in
                        those hard-fought engagements which proved so disastrous to that gallant old
                        regiment.</p>
                    <p> Such, Fellow Democrats, are the men who have been chosen by the convention
                        of our party as the standard bearers in the conquest about to commence. They
                        are men of capacity, honest, upright and withal brave and true, who shrunk
                        not from the post of danger at the call of their country and whose scarred
                        bodies attest the patriotism of as noble a pair of Democrats as ever lived.
                        They deserve well of their country. They compose a white
                            man's ticket on a white man's platform. See to it then, that such
                        a majority be rolled up for them on the second Tuesday of October next as
                        will forever dismay the advocates of the detestable doctrine of negro
                        suffrage. </p>

                    <p>It is the current talk in Wall street that preparations are maturing for an
                        organized pressure on Congress to modify the national banking law, and
                        enlarge the amount of currency permitted to be issued under it. With a
                        currency so redundant that gold is at a premium of forty-four percent, this
                        project is absurd. The arguments in its favor are, that so much of the
                        currency authorized by the existing law has been issued to the banks in some
                        of the states, that an equal apportionment is no longer possible without an
                        enlargement of the total amount and that a great vacum exists in the
                        Southern States into which the exhausted fountain cannot flow without
                        replenishment.</p>
                    <p>We are against this scheme for the further robbery of the laboring classes,
                        and the further enriching of speculators; against it whether the facts
                        alleged are true, or whether they are false. Unless there has been
                        malversation by the Secretary of the Treasury, they cannot be true, in and
                        such sense as to require the authorization of more currency. By the law as
                        it stands, one-half of the whole amount authorized was to be distributed
                        among national banks organized in the several States and territories in the
                        ratio of population, and the other half according to the wealth and
                        commercial wants of particular localities ar determined by the discretion of
                        the Secretary of the Treasury. If the Secretary has done his duty, according
                        to his oath, he has reserved for each of the Southern States its proportion
                        of the one-half, together with a discretionary reservation for the
                        prospective wants of New Orleans, Charleston, and other commercial centres.
                        If he has not done this, it will be the duty of Congress to appoint a
                        committee of investigation, and arraign him for malfeasance; if he has the
                        pretexts for enlargement are false.</p>
                    <p>The paramount need of the country, and especially of the laboring masses, is
                        a curtailment of the currency, which will so bring down the prices of
                        commodities as to enable them to save part of their earnings, and make their
                        savings safe when lent out at interest or invested. At present, they can,
                        with the utmost industry and self-denial, save but little, and that little
                        melts away under an expanding currency, like a chunk of ice on a sun-heated
                        side-pavement, Some three months ago, gold was down to 125, and we seemed
                        fairly in the way to a sound currency. But it is now upward of 145, with the
                        prospect of a still further rise. It is by taking advantage of such
                        fluctuations in the value of money, that sharpers and speculators acquire
                        sudden riches; and every dollar that they make comes out of the earnings of
                        labor.</p>
                    <p>Let us illustrate the operation of our unstable currency by a simple example,
                        intelligible to every laboring man. If three months ago, when gold was 125,
                        a frugal laborer had but $100 in a savings bank, the interest at 5 per cent,
                        the usual rate of such institutions, would be one dollar and twenty-five
                        cents. The principal when he lent it was worth $80 in gold; and now when it
                        has been on interst three months, the principal and interest together amount
                        to less than $71 in gold, making a dead loss of $9 in gold or 13 in our
                        present currency. It is in this way that the people are robbed of the fruits
                        of their labor.</p>
                    <p>We protest against all schemes for the further dilution of the currency. A
                        fluctuating representative of values is demoralizing to the business
                        classes, and ruinous to the honest laboring masses. Mr. Webster, more than
                        thirty years ago, described, with his habitual vigor of statement, the
                        operation of so inflated, fluctuating currency. What he understood so
                        clearly from history and philosophy, we unhappily know from observation and
                        bitter experience. We command his impressive language to the earnest
                        attention of the industrious classes; we ask them to mark, as from their own
                        knowledge they can, the truth of its representations.</p>
                    <p> "The very man," said Mr. Webster, "of all others, who has the deepest
                        interest in a sound currency and who suffers most by mischievous legislation
                        in money matters, is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil. A
                        depreciated currency, changes of prices, paper money falling between morning
                        and noon, and falling still lower between noon and night--these things
                        constitute the very-harvest time of speculators, and of the whole race of
                        those who are at once idle and crafty; and of that other race, too, the
                        Catalines, of all times, marked, so as to be known forever by one stroke of
                        the historians pen, men greedy of other men's property and prodigal of their
                        own. Capitalists may outlive such times. They may either prey on the
                        earnings of labor by their cent, per cent, or they may hoard. But the
                        laboring man--what can he hoard? Preying on
                        nobody, he becomes the prey of all. --His property is in his hands. His
                        reliance, his fund, his productive freehold, his all, is his labor. Whether
                        he works on his own small capital or another's, his living is still earned
                        by his idustry; and when the money of the country becomes depreciated and
                        debased, whether it be adulterated coin or paper without credit, that
                        industry is robbed of its reward. "He then labors for a
                            country whose laws cheat him out of his bread."</p>
                    <p>How forcibly expressed! and how true! the laboring masses have great reason
                        to complain of taxation; of its burdensome impositions and its unequal
                        distribution. --But what are taxes in comparison to this legalized robbery?
                        The people expected the close of the war would bring deliverance, or at
                        least an apporach towards deliverance. but instead of tapering to a point,
                        the evil is enlarging, and a herd of speculators are planning and contriving
                        to make it worse and worse. But even apart from their contrivances, its has
                        been for three months of peace, and, as we are told, of reduced
                        expenditures, growing steadily worse. It is the most oppressive of all the
                        inflictions to which a government can subject the great mass of the people.
                        The government cannot lock them all up in military prisons. It cannot hang
                        or shoot them all without trial by jury. If it taxes heavily and even
                        unequally people can make some calculation of what they will be compelled to
                        pay. But when the dollar shrinks, in time of peace, at the rate of forty per
                        cent, per annum, and nobody can foresee its future fluctuations, and this
                        for the benefit, not of the government, but of speculators, it is next to
                        intolerable. When, oh when are we to have a sound, honest, Democratic
                        currency, that does not rob the people of their hard earnings.</p>
