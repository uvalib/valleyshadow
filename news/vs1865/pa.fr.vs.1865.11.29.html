<b>Jamaica and the South</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Using the rebellion in Jamaica as its example of how emancipation can go
                    terribly awry, the article argues for the implementation of a forceful

                    <p>We have no disposition to drag the unhappy occurrences which are now taking
                        place in Jamaica unnecessarily, and as it were, by the ears, into the
                        discussion of American politics. But one lesson of the present terrible
                        outbreak in Jamaica seems to us so timely, and so important in its relations
                        with the commercial, practical, and therefore non-political aspect of our
                        own national affairs, that we cannot properly pass it over in silence. It
                        will hardly be contended, we presume, by any but the most extreme advocates
                        of chattel slavery, that the negroes of Jamaica, after thirty years of
                        freedom, are less fitted to be left to-day in a condition of uncertainty as
                        to the constitution of authority under which they live than the negroes of
                        the South, in whose ears the accents of the Proclamation of Emancipation
                        have as yet scarce died away. Nevertheless, we see that disputes arising in
                        Jamaica over petty questions of local administration have led the negroes in
                        that island into excesses of violence and frenzy and brutality most horrible
                        in themselves, most fatal to the industry of the colony, and most
                        compromising to the fortunes and the future of their own unfortunate race.</p>
                    <p>Should not this teach reflecting men to understand the paramount importance
                        to our own national peace and prosperity of the most rapid possible
                        reconstruction of a regular civil authority at the South? The anxiety which
                        President Johnson is known to feel on this subject may very fitly be
                        supposed to originate in his own knowledge of the negro character, and in
                        his thorough appreciation of the actual state of affairs in the lately
                        rebellious Sates.</p>
                    <p>While the war lasted, and the authority of the so-called "Confederate States"
                        was paramount at the South, the negroes were quiet and orderly, because they
                        were still in a recognized condition of slavery. Throughout the vast regions
                        which remained to the end unvisited by our troops there was no radical
                        disturbance of the settled and ancient order of things. The negro
                        populations remained under the moral, even where they ceased to be
                        absolutely under the material, control of the institutions amid which they
                        had had grown up from infancy. Now all this is changed. Everywhere
                        throughout the South slavery has ceased to be; and the negroes, shaken out
                        from their old routine of order, do not as yet clearly comprehend in what
                        hands the authority of the State is now vested whose laws they are to obey,
                        by whom or how their lives are to be regulated, and their rights assured.
                        This is always a perilous condition with any race; how much more truly so,
                        then with a race so impressionable and so ignorant as the African, emerging
                        suddenly from the long darkness of slavery, no twilight interposed, in for
                        the full and dazzling day of personal liberty. The Southern negro finds
                        himself bewildered by and apparent conflict of laws. he sees military
                        commanders interfering with the agents of the "Freedmen's Bureau."--and
                        agents of the "Freedmen's Bureau" interfering with his own late masters.
                        Whether he belong to himself, to the "Freedmen" Bureau," or to the military
                        commanders, may well be a grave doubt in his untutored mind. Meanwhile, all
                        things remaining in this uncertain, provisional condition, the capital and
                        enterprise of the white race at the South, upon the activity of which the
                        very substance of the whole population depends, remain inert and passive.
                        Everywhere a scarcity of provisions, in some regions a positive famine, is
                        apprehended. Want and misery will do their work at least as surely upon mobs
                        of negroes as upon mobs of white men; and a season of suspense, enforced
                        idleness, and general confusion will, in all human probability, be followed
                        by a storm of insurgent passions, which the imagination shudders from
                        contemplating. In the interest, then of humanity, as well as of commerce and
                        the national prosperity, we hold it to be, as the President evidently holds
                        it to b e, of the gravest practical import that society at the South should
                        be remitted to operations of its ordinary and legal authority just as
                        rapidly as is in any degree consistent with the consolidation of the
                        authority of the Constitution over the lately revolted States. We have
                        crushed a fearful political rebellion. God forbid that our victory should be
                        so administered as to lead to a still more fearful social Jacquerie. </p>
                    <p>We do not at all believe it possible that this can be. WE are confident that
                        the good sense of the Northern people goes heartily with the President in
                        his eagerness to see law re-established and order re-adjusted through the
                        mouth.</p>
                    <p>But it is plain that the men who really control the republican party, and
                        will give tone to its action in the coming session of Congress, do not
                        partake of this eagerness of the President, and that they will make a
                        resolute, organized, and formidable effort to arrest the good work which he
                        has begun, and to court for the country all the perils of which we see image
                        and fearful foreshadowing in the actual condition of the unhappy island of
                            Jamaica.--New York World.</p>

                    <p>It would be, we repeat: it, more sensible for the people of New England who
                        are given to philanthropy and misanthropy (for the lover of the negro slave
                        is the hater of the white slaveowner), if they would devote some attention
                        to their home slaveries and sorrows. There are agonies in the poor-houses of
                        the North which humanity might well seek to soothe. For some years past
                        these institutions have been neglected, while the attention of the people
                        has been turned to the war; but it is now greatly to be feared; that of the
                        widows and children of the fallen soldiers, without other provisions, many
                        must go there. It would be curious to know the rates at which the poor are
                        now sold in the Eastern States. Can any one furnish statistics of this
                        market?</p>
                    <p>The Hartford (Conn.) Times answers the inquire: </p>
                    <p>In Connecticut the State and town white poor (in many towns) are let out to
                        the lowest bidders, and we find that the State poor have been let out for
                        $1,200 to $2,000 a year; and that the towns have let their poor at rates as
                        follows: Newtown, 4,000 inhabitants, $900 a year; last year, owing to the
                        high rates of provisions, about $200 extra was paid in Barkhamstead, 1,300
                        inhabitants, the sum of $440 was paid, and the contractor was Mr. mason, of
                        new Hartford, who also keeps the Hartford poor. Towns of 1,000 to 1,500
                        inhabitants pay $500 to $600 a year, the lowest bidders taking the paupers.</p>
                    <p>The La Crosse (Wis.) Democrat comments as follows: </p>
                    <p>What's the use of writing about the poor white people of New England? God has
                        cursed them with Anglo-Saxon blood. Had these poor wretches, whose bones are
                        sold to doctors, and whose lean bowels are made in to speculations, been
                        black all over the country, their case would be presented to the people for
                        interference, but these are simply poor, half-starved white wretches. Old
                        men, who, with tolling limbs, hobble along to the grave, cursed with a white
                        skin: Old women, who, with watery eyes, turn their wrinkled faces so their
                        dull ears will catch the should of the pauper's hearse as it rattles over
                        the stones of New England roads Wives, whose husbands are foundations for
                        monuments to heroism. Sisters of brave men dead in battle. Children of white
                        parents. God pity the poor whites! The negro is cared for by pious preachers
                        and policical gamblers, out of the public purse. Curse hem; they are poor;
                        and white besides! Most horrible crimes!</p>
                    <p>Let them paint their skins black.</p>
                    <p>Let them kink their hair, and powder it with burnt amber.</p>
                    <p>Let them cut their eyes open and double die their faces, dance the breakdown,
                        be fat, saucy and happy. Then all "Christian" America will pity them. Of
                        late years the happy negroes have been giving us a breakdown in blood--a
                        breakdown of credit--a breakdown of white liberties.</p>
                    <p>Let them become purified by the odor of Ethiopia, and glory will burst on
                        their vision instantly.</p>

                    <p>Black them--"shine 'em up!" and the West will support them for you.</p>
                    <p>Step this way, gentlemen; the sale is about to open. Here is the place to
                        make money! Here is a lot of poor white wretches to be sold to the highest
                        bidder! First is an old man eighty winters living. How little for him? He
                        don't eat much! His teeth are all out! Examine his flabby gums, ladies and
                        gentlemen! His appetite is poor! He can't hear what you say about him! He
                        can't see the dirt in his porridge! He can't talk plain and don't go
                        visiting. "One dollar a weak!" My good friends, this is extortion. He is
                        old. You can feed him on broth, and sleep him in a hog-pen. Down he goes to
                        Deacon Skinstones, at ninety cents a week. Let us pray.</p>
                    <p>And here comes the next on the catalogue an old female of seventy-six years
                        of age. Hurrah for the days of '76! She is old and blind. She eats coarse
                        much and nigger molasses. She don't get in the way--just sits and drools and
                        mumbles in the chimney-corner all day, and sleeps on a pile of rags at
                        night. Her son is a noted Abolition preacher--a bright star of Puritanism.
                        How little for her? She has a bad thing against her--she is white. "One
                        dollar a week!" 'Tis awful. Her daughter, Mrs. Hon.----, will keep her for
                        that. It don't cost a dime a week to keep her. And down she goes to brother
                        P. Nuribus for six shillings a week. Let us pray.</p>
                    <p>An here, patriotic cakes of humanity, baked on Plymouth Rock--here is a war
                        widow--very white and very poor. She is forty years old and cursed with six
                        white children. Her husband was Michael O'Brian, a fool do and Irishman who
                        went to the war without getting a bounty. He was luckily killed. His widow
                        will be sold to the lowest bidder, and the brats thrown in; she can earn
                        money by washing, and her children will soon be able to earn their keeper
                        money. How little, gentlemen? Figure close. She will earn twice her board
                        and you can draw school money for her children. Down she goes to Deacon
                        Righteous for twenty shillings a week. Let us pray.</p>
                    <p>The sale stands adjourned until we can attend a nigger pic-nic, clam-bake and
                        bar becue, to welcome our dear brothers to freedom. Ladies will look as
                        sweet as possible, and white men will pay the expense. After the pic-nic the
                        sale will be continued. Let us pray.</p>

                    <p>SIR:--For the information of yourself and others who are in charge of
                        Soldier's Orphans' Schools for the more advanced grade of pupils, and of
                        those who may be contemplating the establishment of such schools, the
                        following fundamental requirements, which have been previously stated in
                        substance by letter, are now put in this circular form. All the schools of
                        the above grade will be expected to come up to the standard now announced,
                        as soon as the requisite arrangements can be effected; and any school which
                        shall fail to do so by the first of April next, in any material particular,
                        will be discontinued as a Soldiers' Orphan School at the end of the then
                        current term.</p>
                    <p>1. Each school for the Orphans of the more advance grade,--that is, from 8 or
                        9 to 16 years of age,--is to have a building, or contiguous buildings,
                        sufficient to afford school room , boarding and lodging accommodations for
                        from 100 to 120 pupils of both sexes, with class, working, washing and bath
                        rooms, and all other proper apartments and conveniences; and all these are
                        to be sufficiently lighted, heated and ventilated.</p>
                    <p>2. The school and class rooms are to be properly furnished with comfortable
                        seats and desks, and provided with all the necessary school room apparatus,
                        and particularly with a sufficiency of black board surface.</p>
                    <p>3. There is to be an ample space of play and drill ground, immediately
                        adjoining the main building, with a shed or other shelter of sufficient size
                        for exercise in bad weather; and a separate portion of the ground,
                        &amp;c., is to be divided off and assigned to each sex, with all he
                        proper arrangements for privacy.</p>
                    <p>4. Each school is to have not less than twenty acres of good arable ground
                        belonging to it, and not more than one-fourth of a mile distant from the
                        main building; to be tilled for the production of vegetables, fruit mild,
                        &amp;c., by the pupils; to be stocked with necessary horses, cows, and
                        swine; and to have the proper stables, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>5. The teaching force proper, is to consist of a male principal and one male
                        and two female assistant teacher:--The principal to be qualified to give
                        instruction in all the school room studies of the institution; the male
                        assistant, in addition to his own branches in the sceool room, to instruct
                        in millitary drill, and light gymnastic or calisthenic exercises; the female
                        assistants, in addition to their respective school room branches, to be
                        qualified,--the one to teach vocal music and the other or both to teach
                        sewing, including the use of the sewing machine and cutting out of garments.</p>
                    <p>6. The course and method of instruction to be uniform in all the schools, and
                        to be as shall hereafter be assigned and explained by the State
                        Superintendent of Soldiers' Orphans.</p>
                    <p>7. In each establishment here shall be a person of competent skill and
                        experience, to direct the male pupils in their agricultural and other
                        industrial pursuits, and a matron to similarly direct and superintend the
                        female pupils in all the detail of household affairs and employments.</p>
                    <p>8. All the work of each establishment, that can be attended to by the pupils,
                        shall be by them performed, but, so arranged as not to interfere with their
                        schoolroom studies:--it being the great object of these schools to afford a
                        generous education, connected with such knowledge of household affairs and
                        everyday home pursuits, as a judicious father would impart were these
                        children to have remained in a well regulated home.</p>
                    <p>9. The moral and religious culture of the pupils is, for the present, left to
                        the wise discretion of the respective principals, who have been and will be
                        selected with a view to their fitness for this most important position of
                        their trust. More particular instructions will be issued on this head, and
                        the aid of clergy of the vicinity of each school will be invited in this
                        department of instruction. In the meantime, regular worship and other
                        religious observances, according to the form of the denomination to which
                        the principal belongs, are recommended.</p>
                    <p>Yours very truly,</p>
                    <p>THOS. H. BURROWES,</p>

<b>John Brown in Jamaica</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Suggests that the insurrection in Jamaica foreshadows the future of the
                    South should blacks not be placed under strict control. The piece accuses Horace
                    Greeley and the Tribune of supporting a similar policy in the U.S., in hopes of
                    creating a "negro empire."<br>

                    <p>The poets and philanthropists, falsely so called, of the Republican party,
                        are never weary of congratulating themselves and the country that, though</p>
                    <p>"John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave, His soul is marching on!"</p>
                    <p>Precisely what John Brown's soul is "marching on" to accomplish, they are
                        however, a trifle unexplicit in telling us, and for the credit of their own
                        humanity, says the New York World, we trust, a
                        trifle obfusticated also in perceiving. They carry to the account of this
                        unquiet ghost of theirs all the war for the Union fought by men the vast
                        majority of whom would have gladly let a hand to arrest, in the most summary
                        fashion, the "march" of John Brown's "body" while it was yet alive ad
                        obedient to the dictates of his "soul," and all the victories won for a
                        nationality which John Brown himself was ready and eager to disgrace and in
                        imperil. </p>
                    <p>While the land was all ablaze with battle, this deification of a fanatical
                        public enemy might have been excused, for men's blood was up, their weapons
                        were out, and one trumpet was, perhaps, as good as another for the work of
                        keeping armies in line and spurring soldiers to the charge. But now that the
                        country is returning to that constitutional order which John Brown perished
                        in striving to subvert, it is time for sane men to call things by their
                        right names, and to adjure the devil's livery in serving the State.</p>
                    <p>John Brown's "soul" is verily "marching on" at this moment: and as we can
                        trace its course by the light of burning homesteads and the shadow of
                        gallows-trees, heavy with their horrible fruit, in Jamaica, it can do us no
                        harm to consider whether we really desire to see that course pursued through
                        all the valleys and over the hills of our own Southern States. The grand
                        organ of the gospel of John Brown, the New York Tribune, is our authority for assuming that the hideous massacres
                        which have just occurred and are now occurring in Jamaica are the work of a
                        Jamaica John Brown. The Tribune asserts that the
                        outbreak of the negroes in that island against the white race was planned,
                        fomented, and led by a white man. This does not tally with the reports which
                        come to us directly from Jamaica; but we passover that circumstance. We are
                        willing to concede to a Caucassian brain the horrible merit of devising a
                        project for the extermination of thousands of unoffending white men, women
                        and children, in order that an unadulterated African civilization might be
                        planted upon the ruins of a colony once the garden of England's West Indian
                        empire. The existence of the Tribune itself, and
                        of the party for which it speaks, is the irrefragible proof that such things
                        are possible; and all that the Gordon of Jamaica is charged with carrying
                        into fearful and practical effect, the Greely of America is inviting and
                        praying for, day after day, as a matter of theory. "Negro equality," as
                        preached by the Tribunes and the Independents of the United States, is simply the
                        dream of which "negro empire," as aimed after by the insurgents of Jamaica,
                        is the reality. In what that reality has resulted the whole world is now
                        reading with shudders of horror and disgust. </p>
                    <p>The murder of white men, not slaveholders but abolitionists, not tyrants or
                        "lords of the lash," but sympathetic British clergy-men and magistrates,
                        full of hope for the "future of the African" has been accomplished with
                        circumstances of scarcely human ferocity. A whole population have been
                        throws into a fever of rage and terror by the sudden and lurid upleaping
                        under their very feet of a social volcano, threatening them with nothing
                        less than utter annihilation. And now the crimes perpetrated and planned by
                        the movers of this new jacquerie are avenging by
                        such wholescale executions as men had come to believe a nightmare of the
                        past, not possible to be parallelled in our own time anywhere out of the
                        Chinese empire. The highways of Jamaica fester with the bodies of
                        insurgents, slain, red-handed, by the infuriated militia of the island, or
                        strung up scores at a time by drumhead court-martials in the trees of the
                        forests. The devouring wave of English victory in India rolling back over
                        the revolted Sepoyus of Delhi and Cawnpore was not more merciless than the
                        wrath of the whites of Jamaica who escaped from the horrible fate which the
                        "soul of John Brown" had prepared for them. It is an obvious and easy thing
                        to retort upon the British critics of our won course in dealing with
                        rebellion with exclamation of horror as the ruthless inclemency of British
                        justice in Jamaica. But these [unclear], alike of the conspiracy and of its
                        chastizement, carry a deeper and far more woeful meaning for us. </p>
                    <p>What the maddened colonists of Jamaica are doing our own American forefathers
                        did when the extertalfiation of the New England Indians became the condition
                        of safety and progress for the New England whites. King Philip and his
                        Pequots found as scant mercy and as short a shrift as Gordon and his
                        Jamaican blacks. In our own times Minnesota and Kansas have repeated the
                        story; and if the senseless fanatics who are straining every nerve to make a
                        social war of races not only possibly but probable at the South, shall
                        succeed in forcing their policy upon the country, our own times will see it
                        repeated again on a far vaster and more appalling scale between the Potomac
                        and the Mississippi.</p>
                    <p>It is very well to hold up one's hands in depreciation of such horrors after
                        the events which develop them have worked their work. But whenever a lower
                        civilization rises in force upon a higher, it is in the very nature of
                        things that the outrages perpetrated by the men of the lower civilization
                        shall be of such a kind and degree as to rouse in the men of the higher the
                        most ungovernable instincts of vengeance. This truth has been dismally
                        illustrated in a hundred incidents of the history even of men of the same
                        race, from the days of jack Cade's insurrection in England, down to the
                        terrible battles of the barricades of Paris, in June, 1848. When the
                        antipathies of race, also, are brought into play, the matter, of course, is
                        made infinitely worse. The philanthropy which takes no account of these
                        certainties, and of the natural laws which make them certainties, may fitly
                        enough take John Brown for its hero and its saint; but the triumphs which
                        their faith is winning in Jamaica should suffice for one generation, at
                        least, of the Anglo-Saxon race in the New World.</p>

                    <p>All eyes are forecast to the meeting of this body. Its session will be one of
                        the most important and perhaps the most exciting ever held by any
                        legislative body. The excitement will begin with its beginning. It is well
                        understood now that McPherson, the late Clerk, will refuse to enter the
                        names of the Southern members on the roll of the House. WE don't know that
                        there is any remedy, but there many be punishment. We take it for granted
                        that they will not participate in the organization. We do not regret it, for
                        their presence would make not difference in the result, and we want the
                        whole Abolition p[arty to take the responsibility which the Clerk will throw
                        upon them admitting or rejecting seventy or eighty members elected on the
                        President's own plan of reconstruction. We think they will be admitted,
                        after great and violent opposition on the part of a majority for the
                        Radicals. Some of that party will favor their admission from proper and
                        patriotic motives, and others because they do not care to break with the
                        President and his patronage.</p>
                    <p>However organized, Congress will have enough to do. The war has left a great
                        many unsettled questions of its own, as well as unsettled all the ordinary
                        matters of public policy. By far the most important of all these is the
                        currency question. In this every man has a deep personal interest. The
                        result involved is, whether we shall accept a financial crash now, or
                        postpone it to some future time. Mr. McCulloch hopes it may be avoided, but
                        it never has been under similar circumstances. That his directions will be
                        judicious we have no doubt; but the chance is that they will not be
                        regarded. He thinks the currency should be lessened; but so many influences
                        will crowd in the opposite direction, that it is far more likely to be
                        increased. Then we shall have a few more months of paper prosperity,
                        terminating in such a wreck of men and theories as the world has seldom
                        seen.</p>
                    <p>We do not think the Abolition party will outlive the coming Congress, as a
                        controlling organization. Even now there is no sympathy between its brains
                        and its passions. Each interest hopes to control the President and his
                        patronage but his action within the next few months must necessarily settle
                        the doubts the affect to entertain in regard to his purposes; and from that
                        moment dates the dissolution of the Abolition party. Democrats are in a good
                        position to wait. Though really a large majority of the voting population of
                        the country they are practically without a particle of power or
                        responsibility. This anomalous condition in a republic cannot last long. If
                        we are patient and prudent, the country will soon enough appeal to us for

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A lot of English and shoddy capitalists are in Washington, projecting a
                        mammoth cotton company, for the production of the great staple of the South
                        through free negro labor, and also for the manufacture of the same. Every
                        day fresh evidence is appearing to prove that the "War for Freedom" was
                        founded in the irresistible desire of Northern and foreign capitalists to
                        share with the Southern slaveholders to solid advantages of negro labor.
                        Their activity in cotton cultivation and manufacture now indicates how
                        ardently they have pursued their darling but dishonorable project, and how
                        much they hope for in the future in dollars and cents. They imagine they
                        have things in a much better shape, with the negro free, than the
                        Southerners had with him as a slave.</p>
                    <p>The negro himself will have a hard time of it, if he has to perform all that
                        is expected of him. When a slave he had but one master, whose interest it
                        was to preserve his health and lengthen his life by providing him with good
                        food, first-class medical attendance, not too much work, and by exercising a
                        careful scrutiny of his moral condition. As a freeman, he has to serve a
                        plurality of masters, who can have no sympathy for him nor interest in
                        either his welfare or longevity. He has already become the subject of
                        calculation, by his new masters, who are anxious to know who much work they
                        can get out of him for a given stipend of money. They measure him as they do
                        the working capacity of a steam engine or other working machine; but, as
                        they have nothing to pay in the shape of "first cost," they make no estimate
                        of his lasting qualities, as they do in the case of machine. It is nothing
                        to them whether he lasts one, two or twenty years, so that, while he works,
                        he shall furnish the requisite amount of motive power.</p>
                    <p>Whether the country has gained anything by the change-wrought at a cost of
                        billions in dollars and seas of patriotic blood-the future must determine;
                        but it needs no great wisdom to see that the poor negro has not with liberty
                        drawn a prize. He must continue to be the "hewer of wood and the drawer of
                        water" for those who are smarter and more powerful, and though free from the
                        benevolent or selfish care of an owner, he must still be a slave to the
                        ignorance, the avarice, the greed, and the iron network of circumstances
                        which the now masters will place around him. Slavery meant work-Liberty
                        means work harder. The negroes may well ask-"War for the African and his

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"It is authoritatively avowed that the Secretary of the Treasury will urge
                        that the revenues of the Government be increased to the highest possible
                        figure, and that the excess of receipts over expenditures be applied to the
                        payment of debt as fast as practicable. This is the true, if no the only
                        economy." Thus "authoritatively" speaks John W. Forney, the mouthpiece of
                        the Republican party.</p>
                    <p>Look at it, ye taxpayers, and especially ye who voted with and for the
                        Republican party at the late election. "Taxes up to the highest figure."
                        "This is the true economy." You, some of you groan and sweat and swear now,
                        because the tax collector is haunting you at every street corner, and
                        exhibiting for you inspection his little leather-covered book. But it is not
                        yet enough. The burdens you now bear have failed to crush you. They must be
                        increased to the "highest possible figure" that you can endure. Your lands
                        which are now loaded with taxes equal to an ordinary rent, your labor, your
                        produce, your incomes, your outlays, your shirts and your sheets, your pigs
                        and your poultry, your meats and your drinks, all, all must be taxed up to
                        the highest figure. Why? Because so many hundreds of millions of the money
                        of the rich have been invested in Government Bonds which are exempted from
                        taxation. And you, farmers, mechanics, laboring men must suffer this
                        increased taxation to make up the deficiency. But Mr. Forney says, "We have
                        heard on citizens moaning and complaining of what they conceive to be unjust
                        taxation. Why the audacious creatures! To dare to moan and complain because
                        their taxes are increased while their neighbor worth his millions, goes
                        "sent free." What right have you or we to 'moan and complain' at what the
                        government does? Is it not a kind government, a beneficent government? Why
                        the government has aright to tax, and if it taxes one and passes by another,
                        what is that to us? "Moan and complain" about paying taxes! Why in time of
                        war such conduct would be treason foul, and even now, in those times of
                        peace, it is unpardonable audacity. "Up to the highest possible figure."
                        That is the Republican standard for taxation and then none of your whining,
                        moaning and complaining.--Danville
