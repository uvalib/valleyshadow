<b>The Negro Suffrage Question</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since taking office, Johnson has thus far pursued a course deemed amenable
                    by the Spirit and most other conservatives journals. Through his efforts,
                    national reconciliation will proceed at an accelerated pace so long as the
                    process is not derailed by Radicals pushing for black suffrage. Blacks, the
                    newspaper asserts, are the biggest "source of national contention and turmoil,"
                    but Johnson's decision to leave the question of black suffrage to individual
                    states appears to offer the best method to rectify this situation.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, has become President of the United States by
                        the act of God. Speculation as to the character of his administration has
                        already commenced. The predictions regarding the matter are as various as
                        the prejudices and wishes of the different prophets. We will not presume, at
                        this early period, to assert in advance what Mr. Johnson will or will not do
                        nor what will be the general drift and result of his career as the national
                        Chief Magistrate. We may, however, express an opinion as to the line of
                        action he should mark out for himself, and the leading principles that ought
                        to guide his official conduct. Everybody will probably admit that no
                        citizen, not excepting even Washington or Lincoln, was ever called to the
                        high functions of the Presidency at a mere interesting junction. The crisis
                        may, in certain sense, be said to have been made for Mr. Johnson. Events
                        must show whether he was made for the crisis. If he enters on his mission
                        with a lofty purpose and firm resolution, he will have in its power to be
                        signally useful to his country. If, on the other hand, he fails to realize
                        the magnitude of the exigency, and falls below it in ambition and ability,
                        he may possibly remit the nation to new scenes of discord and contention
                        even more disastrous in their character and issues than those so recently
                        closed, and consign his own name to imperishable disgrace. No man ever
                        enjoyed a better opportunity to achieve an honorable immortality, yet none
                        was ever required to be more entirely equal and true to the weighty
                        responisbilities devolved upon him.</p>
                    <p>The grand aim of his administration should be to restore peace to the nation
                        and to re-establish the harmonious relations of all its parts, so that they
                        may never again be disturbed by those purely sectional differences and
                        disputes that have so often, and at last, so fearfully convulsed the
                        republic. And this object, if he is rightly disposed, he can readily and
                        effectually accomplish. He has, in one word, only to resolve that he will
                        exercise his authority in accordance with broad and righteous principles of
                        national policy, and with the sternest impartiality towards all sections of
                        the union, in order to prove himself the right man in the right place, at
                        the right time, and to secure the cordial respect, confidence and support of
                        all good and patriotic citizens.</p>
                    <p>With reference, especially to all measures that may be suggested with regard
                        to the freed negroes in the South, he should hold the reins of power with an
                        even and steady hand. The radical members of the Republican party are likely
                        to make that subject the fruitful source of popular controversy hereafter,
                        and they are already industriously preparing their plans for an exciting
                        discussion of the proposition to give the negro, the right of suffrage, and
                        to make him, as far as legislation can do it, socially and politically the
                        equal of the white race. Touching this matter no section and no portion of
                        the people of the country should have just occasion to complain of President
                        Johnson's integrity.-The Constitution and such acts of Congress as have been
                        passed in pursuance of it, have determined the jurisdiction of the general
                        Government respecting the delicate qustion of conferring the elective
                        franchise, and Mr. Johnson's whole duty will be discharged if he takes care
                        to enforce a faithful observance of the laws and the constitution. This
                        course would not, perhaps, satisfy extreme and fanatical men in any quarter
                        of the Confederacy, but it is not to them that Mr. Johnson owes his
                        election. The returns show that he is indebted for that honor to the vote of
                        the Middle States, and his administration, therefore, should represent and
                        reflect the conservative sentiment of the people of those States.</p>
                    <p>We may even assert that a large majority of the citizens of the late
                        rebellious States would sustain him in the pursuit of a moderate, equitable,
                        and genuinely concillatory policy relative to the one fatal source of our
                        past divisions and strifes. And by that we do not mean slavery, but the
                        inevitable and eternal negro, who seems destined, whether he be slave or
                        free, in one condition or in another, to be made, by a certain order of
                        demagogues, a perpetual source of national contention and turmoil. The
                        country cannot afford to have the agitation renewed in any form, or upon any
                        pretence whatever. The predominant feeling of the people everywhere is in
                        favor of the speediest possible restoration of a sound, solid durable peace,
                        and that certainly cannot be obtained as long as the old ulcers of sectional
                        jealousy and controversy are kept open and persistently irritated.</p>
                    <p> President Johnson, as respects the question of negro suffrage, has taken the
                        right ground already, and he should sternly and resolutely maintain it. He
                        has declared that the issue is one which belongs exclusively to the States
                        and with which, therfore, the Federal Congress and Executive cannot
                        interfere. A little reflection will make this clear enough to any
                        comprehension. The people of the several States elect the members of both
                        branches of the State legislatures, whose members are, as we have remarked,
                        chosen by the people in each State. While, therefore, the members of the
                        State legislatures and of Congress are chosen by the people, the right to
                        vote in each State, or the qualification for voters therein, has always been
                        and still are determined by the State constitutions. On this subject Justice
                        Story, in his commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, says:
                        "When the Revolution brought about the separation of the colonies, and they
                        formed themselves into independent States, a very striking diversity was
                        observable in the original constitutions adopted by them, and a like
                        diversity has pervaded all the constitutions of the new States which have
                        since grown up all the revised constitutions of the old States which have
                        received the ratification of the people. In some of the States the right of suffrage depends upon a certain length
                        of residence and payment of taxes; in others upon mere citizenship and
                        residence; in others, upon the possession of a freehold, or some estate of a
                        particular value, or upon the payment of taxes, or performances of some
                        public duty, such as service in militia or on the highways. In no two of
                        these State Constitutions will it be found that the qualifications of the
                        voters are settled upon the same uniform basis. So that we have the most
                        abundant proofs that among a free and enlightened people, convened for the
                        purpose of establishing their own forms of Government and the rights of
                        their own voters, the question as to the due regulation of the
                        qualifications has been decreed a matter of mere State policy and varied to
                        meet the wants, to suit the prejudices, and to foster the interests of the
                        majority. An absolute, indefeasible right to elect or be elected, seems
                        never to have been asserted on one side or decided on the other, but the
                        subject has been freely canvassed as one of a mere civil policy, to be
                        arranged upon such a basis as the majority may deem expedient with reference
                        to the moral, physical, and intellectual condition of the particular State." </p>
                    <p>We see, therefore, that the people in each State, who make their State
                        Constitution, thereby determine who shall and who shall not vote at the
                        political elections in the particular State, aod hence it follows that as
                        the question of conferring or denying the franchise, belongs of right to
                        each State exclusively, the national legislature or Congress, cannot
                        lawfully confer the privilege of suffrage on any individual resident, or any
                        class, order, or condition of people resident in a State. President Johnson
                        fully understandi this system of our complex system of government, and will
                        not we believe, be persuaded to stultify himself on the subject by the
                        argument; flatter, expostulations or threats of the silly fanatics who are
                        striving to do that by national legislation, which cannot be done except by
                        State action, and which if done at all, would we seriously believe, result
                        in incalculable evil to the future peace, progress and prosperity of the
                        nation. The fathers of the republic established it as a Government of white
                        people, and as such it should forever remain. When it becomes a government
                        of mixed races, it will inevitably perish.-Nevertheless, if the qualified
                        voters in each of the States of the Union wish to extend the elective
                        franchise to the colored population, and to share its exercise with them,
                        let them do so, of course. But let them, at the same time, do it of their
                        own free will and by their independent action, and not have the thing thrust
                        on them by means of usuurped power , to be executed at Washington, under the
                        pernicious sway of fanatacism.</p>

<b>Secession is Dead</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    <p>A vague apprehension still retains its hold on the Northern mind, that the
                        "disunionists" and "secessionists" are contriving at the next State
                        elections in the Southern States, to get possession of the reins of
                        government. This alarm is as ludicrous as the nameless, shapeless terror
                        which seizes upon the schoolboy when he hurries through the shadow of a dark
                        wood. There is no cause for apprehension. The secession party is dead; its
                        hopes, apirations and power having expired with the Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of that party who are not excluded from the Amnesty Proclamation,
                        are well content to engage in the most harmless and peaceful occupations. We
                        hear of them tilling their farms, cultivating their gardens, and repairing
                        the ravages of war, but we are yet to hear of a "leading secessionist," or
                        "original disunionist," who is manifesting the slightest desire to return to
                        public life. They feel that they have had their day, and that it is neither
                        politic nor decorus for them to take the lead in the work of reconstruction.
                        If there are any of this class who secretly cherish hopes of future
                        promotion, they are too wise to avow them.</p>

                    <p>The Petersburg  Express says that rather an
                        amusing incident occurred in a neighboring county a few days since, during
                        the march of a column of United States troops. The negroes collected on
                        every farm to witness the passage of the soldiers, and in many instances
                        greeted them with evident marks of pleasure. Sitting upon a gate post, upon
                        one of these farms was a sharp little darkey just entering his teens, who,
                        when told of his freedom, clapped his hands and shouted for joy. "Ise free,
                        Ise free!" he exclaimed in exstacy to his mother, "I ain't gwine to rock de
                        cradle no more 'case I'se free." </p>
                    <p> Running to a younger sister he imparted his newly obtained intelligence
                        saying:--"You is free-don't pick up no more chips." And spying a cat lazily
                        stretching her limbs in the sunshine he reached the climax by screaming out:
                        And you's free pussy, don't ketch no more rats!" Whether the delighted
                        fellow went on addressing the fowls, the cattle, the hogs, we do not know,
                        but the above is related as an actual occurrence. Such freedom as he would
                        have the cat enjoy would cost her life, but freedom, in his mind, was the
                        joy par excellence of his life. </p>
                    <p>We learn from the Old Dominion that a negro woman was sent to work a few
                        weeks since, sweeping the sidewalks in Norfolk, under cover of a guard of
                        her own persuasion of color, for expressing her violent detestation of the
                        Yankees. Quite a crowd gathered in the vicinity of the Atlantic hotel to
                        behold the anomaly. She seemed to be about as bitter in her hatred, as some
                        of the lightered colored feminines.</p>

                    <p> The people in some localities of the Western States are getting outrageously

                        hundred gathered around the jail and attempted to get more victims, but four
                        or five bayonets served to keep the blood-seekers at bay. At Council Bluffs,
                        Iowa, also, a few days since, a highway robber was caught and hanged without
                        a show of trial. Such acts, in view of the fact that persons charged with
                        heinous crimes cannot escape punishment in any part of the country upon
                        legal trial, are perfecly inexcusable, and betray a brutality and
                        lawlessness quite as great and atrocious as that for which their victims are
                        made to suffer. Who would like to name as a friend and companion a member of
                        such a mob? </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Ever since the announcement of the reconstruction policy of Andrew Johnson
                        through his North Carolina proclamation the Republican press and politicians
                        have been ominously silent. They are unanimous in withholding their praise,
                        but it is only the more bold among them that have yet ventured openly to
                        assail his patriotic efforts to restore the Southern States to their
                        constitutional relations to the Union. But the issue is bound to come, and
                        they might as well face the music first as last.-The radical leaders-the men
                        who control the Republican organization-have already defiantly sounded the
                        key note of the party in favor of negro equality and negro suffrage, whilst
                        the lesser lights of the party are lingering in the back ground, not knowing
                        which way to steer. This must appear evident to any one who has noticed the
                        tone of the Repository for the last few
                        weeks.-Its boasted independence of character has suddenly vanished into thin
                        air like the morning cloud and the early dew, and we find it groping its way
                        in the darkness before it, hesitating whether to advance or recede-whether
                        to follow the lead of its radical masters, or bow down meekly at the
                        footstool of power. We commiserate its conditon, and sincerely hope that it
                        may have a safe and speedy deliverance from its present perplexing
                        difficulties and that it may not become our unpleasant duty to record
                        "another failure." </p>
                    <p>Doubtless as a relief to the embarrassment in which it finds itself, it still
                        occasionally indulges in the stale and worn-out charges against the
                        Democracy of "opposition to the government." so flippantly used during the
                        war. Under the new order of things this must be now done on the principle of
                        the "stop thief" cry. In view of the unmistakable signs of opposition in the
                        Republican ranks to the policy of President Johnson, and the hearty
                        endorsement of the same by the Democracy, and the following extract from its
                        last issue is singularly refreshing:</p>
                    <p>"The rebel sympathizers among us, who co-operated with the traitors during
                        the fierce struggle just ended, and controlled the opposition at the last
                        election, seem to feel that their party existence depends upon their making
                        odious, and thwarting the administration, and are busy in impeding and
                        deranging the efforts of the government."</p>
                    <p> Will the Repository be kind enough to tell us
                        just when and where the Democracy-or "rebel sympathizers" to use its own
                        miserable twaddle-have been "making odious and thwarting the administration,
                        and deranging the efforts of the government." </p>
                    <p>In making the above wanton and malicious charge against the Democratic party,
                        the Repository should at least have endeavored to keep up a show of
                        consistency. But unfortunately for it, its inconsistency is even more
                        striking and apparent, if possible, than its untruthfulness. In the same
                        number of the paper in which it editorially accuses the Democracy of
                        "threatening the administration," it publishes a letter from its Washington
                        correspondent, whose sentiments it is presumed to endorse, containing a
                        direct and almost violent attack on the policy of President Johnson. The
                        following is an extract:</p>
                    <p>It is said that should the President continue in the course at present
                        indicated, (it?) will not meet the sanction of Congress.-Should Congress not
                        meet till next December, every Southern State will have then here a delegate
                        knocking at the door, similar to the one of last session from Louisiana.
                        There is no probability that Congress will admit them and we may except a
                        repetition of the scenes of days gone by. These so called penitent rebels
                        now here, are walking the streets as haughty and defiant as in days of old
                        and are receiving the attention of persons holding high official positions,
                        which will inevitably lead to something bad in the end.</p>
                    <p> The intelligent reader will perceive at a glance how beautifully the two
                        paragraphs above quoted harmonize with each other, and he will doubtless
                        duly appreciate the propriety of a public journal falsely denouncing its
                        opponents for opposing the administration and in the same breath as it were,
                        alleging acts against "persons holding high official
                            positions, which will inevitably lead to something bad in the
                        end." In the extract we have last quoted the Repository does not content itself with an ordinary criticism of
                        President Johnson's policy, but it takes the most advanced radical ground
                        and threatens revolutionary measures to "thwart
                        the administration" and impede its efforts to restore the Southern States to
                        the Union. It says Congress will not admit the Southern delegation to seats
                        if the present policy of the President is persisted in. Why not? we ask. If
                        members are elected from the Southern States in pursuance of the
                        proclamation of the President and the laws of their respective States in
                        force prior to the rebellion, Congress will have nothing to do but to admit
                        them at once. The attempt to exclude them after having been fairly elected,
                        would be an act of usurpation which would inevitably lead to very serious
                        consequences. Congress can inquire into the fairness and legality of the
                        election, but here its power ceases. It cannot assume to debar whole
                        delgations from seats simply because it chooses to do so for political
                        purposes, or any considerations other than those mentioned. </p>
                    <p> If the Repository chooses to array itself on the
                        side of usurpation and revolution we certainly have no right to object, but
                        we do object to its making unfounded charges against the Democratic party
                        when its own position towards the "government" gives it so doubtful a
                        character for "loyalty." </p>

                    <p>The Democratic State Convention, which will meet in Harrisburg, upon the 24th
                        of August next, is expected to put in nomination candidates for Auditor
                        General and Surveyor General. Justice to the incumbents demands, and the
                        interests of the Democracy of Pennsylvania, (in our judgement) require, the
                        unanimous nomination, for the first office, of the Hon. Isaac Slenker, of
                        Union County, and for the second, the Hon. James P. Barr, of Allegheny.
                        These gentlemen have performed the duties of their respective and onorous
                        offices faithfully and very satisfactorily--having carried the State
                        triumphantly when they were candidates in 1862,--we see no valid reason why
                        they should not be honored, accordinG to the usages of the party, with
                        another nomination and a re-election, believing as we most firmly do, that

                    granting blacks limited rights. The law fails to provide them with anything

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The lower branch of the Tennessee Legislature has passed a bill, by a
                        majority of over two-thirds, fixing the legal status of the colored people
                        of that State. The bill is substantially the same as the one which had
                        previously passed the Senate. It guarantees the sanctity of the matrimonial
                        relation among them, but forbids their intermarriage among whites. All laws
                        in force for the benefit of the married woman and children are to apply to
                        them, provided that colored children are not to be admitted to the same
                        schools with white children. Colored persons may be witnesses in all State
                        Courts, for or against each other, but not in cases to which the party are
                        white, and no contract between a white and colored person shall be binding,
                        unless reduced to writing and witnessed by a white person. Colored persons
                        are subject to the same penalties for crimes as whites, with the addition
                        that rape by a negro upon a white woman is punishable by death. These are
                        the most prominent and important features of the bill, which is said by the
                        Nashville papers to be the most liberal toward the colored people that the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The negro suffrage agitation is agitating the suffrage question otherwise.
                        The idea that our own women and children cannot vote, when half barbarized
                        Southern Africans can be created, right off, as voters, to vote them down,
                        shocks all rational sense of consistency--but this is not all, and the
                        loosest retrograde ideas of suffrage prevail. After France had liberalized
                        the suffrage, and while England is enlarging it, a grave and seriously
                        earnest proposition is put forth in a morning paper--doubtless from some
                        large, silly holders of the national debt--that men shall have just so many
                        votes as they hold $600 dollars of the debt. This would give some of our
                        Banks 1,000 votes; other great corporations more, and many individuals 10,
                        20, 30, 40, or 50 votes or more.</p>
                    <p> It is very hard work in the United States, amid all the excitements that are
                        kept up, especially after a "fast day," literally now a fast day in the jockey sense--and amid so much clerical slang
                        whanging upon these numberous days to stop any sort of retrogradation. Some
                        would consolidate this into a government stronger than the Russian or French
                        monarchy. Others would drive us to the Federal Government to prescribe what
                        we shall eat, drink, or wear. If the principle of democracy, and of
                        self-government can sustain itself against all the desperate struggles, it
                        will be far luckier for us in this country than it has been in any other.
