<b>Pennsylvania Official Returns</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Announces the official results for Auditor General and Surveyor General,
					seven weeks after the election occurred.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We are enabled at length to present to our readers the official result of the
						election held in this State on the second Tuesday of October last. It seems
						strange that the people of the State were compelled to wait seven weeks for
						official information of the results of that election. In other States the
						information is promptly furnished by the officials; but in Pennsylvania, for
						the past several years, the State Department deemed it necessary to withhold
						it as long as possible. Why this is so appears inexplicable. The Harrisburg
							Telegraph complains, that though having had a
						table of returns, copied form the records in the State Department, a week
						since, the Secretary M. Slifer, peremptorily refused to allow it to leave
						his department for publication, and that paper was obliged to copy the table
						from the Philadelphia papers.</p>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Journal of Commerce</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>It is always difficult to forecast the future, and financial predictions are
						especially unreliable. In this country, more than any other, has it been
						found impossible to estimate results yet to be attained by anything we know
						of the past; and thus the most far-sighted have found themselves utterly at
						fault in their judgment. Just now the financial problem takes precedence of
						the political, in the minds of most thoughtful persons; and there is no more
						anxiety in reference to it than is generally confessed. A great variety of
						theories have been proclaimed, and each has its special advocates; but we
						have seen no plan of action yet proposed which had any probability of
						success.</p>
					<p>One flippantly urges a resumption of specie payments, as if that were simply
						a method of progression, and not the very result toward the attainment of
						which all means are to be directed. Another suggests a further issue of
						national currency, without pausing to consider that, as a remedy for
						existing difficulties, this would be the application of the homeopathic
						principle in allopathic doses. The most common proposition, however, vaguely
						refers to some form of contraction as the basis of future action. The
						changes are rung on this theme until the oft-repeated phrase becomes so
						current that many adopt it as the probably solution of the whole difficulty.
						Indeed, it is gravely announced from Washington, as if by authority, that
						the government has determined to exert all its force to reduce the volume of
						the currency, and thus advance by constant, if not rapid steps, toward the
						desired consummation</p>
					<p>All this only disturb the public mind, and misleads those who put their faith
						in such assertions. The country ought never to have had the paper money
						inflation, and our readers need to be told that we have steadily opposed it
						from its first inception. But the best method of removing the evil is not so
						apparent. Those who think that it can be done without a systematic struggle
						which shall tax the endurance of the nation to the utmost, can have no
						proper appreciation of the magnitude of the burden, or the extent of its
						vital relations.</p>
					<p>It is easy to speak of contraction, but who is to inaugurate it? Not the mass
						of the people, surely, for they must be the first to suffer, and few are
						willing to invite present pain in the hope of such an uncertain reward. We
						posted at this years ago, when the inflation was undertaken, with the
						promise that the moment the unnatural stimulus had served its purpose, the
						people would return to instant sobriety. We shoed then, what is proven now,
						that no inebriate ever voluntarily relinquished the cup while it was
						possible for him to carry it to his lips. No! The pressure must come
						altogether from the outside before the penance can begin. The return from
						this mad race is only to be made by a wearisome path, where every step will
						be marked with pain. Whence can this pressure come?</p>
					<p>The answer is ready on many lips: The Secretary of the Treasury must lead the
						people back. B But can he? In nearly all that is written on this subject, it
						is taken for granted that if the government only has the disposition, is has
						the ability to adopt this measure at once. But a little examination will
						show that if the head of the Treasury were reckless of consequences, he has
						no the power to control the future of financial affairs. He must meet his
						pecuniary engagements, and any persistence in an arbitrary course would
						paralize his efforts. Even with the utmost care and caution he cannot afford
						to disturb the market in which he must be a borrower for years to com.
						Within three years there fall due nearly one thousand millions in Treasury
						paper, which must either be funded or paid. If there is any contraction,
						will not every holder insist on payment?</p>
					<p>We are thus prepared to see that for some time to come neither the people nor
						their rulers are likely to engage voluntarily in the working contraction. If
						it depends on mere volition, we see no controlling will strong enough to set
						the work in motion, while many selfish interests are ever busy in efforts to
						continue the unnatural excitement. When it comes, as it must some day in
						spite of all that would perpetuate the inflation, it will probably come
						unheralded, but those certainly will not be led by human agency. All
						factions will unite to resist it. All who writhe under it will cry out
						against it. Political leaders may indeed recommend it at a safe distance,
						but none will be found bold enough to begin the experiment. It may come in
						gradual approaches, stealing its way quietly along the shrinking nerves, or
						it may come in sudden convulsions but it will never end the community
						prepared for it or ready to welcome it. Nature does a kindly work when she
						racks the frame in her faithful struggles to throw off a dangerous disease;
						but what patient ever submitted to the process without a groan?</p>
					<p>Those who are laying their plans for the future may therefore rest assured
						that none of the methods of contraction, which have been suggested will be
						adopted voluntarily, either by he people or their representatives at
						Washington. All of the talk to this effect is the morest buncombe, and will
						lend to no corresponding action. If we could stop the present leaks in the
						Treasury, and bring the expenses of the government within reasonable limits,
						we could save several hundred millions annually to apply to the funding of
						the remainder, both at home and abroad, and through this policy the country
						might return to a safer system, without any upheaval of the foundations of
						credit, or the breaking down of existing financial institutions.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>James J. Waddell chief of the pirate crew of the Shenandoah, is a native of
						Pitsboro, Catham county, N. C., and entered the the United States naval
						service at Portsmouth, Va., on the receiving ship Pennsylvania, in 1841,
						having graduated at the at the Naval Academy by "the skin of his teeth." A
						few months after he was shot in the him, in a duel with another midshipman.
						After fifteen years service afloat he was made Assistant Professor of
						Navigation &amp;c., at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. In 1859 he
						was ordered to the East India squadron, and in 1861, when the war broke out,
						mailed his resignation from St. Helena. His reason for resigning was given
						by him in a letter published by him in January, 1862, as owing to his
						"unwillingness to bear arms against his father's home and relatives in the
						seceded States." He declared explicitly that he had no property in the
						seceded States, that he was not hostile to the Constitution of the United
						States (very few of the rebels were according to their story) that he
						venerated the flag and wished that he might hazard life and limb in its
						defense against some foreign foe, like cruel, neutral old England. The true
						reason was that he was engaged to be married to a young lady of Annapolis,
						whose family was strongly inclined to be rebellious. This lady Miss
						Iglehart, daughter of James Iglehart, a very wealthy merchant, he married in
						December, 1862. This was his first overt act. His resignation was not
						accepted, and he stands on the navy register of 1862 as "dismissed." In
						February, 1862, after having taken the oath of allegiance, and while on
						parole not to leave Annapolis he ran the blockade to Richmond and entered
						the rebel navy. His commission as first lieutenant in that service bears
						date March 27, 1862. He was assigned to duty at Drury's Bluff defenses, on
						James River. Subsequently he had a command in Charleston harbor, from which
						he ran the blockade in 1864 to take command of the Shenandoah. The date of
						his promotion to lieutenant commander is not known.</p>

<b>Congress and Clerk McPherson</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Though hopeful that its assessment is inaccurate, the article casts the
					Clerk of the House in a negative light, alleging that it is doubtful whether he
					will act correctly and admit the Representatives of the former states in
					rebellion.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>It is scarcely possible to overestimate the importance of the measures, to be
						presented to, and which must be passed upon buy the Congress which has just
						assembled. The whole reconstruction policy of President Johnson must undergo
						the scrutiny and revision of an unscrupulous and fanatical majority, and
						most likely a line of policy will be announced which will injuriously affect
						the country for many years to come. We have a right to expect that National
						Representatives, at this crisis, will be governed in their speeches and
						votes, purely by motives of public good and a patriotic desire to heal the
						wounds of the body politic. But in looking over the long list of fanatics in
						both branches of Congress, we confess that the prospects, of sound and
						judicious legislation look dark enough. We shall not, however, be long held
						in suspense on this subject, almost the first at to be done will test the
						fidelity of the members to their official delegations and the requirements
						of the Constitution, for they must immediately determine whether or not the
						Southern members shall be admitted to seats.</p>
					<p>If, in that assemblage, there existed one man of the mould of John Q. Adams,
						we should be more hopeful that justice might obtain, for althought the
						Prince of Abolitionists, he was nevertheless an honest man. He was patriot
						enough to love his country better than party. We remember the gallant fight
						he made, in days of the past, for the admission of the members from New
						Jersey, who came there with the seal of their Commonwealth, attesting their
						right to seats on the floor. The Clerk, who is the mere tool of the house,
						insolently refused to put their names on the roll. It was then, that the
						"old man Eloquent" rose to his feet, and fought the battle for them. And at
						the same time administered a seathing and merited rebuke to the Clerk, for
						assuming powers which did not belong to his office.</p>
					<p>It is quite probable that the same assumption of power will be made by the
						present Clerk of the House, and that he will attempt to usurp the authority
						to pass on the qualifications of the members from the South, to a seat on
						the floor, and we fear that this arrogant presumption on his part, will not,
						as in the case cited, be reproved, but commended.</p>
					<p>This will afford another exemplification of the degeneracy of the times, and
						the difference between the men of the past and the men of the present. The
						first were filled with patriotic ardor and love of country, which carried
						them above party trammels. The latter have but one purpose--party success
						and spoils of office--no matter at what hazard to our institutions. Our
						opponents have shown such a persistent and total disregard of public law,
						and have elevated to power such a host of venal and corrupt men as to force
						upon us the conviction, that they are wholly dead to the sentiments of
						political virtue. Thus we have the extraordinary spectacle of a man elevated
						to place who received his political training, as a lobby member of the House
						of Representatives of Pennsylvania, where for many years, he picked up a
						precarious living in that den o thieves, by doing odd chores for the inside
						member, and by scribbling flatulent paragraphs for partizan sheets.</p>
					<p>We are told, by high authority, that when the sea is in commotion it throws
						up "mire and dirt." In like manner, in time of great revolutions, the "scum
						of mankind" rise to the surface of human affairs, and by dint of mere
						impudence, attain to places of profit and responsibility. Amongst the many
						illustrations of this truth, now in existence, none affords a better
						example, than the rise and progress of this same Clerk of the House. Wholly
						destitute of merit, ability or political integrity, he is nevertheless by
						the grace of Abolition rule, Clerk of the House of the House of
						Representatives in Congress, with all its patronage, and clothed with the
						power to work fearful mischief. If he were a modest man withal, the
						tremendous weight of responsibility resting on him, might cause him to
						hesitate in his progress. But whilst nature has denied him modesty and
						fitness for the duties and responsibilities of the post, it has filled him
						with inordinate vanity and self-sufficiency, which will make him believe
						himself equal to every emergency.</p>
					<p>In one of his speeches, Wendell Phillips, the fanatical abolitionist,
						expressed fears that McPherson would not seize the occasion to "immortalise"
						himself by refusing to enroll the Southern
						members. he may give his fears to the wind, the Clerk is of his own school.
						He is not troubled by constitutional restraints, and the "immortality" will
						be secured, whether of fame of infamy remains to be seen. </p>
					<p>Besides he would not if he could, and could not if he would make any other
						choice. The men who have him in training know how to manage him
						successfully. They know how to appeal to his vanity, his party feelings, and
						his supidity, with irresistable power. The lure of a second term is before
						his eyes, and would besilder a sounder judgement, and a stronger hand than
						his. The puppet will be made to work as fanaticism may dictate. Nor will the
						Clerk let such obsolete scruples as official integrity and public justice
						stand between him and the "loaves and fishes."</p>
					<p>It is in this way that McPherson, with the sanction of the political

<b>The Texas Returns--Infamous Fraud</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contends that the Republicans manipulated the votes of the soldiers
					stationed in Texas, in an attempt to reverse Calvin Duncan and William Stenger's
					election victories.<br>(Names in announcement:  Calvin Duncan,  William Stenger,   Kuhn,   Suesserott, Col. D. Watson Rowe,  Daniel Stoner,  Matthew McConnell,  John Hall,  James Carbaugh,  Levi T. Robinson,  James Hallet,  David H. Hafleigh, Col.  Stumbaugh,  David McConaughy)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>When the greater portion of the Democratic party opposed the extension of the
						right of suffrage to the soldiers to the soldiers in the field, it was not
						because they believed that those gallant men were incapable of appreciated,
						and making proper use of the ballot, but because they believed that
						unscrupulous partizans would take advantage of this opportunity and seek to
						carry elections by the basest frauds. The sequel has shown the wisdom of
						that opposition.</p>
					<p>The "Given Fraud" in Philadelphia, is an illustration on a large scale of the
						iniquity of abolition politicians, and the insecurity of the law extending
						the right of suffrage to any class of citizens outside of the limits of the
						Commonwealth.</p>
					<p>The "Given Fraud," however, does not stand alone. The Democratic candidate
						for Senator, in the 19th Senatorial District, and the Democratic candidate
						for District Attorney in this county, were elected by small majorities.</p>
					<p>The soldier vote returned before the second meeting of the Return Judges
						failed to change the result, and C. M. Duncan, Esq., received his
						certificate as Senator, and Wm. S. Stenger, Esq., received his certificate
						and was duly sworn into office as District Attorney.</p>
					<p>It was too much for our immasculate Abolition friends to endure.</p>
					<p>That all the candidates on their ticket should succeed at the polls except
						that prince of brainless fops and the gallant Colonel who had covered
						himself with glory on hard-fought battle fields, was exceedingly mortifying
						indeed. And that the brave Colonel who had fought for his country should be
						beaten in this loyal country by the man who was denounced by the Repository as "having no claims whatever on Union
						men"--who had been published over the State as a copperhead so vile that
						even General Jenkins felt it his duty to "snub him." This was "the most
						unkindest cut of all." </p>
					<p>There was one way to defeat Duncan and Stenger. Political virtue hung her
						head; the thing must be fixed; our "boys in blue" were sill in Texas. There
						were battery "B" and company "A." Returns would certainly be in from that
						distant State. Surveyor Kuhn and Physician Suesserott swear that they
						believe that there was a majority of fifty for Colonel Rowe in the 77th
						Regiment. What mattered it to them that the Holy Word says, swear not at
						all&gt; Up to the mark they marched, read the affidavit and gulped it
						down. Twenty "respectable" citizens certify to the same effect.</p>
					<p>Are we to believe that Kuhn and Sueserott know that the return were in
						preparation of "cooking?" Somebody must have deceived them; they swear to
						fifty, and the cooks only prepared seventeen for Rowe. Our sympathies go
						out, in spite of us, towards these two men who were used as swearing
						machines.</p>
					<p>Seventeen votes were returned from battery "B" against Stenger--Seventeen
						from this county and four from Adams county, from battery "B," and ten from
						company "A" against Duncan. The names of the Judges who are represented as
						making this return from the batter, are Daniel Stoner and Matthew McConnell.
						The Clerks are John Hall and James Carbaugh.</p>
					<p>There was a poll opened in the battery on election day. Daniel Stoner,
						Matthew McConnell and Levi T. Robinson were the Judges, James Hallett and
						David H. Hafleigh were the Clerks.</p>
					<p>The votes cast there on that day were some twenty-four or five for the State
						ticket and five votes for Colonel Stumbaugh.
						There was not a single vote cast for David McConaughy, nor for D. Watson
						Rowe. </p>
					<p>Furthermore, there was never any return made of that
							election. The papers were never signed at all, the tickets were
							abandoned. The officers of the election will swear to these
						facts, and yet seventeen are returned for Rowe and twenty-one for
						McConaughy. We pause for a reply from Dr. J. L. Suesserott; we pause for a
						reply from Emanuel Kuhn; we pause for a reply from the twenty "respectable"
						citizens who signed Col Rowe's petition. </p>
					<p>But it will be seen that John Hall and James Carbaugh, whose names are signed
						to these returns, were never in the Board of Election
							officers after all. Judges and Clerks, with one voice say that wherever their names appear upon these returns as
							having been signed by them, they are forged. One of the clerks swears
							that he can not write his own name. He is returned as a voter. He
						swears that he did not vote at all, and never did,
							because he could not sign the return. We do not suspect
						Suesserott and Kuhn of being concerned in this forgery--they are "honorable"
						men--but let this be a lesson to their pious souls--let them think hereafter
						before they swear, and remember that they must one day answer before the
						dread tribunal for the deeds done in the body. They may
							then cease to be machines. Four of the men returned as voters
						were forty miles away from the battery on the day of election. </p>
					<p>One of the men returned as voting for McConaughy and Howe was never with the
						batter in Texas, but was in this county on the day of election. Six of the
						men returned as voters are not, and never were residents of this county. And
						so we might go on. Citizens of Franklin county, by such means as these do
						the reckless scoundrels of the Abolition party seek to thwart your will,
						expressed at the ballot box.</p>
					<p>Having buried honor and common decency they seek by fraud to dispossess of
						their offices the men you have elected as Senator and District Attorney. It
						becomes the honest men of both parties--the men who do not allow political
						prejudices to warp their judgments and stifle their consciences, to speak
						out boldly in denunciations of this atrocious fraud and to lend a helping
						hand to discover if possible the infamous perpetrators of this outrage, so
						that prompt and severe punishment may be visited upon them.</p>
					<p>We do not fear that this fraudulent return will work its purpose. It will not
						stand and hour's test in a Court of Justice. Mr. Stenger is certain
						therefore to retain his position as District Attorney of the county. And
						even a partisan committee will not, cannot, be so utterly lost to honor as
						to admit a vote which bears upon its face the evidence of forgery and, which
						under the testimony that will be adduced will be shown to be one of the most
						atrocious, and at the same time, one of the most stupid frauds that ever was
						committed. Mr. Duncan is certain therefore to represent this District in the
						Senate for hte next three years.</p>

					<p>The Ohio Republican caucus last night, was attended by sixteen members, and

					<p>The Republican members of Congress to the number of one hundred twenty-four,
						met in caucus to-night in the hall of Representatives. No members were
						present from any of the late insurrectionary States.</p>
					<p>Hon. Justin S. Morrill, of Main, was appointed Chairman, and Hon. Ignatius
						Donnelly of Minnesota, Secretary.</p>
					<p>On motion, a committee of seven was appointed, consisting of Messrs. Stevens,
						of Pennsylvania; Raymond, of New York; Spalding, of Ohio; Wasburnd, of
						Illinois; Payne of Wisconsin; Boutwell, of Massachusetts; and Blaine, of
						Maine, who reported the following resolution:</p>
					<p>Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of
							the United States in Congress assembled That a joint committee of
						fifteen members shall be appointed, nine of whom shall be members of the
						House and six of the Senate, who shall inquire into the condition of the
						States which formed the States of the so-called Confederate States of
						America, and whether they or any of them are entitled to be represented in
						either House of Congress, with leave to report at any time by bill or
						otherwise; and until such report shall have been made an finally acted upon
						by Congress, no member shall e received into either House from any of the
						said so-called Confederate States; and papers relating to the
						representatives of the said States shall be referred to the said committee
						without debate. </p>
					<p>This resolution was adopted unanimously, and will be offered in the house of
						Representatives by Mr. Stevens, the chairman of the special committee, who
						prepared it.</p>
					<p>The caucus desired to refer the contested case of Koonts and Coffroth, of
						Pennsylvania to the Committee on Elections, when appointed, to report on the
						subject. The returns of each were considered irregular by the Governor of
						the State.</p>
					<p>The caucus proceeded to the selection of candidates for officers of the
						House, when Hon. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, was adopted for the
						Spearkership by acclamation, and so was Hon. Edward McPherson, of
						Pennsylvania, for Clerk. Sergeant-at-Arms Oldway, of New Hampshire, was also
						renominated unanimously, Colonel Ingraham having withdrawn as a candidate.
						The vote for Doorkeeper was, for Goodenow, of New York, 66 and for Hawkins
						Taylor, of Kansas, 58. Mr. Goodenow having the highest number of votes, his
						nomination was made unanimous. Colonel Given was selected as candidate for
						Postmaster in the place of the present incumbent, Mr. King. With this
						exception, all the officers of the former House have been renominated.</p>
					<p>The caucus then adjourned.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Since the commencement of the war articles of prime necessity of every kind
						have advance fully three hundred per cent. The wages of mechanics and
						laborers have advances in nearly a corresponding ratio, and from two to
						three dollars per day is now realized by that class. The advance even as
						regards these has not been in proportion to the enhanced prices of
						everything consumed in their families, yet they are considerably better off
						than those whose labors are really more onerous--we mean the teachers of our
						public schools. In many districts of the county we learn that teachers are
						offered the pitiful sum of from $24 to $35 per month. With butter at forty
						cents per pound, coffee, sugar, tea, flour and everything else in
						proportion, we would ask how are these men to live. The business of a

						pay his boarding, if a single man, or to provide for his family if married,
						we cannot possibly perceive. We would earnestly call the attention of school
