<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The fanatical Abolitionists who are crazy to carry on this horrid war go off
                        into ecstasies over every idle rumor of successes attained by our armies in
                        the field. Their passions and their prejudices will never permit them to
                        take a calm view of such reports--to ascertain, in the first place, if there
                        is any truth in them, and if true, whether any permanent advantage is gained
                        to our cause. They catch up with eagerness and believe the most improbable
                        and ridiculous stories, and though deceived and cheated, time and again, by
                        similar fabrications, they are just as ready to pin their faith to the next
                        that comes along and cling to the belief as obstinately, thus verifying, in
                        the most striking manner, the lines of the poet:</p>
                    <p>"Faith--fanatic faith--once wedded fast <br>To some dear falsehood, hugs it
                        to the last."</p>
                    <p>Their past experience in bogus war news is of no avail; so thoroughly are
                        they demented, by their chronic attack of negro-phobia, that they cannot
                        even learn a lesson in the hard school in which fools are taught. They are
                        to be pitied--their case is a deplorable one, and all that we can do for
                        them is to</p>
                    <p>"Pray the powers to mend their mental flaw, <br>Or grant them kindest
                        keepers and clean straw."</p>
                    <p>Another peculiarity of their madness is this: Should any staid Democrat
                        venture to doubt their war rumors--expose their fallacy--or point out their
                        mistakes and discrepancies, they forthwith raise a crazy howl over him and
                        denounce him as a "traitor" and a dangerous person to be at large. You are
                        required to believe the most enormous falsehoods--magnify all disasters into
                        victories, and put the best face on things generally, or you will excite in
                        them a paroxysm of madness terrible to behold! The rule with them is to
                        believe all they hear, imagine more than is told, and exaggerate all they
                        repeat, and you are expected to swallow it all as gospel or come under the
                        ban of "disloyalty."</p>
                    <p>When the movements of our armies compelled the evacuation of Savannah it was
                        a "big thing" for the Abolitionists to rejoice over, but when Charleston and
                        Wilmington came tumbling after their exultation knew no bounds. The "back
                        bone of the rebellion" had received a compound fracture beyond the skill of
                        the most expert bone-setter to restore! They had preached up the doctrine
                        that England supplied the rebels with all their war material, through these
                        ports, and that the rebellion would have fizzled out long ago were it not
                        for the aid it obtained from abroad. There was not an Abolitionist in the
                        land who did not profess to believe this, and now that these ports were
                        captured the rebellion was on its last legs--the last rebel had found the
                        last ditch and there given up the ghost! Nothing remained to be done but to
                        confiscate the property in the rebel States and parcel it out among negro
                        soldiers and cotton speculators. Occasionally an imprudent Democrat could be
                        found fool-hardy enough to cast a doubt over this pleasing aspect of
                        affairs. He might be so bold as to venture to suggest that we have lost more
                        than we have gained by the capture of these places--that their garrisons,
                        and those at other points evacuated, have given the rebels an active army in
                        the field of over seventy thousand veterans--enough to hold Sherman in
                        check. The aforesaid incautious Democrat might also venture to throw out an
                        intimation that Brother Jonathan is a better friend to the rebels than
                        Jo[h]nny Bull--that he will furnish them with all the supplies needful to
                        carry on the rebellion at less risk and on more accommodating terms than
                        could be obtained from foreign blockade runners. Our Democratic friends
                        would of course, not be so reckless as to hazard this assertion without
                        being backed up by sound Abolition authority--the real simon pure,
                        negro-loving, loyalty stripe! He would, therefore, respectfully refer them
                        to the report on the bill to abolish the present system of trading with the
                        rebellious States, and which Lincoln failed to sign. The report was prepared
                        by the House Committee in Congress, of which that rank Abolitionist,
                        Washburne, of Illinois, is chairman. The following extract is taken from the
                        report:</p>
                    <p>"The rebel armies east and west of the Mississippi river have been mainly
                        supplied for the last twelve months by the unlawful trade carried on on
                        [sic] that river, and that the city of New Orleans, since its occupation by
                        our forces, has contributed more to the support of the rebel armies and to
                        the purchase and equipment of privateers that are preying upon our commerce,
                        as well as to maintain the credit of the rebel government in Europe, than
                        any port in the country."</p>
                    <p>This statement is undeniable and in the face of it well may we inquire what
                        has been gained by the occupation by our forces of Savannah, Charleston and
                        Wilmington, if these places are to be turned to no better account than New
                        Orleans in subduing the rebellion? It must be remembered that all persons
                        allowed licenses to trade with and supply the rebels are intensely loyal and
                        pets of this administration, otherwise they would not obtain permits, and of
                        this "numerous class" it is said, in the report already quoted, "they follow
                        in the track of the army, traf[f]ic in its blood and barter the cause for
                        which it is fighting with all the baseness of Judas Iscariot, but without
                        his remorse." Vive la loyalty!</p>

                    South Carolina Sea Islands, currently living in conditions reportedly worse than

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The notorious Anti-slavery Society, which has troubled the country for
                        thirty-five years, is about to close its dishonorable career. Garrison, who
                        has been the chief conspirator in its destructive work, has turned his back
                        upon it, and is now laboring to terminate its existence. He has become
                        interested in Abraham Lincoln, and has constituted himself Lincoln's
                        apologist. His declarations before the Society, and in his paper, go to the
                        extent "that the President can do no wrong." But many in the Society, and
                        among them the most eloquent and influential members, true to their old
                        instincts, indulge in severe criticism of the President and his
                        administration. Garrison has in vain tried to stem the tide against his
                        favorite, but failing in the attempt he has resorted to stratagem to break
                        up the Society. He sold it out and all its influence to Mr. Lincoln's party,
                        and he is angry that his former followers will not ratify the bargain.</p>
                    <p>These are the facts disclosed to impartial observers in the recent meetings
                        of the society in the Melodeon. The Garrison and Phillips wings stood in
                        battle array against each other. The Phillips faction proved the strongest,
                        because consistent with their past history and declarations. The mantle has
                        fallen from the anti-slavery leader. He is no longer recognized by them. He
                        is shorn of his strength. They who worshiped him have had their eyes opened,
                        and find that he is weak and like a very common man.</p>
                    <p>The discussions at the meeting yesterday afternoon and evening took a wide
                        range. Mr. Stephenson, a man active in freedmen's aid societies, hoped all
                        personalities would be laid aside. He contemplated the negro in his
                        condition as a "freedman," as so much clear gain to New England
                        manufacturers. The slaves are not good customers; the efreedman [sic] is a
                        liberal purchaser.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Knox, who had been down South, at Beaufort, among the islands within
                        Saxton's lines, and who said he spoke the literal truth, from actual
                        experience, declared that the whole idea of "freedmen" was a hideous joke,
                        the President's emancipation proclamation a sham. The so-called freedmen of
                        the South were, to-day, as bad off as they were in slavery; worse off than
                        before the war, for the Northern men who have gone down there and undertaken
                        the charge of the "poor negro," in the name of philanthropy, were full as
                        wicked, as oppressive, as tyrannical--yes, more wicked and avaricious than
                        the original slaveholders. The day wages for a negro on the Sea Island
                        cotton fields is worth $4 a day, at the present prices for cotton; but they
                        who hold the plantations make the negro work for fifteen cents a day, and if
                        he dares to complain, is treated with the foulest language, abused in
                        various cruel ways, scourged, told he is not worthy of freedom if he
                        complains, and threatened with immediate enlistment into the army. In this
                        way they are forced to submit to the most galling servitude.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Knox then turned his attention to the Freedmen's Society. He
                        characterized it as "The God Forsaken National Freemen's Aid Society!" It
                        was a humbug, a cheat; obtained funds under false pretences to buy goods,
                        which they sell to the negroes and then pocket the money. The society,
                        united with new Northern slaveholders, were grinding the negroes to the
                        dust, in the name of humanity, and growing rich out of the sufferings of the
                        blackman and the miseries of the country. As for General Saxton, Dr. Knox
                        declared in the most emphatic terms, and repeated the declaration; that
                        "Gen. Saxton, who is a coward and a rascal, stands at the head of this
                        oppression, and is, practically, the leader and the head of the slaveholders
                        at Port Royal." [Cries of shame! shame! it's a lie! it's a lie! put him
                        out!" hisses, groans, applause, &amp;c.]</p>
                    <p>Geo Thompson in the course of some remarks offered by him, agreed with Mr.
                        Philips that the liberties of America should not be entrusted in the hands
                        of politicians and Generals in the army. If the people do not see to it that
                        the negro has given to him the full measure of his liberties, then the
                        American Republic cannot stand. The wrath of God will be upon them. He said
                        that in the light of the Declaration of Independence, America has lived a
                        lie from the 4th of July 1776, to the present time. Give the negro justice,
                        full justice, and the American Republic will stand forever.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Philips wanted everything to be laid aside at present to make way for the
                        great question before the American people at the present time, shall
                        Louisiana be admitted into the Union with her present slavery? The duty of
                        this meeting was to send out a strong and unanimous No. We must demand of
                        Congress to repudiate the so called freedom but in reality the slavery of
                        Louisiana, and refuse her entrance in her present state.</p>
                    <p>After other remarks, the resolutions of Mr. Philips were adopted and the
                        meeting was dissolved.</p>
