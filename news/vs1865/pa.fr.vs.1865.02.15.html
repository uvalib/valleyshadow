<b>The Conscription Laws</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the U.S. Senate on Monday Mr. Buckalew's amendment, striking out the third
                        section of the enrollment law of last winter--which permits recruiting
                        agents to visit Southern States to obtain recruits for State credit--was
                        adopted by a vote of 28 yeas to 12 nays--9 of the nays being cast by New
                        England Senators. Both Massachusetts Senators--Wilson and Sumner--opposed
                        the amendment. The reason for this opposition, says the Patriot &amp; Union, is not hard to understand by those who
                        know that Massachusetts has, during the past year, been doing most of her
                        fighting on a German and negro basis.</p>
                    <p>During the discussion it was stated, by Mr. Saulsbury, that immediately on
                        the fall of Savannah, Massachusetts had her agents on hand, without
                        authority, to fill her quotas; that after the slaves had been put on
                        shipboard Gov. Andrew made application to the President for permission to
                        enlist them and it had been granted. Mr. Wilson "did not know anything about
                        it; Gov. Andrew was an earnest, determined man, and would enlist loyal black
                        men; and that if Massachusetts agents got there first it showed that they
                        traveled faster than other agents."</p>
                    <p>It will cost Massachusetts and her "hub" many a pang now that they will have
                        to fall back upon their own raw material; but as they yet have the
                        comforting assurance of a surplus credit of about 8,000 "black loyalists"
                        fortunately secured on Sherman's raid before this embargo was laid. What the
                        "hub" will do for the future emergencies, is hard to say. Perhaps it may
                        determine to import a few cargoes of John Chinamen; or, better yet, to ship
                        a few cargoes of the surplus old maids to California and Oregon, as
                        recommended by the Governor, and, by a sharp arrangement of exchange, get
                        able-bodied male recruits for them. This would be quite up to the usual
                        style of Massachusetts financiering, and the world would not be in the least
                        astonished to hear of its successful accomplishment. The wonder is that it
                        has not already been attempted.</p>

<b>Why Shoddy Wants to Abolish Slavery</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Accuses Republican supporters of abolition of caring "nothing for the
                    negro."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Patriot &amp; Union</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Let every Democrat in the land keep this fact steadily in view: That the
                        Shoddy leaders care nothing for the abolition of slavery as a measure of
                            philanthropy, but everything for it as a
                            political measure. All their fine blather
                        about "universal freedom," the "rights of man," the "barbarism of slavery,"
                        &amp;c., is but the thin varnish over a magnificent political scheme by
                        which they hope to destroy the Democratic party, and retain control of the
                        reins and patronage of the Government. Now and then the confession slips out
                        of one of their too-well greased organs. For instance: The shoddy postal
                        organ of Thursday, in a howl about the failure of the ratification
                        resolution in the State Senate, for want of a quorum, says:</p>
                    <p>"It only delays the triumph, which is to rid the land of slavery And Thus
                            save the Government for all time, from the
                            pollutions of modern Democracy."</p>
                    <p>Is anything more needed to convince any Democrat of the despicable designs of
                        the shoddy politicians? Through this "triumph" (i.e. the abolition of
                        slavery) "the Government for all time" is "thus"
                        to be saved from the "pollutions" of "Democracy." The Negro is not to be
                        benefitted--oh no! The "rights of man" are not to be thought of, if the man
                        is a "Nigger." Only the "rights" of the Shoddy "man" to govern, speculate
                        and plunder the Government are to be considered. The all important object in
                        the destruction of slavery is, therefore, the destruction of the Democratic
                        party and the elevation of Shoddy.</p>
                    <p>We long ago said, and repeatedly, that the crusade carried on against slavery
                        was really to destroy democracy. The war has been conducted, for the past
                        four years, not against the Southern people as rebels but as Democrats. The shoddy
                        leaders feared to restore the Union until after they had destroyed slavery
                        (which, they believed made Democrats of nearly all the Southern people.)
                        After they have destroyed Democracy, then, and not till then, will a single
                        shoddy leader consent to a re-union of the States. They are not patriots;
                        they are not "loyalists;" they are demagogues and cormorants. They care
                        nothing for the negro--nothing for their country. Self, self, self--is their
                        stole animating principle. Time will most fully expose their schemes of
                        ambition and cupidity.--Patriot &amp;

                    <p>Correspondence of the Valley Spirit.</p>
                    <p>Harrisburg, Feb. 11, 1865.</p>
                    <p>Both Houses of the Legislature re-assembled on Monday evening at 7 1/2
                        o'clock. The session was consumed in going through with the regular order of
                        business. Quite a number of bills were read in place, none of which,
                        however, are of any general importance. A resolution was introduced and
                        passed in the House, tendering the thanks of the House and the people of the
                        State to Governor Curtin for his letter to President Lincoln, and for the
                        correct position taken in that letter in defence of the citizens of
                        Pennsylvania. This resolution was permitted by the Republican members to
                        pass, not, however, without some very wry faces on their side of the House.
                        When the vote was taken the Democrats unanimously voted "aye," whilst the
                        Republicans, with the exception of a few faint "noes," refused to vote at
                        all, thus showing that they were ready to "lick the hand that smites them,"
                        but lacked the moral courage to make an open issue with the Governor of
                        their own choosing.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday evening, the Senate resolutions ratifying the amendment to the
                        Constitution abolishing slavery, came up in the House for final action. The
                        discussion was opened on the Republican side by the reading of some three or
                        four long and prosy essays on the evils of slavery, the last, and longest,
                        and dullest of which was read by a youthful looking member from Crawford,
                        whose appearance, manner, and matter indicated that he had but recently been
                        discharged from the sophomore class of some western college. The young man
                        had about two quires of closely written pages of foolscap before him, which
                        he read to a wearied and "bored" audience in true sophomoric style, but
                        evidently to his own infinite satisfaction. After the herculean task was
                        ended, he wiped the profuse perspiration from his brow and smiled most
                        graciously upon the audience, looking as well pleased with himself as a
                        young bride during the first week of her honey-moon. The debate was
                        continued on the Democratic side by Messrs. Hakes and Boyer in able and
                        forcible speeches against the amendment. The resolutions were passed by a
                        strict party vote. Mr. Sharpe was not present to participate in the
                        discussion, (having been unavoidably detained on account of sickness in his
                        family), but asked leave the next day to have his remarks published in the
                            Legislative Record, which was granted.</p>
                    <p>The house on Thursday and Friday was mostly occupied in considering bills on
                        the public calender [sic]. The bill which excited the most interest and
                        elicited the most discussion was that in relation to the river beds in the
                        oil region. The discussion on this bill was at times quite animated and
                        exciting. It was defended by Messrs: Searight, McClure, McAfee, Pancoast and
                        Allen, and opposed by Messrs. Burgwin, Sharpe, Cochran (Erie), Cochran
                        (Phila.), Wells, Waddell, Satterthwait, Thonas [sic] and Markley, Mr.
                        Cochran (Phila.) moved to refer the bill to the Committee on Ways and Means,
                        which was carried by a vote of 47 yeas to 43 nays. It will probably pass
                        eventually. Both Houses have adjourned over from Friday to Monday evening at
                        the usual hour,--7 1/2 o'clock,--and most of the members have gone home.</p>
                    <p>The weather is very cold, snow a foot deep and sleighing excellent.</p>
