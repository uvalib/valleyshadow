                        Before the speaker had concluded the committee returned and reported the
                        following;</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Preamble and Resolutions</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Whereas</emph>, The Agricultural College of Pennsylvania
                        was originated, and has been organized by the industrious classes, to remedy
                        evils arising out of the distaste for manual labor, imbibed at our literary
                        institutions of learning, as well as our Agricultural Societies, have wholly
                        failed to supply. And </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Whereas</emph>, The industrial classes have regained the
                        control and government of the institution which they have thus originated
                        and organized by reserving to themselves the election annually of three
                        trustees, in the exercise of which right we are now here assembled as
                        electors; therefore </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That whatever, in the management of the
                        Agricultural College of Pennsylvania, has been wrongly done, whatever has
                        been omitted, that should have been done, may, in part, at least be justly
                        attributable to our negligence, and that a sure remedy against the
                        recurrence of similar evils will be found in our own vigilance. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the Agricultural College of
                        Pennsylvania, conducted successfully for six years, under great
                        disadvantages, and great embarrassment, in less than one-third of the
                        College building, has commended itself to public confidence, and given
                        assurance of ultimate and entire success. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the indomitable energy, untiring
                        perseverence, generous liberality, and self-sacrifices of the turstees, as
                        well as pressing forward the work upon the College and other necessary
                        buildings and supplying the funds required, as in securing from Congres the
                        grant of land to the several States which should provide Colleges for the
                        benefit of Agriculture and the mechanic arts, commend them to the public
                        confidence and esteem. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That vitally important as are "The
                        Experimental" and the "Model Farms," the completion of the College building,
                        the erection of the Barn, the President's and Professor's houses and
                        necessary outbuildings, were still more important; and these, requiring an
                        expenditure of fifty thousand dollars beyond the funds of the institution,
                        are a full justification of the trustees against the imputation, of
                        negligence. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the endowment arising from the
                        investment for the proceeds of the sale of the Agricultural College Land
                        Scrip, which cannot exceed thirty-seven thousand dollars a year, is
                        absolutely required to render the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania what
                        it should be, and that the same can be more economically and beneficially
                        expended in one than in more than one institution. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the literary and sectarian
                        institutions of the State, whose officers and agents have, for the last two
                        years, been soliciting the Legislature for a portion of the proceeds of the
                        Agricultural Land Scrip, under the pretence that <emph rend="italic">they
                            will qualify</emph> themselves to discharge the duties required, have no
                        just claim thereto; and that a grant of the appropriations (), would the
                        palpable violation of the trust imposed by the act of Congress and a
                        consequent forfeiture of the fund. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the Industrial classes of
                        Pennsylvania, constituting more than three fourths of our entire population,
                        are deeply interested in the success of the Agricultural College of
                        Pennsylvania, the only literary or scientific insitution in the State
                        subject to their control. And that we therefore pledge ourselves and our
                        consitutents to sustain and protect it from the assault fo prejudice upon
                            <emph rend="italic">manual labor institutions</emph> protect it against
                        the combination of our sectarian colleges to secure for themselves,
                        respectively, portions of the proceeds of the lands donated by Congres, and
                        against the further embarassments of poverty, by which it has been prevented
                        from accomplishing what it would otherwise have accomplished. </p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Address.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>The undersigned committee, appointed by the delegates from the State and
                        County Agricultural Societies, electors to the Agricultural College of
                        Pennsylvania, most respectfully submit to their constituents, the industrial
                        classes of Pennsylvania the following Address:</p>
                    <p>The literary colleges of our country furnish men well qualified to fill the
                        learned professions, but whether the sons of professional men of the sons of
                        agriculturists and mechanics, the students generally leave those
                        institutions of learning with an utter distaste for manual labor and are
                        wholly unqualified for any of the industrial pursuits of life. This great
                        defect in our educational system has been long felt and sincerely deplored.</p>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society and the several county
                        Agricultural Societies have been productive of much good. They have
                        introduced thorughout the State the best implements and machinery and have
                        greatly improved the productiveness of the soil. The annual exhibitions are
                        admirably calculated to arouse the agricultrual community from their
                        lethargy, but they are too ephermeral to fix their attention and guide them
                        by the light of science, or to protect them form the frauds that are from
                        time to time perpetrated upon them. The wants of the age, thus unsupplied by
                        our educational institutions and agricultural societies, seemed to require a
                        permanent institution, in which the sciences bearing upon the practical
                        duties of life should receive marked and special attention. An institution
                        in which more time should be devoted to physics and less to
                        metaphysics--more to the living and less to the dead languages, than in our
                        ordinary literary colleges--an industrial college founded upon the principle
                        that all labor, whether manual or mental, which conduces to man's comfort,
                        is equally honorable--a College immediately connected with an experimental
                        and with a model farm on which this great truth should be developed and
                        illustrated from day to day by the Presdient, Professor and Students--an
                        institution in which the results of the experiments, whether successful or
                        unsuccessful, should be faithfully recorded in books provided for the
                        purpose, open at all times to visitors and to publications for the benefit
                        of the commmunity--an institution to which agriculturists could resort as
                        well for social intercourse and consultaiton with each other, the President
                        and Professors, as for the improvement of their seeds, grains, vegetables
                        and farm stock--an institution so distinguished for the productions of its
                        model farm, for the luxuries of its orchards and gardens, and the beauty of
                        the shrubbery in its Campus as to make the students proud of the labor of
                        their hands--an institution at which the sons of farmers and mechanics could
                        be furnished a thorough, practical, scientific education at an expense not
                        incommensurate with the limited incomes of that class of the community.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to supply these wants, with a a capital of but fifteen thousand,
                        the Agricultural college of Pennsylvania had its origin. The enterprise,
                        however, so commended itself to public favor that the Legislature of
                        Pennsylvania appropriated one hundred thousand dollars--the State and county
                        Agricultural Societies contributed seventy-five thousand dollars; and the
                        Congress of the United States granted lands ot the several States which
                        should provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture, and the mechanic
                        arts, equal to thirty thousand acres for every Senator and Representative in
                        Congress to which the States were respectively entitled--which grant,
                        amounting to seven hundred and eighty thousand acres, the Legislature of
                        Pennsylvania on the 1st of April, 1863, accepted and appropriated the annual
                        interest accruing therefrom to the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania for
                        the endowment, support and maintenance thereof.</p>
                    <p> The trustees of the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania, thus supported and
                        encouraged, have secured four hundred acres of good limestone land,
                        susceptible of the very highest degree of improvement, an have erected
                        theron a college, a barn, dwelling houses for President and Professors and
                        other necessary buildings, at an expenditure considerably exceeding two
                        hundred thousand dollars. These structures far surpass in permanence and
                        adaptedness to the purposes for which they are intended, any Agricultural
                        College buildings in the United States. The completion of the college
                        building, within the last year, has increased the capacity of the insitution
                        for the accomodation of students from <emph rend="italic">one to four
                            hundred</emph>. For six years it has under great disadvantages, been
                        successfully conducted, in less than one-third of the college building. Thus
                        enlarged, with a President and corps of Professors, unsurpassed by those of
                        any similar insitution in the world, the Agricultural College of
                        Pennsylvania is now presented to the public--now opened for the accomation
                        of the sons of the industrial classes of our State--now, open to add dignity
                        to manual labor--now open to demonstrate the truth of the motto of one of
                        her literary societies that "Labor guided by science approximates

                    <p> Will you sustain and protect this institution, combatting the long fostered
                        prejudices of the great majority of our literary men, and literary
                        instituions, against the connection of manual labor with the acquisition of
                        scientific knowledge? Will you sustain it against the combination of
                        literary and sectarian institutions throughout the State, to obtain from the
                        legislature an appropriation to themselves of the proceeds of the lands
                        donated by Congress to endow Colleges, "the leading object of which is to
                        teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanic
                        arts," under pretence that they <emph rend="italic">will</emph> qualify
                        themselves for the discharge of the trust? Will you protect it from the
                        embarassments of poverty, under which, from its very organization to this
                        moment it has been continually suffering? that poverty which has been a bar
                        to the establishment of the "Experimental farm"--that poverty which has
                        prevented the formation and improvement of the "Model Farm" and the erection
                        of the additional barn, required on the Experimental farm--that poverty
                        which has prevented the stocking of the farm with the choicest breeds of
                        horses, cattle, sheep and hogs--that poverty which but for the indomitable
                        energy, untiring perseverance and generous liberality of the trustees would
                        have blighted all its prospects? </p>
                    <p>And yet this institution, thus struggling for life, thus excused because
                        because of its poverty, by all who know it, for not being what it should be,
                        is said by our literary sectarian institutions to be "too rich, too
                        liberally endowed," although not one dollar has been yet realized from the
                        grant. But suppose the entire land scrip converted into money at eighty
                        cents per acre, the highest price for which it can be sold, it would amount
                        to but six hundred and twenty-four thousand dollars, which, invested at six
                        per cent, would produce but thrity-seven thousand, four hundred and forty
                        dollars annually, an income greatly below that arising from the respective
                        endowments of Harvard University, Yale and Columbia colleges and other mere
                        literary Institutions of our country; an income, every dollar of which could
                        be most economically exepended yearly, in the necessary current expenses of
                        the Agricultural College. And how beneficially the entire income derivable
                        from the students could be expended, let the indebtedness of the institution
                        and the remedies for the evils and the supply for the wants, to which we
                        have just referred, answer. The learned professions have their colleges and
                        schools, the Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian, Lutheran,
                        Catholic and others have their denominational institutions scattered thorugh
                        the length and readth of the land. The schools of law are conducted by
                        lawyers, the schools of medicine by doctors, the literary sectarian
                        institutions by the respective denominations at whose instance they have
                        been incorporated and endowed. The industrial classes of Pennsylvania
                        constitute three-fourths of our entire population, and yet what institution
                        of learning within the bounds of the Commonwealth do you govern or control.
                        Not one, except the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania. Here and here
                        only, is your voice heard through the representatives of the State and
                        Agricultural societies at every recurring annual election of trustees.</p>
                    <p>You can mould the policy of the Institution to advance the interest of the
                        great masses of the community to which they belong.</p>
                    <p>Electors of the Trustees, you are the sovereigns of the Agricultural College
                        of Pennsylvania.</p>

                        institution of learning can you as a class, exert any control? And will you
                        suffer this Agricultural College originated as we have seen, by the wants
                        and necessities of the age and thus far crippled by poverty, to be deprived
                        of the endowment mainly secured by its founders and absolutely necessary to
                        its success; deprived of it too by institutions which we have seen despise
                        industrial Colleges and only propose "to teach such branches of learning as
                        relate to Agriculture and the mechanic arts" because they love "the goodly
                        Babylonish garment an the wedge of gold" which they expect the proposition
                        to bring.</p>
                    <p>The preamble, resolutions and address were unanimously adopted, and three

                <transcript>
                    <p> In a loathsome prison cell of this State with wo burglars and a negro
                        ravisher for companions, is incarcerated a pious young Catholic priest, for
                        the crime of having preached the word of God, without having first obtained
                        a State license to do so. To obtain this license he should have taken, not
                        merely an oath of loyalty for the future, but also an oath of loyalty <emph
                            rend="italic">for the past</emph>, declaring that he had never <emph
                            rend="italic">thought</emph> or <emph rend="italic">sympathised</emph>
                        otherwise than the authorities think he should have done during the war.
                        That oath he might have probably taken, if he would only degrade his manhood
                        an his priesthood, by kneeling at the throne of the Governor--a beggar for
                        permission to preach the Gospel of the King of kings.--Another devoted
                        priest is now awiating his trial at Jefferson City for the same offense.
                        This clergyman has been from the beginning a strong Union man, and was
                        editor of the German Catholic paper of this city, which was all but radical.
                        The Jefferson City <emph rend="italic">Times</emph> classes his offense with
                        "gambling and selling whiskey without license," and says he will be tried
                        for each offense.--In a previous number the same paper mentions that some
                        persons are of opinion that a religious war is at hand, a war chiefly
                        against Catholics, and intimates that as the war against slavery commenced
                        in Kansas, that against Catholicity will commence in Missouri. </p>
                    <p> The vulgar bigotry of this paper would place it below all criticism or
                        authority, if there wre not indications that there is a spirit alive--the
                        infidel and guillotine spirit of the French Revolution--bold and wicked
                        enough to dare such a persecution. The fact that <emph rend="italic">only
                            Catholic priests have been arrested</emph>, though it is notorious that
                        they never preached politics nor rebellion,k and never even preached against
                        the new constitution--points in this direction. But the few wretched
                        radicals that would advocate such a persecution, and have in fact commenced
                        it, can never prosecute it. The respectable men of their own party (who are
                        all against the new constitution) will scarecely stain it with blood in its
                        infancy.--The honest men of every religious denomination, who feel that it
                        is not popery, but Christianity in every form, these infidels would destroy,
                        will rally round the persecuted--feeling that their turn may come next. The
                        great American principle of perfect religious freedom, which is now showing
                        itself in the condemnation of this enactment by the Eastern papers, of every
                        shade of opinion, is arrayed against the persecutors. Catholic,
                        Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist will unite against them and that church
                        which shall sufer mots, and show most fortitude in leading the van of the
                        followers of Christ, will receive the plaudits of the Amercian people, and
                        show itself the work of God! </p>

                    <p> We think that there can be no resonable doubt the radicals, headed by Wade,
                        Sumner, Stevens, Phillips, &amp; Co., will bitterly opposed the
                        admission of the Southern States into the Union next December, precisely as
                        they resisted and prevented the admission of Louisiana, during the lifetime
                        of President Lincoln; and the main ground of their opposition will be the
                        refusal or unwillingness, of the applying States, to grant universal
                        suffrage to the freedmen. But, constitutionally they cannot make this a
                        ground of objection, or they would have done so in the case or Louisiana. In
                        that instance it was the irregular and unrepublican character of the
                        government, erected according to Mr. Lincoln's proclamation, which stated
                        that the participation of one-tenth of the legal voters, would justify him
                        in accepting their actions. Upon this government Mr. Sumner heaped the
                        fiercest abuse, styling it "nothing but a stupendous hoax"--"a mere seven
                        months' abortion begotten by the bayonet in criminal conjunction with the
                        spirit of caste, and born before its time, rickety, unformed,
                        unfinished--whose continued existence will be a burden, a reproach, and a
                        wrong." And he was successful in opposing the admittance into congress of
                        its delegates. So, to avoid another and similar resistance to the admittance
                        of Louisiana, Andrew Johnson has abolished the government of that State, and
                        appointed a provisional governor, and directed a new constitution to be
                        framed, and steps, in all respects similar to those taken by the other
                        Southern States, to be pursued. Louisiana, and all the other States, will
                        present themselves with free constitutions, but such as do not recognise the
                        right of negro suffrage! And, then, what a terrible hullaballoo will be
                        raised about the "distinctions of color," and the right of the "freedmen,"
                        and the "contumacy" of the South; and the "not dead but sleeping spirit of
                        slavery," all culminating in the assertion that the members cannot
                        constitutionally be admitted until they subscribe to the oath regarded by
                        act of June, 1862, forbidding all who had <emph rend="italic"
                        >voluntarily</emph> aided or abetted war from seats in congress. And, then
                        what howls of demoniac glee will go up from the vituperative Sumner, should
                        some decline, or others be proved ineligible. How will Beecher riotously
                        cachinate in his paper and bellow infidel nonsense! And how will Greeley
                        rave and rant, and roar and "expectorate," in the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune</emph>, and heap abuse and ridicule upon the "Southern
                        chivalry'" and altogether, they will raise such a tremendous dust that the
                        eyes of many will be blinded, and they will vote against the Southern
                        delegates, contrary to all right, reason or justice.--Well let us take
                        things coolly. </p>

                        cannot trade; nor will our people feel like turning themselves to productive
                        industry until all these disturbing influences in regard to the Union, and

                <summary>In the upcoming session of Congress, the conflict between the Radicals and
                    the Democrats will come to the fore over the issue of the re-admission of the
                    former rebel states. The article states that the Radicals will undoubtedly
                    resist the process if black suffrage is not accepted by the state governments in
                    question. The Radicals, the Georgia journal predicts, will fail to achieve their
                    prescribed goal because they cannot constitutionally make this a ground of
                    objection. More importantly, it continues, the southern states will be
                    re-admitted sooner or later, regardless of whether they adopt the measures
                    allowing for the freedmen to vote, because the country is reliant on the region
                    for its agricultural products, namely cotton.</summary>
