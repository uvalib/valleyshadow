<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Under our Telegraphic head will be found the very latest intelligence of the
                        operations of the army investing Petersburg and Richmond. The official
                        despatches of President Lincoln from City Point are brief but satisfactory,
                        containing a succinct account of the results of the great struggle which
                        commenced on Friday last and culminated in the occupation of Richmond by a
                        portion of our army under Gen. Weitzel on Monday morning at 8.15. Victory,
                        entire complete and decisive has crowned our banners and Lee has been
                        compelled to yield the rebel capital to our victorious army after one of the
                        most desperate struggles of the war.</p>
                    <p>General Grant is now in hot pursuit of the retreating rebels and there is
                        every probability that he will succeed in overtaking and utterly destroying
                        the only great army of the "Confederacy," in point of numbers. Until the
                        pursuit is ended and the smoke of battle cleared away, we are unprepared to
                        indicate, with any degree of certainty, all the results likely to follow our
                        recent brilliant successes. We feel assured, however, that the "backbone" of
                        the rebellion has at length been broken beyond repair, and that though the
                        war may continue for some time, yet the
                        probability is that it will soon end. In the near future we behold visions
                        of a restored Union and a prosperous, reunited and happy people.</p>

                    <p>Hd.Qrs. Army of the Potomac, <br>April 1, 1865</p>
                    <p>The greater portion of this army has not been engaged with the enemy to-day;
                        the time being occupied in erecting works on the rear line, and repairing
                        the roads connecting the different corps.</p>
                    <p>The late rains rendered it impossible to to [sic] move the wagon trains as
                        fast as the troops advanced; one train taking forty-eight hours to move five
                        miles, one thousand men assisting, but through the untiring industry and
                        perseverence of the officers in charge of the Quartermaster's and Commissary
                        Departments, the army has been almost as well supplied as while in their old
                        quarters.</p>
                    <p>When the news of Sheridan's repulse reached here last evening a part of the
                        5th Corps was at once despatched to his aid and it is expected that to-night
                        or in the morning we shall receive good news from that quarter.</p>
                    <p>It appears that Sheridan was moving on the road leading to a place called the
                        Five Forks, which is about 3 miles from the Southside Railroad, where two
                        brigades of Picket's Division, which had been moved out in a great hurry,
                        came down on a road which runs from Sutherland Station to the one on which
                        we were. Sheridan's cavalry having for the greater part passed the junction.
                        This movement of the enemy threatened to cut him off. He, however,
                        discovered his danger in time to get his command off with only a slight
                        loss; at the same time taking about 1000 prisoners. Both the Lees were
                        present, but one of them at a respectful distance. On being reinforced this
                        morning by the 5th Corps, the enemy fell back so rapidly that their dead and
                        wounded fell into our hands, as well as those of our own unavoidably left
                        behind yesterday afternoon. The attack made on the enemy's line in front of
                        the 24th Corps, was by Foster'd Division and about 200 prisoners were
                        brought in, the 148th New York taking most of them. Some 300 or 400 yards of
                        ground was taken from them and our present line so much further advanced.</p>
                    <p>At 4 A.M. this position was assaulted and a few of our men captured, but in a
                        very short time it was retaken with about 50 prisoners and a stand of
                        colors.</p>
                    <p>Our loss up to the present time will not exceed 2500, while that of the enemy
                        on some parts of the line at least, was greater than our own but of course
                        the total cannot be given.</p>
                    <p>Major Dickinson, of the 15th New York heavy artillery, is reported wounded
                        and a prisoner.</p>
                    <p>The sharp shooters brought into the 5th Corps headquarters this morning, 15
                        cavalrymen belonging to Wm. Henry Lee's command. They had been on picket and
                        were cut off by the force which was sent to the assistance of Sheridan.</p>
                    <p>Hd. Qrs. Army of the Potomac, <br>April 1--Midnight.</p>
                    <p>A courier from Sheridan has just arrived with the most cheering news. The
                        combined forces of cavalry and Warren's infantry advanced against the enemy
                        this afternoon, driving them several miles and capturing about four thousand
                        prisoners, and a number of guns. They retreated to the Five Forks where they
                        were flanked by a part of the 5th corps which had moved down the White Oak
                        road. It was here the large number of prisoners were taken. The rebels then
                        retreated south, along the White Oak road and were vigorously pursued by
                        General Sheridan while McKenzie's cavalry, from the Army of the James,
                        advanced west on the Fork road towards the South Side road and when the
                        messenger left was only about three miles from it and would undoubtedly
                        reach it before morning. Thus the last great line of railroad the rebels
                        have to supply their capital and Lee's army is about to be severed and it is
                        firmly believed that they will immediately leave their present positions at
                        Petersburg and Richmond. Sharp cannonading is now going on near the centre
                        of the line held by the left of the 6th corps.</p>
