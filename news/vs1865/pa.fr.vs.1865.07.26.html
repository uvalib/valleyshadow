<b>No Dutch or Irish Need Apply</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter received by the editor of the Baltimore Clipper asserts that the

<b>What Has Pennsylvania Done?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Using figures made public at the Convention of State Adjutant Generals on
                    July 20th, the article proudly boasts of Pennsylvania's contribution to the war

                    State provided over 360,000 men for the Union army, a tally that far exceeds the

                    <p>In the midst of the war there was considerable boasting on the part off some
                        of our neighboring States, as to what they had done and how they were
                        excelling their sister Commonwealth, in supporting the National authorities,
                        and as a consequence, how magnificently prominent in the history and
                        admiration of the people of the world, the authorities and the citizens of
                        such States would appear. In the meantime, Pennsylvania worked on steadily
                        and, as it were, silently. Like a Conestoga wheel horse, she tugged at the
                        load on the Nation carrying it onward to its destiny, satisfied to wait for
                        her reward when the work was done and the end reached. The record is now
                        open, and all the facts are spread before the country for its judgment and
                        consideration, and in order to call public attention to the mattermore than
                        it has yet been, we repeat in a censpicuous form the statistics emanating
                        from the Convention of State Adjutant Generals, which met in Boston, on

                    <p><br> The fact elicited by these figures is a glorious one for the people of
                        the Keystone State. It thus sets forth in a manner which cannot be
                        controverted, that Pennsylvania has furnished troops in a larger proportion
                        than any of the Eastern States, if we may except Rhode Island. Massachusetts
                        is the only State which has sent three-fourths of her arms-bearing
                        population. Pennsylva- far exceeds this ratio, and Rhode Island is the only
                        State which can take position with the Keystone in the achievement of the
                        same results. Kansas, if she has not increased her population since 1860,
                        must have sent into the field her entire adult inhabitants. But it is well
                        remembered that just previous to the war, the emigration to Kansas was
                        immense, hundreds of the citizens of Pennsylvania having settled in that far
                        distant State. </p>
                    <p>In alluding to these facts it must be remembered that the figures given above
                        do not include the colored troops, of whom Pennsylvania furnished a large
                        number, while they do include the Massachusetts colored troops, and most
                        likely also those of Kansas. Pennsylvania contributed largely to the colored
                        organizations of Massachusetts. Recruiting officers for Massachusetts
                        colored regiments carried a large number of men from this city, so that even
                        in her colored troops, if justice be done in the calculation, Pennsyvania
                        exceeds the States enumerated above. In addition to these facts, if we could
                        add to our total all the colored troops raised in Pennsyvania by the United
                        States officials, as well as the white and black men raised here for New
                        York, New Jersey, Delaware and Masachusetts regiments, our State would
                        astonish every one by her aggregate. But, taking the figures as they stand,
                        we think they may challenge the attention of all, as shwing the immense
                        strength of this noble old Commonwealth. Pennsylvania has patiently bided
                        her time for justice, and now when white-winged peace folds her her pinions
                        over the land, and prosperity promises to bless the inhabitants thereof,
                        justice and honor and glory attend on the glorious old Keystone State. She
                        has faithfully discharged her duty and the figures prove it. What more could
                        she ask?</p>

                        the public press to give voice to their almost universal condemnation. By
                        our clear recognition of this duty, and our appreciation of the grave
                        importance of the subject, we have been led to recar to it again and again.
                        --We believe that in denouncing the dangerous innovation, which owes its
                        inauguration and certainly its prolonged existence to Secretary Stanton, no
                        patriotic public speaker or writer can be too emphatic. We have reason to
                        believe that the people will not grow weary of the discussion, however
                        frequent may be its renewal. They feel the evil more deply than officials at
                        Washington seem to imagine.</p>
                    <p>This public feeling has arisen not so much from any particular action of
                        these "Commissions," as from the far more important consideration of their
                        entire unlawfulness. When, therefore, by common consent, the people condemn,
                        as without authority of law, the action of their public servants, its
                        continuance is tyranny or despotism. Under our system of government there
                        can be no legitimate proceedings on the part of officers of any of its
                        departments which find their authority elsewhere than in the Constitution or
                        the laws enacted in obedience to or in conformity with its provisions.</p>
                    <p>"Military Commissions" are justly detested and condemned as the despotic
                        exercise of power, without authority or sanction of the Constitution or the
                        laws which it justifies. The Government of the United States is a political
                        organization deriving its powers from the people. It is a representatvie
                        system, by which the citizens have their political power present in every
                        department or branch of the government. The representative department
                        proper--the legislature--is the primary expression of this power. The
                        executive department is what may be called its secondary expression. --The
                        judicial is the third department, and further removed from the direct
                        exercise of the sovereign will of the people; yet, the judiciary reflects
                        this sovereign power, through the executive nomination to and the
                        legislative confirmation of its constiutional functions. It has its
                        accountability to the political power, by impeachment. --The Constitution of
                        the United States is the foundation on which the powers of these departments
                        rest. Neither can perform a single act which is not warranted by the terms
                        of this organic power. It gives life to the system--without it, "the
                        government" dies--and the system is changed, revolutionized, and becomes
                        anarchy or despotism.</p>
                    <p>The executive branch of our form of government is the President. He is aided
                        in the performance of his duties by his appointed officers, who are only
                        sub-divisions of the executive authority. They have no independent
                        authority. The legislature enables the executive to act, in conformity with
                        the constitutional requirements obligatory upon the law-making and
                        law-enforcing branches of the political system. The treasury departments are
                        the instruments which the executive employs to perform the duties which the
                        Constitution and Congress authorize. The War Department is as subject to law
                        as the Postoffice Department in our system of government. A mail route is
                        created by law, and a fort, or a regiment, or an army, has no other
                        existense. The War Department is organized, as is the postal service, to aid
                        in the execution of the law, and it has no duty to perform which Congress
                        and the Constitution do not create or enjoin. True, the War Department is
                        more active when the power of executing the law is opposed by insurrection,
                        rebellion or invasion; but this condition of public affairs gives it no
                        power which is not conferred by the Constitution or Congress. --The
                        Postoffice Department, opposed or impeded in its service, can claim no
                        authority to act in such cases, unless the law provides such authority, nor
                        would such a claim be tolerated. War is the exceptional condition of public
                        affairs. It is that relation between systems of government, which, leaving
                        the civil laws of each for the conduct of each, invokes a special law for
                        the decision of issues made by the political policy of either or both. A
                        rebellion, or civil war, neither creates nor destroys rights or powers in
                        our political system. It gains no political power until it ends, and then
                        only by the success which attends it. The civil war, now ended with the
                        South, gave, during its existence, no power to the Executive or Congress,
                        which the Constitution did not confer. If it did, then the easiest mode of
                        amending the Constiution is to create a civil war. But this mode of
                        amendment is ignored by a plan determined and defined by the Constitution
                        itself. Hence if the War Department as an agent of executive power, finds no
                        authority in times of peace for the extraordinary or implied powers, and the
                        Constiution does not authorize such action in times of civil war, by direct
                        grant, then any attempt so to act without law is an odious exercise of
                        illegal power. As well might the Postoffice Department create a "Commission"
                        to try persons and questions in times of civil war because the mail service
                        is interfered with in rebellious States or portions of States. It has the
                        same right to do this as any other branch of the executive authority--the
                        same right, no less, no more, than the War Department, to set itself above
                        the Constituion and Congress. War between nations, or governments, invokes a
                        sytem of military law which does not exist in rebellions or civil war
                        between citizens or subjects of the same government. A rebellion is an armed
                        resistance to the government by people subject to it. The execution of the
                        laws is defied, and the Executive calls on the War Department for those
                        duties in the emergency with which it is charged by the Constituion and
                        laws. Its powers are not enlarged, therefore, but those it possesses are
                        brought into action. To perform consitutional duties does not by implication
                        authorize the exercise of power which the Constitution does not warrant. To
                        justify despotism it would only be necessary for the Executive to declare
                        the existence of the rebellion, and to praclaim martial law. In such a case
                        "Military Commissions," would usurp the functions of Congress and the
                        judiciary at the will of the War Secretary. Then the Postoffice Department
                        would convene its "Commissions," and why not the Treasury Department also?
                        Where then would the consitutional powers, and the laws, and the rights of
                        the people be found? Where the sovereign power of the ballot box, with its
                        corrective appellate jurisdiction? Anarchy and despotism would be the normal
                        conditon of the country. The will of the Executive would be the governing
                        principle, and the people would be subjugated or in continual revolutionary
                        struggle for the recovery of their liberties.</p>
                    <p> To prevent, to forbid such a state of public affairs our fathers made the
                        Constitution for the people, and for the administration of their system of
                        government. It is alike sufficient for civil war and for times of peace. It
                        decrees that certain rights are not to be denied to the citizen. Trial by
                        jury is one of those rights. If it were only meant to apply to times of
                        peace, it was not necessary to decree it, for then the right is not
                        endangered. It was for all times and all circumstances, "except in cases
                        arising in the land or naval forces, or in the
                        militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger." It
                        could not have been intended by our fathers, that this right of their
                        descendants, so solemnly decreed, should be held by a tenure so insecure
                        that a few men, more or less, in Maine or Louisiana, might, by a civil
                        commotion, called a rebellion by the War Department, be denied to every man
                        in all the other States. This is the mere shallow pretext of tyranny; its
                        absurdity is apparent. These "Military Commissions" exist in places where
                        the rebellion never reached; where every civil court was open and without
                        obstruction exercising its proper functions. That there is no authority for
                        them is shown by the fact that the Constitution does not contemplate their
                        existence, and that by them rights are destroyed which the Constitution
                        decrees shall be indestructible. </p>
                    <p>If the War Department can set at defiance the rights of citizens, and refuse
                        obedience to the Constitution, it has become more powerful than the organic
                        basis of our sytem of government. If it be more powerful, it is so by force.
                        If by force the Constitution is defied succes fully, it is destroyed, and
                        this is revolution. If our system of government be so changed that its
                        agents can revolutionize and destroy it at will; if this gigantic evil has
                        grown out of the suppression of the rebellion, then indeed is the remedy
                        worse than the disease.</p>
                    <p>We cannot permit ourselves to abandon the hope than the people will yet drive
                        from power those who are thus trifling with their rights and liberties.
                        Secession, rebellion, "Military Commissions," and the thousand other
                        "chimerasdire" which have been witnessed in our land during the past four
                        years, will, as we are sure, prepare the hearts of all who love this country
                        to look with patriotic hope for the advent of the day when the principles of
                        the Constitution, and liberty, secured by law, will again have effective
                        life, restored by the re-establishment of the Democratic party in the
                        administration of the Federal Government.</p>

                    <p>The bearing of the southern people under their defeat and the immense loss of
                        property involved in the emancipation of their slaves is more generous,
                        manly and self-respecting than we had any reason to expect. From the Potomac
                        to the Rio Grande, there is not a single guerrilla band, nor any
                        demonstration of resistance to the federal authority. The influential
                        statesmen of the South, and their trusted military leaders, are disposed, to
                        a man, to acquiesce in reunion and make the best of the situation. General
                        Lee, whom the southern people almost revere, is an open applicant for pardon
                        and lends his weighty example to a sincere and faithful submission to the
                        laws. General Johnston, who stood next to Lee in southern consideration, has
                        publicly given as rational advice to his fellow citizens as could have been
                        dictated by the stanchest friends of the Union. Mr. Boyce, of South
                        Carolina, Gov. Brown, of Georgia, and other southern statesmen of equal
                        distinction have made addresses counseling acquiescence in the abolition of
                        slavery, and fealty to the federal government. The southern newspapers are
                        almost universally conducted in the same admirable and manly spirit. There
                        is no contumacious sullenness, no captious refining on the Constituion, no
                        refractory assertion of State sovereignty, no harsh criticism of the policy
                        of President Johnson, none of the haughty tone of self-assertion once so
                        characteristic of southern public men. And yet there is nothing servile or
                        craven in the general tone of acquiescence and submission. It is the
                        simplest manifestation of good sense and manly feeling, which accepts the
                        inevitable without womanish petulance, and seeks, in a straight forward
                        manner, to adapt itself to the actual situation.</p>
                    <p>As Americans, the South has given us no reason to be ashamed of our
                        countrymen. --They made, to be sure, a terrible mistake in going into this
                        contest; but once in, they bore themselves with a resolution, gallantry,
                        persistence, and fidelity to each other, which did no discredit to their
                        public spirit and soldierly qualities. The herculean and protracted
                        exertions we were compelled to make to subdue them attest their vigor and
                        valor; and, after so tough a contest, we cannot deny them the posession of
                        great qualities without humiliating self-disparagement. --But the frankness
                        of their submission, when they saw they were beaten, is as conspicuous a
                        proof of magnanimity as the chivalric determination with which they fought
                        against superior odds. It adds to our sense of national strength that, in
                        future wars with foreign powers, we shall have the support of men who
                        understand so well the duties of soldiers and citizens.</p>
                    <p> Considering their present admirable bearing, ought we to treat them as
                        friends or as enemies? When we separated from Great Britain, we proclaimed
                        to the world, in the Declaration of Independence, that we should hold the
                        Britons, like other foreign peoples, "enemies in war, in
                            peace friends." Shall we treat our own repentant brethren with
                        less malignity than foreign nations practice toward each other? Why should
                        our newspapers teem with calumnies on their character? When they so frankly
                        accept the new order of things and the mighty revolution in their social
                        system, what sense, what malignity, what decency even, is there in
                        subjecting them to needles humiliation and indignities? Nobody fears a new
                        rebellion; nobody believes that the frank submission of the South is
                        feigned; and it is unworthy the character of a great nation to practice a
                        mean, suspicious, and irritating surveilance over a proud and spirited
                        community, who bear themselves with such sense and self-command under one of
                        the greatest trials through which any people was ever called to pass. </p>

                    <p>For the last two or three years it has been the habit of the Jacobin
                        [unclear] equality editors and spouters to [unclear] make it appear that the
                        soldiers of our armies were very hostile to Democrats and democratic
                        principles. "Wait till the soldiers come home," was a kind of unlawful
                        threat that shoddyites and plunderers were constantly holding up before
                        Democrats, intimating by this menace that the soldiers, after their
                        discharge, wer to become cut-throats and assassins, and that their victims
                        were to be prominent Democrats.</p>
                    <p>The leading Jacobins, who are as cowardly as they are dishonest, would
                        rejoice could they induce the discharged soldiers to become incendiaries and
                        outlaws. Such conduct on the part of our discharged sodiers, we repeat,
                        would have been very acceptible to the negro-equality-stay-at-home patriots.</p>
                    <p> Well, the soldiers are at last coming home: thousands of them are already
                        here. We have conversed with scores of them and on several occasions had our
                        sanctum filled with them. Many who served with Sherman, and many who served
                        with Grant, in many hard-fought battles, are here, some minus an arm or a
                        leg, but all joyous because of the end of the war, and because once more
                        they are permitted to enjoy the society of the loved ones at home, and to
                        feel that they have no foe to contend with. Do they come home, filled with
                        bitterness and ready to menace Democrats, as the shoddyites hoped? No, no.
                        They talk like men of sense, are liberal in their views and patriotic in
                        their sentiments. To a man they are opposed to
                            negro-equality; opposed to negroes voting: opposed to "loyal thieves,"
                            and opposed to those heartless rascals who remained at home to fill
                            contracts and pile up magnificent fortunes at the expense of the soldier
                            and the Government. --These are the men, these the measures the
                        soldiers are hostile to: and mark it, they will let their resentment be felt
                        at the proper time and in the proper way. Hereafter they will vote as
                        freemen and as they please. Many of them remarked to us "we are now out of
                        the army, with no one to threaten us with punishment if we refuse to vote
                        the ticket furnished us; hereafter we vote according to our own judgment."
                        That's the way they talk, and, they are in
                        earnest. --Hundreds, thousands, aye, tens of thousands, who left home
                        three or four years ago, rampant Abolitionists, return cured. --They have seen enough of abolitionism; enough of the
                        doings of the leading men of that traitorous organization. One man who had
                        been a leading Aboltionist in his township, and who has been in the army for
                        more than three years, told us that he was fully convinced that the sudden
                        manner in which the slaves were set at liberty was a terrible calamity to
                        them. He had witnessed the suffering that had followed, and was horrified.
                        Gradual emancipation, he said, might have worked well, but freeing four
                        millions of slaves and turning them lose at once, thousands of them to
                        perish, was a wickedness that no man with a heart in his bosom could
                        endorse. --Those were the views of a man of sense--the views of a man who
                        entered the army a bigoted Abolitonist, and who returns home a full believer
                        in the principles of the Democratic party. Hereafter he will act with and
                        vote with us. </p>
                    <p>"Wait till the soldiers come home." --Well, we have waited patiently, and
                        right glad are we to see the soldiers and hear them talk. They are with the
                        Democrats, and the only men against whom we hear them hurl their curses are
                        the "loyal thieves" and the negro-equality advocates. Thank, God, the
                        soldiers are again freemen, and cannot be approached by a hireling of the
                        Government, or instructed how to vote.</p>

                    <p>"The rebels of the South, in all they have done and said since fighting
                        ceased, have failed to give evidence of fitness for the resumption of civil
                        rights. It has been made manifest that the people of the Southern States who
                        were lately in open war against the government, are still under the full
                        influence of the spirit that animated them during the four years of bloody
                        war. To restore to such a people, under thesee circumstances, the State
                        Governments, and admit their representatives to seats in Congress would be
                        to re-establish the state of things that precipitated the war for the
                        destruction of the National Government. Recent events have made this
                        perfectly clear."</p>
                    <p>It is not quite apparent what the rebels have done since fighting ceased. It
                        would seem more dignified, and certainly much less like anxiety to
                        accomplish a partisan political end, if such writers would wait a decent
                        length of time, at least until something blameworthy has been done, before
                        demning a race of people. It is generally supposed hereabouts that the
                        people of the south are exhibiting a very commendable spirit, and behaving
                        remarkably well under the circumstances. But it is sadly probable that we
                        have politicians who design and desire to keep the country in trouble, and
                        to make dissension the normal and unchangeable condition of things. In time
                        of peace and calm, demagogues sink out of sight more easily than in times of
                        excitement. --Hence their desire to keep the war alive.</p>

                    <p> Never was there a more deluded party than the advocates of negro suffrage.
                        They are seeking power through an inordinate disgusting display, of love for
                        the "Freedman," as they now call the negro. With him as a voter they feel
                        safe. The power and spoils of the government will remain in their hands,
                        hence as true loyal men they desire negro
                        suffrage. This, and this only constitutes the full measure of their love for
                        the poor "Freed man." They want to use his ignorance, and stupidity to
                        bolster up their cupidity. Convince them, that
                        negro suffrage would throw political power against them; from Sumner down to
                        the lowest scribbler in the party, who would not oppose the measure with all
                        the power he could command? The leaders of the party are not, strictly,
                        negro worshippers. --He may be the idol of their hopes, but he is not the
                        God of their love. They bow the knee to a far different influence. Under an
                        enfranchised negro system, they hope to utterly prostrate the democratic
                        party, and reap a rich harvest of power and spoils. --This is the only spur
                        to their vaunting philanthropy, and every kick aims at the vitality of the
                        Democracy. </p>
                    <p>They rave and howl about what they call the ignorance of the democratic
                        masses, and yet, seek to enfranchise an inferior, ignorant, mass of negroes,
                        over whose degradation they shed floods of tears but a few months ago. What
                        a beautiful ebony veiled junto these abolitionists are. C.</p>
