				<head>The "Coming War"</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt>"Now that the White Man's party has been defeated, we shall be given a full
					opportunity of tasting the "benefits" which are to result from that defeat, and
					their schemes for the advancement of the negroes at the expense of the white
					workingman of the State."</excerpt>
				<transcript>
					<p>The long looked for is coming at last-via; the "irrepressible conflict;" the
						"cullud pussen;" known in State papers of former times as the "American
						citizen of African descent." Among recent telegrams from the Federal capital
						we find the following announcement:</p>
					<p>"A large number of freedmen are to be sent North, to be employed in mines and
						on railroads."</p>
					<p>Following so closely as this announcement does upon the shoddy victory at the
						Pennsylvania ballot-box-achieved as it was upon a platform favoring if not
						endorsing negro suffrage and equality-we can attribute it to no other
						influence that the result of the election. It is true Pennsylvania is not
						specifically mentioned, but the word "mines" clearly indicates that their
						main destination is the State where mining is one of the principal pursuits.
						As the direct consequence, therefore, of the elective victory of the
						Pennsylvania negro party, the "coming man" is coming-coming not singly or in
						scores, as formerly, but in "large numbers." Would the Boardinghouse Bureau
						have ventured upon such as movement had the Democracy been victorious? We
						are quite sure that it would not.</p>
					<p>The Democracy proposed to first take care of the white poor of the
						State-among the most numerous of whom are those made helpless by the
						causalities of war-before they should exted their good offices to the black
						pets of abolitionism-the poor created by the negro stealers of the shoddy
						party. Knowing well that the Democratic party considered the Government's
						first duty to be to those who helped to save it, and who, in helping,
						greatly suffered, the War Department and its Negro Bureau no doubt waited in
						anxious suspense the result of our election. Now that the White Man's party
						has been defeated, we shall be given a full opportunity of tasting the
						"benefits" which are to result from that defeat, and their schemes for e
						advancement of the negroes at the expense of the white workingmen of the
						State.</p>
					<p>The white soldiers who have just returned from the sanguinary battle-fields
						which brought freedom for the negroes, and who have gone patiently to work
						to repair the ravages which war has made upon their humble fortunes, will
						now find fresh applicants contesting for their situations, and those of them
						who have not succeeded in securing employment will soon find the avenues of
						labor choked with the in-coming avalanche of Blacks. Is this what they
						fought and suffered for? Is this the manner in which they are to be rewarded
						for all their sacrifices and wounds?</p>
					<p>The Shoddy mouthpieces for years declared that the freed Negroes would not
						come North, and the story was repeated up till the last ballot was cast on
						the 10th of October. It is true, they may now say in apology, that the
						negroes are not <emph rend="italic">coming</emph> North-that they are merely
							<emph rend="italic">sent</emph>. But the quibble will not avail. Those
						who held out to the workingmen of Pennsylvania that negro labor would never
						compete in Pennsylvania with white labor, should now be brought to judgment.
						Those who advocated war to secure freedom for the Blacks, and then held out
						false promises of patronage and protection to our workingmen to go into the
						service, should be arraigned before the bar of judgement and settled with by
						public condemnation.</p>

				<summary>Responding to a report that scores of blacks will soon be sent north for
					employment in the region's mines, the Spirit condemns the proposal as an insult
					to white workingmen, particularly those in Pennsylvania since it is home to a
					large number of extractive industries and, therefore, will be the destination of
					a signficant proportion of said freedmen. The article intimates that the
					continued campaign to elevate blacks socially and politically will ultimately
					result in racial conflict.</summary>

				<head>Reconstruction</head>
				<origin>Lycoming Gazette</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt>"[The Republicans] do not desire a Union as it was, linked by
					constitutional obligations; they desire a new Union of their own creation,
					united by new links, forged by new men, composed of new material."</excerpt>
				<transcript>
					<p>The subject of reconstruction cannot too often arrest attention and careful
						consideration, as the destiny of the nation depends in a great measure, upon
						the proper adjustment of political issues now pending. Suffer the
						revolutionary policy of Stevens to triumph, new wounds, in addition to those
						now afflicting the body politic, will be laid open; wounds that will eat
						like a cancer upon the life of the republic. The vital interests of the
						nation are involved in the question of reconstruction. If Andrew Johnson
						remains true to his avowed declarations-true to his recorded oath, and true
						to his country's interests, the States late in rebellion will spring up
						phoenix-like and take their original position in the old union galaxy; her
						citizens, infused with new life and vigor adding their quota to every branch
						of individual and public enterprise, building anew the waste places and
						making her borders to bloom and blossom like the rose.</p>
					<p>There appears to be, however, a determined effort upon the part of the
						radicals in every section of the republic to checkmate the designs of
						president Johnson in his noble efforts towards reconstruction upon
						constitutional principles. The deep-seated feeling of hate still finds food
						and shelter in the radical heart, ignoring the fact that war has ceased its
						work, no longer arraying one section against the other. This feeling will
						not allow them to enter into social and political relationship with their
						erring brethren of the South,--will not allow them to meet as equals, as
						members of the same national brotherhood.</p>
					<p>This feeling of hate must be put down if we ever expect to live in peace and
						quietness-if we ever expect a complete restoration of national law. Let us
						then, do all we can to cultivate this spirit among all classes and grades.
						Let us offer to all the pipe of peace, and we will be exonerated from all
						blame, should the wild ravings of wicked men prevail.</p>
					<p>The terrible events of the last few years are not sufficient to satisfy the
						radical leaders. Their thirst for contention and strife is not quenched, and
						will not be until all social, civil and political rights are taken from the
						Southern people. That is the reason why they refuse to welcome back the
						returning prodigals. Give us, says the Jacobins of the Republican party,
						supreme power of the States late in rebellion, and all will be well. They do
						not deserve a <emph rend="italic">Union as it was</emph>, linked together by
						constitutional obligations; they deserve a new Union of their own creation,
						united by new links, forged by new men, composed of new material. The
						troubled waves of passion outride the storm of civil strife, casting up new
						ingredients of discord. </p>
					<p>The developments of the next few months will bring to an issue the great
						question under advisement. We will then find out who desires a complete
						restoration of national law. A wise policy, predicated upon a sure
						foundation, treating the States late in rebellion as subject to the same
						protection as if no war had cursed the land, must be endorsed, or a new
						policy, revolutionary in its operations an unjust in its exactions, treating
						the states as conquered provinces, her citizens as vassasl, without any
						political character, must become the law of the land.</p>
					<p>The conservative citizen will choose the former line of action. To his mind
						the way is clear. <emph rend="italic">Give back the old flag, and all its
							protecting influence</emph>--cultivate a spirit of amity and good-will
						among the people-cancel old accounts and make new ones where debt and credit
						will be redound to the benefit of all classes and sections. In this way
						peace will prevail, all branches of industry will recover with rapid stride,
						and a nation's resources will recuperate from a nation's trials. </p>
					<p>Let us throw to the winds the idle doctrine which promulgates the idea that,
						a State can lose its status by individual direliction. We trust that the
						sober second thought of the people will favor the policy of President
						Johnson, the only policy that will cement the States into one.</p>
					<p>We have had enough strife and bloodshed; why continue to harass a fallen
						brother, who acknowledges his sin, expressing a willingness to discharge all
						the duties of citizenship; why talk about obsolete issues that are dead and
						buried?</p>
					<p>It behooves the conservative men of all parties to unite in one vigorous
						effort, if they hope to crush the new reconstruction theory of Stevens
						&amp; Co. Will they do it? Will they count all other issues of minor
						import? They <emph rend="italic">must</emph>, or our country becomes the
						theatre of new conflicts, more terrible in their results upon society than a
						"four years war." The result of the recent elections is no criterion to
						judge men upon this vital issue, as it was contended by the Republicans that
							<emph rend="italic">they were opposed to the radical doctrine, and
							approved of the President's policy.</emph> We did not believe their
						declarations, but enough did, to throw the State against the open an avowed
						friends of restoration upon constitutional principles.-</p>

				<head>Mr. Johnson's Conversation with Mr. Stearns</head>
				<origin>New York World</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>It is extremely amazing to witness in what an agony of anxiety and perplexity
						partisan Republicans are thrown by the cordial support the Democracy are
						given Mr. Johnson. This pepitation and restless were not uppermost in the
						mind of Mr. Stearns that it inspired the first utterance he made. From the
						fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh. We are not surprised that Mr.
						Johnson <emph rend="italic">laughed</emph> in the face of Mr. Stearns, and
						we can understand how the President, after the interview was over, quietly
						enjoyed the attitude in which he had left his distressed inquisitor. Mr.
						Stearns evidently hoped and expected to draw out something which he could
						quote as evidence that Mr. Johnson repelled the support or doubted the
						sincerity of the Democracy; but he went away with a large flea, of the genus
						Pulex, in his ear. The remark of Mr. Stearns in such a perfectly exquisite
						description of the condition of the Republicans that we cannot abstain from
						reproducing it: </p>
					<p>I remarked that the people of the North were anxious that the process of
						reconstruction should be thorough and they wished to support him in the
						arduous work; <emph rend="italic">but their ideas were confused by the
							conflicting reports constantly circulated, and especially by the present
							position of the Democratic party. It is industriously circulated in the
							Democratic clubs that he was going over them.</emph></p>
					<p>We advise the Republicans to take a little of the white of an egg or fish
						skin to <emph rend="italic">settle</emph> their ideas, which are now so
						"confused!" </p>
					<p>The substance of Mr. Johnson's reported conversation is as good as the
						introduction. He makes it clear:</p>
					<p>1. That he means to squelch forever the state-suicide theory of the Faneuil
						Hall momorialists headed by Professor Parsons; of Sumner, Stevens, gnd all
						that clique, and of the <emph rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</emph>, and
						such radical sheets. </p>
					<p>2. That he does not intend to be rigidly bound by the terms of his first
						proclamation of amnesty, but that he will throw wide open the doors of
						pardon to all, no matter whether or not they are in the excepted classes.
						"Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you," is the
						encouragement given by the President to every one who repents and sues for
						forgiveness.</p>
					<p>3. That the arm of the federal government will not be used, if our Chief
						Magistrate has power to prevent it, to <emph rend="italic">force</emph>
						negro suffrage upon the reluctant Southern States as a condition of
						representation in Congress. </p>
					<p>4. That he his opposed to a consolidated federal government. In that respect
						he is the opposite of his immediate predecessor in office, who was a
						Federalist by education and habit of thought, and had no sincere respect for
						the reserved rights of the individual States.</p>
					<p>5. That he is favor of elevating and purifying the ballot, of which he has
						already given the best evidence by preventing the Weed faction in the State
						from using the power of the navy-yard and custom-house to debase and corrupt
						the elective franchise. His excellent suggestions about educating the
						negroes, if possible, up to a standard enabling them to appreciate the
						responsibility of a vote, are humane and statesmanlike, and will be more and
						more approved as time goes on.--</p>

				<head>The Return of Specie Payments</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The remarks of the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject attract a good
						deal of attention. He is in favor of reducing the currency and getting back
						to specie payments. His views of finance are sound enough; but it is certain
						that any sudden movements in that direction would be disastrous to the
						country just now. The return must be very gradual. We need not, however,
						apprehend haste. The necessities of the government will prevent it. The
						attempt to control the whole finance of the country by national banks is
						essentially vicious, but the attempt is made. Sooner or later the evil
						effects will be felt. Just now everybody pays with somebody's promises to
						pay, who has nothing to pay with but somebody else's promise to pay, who
						can't pay better than he can. The banks, as usual, live on the interest of
						what they owe, or what somebody else owes. The government is the great
						promiser, carrying a mountainous debt with its promises. To get enough
						promises to pay to answer its purpose, it must protect the promises of its
						pet banks, so that business may go one and taxes be paid. W used to be
						shocked at national debts of incomprehensible magnitude, without foreseeing
						how soon we would present to the world and example of indebtedness
						surpassing any ever seen; for our debt is as large as the debt of England,
						and we pay twice the rate of interst. Financial affairs have got out of all
						comprehension on any principles known amongst men. It is idle to think of
						paying, sure enough, with <emph rend="italic">money</emph> in any reasonable
						time. Amongst the millions of promises to pay, there is no paying on sight,
						and not going to be soon.</p>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The Abolition Republican Union party, having again succeeded, by indefinite
						platforms and all sorts of specious pretexts, in escaping defeat at the late
						elections, the question now to be determined is what did those State
						elections determine? The extreme Radicals will be satisfied with nothing
						short of a complete surrender to them by their more conservative allies. In
						this State, it is true that the chairman of the Abolition State Central
						Committee appealed to his party not to divide upon the negro question; that
						negro suffrage, &amp;c., were not questions in agitation before the
						people; but notwithstanding this avowal, upon the part of Mr. Cessna, the
						result of the contest is claimed as being an open, undisguised Radical
						triumph. The eternal suffrage question then being sure to come up in the
						coming Congress, at an early day, the Radicals have commenced their
						operations to lash their more conservative coadjutors into their way of
						thinking. The leading Abolition papers contain, daily, reports of speeches
						by leading radicals, which bitterly assail any in their party who do not
						endorse the black issue. The simple truth is that the Radicals referred to,
						desire no restoration of the Union. They were always opposed to the old
						Union and they are so now regarding its restoration. The only Union they
						desire is one of a force; they wish to beggar the Southern people by
						confiscation, and humiliate them by conferring upon their late slaves the
						right of suffrage.</p>
					<p>We trust, however, the people of the South will prosecute, with continued
						energy and confidence, their efforts to renew the prosperity of the Southern
						States. Let them heed the President's warning, and pay no regard to speeches
						that may seem to breathe a spirit of hatred and revenge.</p>

					<p>The Montpelier <emph rend="italic">Argus &amp; Patriot</emph> contains
						the report of a recent decision of Judge Smalley in the case of Walker vs.
						Crane, tried in the United States Circuit Court at Rutland, which stamps
						with the just stigma of unconstitutionality the section of the act of March
						3, 1863, which pretend to interpose between justice and the official doors
						of lawless and arbitrary acts the shield of presidential authority. The
						sections reads as follows: <emph rend="italic">And be it further
						enacted</emph>, That any order of the President, or under his authority,
						made at any time during the existence of this rebellion, shall be a defense
						in all courts to any action or prosecution, civil or criminal, pending or to
						be commenced for any search, seizure, arrest or imprisonment made, done, or
						committed, or acts omitted to be done under and by virtue of such order, or
						under color of any act of Congress, and such defense may be made by special
						plea or under the general issue, </p>
					<p>In the Language of the <emph rend="italic">Argus &amp; Patriot</emph></p>
					<p>Judge Smalley delivered an able and impartial charge to the jury upon the
						facts, submitting to them the various questions arising upon the conflicting
						evidence. He ruled that the section of the act of March 3, 1863, above
						quoted, <emph rend="italic">was in violation of the Constitution of the
							United States, and afforded no protection for acts done under the
							authority of that section</emph>, that the language used by the
						plaintiff did not amount to any offense against the enrollment acts; also
						that the opinion of Whiting in regard to the construction of that act was
						erroneous; and <emph rend="italic">that martial law in Vermont, the civil
							law remained in full force, and was not subordinate to military
							authority.</emph> He submitted the question of damages to the jury,
						claming that a defendant honestly believed, and had reason to believe, that
						the plaintiff was a substitute broker, and came within the effect of the
						order to exclude persons of that description, it should go in mitigation of
						damages, even if the fact should be found to be otherwise. </p>
					<p>"The jury, after a short absence, returned a verdict for the plaintiff for
						one-thousand dollars."</p>
					<p>This is a gratifying step toward the restoration of the protection of law to
						American citizens. It is something if civil liberties can be restored, even
						if there was not virtue enough tin the American people to have them
						retained.</p>

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Boston, Oct 18.</p>
					<p>Wendell Phillips delivered a lecture before the Boston Fraternity last night.
						The lecture attracted a large and enthusiastic audience. Its title was "The
						South Victorious." Mr. Phillips declared that President Johnson in his
						speech to the delegation that waited upon him from South Carolina, and who
						appealed to him for protection against Congress and the harsh spirit of the
						Northern States, had ranged himself with the half converted rebels, and made

					<p>In 1862 there were only 8,146 pensioners of all classes on the lists. In 1863
						the list increased to 14,780; in 1864, to 51,135; and to this date (October
						17) the certificates issued on admitted claims amount to about $93,000. The
						full pensions of a Lieut. Colonel and officers of a higher grade is $30 per
						month; for a Major $25; for a Captain $20; for a First Lieutenant $17; for a
						Second Lieutenant, $15, and for enlisted men $8. Under a special act, passed
						last March, persons who have lost one foot and one hand are entitled to $20
						per month; and to $25 per month for both hands and both eyes. There are
						one-quarter, one-half and two-thirds pensions, according to the rated
						degrees of disability, and where a man is killed, or dies from disease
						contracted in the line of his duty, the widow, minors, dependent mother or
						sister, draw full pensions according to the rank of the deceased.</p>
