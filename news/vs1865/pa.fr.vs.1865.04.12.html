<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give our readers in the present issue of our paper the most glorious news
                        presented them for four years past. General Lee and the Army of Northern
                        Virginia have surrendered to General Grant and the army under his command.
                        This great and bloodless victory was achieved on Sunday afternoon, at
                        Appomattox Court House, about eighty miles west from Richmond, and and [sic]
                        about forty miles from Lynchburg, the point Lee's army had reached on its
                        retreat towards Lynchburg. It will be seen from the correspondence
                        published, that the surrender was demanded by General Grant, and accepted by
                        General Lee. The conditions are liberal and honorable, and we have no doubt
                        will be scrupulously observed by both sides. By the terms of this surrender,
                        the Army of Northern Virginia is disbanded, and the men and officers, from
                        Lee down to the lowest grade, are sent to their homes, not to take up arms
                        again against the United States until regularly exchanged, which, of course,
                        will never be. It is virtually a treaty of peace. General Grant, in his note
                        to General Lee, says "peace is my first desire," and General Lee in
                        accepting the proposals desires to know if they "would tend to that end,"
                        and says "the restoration of peace should be the sole object of all."
                        Generals Johnson, Beauregard, Hardee, Bragg, Walker, Smith, Magruder,
                        Buckner, and other rebel Generals still in the field with pretty large
                        armies, will no doubt see the surrender of Lee in the same light--the
                        restoration of peace--and gladly accept the same conditions, and lay down
                        their arms and return to their homes, "not to be
                            disturbed by the United States authority so long as they observe their
                            parole and the laws in force where they may reside.["] These
                        conditions being so generously and noble [sic] granted to Lee and his men,
                        will, of course, be granted to all others. We may, therefore, safely
                        pronounce the war at an end. We cannot but feel proud that this end has been
                        attained without the interference of any foreign powers but solely by
                        ourselves in a way that must reflect great honor on us as a Christian and
                        civilized nation. All must rejoice at these results and offer thanks to
                        Almighty God that this unhappy strife is about to cease, and the blessings
                        of peace be once more restored to our afflicted land.</p>

<b>Hon. Thaddeus Stevens</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes remarks made by Thaddeus Stevens that suggest that "justice"
                    will not come without the total subjugation of the South. In those remarks,
                    Stevens talked of treating the Southern states like "conquered provinces" under
                    the control of the US Congress.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lancaster Intelligencer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens was serenaded at his residence in this city on Monday evening,
                        when he made a short speech, which we find reported in the Express. He said the power of the rebellion was
                        certainly failing, but he would not even now predict that this would be
                        their last campaign. He had not been among those who foretold an easy
                        triumph and a short war; but he believed the ensuing campaign would destroy
                        the most formidable armies of the rebels and take their strongholds. Still
                        he looked for one or two years of partisan warfare in their highlands and
                        fastnesses difficult of access. He did not believe there was much Union
                        feeling in the rebel States. The only Southern patriots were the colored
                        men, and committed a great error in not appealing to them and liberating and
                        arming the slaves the first year of the war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevons [sic] is of the opinion that when the enemy shall have been
                        subdued, then will begin difficulties little less troublesome than the war.
                        "To re-construct this nation," he says, "on the principles of
                        justice--justice to the victors and to the vanquished--to reconstruct it on
                        a solid, immovable basis of universal liberty, will require the exercise of
                        the highest wisdom and the coolest forbearance of those to whom it may be
                        confided. To re-admit the conquered States and the murderous belligerants,"
                        he continues, "to all the rights and privileges of the Union as it was and
                        the Constitution as it is, would be the foulest injustice and the rankest
                        folly." He holds that all the territories of the subdued States should be
                        treated as conquered provinces and belong to the nation, to be governed by
                        Congress until admitted into the Union as new States. So much thereof as may
                        be deemed just should be forfeited and sold to pay the national debt, and
                        other portions should be allotted to our maimed veterans and freedmen.</p>
                    <p>The above is the substance of Mr. Stevens's speech on the occasion alluded
                        to. It shows that he is still full of venom towards the white people of the
                        South, and full of affection towards the negroes. He wishes to strip the
                        former of their property and give it to the latter. What claims the
                        "freedmen" have to such generous treatment is more than we can imagine. We
                        are able to understand why our government should bestow land upon Southern
                        negroes and withhold it from Northern white men. Mr. Stevens and other
                        malignants who are in favor of wholesale confiscation, evidently desire to
                        make the African the ruling race in the Southern States. They intend to
                        reduce the white inhabitants of that portion of our country to the lowest
                        state of poverty--to make them, if possible, hewers of wood and drawers of
                        water for the "freedmen" upon whom it is proposed to confer their landed
                        estates.</p>
                    <p>In proposing to deal thus harshly and inhumanly with the white people of the
                        South, we fear that Mr. Stevens reflects the feelings and sentiments of the
                        great body of his party. There is some evidence to the contrary, however.
                        The New York Tribune has abated its former
                        bitterness, and even Henry Ward Beecher begins to talk like a Christian. It
                        is not often that this distinguished abolitionist says anything that we can
                        commend, but the spirit of his remarks last Sunday respecting his proposed
                        participation in the Fort Sumpter fete, seems to
                        us to be just and generous. The New York Times
                        reports him as saying:</p>
                    <p>At other times, when the prospect of lifting the flag to its former place
                        seemed almost visionary, he had spoken of such an event with jubilation. But
                        now, as the time in reality drew near, his soul trembled within him at its
                        solemn meaning. Many would go there imbued with this feeling of solemn
                        jubilation, in this wonderful event in the history of this people. He should
                        feel sorry if any went there with any other feeling than that of Christian
                        patriotism. If others went with feelings of exultation
                            over a fallen foe, for his part he went as a brother to appeal to misled
                            brethren from the day of their misaaprehension [sic] to the day of
                            knowledge. It would be so say to them that, after four years of blood
                            and darkness, we had brought back to them the same hearts of love they
                            had smitten in these long four years.</p>
                    <p>If the dominant party manifest any such temper toward the South as here
                        expressed, the task of reconstruction will not be as difficult as Mr.
                        Stevens imagines. Mr. Beecher did his share in stimulating the passions
                        which brought on this dreadful war, but it will be forgiven and forgotten if
                        he prove half as efficient in allaying sectional passions as he has
                        heretofore been in exciting them.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There was one black cloud at Richmond yesterday that did not make the hearts
                        of the people sad, viz: the entrance of the colored regiment with the
                        lightnings of the old flag dancing over their heads, and the thunders of
                        "John Brown" rolling from their lips.--Forney's
                        Press.</p>
                    <p>Before "John Brown" made his memorable descent on Harper's Ferry, he and his
                        fellow-traitors organized a "Provisional Government for the United States."
                        The property he captured at Harper's Ferry was the property of the United
                        States. The force sent by President Buchanan to retake that property carried
                        the flag of the United States. The marines killed and wounded in capturing
                        Brown wore the uniform of the United States. They were commanded by Robert
                        E. Lee, who was then a colonel in the army of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Why is it that negro troops now in the service of our government are
                        permitted to enter Richmond with "the thunders of John
                            Brown rolling from their lips?" Did Brown do a meritorious and a
                        patriotic thing when he killed the marines, captured the property and tried
                        to overthrow the government of the United States? If Abraham Lincoln says
                            no, then let him see to it that the
                        scandalous song of "John Brown" is not again blubbered under his very nose
                        by thick-lipped negroes for the pay of the United States.</p>

                        Every one left their beds and gathered on the streets. The bells were rung,
                        guns, pistols and cannon fired, and bonfires blazed at every corner. The
                        excitement continued all night and increasing to a perfect panic about morning. The speech-makers were called
                        out and mounting the store-boxes harangued the crowds in the most excited
