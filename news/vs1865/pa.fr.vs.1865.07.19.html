<b>Selling Paupers in New England</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Castigates the practice of selling off poor whites to the lowest bidder, a
                    yearly tradition in New England where paupers are forced to work for private
                    individuals to receive support. The article alleges that New Englanders are
                    hypocrites, or worse yet race traitors, for providing their unyielding support
                    for abolition while, at the same time, they fail to afford poor whites the same
                    concern.<br>

<b>A Black Editor's Opinion</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Black Republican, a New Orleans' newspaper, declares that blacks and
                    whites cannot live together in the United States. The editor, a clergyman,
                    asserts that blacks, like Native Americans, will become "extinct in this
                    country" unless they separate themselves.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Condemns the rising tide of lawlessness that appears to be sweeping across
                    the North. The article lays part of the blame for the current state of affairs
                    on the "Abolition press," which, it claims, has helped to foster the poisoned
                    atmosphere through its attacks on Democrats and anyone else who failed to agree
                    with its prognosis for ending the war.<br>

<b>A Negro Army</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Condemns the proposition floating around Washington that blacks will
                    comprise a significant proportion, if not majority, of the regular army once
                    excess troops have been mustered out. The article maintains the policy is
                    fraught with danger because it will lower the army's standards since no white
                    man will want to join the service once "black" and "soldier" become synonymous.
                    The article also rails against the possibility of creating an integrated force .<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Pointing to the Civil War as proof, the Spirit voices the opinion that the
                    Constitution should be modified since it is inadequate in emergencies. The
                    article calls for the enactment of an additional amendment to provide a clear
                    provision for the government to suspend parts of the Constitution in times of
                    war.<br>

<b>Soldiers Read</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Details a Fourth of July celebration in Farmington, Mass., where Wendell
                    Phillips declared that blacks bear "the palm in virtue, gallantry, and
                    patriotism" in the Civil War. According to the Spirit, this statement, as well
                    as one issued that same day by a black orator who avowed that black soldiers
                    would rise up should they be denied the franchise, indicates the manner in which
                    abolitionists are placing the achievements of blacks above those of whites.<br>

<b>Soldiers! Heads Up! Eyes Front!</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Calls upon returning white soldiers to demonstrate to Republicans how they
                    feel about the prospect of black suffrage by voting against them in the upcoming
                    election.<br>

<b>Numbers, Not Intelligence</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Recounts a speech given by H. Winter Davis at a Republican meeting in
                    Chicago, where the politician declared his support for black suffrage. The
                    rationale for his decision lay not with the fact that blacks deserved the vote
                    because of their intelligence, or their gallantry during the war, but rested
                    instead with the fact that blacks constitute a significant percentage of the
                    southern populace and thus could be used to contain white resistance to
                    Republican rule.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Blacks convening in Alexandria, Va., have issued a statement blasting
                    Governor Pierpont and the state legislature. The group unanimously agreed to
                    "secure the elective franchise" for blacks "as soon as it can be safely done"
                    and to "establish a strong and loyal government, military or territorial."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Over the past twelve months at Camp Nelson in Kentucky, 1,200 blacks have
                    died. With such a horrific death rate, the Louisville Democrat sardonically asks
                    how long it will be before Kentucky is made a free state.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Louisville Democrat</blockquote>
<b>Negro Suffrage in the South</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter to the editor that rails against radicals and the prospect of
                    black suffrage which, the writer contends, is completely inappropriate since the
                    freedmen are incapable of exercising the right properly. The democratic system,
                    he avers, can only be preserved through restricting the franchise.<br>

<b>Senator Wilson on the Rampage</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>At a Forth of July picnic in Washington attended by blacks, Senator Wilson
                    addressed the crowd and spelled out some of his views concerning the post-war
                    racial order. The article quotes Wilson at length, highlighting what it deems as
                    his "impudent" and "radical" threats to ensure that blacks have the right "to
                    vote, hold office, and generally to control the country."<br>
