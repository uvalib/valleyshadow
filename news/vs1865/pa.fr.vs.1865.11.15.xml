                    <p>Our neighbor, the senior editor of the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph>,
                        has recently been in Washington and had an interview with President Johnson.
                        His purpose in making this visit it seems was to instruct the President in
                        his duties and to advice him as to the policy he <emph rend="italic"
                        >ought</emph> to pursue towards the people of the South, but according to
                        his own account published in last week's issue of the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Repository</emph>, he left the executive presence with a very large
                        sized flea in his ear. We are surprised that the President should be so
                        unappreciative as to reject the views and disinterested counsel so kindly
                        proffered him. Doubtless McClure considers the President very stupid in
                        failing to perceive the force of his arguments, and it may be that the
                        President regards McClure as a little <emph rend="italic"
                        >presumptuous</emph> in venturing to offer them. But be that as it may it is
                        quite evident that this self-constituted mission to the White House was
                        fruitless of desired results, but the ambassador is no doubt a little wiser,
                        if not much older, and has learned to his regret that the badger an honest
                        and patriotic President, who has the firmness and decision of character to
                        fearlessly pursue the right regardless of the frowns and threats of
                        demagogues, is a business that <emph rend="italic">don't pay</emph>. </p>
                    <p>"However reticent he (the President) may be on some issues," says the
                        Colonel, "he seems to have no reserve as the policy he conceives to be the
                        true one to bring back the insurgent States. He discussed the position of
                        those States and their people with great interest and occasional <emph
                            rend="italic">warmth</emph>, and with a frankness that left <emph
                            rend="italic">no doubt as to his purpose</emph>." As to what this
                        "purpose" is we will permit McClure to tell in his own language at the close
                        of this article. We can imagine the chagrin and feeling of "hope deferred"
                        which seized upon the nervous frame of our amiable neighbor, when he
                        listened to that "frankness" from the lips of the President which left no
                        doubt as to his "purpose." We infer also that there is now but little hope
                        of consummating a "compromise" between the President and the radicals which
                        we know to have been a cherished idea with out neighbor, and by which it was
                        hoped the Republican politicians would be able to retain possession of the
                        "loaves and fishes." </p>
                    <p>But it must not be supposed that the gallant Colonel retired from the field
                        without first making a brave and heroic effort to drive the President from
                        his position. This he did not do so much by direct assault as by one of
                        those grand strategic flank movements by means of which Grant captured Lee,
                        and by means of which McClure <emph rend="italic">didn't</emph> capture Andy
                        Johnson. He commenced his flanking operations by making "suggestive
                        objections" to the President's policy of restoration and his treatment of
                        southern rebels. He "reminded" the President of the many errors he had
                        committed-of the many things he had done which he ought not to have done,
                        and the many things he had left undone which he ought to have done-of the
                        many rebels he had pardoned that should have been hung, &amp;c. And then
                        as a grand charge to carry the President's position by storm, he exclaimed:
                        "You have given us on every hand the nation's monuments of Mercy-where will
                        be its monuments of Justice?" "To this the President answered with much
                        animation that the measure of, and time for, atonement were yet for the
                        future to determine." Not much comfort in that for a man apparently thirsty
                        for blood and vengeance! The President's position being found impregnable,
                        and the President himself being so unaccommodating as to obstinately refuse
                        to be either "flanked" or dragooned into radical measures, our modest hero
                        abandoned the hopeless siege, utterly disgusted with a President for whose
                        election he had labored so zealously but one short year ago, muttering in
                        mournful cadences as he retired: "If I were to guess on the subject, I would
                        say that Davis is more likely to be paroled during the next year than to be
                        tried, and if he is ever hanged, <emph rend="italic">he must do it
                        himself</emph>." </p>
                    <p>We give below the closing paragraphs of the account of the interview of
                        McClure with the President as a matter of information to our readers in
                        regard to the position and purpose of the President on the great questions
                        of the day-the restoration of the Southern States to the Union. The
                        testimony of the witness being against himself, it may be received as
                        entirely reliable. The Democracy will thank McClure for this new proof that
                        ANDREW JOHNSON remains firm in his purpose to adhere faithfully to his
                        declared policy and administer the Government on the principles of the
                        Constitution, and with a view to secure the peace, happiness and prosperity
                        of the whole country:</p>
                    <p>"I believe that the President will wield all his power to effect the
                        admission of the representatives of the rebellious States into Congress
                        during the next session. The Senate being organized the question cannot come
                        up there until it is brought up in order; but there will be a strong
                        pressure to force the admission of the Southern members by placing their
                        names on the roll when the House meets. This Mr. McPherson will not do, and
                        on all votes of instructions he will call only those who are returned from
                        States clearly entitled to representation.-The law forbids him to do
                        otherwise, and he will be faithful to it. The question of their admission
                        will then agitate the House, and I fear make a sad breach between the
                        President and Congress. The South is encouraged by the position of the
                        administration to be importunate in its demand for admission, and it is no
                        improbable that it will in the end be admitted. I have seldom seen Congress
                        struggle against power and hold out to the end. The history of such
                        conflicts is always dotted with frail ones who fall by the way. I have ever
                        felt that the revolted States should take no part in the government they
                        vainly sought to destroy until all issues arising from the war, and all its
                        logical results, should be settled by faithful men. To the victors, not to
                        the vanquished-to the friends, not to the foes of the government does this
                        duty belong, and if it shall be otherwise, there are many who will tremble
                        for the safety of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>On the future of the freedmen the President talks well. He displays more
                        sense than sentiment on the question, and means to solve the problem fairly
                        as demanded by civilization and humanity. Of their ability to win a position
                        that will enable them to be incorporated into our system of governments as
                        citizens, he is not eminently hopeful, but feels that it must be fairly
                        tried with an open field for the negro. That failing, he looks upon
                        colonization as the only alternative.</p>
                    <p>It would be foolish to disguise the fact that the President, both by word and
                        deed, disclaims the position of a partisan Executive, and that he is not
                        insensible to the flattering approval of his administration by the
                        Democratic party. I do not mean by this that he is in sympathy and
                        fellowship with them, but I do mean that he is no wholly in sympathy against
                        them; and he will, I feel warranted in saying, adhere to the political
                        fortunes of the Southern States without regard to political consequences.
                        This may or may not sever him from the party that sustained and cherished
                        him in their darkest days through which he passed [unclear], and that won
                        him the highest honors of the nation through a flood of [illegible]; but if
                        it does, I infer that he will accept the situation. He evidently means above
                        all other things, to compass the admission of the Southern members and the
                        complete restoration to power of those States, and if Massachusetts and
                        South Carolina can strike hands over the same administration then will we
                        have a [unclear] faithful President and a harmonious country. If not-I leave
                        the future to tell the story. Where in all this record soon to be made up
                        the Nation shall see that "treason is the greatest crime and must be
                        punished," is not to my mind apparent.</p>

                <commentary>"The Harrisburg Telegraph is in a terrible way about the result of the
                    election for Senator in this district. In its issue of the 11th inst. we find
                    the following, which we copy for the purpose of showing how many misstatements
                    can be contained in so small a compass. The <emph rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>
                    says:"</commentary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The copperheads are making a desperate effort to establish the false claim of
                        Duncan, the copperhead candidate for Senator in Adams District. There is
                        nothing unusual in such a claim being set up by those tricksters, but it
                        does not alter the actual result of the election in that Senatorial
                        District. Without a doubt, and by a clear return, McConaughy, the Union
                        candidate, has a majority of the legal votes received for Senator in that
                        District, and if the illegal votes accepted by copperhead election officers
                        had been rejected, as was enjoined upon them by their oaths, McConaughy's
                        majority would be four or five times larger than it really is.-The returns
                        from the Pennsylvania soldiers who had an election in Texas will give Mr.
                        McC. 40 majority. But even with this fact in his favor, we trust that no
                        effort will be spared to expose the traitorous and cowardly frauds resorted
                        to by copperhead election officers to carry the Adams Senatorial District.</p>
                    <p>There is might little of truth in the above. The "copperheads" are not
                        "making a desperate effort to establish the false claim of Duncan the
                        candidate for Senator in Adams District" for the reason that no effort was
                        or is necessary in the case.-Mr. Duncan was duly elected, and having
                        received a majority of the votes-without objection from any one on the
                        ground of illegal votes having been given for him-was accorded the
                        certificate of election, by the Return Judges. There has been no allegations
                        made in the district of illegal votes, fraud, &amp;c., by and one
                        excepting Mr. McConaughy himself and the ex-commissioner of the draft,
                        Mulhenny, who are now raising a cry of that kind, in order to influence the
                        action of an Abolition Senate in favor of McConaughy. The story about the
                        election Texas by Pennsylvania soldiers is about played out. The 40 majority
                        for McConaughy hasn't come to hand in the returns, and if he, or his
                        tricksters undertake to <emph rend="italic">manufacture</emph> a return they
                        must do it neatly to escape detection. We admit the truth of one allegation
                        in the article, that "if the illegal votes accepted" "had been rejected"
                        McConaughy's <emph rend="italic">majority</emph> would be "four or five tmes
                        larger than it really is;" but as "McConaughy's majority" is a majority of
                        25 votes <emph rend="italic">against</emph> him we can't see see how that
                        would better his case. The would-be Senator and his friends had better
                        abandon this business. Mr. Duncan has been legally and fairly elected, and
                        they know it. They are raising all this dust under cover of which they
                        intend to perpetrate "traitorous and cowardly frauds," by which Mr. Duncan's
                        seat in the Senate may possibly share the fate of Mr. McGaughey's western
                        land.</p>

                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>To those who have studied the tactics of the Republican party, and become
                        familiar with its policy of management, its programme for the future is
                        plainly perceptible. The present object of that party is to retain
                        possession of the government-that is, to continue their partizans in office
                        for some time longer, until they shall have effected full strength, and
                        power warranting them to cast off the mask of hypocrisy they now wear
                        towards the President, and boldly announce their radical schemes.</p>
                    <p>It is idle to say that the party supports President Johnson or his policy
                        with honesty-or, in fact, that it supports him or it at all. With their
                        accustomed political cunning they selected Andrew Johnson as their candidate
                        for the Vice Presidency , to secure Democratic votes. Does any man in his
                        senses believe that he would have been nominated, if he had been supposed
                        for a moment he would have succeeded Mr. Lincoln?</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the party-those who control it-who <emph rend="italic"
                        >own</emph> Black Republican organization, bitterly denounce both the
                        President and his policy. Yet others profess to support him-profess to do
                        so, because thereby they retain office and consequently are enabled to use
                        the great power of the Administration for electioneering purposes. In a
                        little while, having effected their purpose, they will throw off the mask,
                        and the entire organization will denounce him, as one of its owners and
                        directors has already done, as "three-fourths a rebel-three-fourths a
                        traitor." Their schemes if not promptly checked, will then be in course of
                        successful operation, and, for a standard bearer to succeed Mr. Johnson,
                        whom they hate a thousand fold worse than they do Jefferson Davis, they will
                        selsect Chief Justice Chase. </p>
                    <p>This is their programme, and not many months will elapse before they publicly
                        announce it. It remains to be seen whether they will have the skill and
                        cunning to blind the eyes of Andrew Johnson to their treasonable plans.
                        Their only argument heretofore has been the calling of names-styling the
                        Democrats, "Copperheads."-Backed by the military power, and all the
                        resources of the civil arm of the government, this argument has had some
                        weight. They are conscious now that it has lost its old effect, and as a
                        substitute for the military force which they have lost through its
                        disbanding by the President , they seek to obtain such a hold upon the
                        government in all its branches, as will enable them to dispense with
                        arguments altogether. The country looks with interest to the action of
                        President Johnson. Backed as he is by the entire and re-united Democratic
                        party, we trust to his wisdom and firmness to save us from the effects of
                        Black Republican treason and fanaticism, and to continue in the Presidential
                        chair one like himself, rather than that high priest of Northern
                        disunionism, Salmon P. Chase.</p>

                    <p>The radical press are very confident that the negro will do exploits in hard
                        work now that he is free and works for himself, and they will not be
                        convinced to the contrary. They can't admit he will not be self-sustaining;
                        that he will be idle vicious, and fade away by degrees in the blessed state
                        of freedom; that they have consigned him to generations of suffering and
                        sorrow to disappear at last from the face of this continent. They can't
                        afford to tolerate the idea. It would spoil the merit of their great
                        achievement, on which they pique themselves.-They may go and see the truth
                        with their own eyes, but they must not believe it.-He who would force the
                        conviction on him would make him very angry. He would shriek our rebel!
                        traitor! and blame Heaven, if he could find no one else at fault, and never
                        admit that he played the fool-not he. The British Abolitionists are not yet
                        satisfied that the Jamaica negro is not in the happiest condition, and the
                        he has not made great progress in numbers and civilization. The
                        Abolititionists North will be a long time finding out the truth about the
                        negro in the Southern States. They tell fabulous stories now, and will keep
                        them up and believe them with a faith that could have mountains if it was in
                        the truth.-They are, however, too near the Southern States to hide the
                        glimpses of the truth after awhile. Let them go on believing and
                        experimenting. The present race of politicians will never give up that they
                        were mistaken. They must believe on until his Satanic Majesty gets hold of
                        them. It is not worth while to argue the case with them, nor to present
                        facts; for it's all the worse for the facts if they don't correspond wit
                        their political desires.</p>

                    <p>The result of the late election in Pennsylvania seems to have had the effect
                        of bringing out plenty of candidates for Governor, in the opposition party.
                        Of course they are under the impression that having succeeded this year,
                        owing to the apathy and indifference of the Democrats it will be a "sure
                        thing" next year. But they may and we think they will be greatly mistaken in
                        the matter. With a good candidate, a sound constitutional Democrat and a
                        sound Democratic platform we shall certainly succeed, and their calculations
                        will be considerably spoiled. A Harrisburg correspondent of the <emph

                        of on the part of the opposition: Gen. Moorehead, of Allegheny; Col. Jordon,
                        of Bedford,; Gen. Geary and John Covode, of Westmoreland; W. W. Ketchum, of
                        Luzerne; Thomas M. Howe, and John P. Penny, of Allegheny; Lemuel Todd and
                        Mayor McMichael, of Philadelphia; Gen. Hartranft and Gen. Hancock, of
                        Montgomery; Galusha A. Grow, of Susquehanna; Senator Lowry, of Erie; George
                        V. Lawrence, of Washington; John Cessna, of Bedford, and others whose names
                        he does not know. These will be plenty to select from, and any one of them
                        will be very glad to take the nomination. Of course John Cessna expects to
                        get it. He expected to be paid for his treachery to the party as all
                        renegades do. </p>

                    the blacks, but advised patience. He said:"</commentary>

                    <p>The negroes must be routed up and driven from the cities, unless they have
                        some permanent employment there which promises them a support for some time
                        to come. This one thing-the negro's hankering to crowd together in cities,
                        and live in idleness and silly chit-chatting and little snatches of work-is
                        intolerable; it is one of the negro's greatest curses. In Augusta, his
                        headquarters, he had twelve negroes employed as confidential agents, to
                        circulate them were honestly at work, and who were only idling about and
                        pretending to be "hunting work," and all thse latter he compelled to go into
                        the country. There are multitudes of them; they come in and carry their axes
                        on their shoulders to deceive people; and they block up the streets with
                        their petty huckster shops, when they ought to go into the country and go to
                        work.</p>
                    <p>This system of free labor has not had a fair trial yet; it has been begun in
                        the midst of war and confusion; and though in a few cases it had succeeded,
                        in far more cases it had failed. Where it had been tried inside our army
                        lines, where it was quiet, it had succeeded well. The planters themselves
                        told him so. Still the great majority of free negroes will not work
                        continuously for pay alone. The negro must be left perfectly free to choose
                        his own employer, and make his own contract; when that contract is made the
                        planter must have the power to thold him to that contract, and to compel him
                        to labor. Excessive cruelty alone will be considered sufficient to justify
                        him in leaving.</p>

                        their profession.</p>
