                     for 1858.  There were 185
                     deaths, 634 births, and 151 marriages. The small number of deaths for a county of 25,000 reflects
                     the health of the area. The marriage list "shows that the blessing of matrimony still continues to be
                     appreciated. The births speak for themselves."
