The editors argue that though some white labor can be procured through immigration, Virginians must face the truth that the freedmen will remain in the South for good or ill. Consequently, they must be made to labor to "prevent vagrancy" and "the acquisition of idle habits." The editors argue that African American labor was profitable under slavery, and can be made so again with the proper laws.

If the Southern whites do this, the writers argue, then they can guarantee "undivided support." If the southern whites "stand back" then "strangers" from the North will step in and fill the role.

<xref link="va.au.ss.1867.10.15,#02">Staunton Spectator, October 15, 1867, p. 2, c. 3: "A Few Words to the Colored People."</xref>Urges black readers not to be misled by "designing people" who "try to array you against your old masters," warning that if "you listen to the counsels of these bad men, do you think the men of property will employ those who turn against them?" Emancipation, according to this logic, was part of a larger and more grandiose plan by northerners to drive blacks "out of the Southern States into Mexico" so as "to make room for themselves" as Southern laborers.

The problem is that the future will be bleak for those blacks who turn to their children for support. If black children are not pushed into honest work by their parents, their children will not only turn out badly, but their futures will be in jeopardy.

    <xref link="va.au.vv.1869.07.01,#02">Valley Virginian, July 1, 1869, p. 2, c. 1: "Negro Labor in the South."</xref> This article refutes a number of claims recently made by Harriet Beecher Stowe. She suggests, after living in a ramshackle dwelling in Florida, surrounded by black people, that while in extreme poverty, they are all industrious and honest. As evidence, she illustrates how doors were left open, and keys were left lying about without a single incident of thievery. The author argues the very opposite. Black people, he claims, both before and since the war, have displayed their inherent nature to steal whenever given the chance. Further, they do not, or rather cannot understand freedom as it pertains to honoring labor contracts. In short, blacks are not to be trusted. They have managed to secure a number of offices under the auspices of the radical party, but their schemes to rule over the white race will soon be thwarted.

In fact, he implies that southern industry developed independently, and only needs time to develop and prosper on its own. Unlike others who recommend industrial bonds be formed with northern neighbors in the name of prosperity, the author recommends further disunity and invokes Jefferson's "wall of fire" principle to keep North and South separate.

Further, several examples of how these resources can be applied to new manufactures, such a blast furnaces, is described. Female academies illustrate an additional source of economic prosperity.

        <xref link="va.au.vv.1869.08.26,#03">Valley Virginian, August 26, 1869, p. 3</xref> This lengthy article recounts the story of the killing of a young man and the subsequent trial of the accused killer for murder. As the story unfolds in the courtroom, evidence mounts that the accused--Stanley--fired the weapon that ended the life of Scherer, a young Stauntonian. The question presented to the court is whether the accused was justified in this killing. Circumstances suggest that Stanley was indeed threatened by the unlawful entry of several men, including Scherer, into his house, where not incidentally, "questionable" acts were taking place. While the defense argues that Stanley killed only in self-defense, the prosecution maintained that Stanley acted in haste, and then fled the scene for fear of prosecution. Intense debate between counselors, some of the most prominent in Staunton, creates great interest among Staunton's citizenry.

One of the most significant achievements of all these schools, an important point showing the schools' vitality, is that they survived the "vicissitudes of war" and flourished soon after the war's conclusion.

What is important is that these schools are constructed as soon as possible, even if this means putting moneymaking enterprises temporarily aside. The author stresses the importance of imparting knowledge to the next generation, particularly the women. Knowledge, he says, cannot be squandered.

To do so, the article warns, would play into the hands of the Radicals, who hope Southerners will demonstrate a rebellious spirit. "It does not require much," the editor explains, "to convince those whose minds are already poisoned with prejudice against us."

To thwart their "fiendish spirit" and "demoniac desires" the author offers a plan of "'masterly inactivity.'" Since law dictates that the Constitution must be approved by a majority of the registered voters, the editor urges every white man to register but not vote. Under these circumstances, "the white man who will fail to register," and then not vote, "should be considered not only an enemy to liberty, but to his race."

The editors assert that there is now no difference between the platforms of the two parties on such critical issues as reconstruction and the role of the military in the South. The Democrat's strong resistance proved to Republicans that they could not impose a harsh reconstruction upon the South.

The radicals, the article asserts, are intent on starting a race war. The South, the editors argue, have kept their half of the bargain by accepting the results of the war, including the end of slavery, but now the North is going back on its promises of speedy reunion. If only Johnson's policy had been adhered to, the South would have been able to quickly regain peace and prosperity.

The article argues that taking the course proposed by the Gazette would play into the Radicals' hands.

The "injustice" of reconstruction is nothing next to the suffering and perseverance displayed by southern whites during the war years. If southerners only focus on resisting the Radical agenda while developing the material prosperity of their section, they will soon be readmitted to the Union with rights intact.

The author suggests that Radicals hold unconstitutional sway over the executive, and calls for the people of the North to act against those who "paralyze" the executive branch. The South, on the other hand, stripped of its power, must "keep quiet and cool" while the North decides the pressing questions of power and legitimacy. Meanwhile, southerners must concentrate on providing for the poor and doing all they can for the benefit of their children and state development.

President Grant is merely a tool of the Radicals and the Supreme Court is its puppet. The author indicates that the Radicals make a farce of the Constitution, which in turn has consequences not only for the Southern states, but the Northern ones as well. Despite the oppressive circumstances at the present, the author is confident that the next general election will yield positive results against the radicals. He assures his readers that Grant will soon have no backers.

Soon after winning the contest, he was captured by the rebels who refused every entreaty to exchange him for a rebel prisoner. The motive for their refusal, the editors claim, was that White, had he been able to take his seat, would have given the Republicans a majority in the senate. White, however, undermined their efforts when he managed to send notice back to Pennsylvania resigning his seat, thereby enabling the Republicans to secure it through a special election. As a consequence of his actions, the Democrats "will leave no means or efforts untried to compass his overthrow."

In contrast to the conservative policies endorsed by the Democrats, the most important being state's rights, the Radicals, the article contends, are promoting an aggrandizement of the federal government's powers and the placement of severe restrictions upon the former Confederate states. The Spirit maintains that the Reconstruction policy adopted for North Carolina should serve as the model for the readmittance of the southern states.

The President, it appears, has suspended all Congressional nominations for office, in direct contrast to Republican expectations. To the article's author, the Republicans' astonishment seems strange since Johnson, as they well-knew, "was always a Democrat," and was selected by them precisely because of that fact.

Determining suffrage qualifications, they note, is the province of the state governments, not the general government. The District of Columbia, however, presents a different issue. As the sole legislative power of the District, Congress has the right to enact laws it deems best suited to serve the people's interest, including enfranchising blacks.

Using a bill recently introduced by Congressman John Broomhall, a representative from the Keystone state, the piece illustrates how the unintended consequences of these measures may actually do more harm than good.

To counter the treasonous sentiments pervading the region, Congress must guarantee basic rights for the freedmen and women and must ensure that slavery will not return simply under the guise of a different name. The editors contend that the amendment recently introduced by Thad Stevens is a "step in the right direction."

Having just emerged from a lengthy war, the country is in no condition -- financially, psychologically, or physically -- to fight. Yet, the article reminds readers, the nation is still divided. Under these circumstances, then, the last thing the country needs is to be divided over domestic policy, particularly over the issue of black suffrage.

Pointing to their attempts to aid ex-slaves and the refusal of the "rump" Congress to admit the representatives from the southern states, the piece calls on the "conservative men of the country" to protest against the shelving of the Constitution.

<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1866.03.07,#02">Franklin Repository, March 7, 1866, p. 2, c. 2: "Political Status of the President."</xref> The editors assert that, despite his attempts to explain the circumstances behind it, Johnson's February 22nd speech before "copperheads and avowed rebels" was "insolent, defiant, vulgar and vituperative to a degree that would have degraded a ward politician haranguing at a corner grog-shop." The veto of Freedmen's Bureau was not a singular event, rather it was emblematic of his efforts to "seduce the Union men" to support his reconstruction scheme.

This was done, it claims, to ensure the continued loyalty of conservative members of the party, who would surely bolt if the platform reflected the true spirit of the current leadership and its opposition to Johnson.

Although Johnson has not done enough to restore the "unbounded faith" they once had in him, the editors express the hope that he will ultimately "redeem himself by seeking the confidence of the Union men of the country." The true test, they assert, will be his position on the Civil Rights bill.

Despite Johnson's claims otherwise, they declare, the bill does not propose to confer any "extraordinary rights" to blacks, rather it simply calls on the government to protect their "natural rights" as citizens.

The enactment of the legislation will guarantee that "caste, condition and color" shall no longer affect an individual's ability to enjoy the fruits of his labor or protection under the law. But it does not grant suffrage to the freedmen, a decision supported by the editors who contend that the qualifications for political rights are the province of the states.

Admittedly, the piece professes, "some of the measures of the Union party may be objectionable," yet, "can they possibly be as objectionable as the infernal schemes concocted by the rebels and their sympathizing friends?"

In fact, they insist that the nation would benefit immensely if the re-admission process could be accelerated. Congress is not responsible for the failure to achieve this goal; rather blame rests entirely on the southerners, for they consistently elect "traitors" to office despite laws barring them from serving.

<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1866.05.16,#02">Franklin Repository, May 16, 1866, p. 2, c. 1: "More Vetoes."</xref> Having "perfected his compact with traitors and copperheads," assert the editors, Johnson will surely veto two more bills passed by Congress. The first bill would admit Colorado into the Union as a state, a move the President opposes because the new state would most likely come under the rule of Republicans, thus granting the party an even larger majority in Congress. The second bill is the Habeas Corpus Act, which was passed by Congress in an effort to protect loyal men in the South who have been persecuted by local authorities for their actions during the late war, including any "real or imaginary destruction of property or injury to individuals."

<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1866.05.16,#02">Franklin Repository, May 16, 1866, p. 2, c. 2: "The Reconstruction Report."</xref> The editors acknowledge that "there is a great diversity of opinion" among Republicans as to "the detail of the proper policy of reconstruction," yet, they maintain, "Union men will unite cordially and earnestly in supporting any measure that may be accepted by the Union men of Congress." Reconstruction policy represents a case in point; though there is much disagreement over the best course of action to re-admit the former rebel states, Republicans agree that "traitors" should not be allowed to dictate the terms of re-union.

These laws, it points out, would admit the former rebels to the Union "not as equals, but as superiors" who, when the votes were tallied, would "account for nearly twice as much in influence upon all national questions as a loyal man."

Indeed, they have every confidence that Congress has used its time well and will enact a plan that both protects northerners' interests and respects the rights of the "blood stained traitors." The only obstacle to achieving this goal is President Johnson, whom the editors assert may try to subvert the government's efforts.

As a result of the continued antipathy of white southerners toward the federal government, the authors of the report assert that the former rebel states "are not at present entitled to representation" in Congress and should not be granted such until they ratify amendments to protect the civil rights of the freedpeople and "fix a stigma upon treason."

Others topics, such as the tariff, internal improvements, and foreign relations were "discussed but only incidentally." Consequently, the results of the various elections indicate that the general public in the North approves of the Republicans' efforts to force the South to accept to proposed constitutional amendments before being re-admitted to the Union.

Their ultimate goal, it asserts, is to "obtain absolute powers of government unlimited by constitutional constraints." In light of the situation, therefore, the Spirit suggests that it is possible that the "only path to peace and a settled government lies through the furnace of revolution."

Rather than accept the "magnanimous terms of reconstruction" offered by the North, they "have again listened to the promises of succor from a faithless President and the broken and demoralized Democracy, only to find both overthrown by the people."

As such, say the editors, the result represents "a declaration of the People that cannot be misunderstood by any section of the country." If the southern states wish to re-join the Union as full partners, they will not only have to accept the constitutional amendments, but must enforce them as well, otherwise Congress will offer much less generous terms.

Although the session will be short, remark the editors, Congress' "duties and responsibilities will be of the gravest character."

Only months ago, they note, the likelihood of such a measure becoming law would have been unthinkable, but now, because of continued southern obstinacy, even the Senate is in favor of adopting more stringent terms for re-union. This bill, they advise, "is evidently the first step toward taking possession of the rebellious States as territories."

The first "obliterates at one blow the sham government organized by traitors" in Louisiana, and "provides for the creation of a loyal government, by the loyal people ... without regard to color or caste--disfranchising all who have actively participated in the rebellion."

As a result, there is a general consensus within that body that the southern states are to be treated as a "conquered territory," a decision that "implies a total forfeiture of rights by the rebellious States and assumes a sovereign power in Congress to govern, direct and control them so long as they remain in their present condition."

<xref link="pa.fr.vs.1867.09.11,#02">Valley Spirit, September 11, 1867, p. 2, c. 2: "Reaction."</xref> When the South left the Union, say the new editors of the Valley Spirit, the "influence of seccession extended beyond the limits of the seceding States." Indeed, that decision "hung mill-stones around the necks" of northern Democrats, who were implicated and persecuted as a consequence of their association with southern wing of the party. But now, after seven years of defeat and marginalization, the Democrats have been resurrected.

<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1867.09.11,#02">Franklin Repository, September 11, 1867, p. 2, c. 1: "How the Matter Stands."</xref> According to the editors, there is one key issue dividing the parties in the upcoming election: their respective views on reconstruction. The Republicans support a reconstruction policy to fashion the nation into "a perfect Republic," one in which "all men shall be entitled to the same right and privileges of citizenship." By contrast, the Democrats endorse a return to the pre-war status quo.

The proclamation illustrates just how little regard Johnson has for democracy and the nation as a whole.

Everywhere Republicans have been voted into office, they have "clothed the negro with the right of suffrage."

<xref link="pa.fr.vs.1867.10.02,#02">Valley Spirit, October 2, 1867, p. 2, c. 2: "What The Radicals Intend."</xref> If elected, the editors avow, the Republicans in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York will move ahead with their primary objective: to impeach the President. Once Johnson is deposed, the editors insist, the Radicals will "put Benjamin Wade in the Executive chair" and initiate their corrupt program. The only way "to save the country" from imminent "anarchy" is to vote for the Democratic ticket.

According to the editors' rationale, the Democrats' resounding victory justified their emphasis on the highly controversial topic and proves that they have nothing to be apologize for.

<xref link="pa.fr.vs.1867.10.23,#02">Valley Spirit, October 23, 1867, p. 2, c. 3: "Cabinet Changes."</xref> President Johnson is planning to make further changes to his cabinet; "prominent" Democrats have urged him to consider members of their party as possible replacements. The editors counsel against such a move because, in addition to undermining the credibility of any Democrat who joined Johnson's cabinet, it would do the President "more harm than good."

<xref link="pa.fr.vs.1867.10.30,#02">Valley Spirit, October 30, 1867, p. 2, c. 1: "Trouble In The Radical Camp."</xref> Since the election, explains the article, the Republicans have splintered over the best course of action for the party to pursue. The split has become particularly pronounced over the issue of the party's next presidential nominee. The conservative wing has proposed Gen. Grant as the Republicans' candidate, a move that would surely provoke the ire of the "extreme men" in the party.

<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1867.11.13,#02">Franklin Repository, November 13, 1867, p. 2, c. 1: "Foreboding."</xref> Despite the Republicans' recent electoral setbacks, explain the editors, the Democrats will not be able to reverse the current course of the nation. Though the "partial success of this despicable party" has emboldened southerners and given them new hope that they might achieve what they "failed to secure by their appeal to arms," the vigilance of Congress and the people will prevail.

<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1867.11.27,#02">Franklin Repository, November 27, 1867, p. 2, c. 1: "The Political Lesson of 1867."</xref> In his first editorial since departing for his tour of the Rocky Mountains, McClure laments the Republicans' poor performance in the recent elections. He asserts the results are a consequence of the public's reaction to rampant political corruption. Should the party's troubles continue in the Presidential election in 1868, he avows, it "would turn back the tide of progress" and lead to the "practical re-enslavement of the Freedmen."

<entry>
<xref link="pa.fr.vs.1867.12.18,#02">Valley Spirit, December 18, 1867, p. 2, c. 2</xref> The editors ridicule the Repository for endorsing Gen. Grant without having a clear sense of where he stands on the issues that are most dear to its cause. The Repository's advocacy of his candidacy, they avow, illustrates the lengths Republicans will go "in order to increase their chances of whipping the Democrats" in the next election: the Republicans have shown they are willing to sacrifice "principle" for "expediency."

<entry>
<xref link="pa.fr.fr.1867.12.18,#02">Franklin Repository, December 18, 1867, p. 2, c. 1: "Congress and Christmas."</xref> The editors call on Congress to continue its work so that it may finish the present session "uninterrupted to its end." This, they say, is necessary to insure that Congress's plans for reconstruction are implemented, and to counter any attempt by President Johnson to "destroy the good work of the loyalists." "Never had a legislative body more solemn duties imposed upon it."

<entry>
<xref link="pa.fr.vs.1867.12.25,#02">Valley Spirit, December 25, 1867, p. 2, c. 1: "A Radical Blow At Grant."</xref> Reports that representatives from the Union Leagues of America and the Grand Army of the Republic met on Dec. 11th and passed a joint resolution urging the National Republican Convention to select a Presidential candidate who believes in the "equal rights of all men before the law" and "universal manhood suffrage." The editors of the Valley Spirit applaud this development because they feel it will force Gen. Grant to make public his sentiments on black suffrage (and might therefore cause dissent within the Republican ranks) and because they feel it will draw clear distinctions between the platforms of the respective parties in the upcoming election.

    <xref link="pa.fr.fr.1868.02.05,#02">Franklin Repository, February 5, 1868, p. 2, c. 2: "Stand By the Best Party."</xref> The editor seeks to convince voters that they should not abandon their party even if that party does not conform precisely with all their wishes. The paper insists that only two parties mattered in the upcoming election: The Republicans and the Democrats. Labels the former as the party of Union and the destroyer of slavery and the latter as the party of treason.

        <xref link="pa.fr.fr.1868.03.04,#02">Franklin Repository, March 4, 1868, p. 2, c. 1</xref> The editor maps out the prime reasons why the impeachment of President Johnson was justified and inevitable. Johnson violated the Tenure of Office Act by removing Stanton from the War Department and the Senate impeached Johnson as a result. The paper predicts that although public opinion could swing the verdict, both Congress and the public know Johnson should be impeached.

The editorial points out that, prior to the war, chief executives had used patronage to command obedience. Grant, therefore, was a truly democratic leader who acted with Congress rather than dictating policy himself. In short, the president was carrying out the will of the people. The author then points to the administration's successes in reducing the national debt and reconstructing the South. Furthermore, the Repository calls Democratic leaders unprincipled and derides them for having supported slaveholders and the Confederacy.

Specifically, the author argues that universal manhood suffrage, an important component of the new constitution, would transcend any equalization of the races based on voting rights alone. Rather, suffrage would pave the way for race leveling in other areas, such as legislative and judicial. There would be further consequences when free schools opened their doors to both black and white. The best way for poor whites to maintain the distinction between races is to not support the new constitution. The Radical party, the article maintains, is creating a constitution that will inevitably lead to race mixing.

With slavery finished, the introduction of the new labor regime has fueled the break up of the large plantations that had dominated the antebellum landscape. These smaller units, the piece assures readers, will provide large numbers of landless whites and yeomen with a chance to improve their station, and will lead to a more varied distribution of wealth.

        <xref link="va.au.vv.1869.06.10,#02">Valley Virginian, June 10, 1869, p. 2, c. 1: "War on the Dead."</xref> Desirous of a peaceful "reconciliation" with former enemies, the author is outraged by the shameful acts of Union soldiers toward the Confederate dead. The author recounts a story of one Union lieutenant, who ordered a charge on those paying their respects at Confederate graves at Arlington Cemetery. Blame is affixed squarely on the shoulders of GAR Post No. 1. This article claims that bitterness is only perpetuated through these types of acts. It implies that southerners would never commit such heinous acts of disrespect and that all animosity left over from the war is the fault of ill-mannered northerners.

Though the previous two legislatures rejected appeals to indemnify those who suffered losses at the hands of the Confederate raiders, the new proposals are different because they do not seek restitution, the authors of the piece contend. In an era when the Commonwealth is "overflowing with wealth," they maintain that the state can easily afford to ease the "crushing desolation" of the "several hundred families rendered homeless by the vandalism of McCausland." Should the legislature fail to act, these same families will be consigned to "hopeless ruin."
