<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Laments the defeat of the Valley Railroad subscription by Augusta voters.
                    Blames the prospect of higher taxes and refusal of assistance by Baltimore and
                    Ohio R.R. officials. Quotes a letter from B. &amp; O. R.R. president J.W.
                    Garrett, who refuses to offer any extra incentive for Augusta residents to vote
                    in favor of the measure.<br>

                    <p>From the official returns of the election on the question of subscribing
                        $300,000 to the stock of the Valley Railroad, published in an other column,
                        it will be seen that the subscription was defeated.</p>
                    <p>This road is a very great desideratum to all our people, both of town and
                        county, and is so felt by all, but the idea of increased taxes seemed to be
                        the great bug-bear.</p>
                    <p>Feeling that is was a matter of the most vital importance to the
                        interests of Staunton and Augusta County, that the road should be secured at
                        the earliest day, the City Council of Staunton passed an ordinance to take
                        the sense of our people on the question of a further subscription to the
                        Valley Railroad, having the best reasons to believe that the Baltimore and
                        Ohio Railroad Company would guarantee that the dividend on the stock
                        subscribed would pay the interest on the bonds. On Wednesday night last, the
                        following communication from Jno. W. Garrett, Esq., President of the B and
                        O. R.R. Co., was received, which dispelled all hope from this source:</p>
                    <p>BALTIMORE &amp; OHIO RAIL ROAD,</p>
                    <p>PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.</p>
                    <p>BALTIMORE, Aug. 9, 1870.</p>
                    <p>M.G. HARMAN, President, Staunton Va.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--I much regret that the people of
                        Augusta have so signally failed to appreciate their own interest. I do not
                        think any such guarantee as you propose for Staunton can be obtained in
                        Maryland.--The City of Baltimore and the Baltimore and Ohio Company feel
                        that they have acted with the greatest liberality, and if the citizens of
                        the Valley will not aid to the limited extent heretofore understood, the
                        calamity must rest with them. Their expectations about another route will
                        prove a mere ignis fatuus.</p>
                    <p>Yours very Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>J.W. GARRETT, President.</p>
                    <p>From this it will be seen, that outside help is almost hopeless. If the Balt.
                        and O. R.R., which is directly interested in the opening of this route, can
                        not aid us further, we can not reasonably expect less interested parties or
                        corporations to assist. It remains, therefore, with the people, counties or
                        towns of the Valley to secure this road. Without our earnest efforts in this
                        direction we shall lose the opportunity. Shall we bend our energies to
                        secure the Valley R.R., now, or, in the vain hope "that it will come
                        anyhow," lie supinely on our backs, and lose the golden opportunity to the
                        people of our Valley and especially of this county. Fellow citizens the
                        question is thrust upon you in all its hopelessness. How will you meet
                    it?</p>
