                    <p>The question will soon be asked the people of Augusta whether they will vote
                        the credit of the county for a subscription of $300,000 to the capital stock
                        of the Valley Railroad and thereby secure not only the immediate beginning
                        but the early completion of a railroad that they have earnestly desired for
                        well nigh 40 years. Burdened with debt, straitened by the failure of crops,
                        and dreading a load of unusual taxation, it would be strange indeed if a
                        proposition to pay more, to add the burdens already on our backs, did not
                        meet with decided opposition from many of the most prudent and influential
                        citizens of the county, from the men whose opinion all esteem, even when we
                        do not agree with them, for they are patriotic men earnestly desiring the
                        welfare of the county and jealous of its reputation. They are ones, above
                        all others, whose support we desire for this great work, therefore we would
                        reason with them, asking them to weigh the question fairly, before they
                        decide to oppose the subscription. The advantages of the future we may
                        overlook--increasing facilities for going and sending to the great markets,
                        the reduction of fares and freights resulting from competition, the
                        development of our mineral resources, the demand for the surplus lands of
                        the county; especially those contiguous to the new Railroad, the
                        distribution of coal for fuel, for furnaces and for the manufacture of lime
                        &amp;c., &amp;c., since <emph rend="italic">more than one
                        third</emph> of the whole county will be within five miles of the Valley
                        Railroad. Saying nothing of these future results, which will inevitably
                        follow the completion of this Railroad, we desire to call attention to the
                        benefits of the present and ask if we can <emph rend="italic">afford</emph>
                        to let them go. Will it not pay the whole community to pay the interest on
                        $300,000 for 2 or 3 years, if by so doing they can secure an expenditure of
                        more than a million and a quarter of Dollars in the county? The best markets
                        our producers now have is on the line of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio
                        Railroad, far west of us, because thousands are there at work on the
                        extension of that road. How would the market be if this work were going on
                        at your doors? As soon as the road is completed the company has an offer
                        from responsible parties, to pay 6 per cent upon the cost of it for the
                        privilege of using it;--to relieve us from paying interest any longer than
                        the 2 or 3 years employed in the construction of the road. While a large
                        amount is being paid for any and everything you have to sell, you are asked
                        to loan a small portion of your receipts for a few years; to invest in the
                        best stocks of the country, at the same time reaping the benefit of the
                        whole expenditure, not only of your own mite, but of others' thousands.
                        Would it not be well for those opposed to consider this carefully, ere they
                        determine to throw aside the great advantages which must accrue to us by the
                        construction of this great Valley Railroad, when they can be secured at so
                        little <emph rend="italic">real</emph> cost to us as a community?</p>

                    <p>In the United States Senate on Monday, Mr. Johnston said: I present the
                        memorial of David Fultz, of the town of Staunton, Virginia, who represents
                        that he was the owner of a large farm near that town, and that Federal
                        soldiers under the command of Generals Hunter and Sheridan, when they passed
                        through the Valley, took and carried away from him nine valuable horses, all
                        of his grain and provisions, and entered his dwelling and broke and
                        destroyed and carried away many articles of property and some family relics
                        of great value, leaving him without the necessaries of life. He also sets
                        forth that he never, by word, act, or deed, aided or abetted the rebellion,
                        but, on the other hand, he had uniformly denounced secession as an
                        abominable political heresy, and rebellion as the madness of folly and
                        wickedness. He therefore prays that, being a loyal man and friend of the
                        Union, he may be speedily compensated for the actual losses sustained by
                        him. I know him personally as a man of high standing and good character, and
                        I hope the prayer of the petitioner will receive the favorable attention of
                        the Committee on Claims, to whom I move the reference of this petition.</p>
                    <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

                    and sound judgement and high sense of honor was added a firmness that nothing
