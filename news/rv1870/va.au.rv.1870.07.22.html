                    <p>Several weeks since the State Journal leveled a
                        very pointed and, we thought, uncourteous article at us, charging us with a
                        "spiteful mis-representation" of the Hon. Jno. F. Lewis, to which we replied
                        in terms we deemed called for by the Journal
                        article. To this Mr. Lewis has responded in a letter directed to us, a copy
                        of which appeared in the State Journal on the day
                        on which his letter reached us. Were we so disposed, this would be
                        sufficient reason for a refusal on our part to publish his letter, but we,
                        nevertheless, give it below, being willing to give him a fair hearing before
                        our people, and invite their attention to it, as we shall have a word or two
                        to say in connection with it.</p>

                        Editor Vindicator, Staunton, Va.
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR:--Some days ago I was shown a copy of your paper in which various charges
                        were preferred against me. The article alluded to affirmed that I had been
                        elected to the position I now hold as a "Conservative," that I had opposed
                        the appointment of Mr. Akerman to a position in the Cabinet because he had
                        served on the staff of Gen. Toombs, &amp;c., &amp;c. I told the
                        gentleman who called my attention to the article that so far as the charge
                        related to my having opposed the appointment of Mr. Akerman there was not
                        one word of truth in it, and that he had my permission for so denying it. As
                        to the other charges, although they have been made and reiterated time and
                        again by all the democratic and other papers laboring in the interest of
                        that party in Virginia, I have not considered them of sufficient importance
                        to require a denial.</p>
                    <p>I find, however, in your issue of the 8th inst., that you reiterated the
                        charges made in your former article, and add others which have not the least
                        shadow of a foundation in truth. I propose to reply briefly to those charges
                        , with the hope that you will give my denial a place in the columns of your
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>First, then, I was not elected as a Conservative,
                        but by them, and this without any pledge on my
                        part to any one of any party. No honest member of the Legislature will dare
                        attempt to controvert this statement. It was well known not only by those
                        who elected me, but by every man of intelligence in the State, that I was an
                        open avowed Republican, a warm supporter of Gen. Grant, and in favor of his
                        nomination and election over any and all other persons. Gov Walker and
                        myself were the "True Republican" candidates. To
                        prove this I have but to refer you to the platform on which we were placed
                        by the Convention which nominated us, and to the speech of Gov. Walker in
                        accepting the nomination--to the columns of almost every newspaper in the
                        State now laboring in behalf of the democracy, in which it was daily and
                        weekly asserted that ours was the only real "True
                        Republican" party in the State. But this is not all. In further proof of my
                        position I refer you to the speeches of Gov. Walker before the
                        Reconstruction Committee, his proffer to Gen. Grant of a cordial, earnest
                        and undivided support, and his unqualified declarations of earnest sympathy
                        with the Republican cause made to every Republican Senator with whom he
                        conversed prior to the admission of the State. I made like declarations and
                        pledges, and have endeavored to faithfully and honestly carry them out. I
                        was not aware then that these solemn pledges were
                        made on the part of any one simply to deceive, and as cloak under which to
                        get back into the Union. No, neither Gov. Walker nor myself were the
                        Conservative Candidates. Mr. Withers was the standard bearer of that party;
                        and he did not withdraw until some time after the nomination of the "True
                        Republican" ticket.</p>
                    <p>As to my opposition to Mr. Akerman: Every gentleman with whom I had any
                        conversation on this subject will bear me out in the statement that, when I
                        found there was no probability of securing the nomination of Judge Rives to
                        the position of Attorney General, I did what I could to secure the position
                        to Mr. Akerman. My colleague (Judge Johnston) who is a democrat, will
                        certify to this fact. That I did not deny the charge earlier was because I
                        was absent from the city, and was not even aware that such a charge had been
                        made against me until it was shown me by the gentleman who I authorized to
                        contradict it.</p>
                    <p>You say I am "mis-representing my people." You are certainly very greatly
                        mistaken. If I could bring myself to believe for a moment that the democrats
                        are "my people," I would not be slow to acknowledge the truth of your
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>Believing that I am "mis-representing" the democracy, you think I had better
                        resign my position. With the kindest feelings in the world toward you, and
                        without any intention to reply curtly to your suggestion, I desire to inform
                        you, and through your paper all others whom it may concern, that I have no
                        taste for the position of United States Senator, and that while my health is
                        greatly suffering from the confinement to which the position subjects me,
                        nothing but death will cause me to give it up before the expiration of my
                        term of service, unless a legislature is returned which will elect an avowed
                        and earnest Republican to take my place.</p>
                    <p>And now as to the charge that I voluntarily made or sought to make any
                        contract with the Confederate Government I pronounce the charge utterly
                        false. During the war I, with others, was engaged in making iron. We had a
                        contract with Jos. R. Anderson, Esq., a private citizen of Richmond, by
                        which we were making money.--This contract a military despotism, calling
                        itself the Confederate Government, made us relinquish and required us to
                        deliver to them a portion of the iron made at our works, as an offset to
                        which we were to be furnished with a sufficient number of conscript soldiers
                        to carry on the works. This is all there is to this charge. But you go on to
                        say that a friend had to "go forward, at my instance and vouch for my
                        loyalty" to the Confederate authorities. I should be very much pleased to
                        have you name this "friend," and get him to make the charge over his own
                        signature. The charge is utterly false.</p>
                    <p>Again you say that I "gave information and guides which came near enabling
                        Gen. Early to bag the force of Custer, at the Cave," near my home. This
                        charge is in keeping with the other charges preferred against me, and is
                        false from beginning to end. If necessary I could prove by Gen. Early
                        himself that I never, on any occasion, furnished him with either information
                        or guides. I can further prove that, on the occasion referred to, I was not
                        within seventy miles of my home. Had I been there Gen. Sheridan would not
                        have destroyed my property.</p>
                    <p>I cannot believe for a moment that you desire to do me intentional wrong,
                        neither can I bring myself to believe that you place any faith in the truth
                        of the charges which you have preferred agrinst me.</p>
                    <p>I remain yours, respectfully</p>
                    <p>JOHN F. LEWIS</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis, whether intentionally or not, would lead those who have not read
                        our articles to believe that we had asserted that he was elected as a conservative. We made no such statement. We
                        said positively that he was elected by and as the nominee of the conservatives in the
                        Legislature, which he corroborates. And we assume further that whether he
                        made any pledges or not, in terms, that the acceptance of their nomination
                        and, by virtue of the election by conservatives, taking his seat in the
                        Senate was a tacit pledge to represent them. That he has failed to do this,
                        and has gone directly against their wishes and sentiments, and the wishes
                        and sentiments of a large majority of the people of Virginia, is well known
                        and is our cause of complaint, and we again assert that he does not
                        represent his people. By this we meant what we
                        said. Mr. Lewis seemingly, desires to make the impression that we meant by
                            "his people," the 'Democracy.' No, by no
                        manner of means. We insist that he mis-represents the large majority of the
                        people of the State.</p>
                    <p>Though the "True Republicans" was the name of the party on whose ticket he
                        ran for Lieut. Governor, the ticket was elected mainly by the Conservatives,
                        and we insist also that he does not represent those who elected or advocated
                        that ticket. They were conservative in sentiment, while he has left them,
                        high and dry, for radicalism. But the "True
                        Republicans" did not elect him to the Senate. It was Conservatives, (elected as Conservatives to the Legislature,) and hence the side issue of
                        "Democracy" and "True Republicans" is but a begging of the question.</p>
                    <p>His remarks about Gov. Walker, we leave for him and the Governor to settle.</p>
                    <p>As to the question of opposition to Mr. Ackerman, we give Mr. Lewis the full
                        benefit of his statement.</p>
                    <p>That Lewis, Crawford &amp; Co., of which firm Jno. F. Lewis was a
                        partner, did have a contract with the Government, the papers in the case of
                        Anderson &amp; Co., vs Maj. Jones, of the
                        Nitre &amp; Mining Bureau, on file in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit
                        Court of Augusta, prove; a sworn statement therein giving the amount of
                        hammered iron (125 tons) contracted for. The suit of Anderson &amp; Co.,
                        was dismissed, and the Government kept the iron under its contract--Whether
                        it was voluntarily sought, we made no issue--Mr.
                        Lewis raises that--we simply asserted that he had a contract. That several
                        parties applied to Col. St. John, of the Nitre &amp; Mining Department,
                        in behalf of L.C. &amp; Co., before the contract was made, we believe
                        Col. St John will attest, and that Mr. Lewis' loyalty was questioned and
                        vouched for, but we must do Mr. Lewis the justice to say that as far as its
                        being done at "his instance," from inquiry, we believe the report to have
                        been incorrect. This, however, we did not assert, only stating it among
                        other rumors, (the truth of which we expressly stated we did not know, and
                        hence would draw no conclusion therefrom,) merely to refute the charge of
                        the Journal that we were "spiteful." We could have added the rumors in that
                        connection,--"of raising or proposing to raise a company for the Confederate
                        Service"--"of giving $50 towards bringing a regiment of Indians into the
                        service," (which we had heard but did not know of their truth,) to show a
                        want of "spitefulness" on our part, or we could have turned to the Journal
                        of the Convention of 1861, of which body Mr. Lewis was a member, and cited
                        (page 184,) the unanimous election of Gen. R. E. Lee, as Commander in Chief
                        of the forces of Virginia, on the 22nd of April; (page 204) the vote of Mr.
                        Lewis in the affirmative on the question of taxing slaves to raise means to
                        carry on the war, on the part of Virginia; (page 217) his vote against
                        vacating the seats of the members of the Convention and electing others on
                        the 4th Thursday of the following May; and that, after hostilities had
                        commenced, and the battle of Big Bethel had been fought and won, we find Mr.
                        Lewis (pages 270-271) voting for Messrs. Boteler &amp; Neeson to
                        represent the 9th and 10th districts of Virginia in the Provisional Congress
                        of the Confederacy. These facts even, taken from the Journal of the
                        Convention, we could not have been considered as asserting, only adducing to
                        show that we were not "spiteful," and much less rumors which we positively
                        declared we did not know to be true.</p>
                    <p>As to the charge of furnishing information and guides which came near
                        enabling Gen. Early to capture Custer at the cave, we heard it from one who
                        was there and who was along with the guides, who gave us the same reason for
                        not capturing Custer as that given in the letter of Gen. Early, elsewhere.
                        We did not say the information was given to Gen. Early. It was given to the
                        gentleman who mentioned it to us, and the guides were furnished him. He
                        asserts that he frequently sought information from Mr. Lewis and never
                        failed to get it. Sheridan did not reach Mr. Lewis premises then, we are
                        informed, as Gen. Early held them. Mr. Lewis is therefore at fault in this.
                        May he not be as to the remainder? Surely he does not claim perfection for
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>General Early, (who saw our article and addressed a letter to us) declares
                            he received no information from Mr. Lewis. We
                        publish his letter elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion we would again remind Mr. Lewis, that it is not only the
                        "democracy" we believe he mis-represents but a large majority of the people of the State, and that it was on that
                        account we suggested the propriety of his resigning.</p>
                    <p>We know that he ran for Congress, at the election held soon after the war,
                        and that, although a candidate for Lieut. Governor on the ticket with Gov.
                        Walker, yet he also announced himself as a candidate to represent the people
                        of this district in Congress, thus offering for two offices at the same
                        time, and as we had not heard that he at all objected to taking the U.S.
                        Senatorship, and that as the gift of conservatives, we concluded he was a
                        "leetle" anxious for Congressional position. But how people can be mistaken!
                        As he is in and won't resign, we can't make him
                        do so, and the people will have to bear with patience being unrepresented,
                        as far as he is concerned. We will only add that, the people will take good
                        care to secure a Legislature, which will elect as his successor, a man, who,
                        if he does not "stick" quite so well, will more nearly represent their
                        sentiments and interests.</p>

<b>The Valley Railroad. Facts and Figures</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article written by an anonymous contributor details the immense benefits
                    and limited risks of investing in Valley Rail Road stock. Gives statistics of
                    other successful railroads, the amount of money Augusta county can expect to
                    make, and the limited amount of taxes residents would need to pay.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The amount of taxable property in Augusta county, in 1868, was $12,407,675.
                        It is confidently believed that, in 1871 and 1872, it will reach
                        $15,000,000, and if the Valley Rail Road be built that it will far exceed
                        that amount. But taking $15,000,000 as the estimate, it will only take a tax
                        of 12 cents on the $100 of property, or one-eighth of 1 per cent to pay the
                        $18,000 interest on the subscription of $300,000 to the Valley R. R. Stock.</p>
                    <p>The whole amount necessary to build the road will be subscribed, if Augusta
                        votes her quota, and having all the necessary money in hand to build the
                        road, it can be completed in two years. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R.
                        Company have proposed to lease the road, as soon as completed, at 6 per cent
                        on the cost of construction, thus guaranteeing an income from the road equal
                        to the interest; hence it it is rendered certain that the tax
                        will only have to be paid for 2 years to meet the interest.</p>
                    <p>The following sales of Rail Road Stock, made in Baltimore and New York,
                        during the present month, show the value of the stock of six roads which are
                        out of debt, or nearly so, as the Valley R.R. will be :</p>

                        county will be worth $363,000; so that, if the county does not choose to tax
                        itself to pay its bonds and keep its stock, it can sell the stock for
                        $363,000, pay its bonds and put $63,000 back into its treasury, which will
                        reimburse both principal and interest, of $36,000, paid in taxes, the first
                        two years.</p>
                    <p>The estimated cost of building the road through Augusta county is
                        $1,360,000.--All this money will be put in circulation in the county within
                        two years, and equally distributed over it, both by contractors and work
                        hands, for every thing you may have to sell. By a late resolution, passed at
                        a meeting of the Board of Directors, the road will pass as near as
                        practicable through the centre of the county, which will bring it within 5
                        miles of one-third of all the improved land in the county, and cannot fail
                        to add from 25 to 50 per cent to the value of all the property in the
                        county, or from $3,000,000 to $6,000,000 to the aggregate wealth of the
                        county.</p>
                    <p>These are facts that can, every one, be proven by evidence that would stand

                    <p>Lynchburg, July 16th, 1870.</p>
                    <p>
                        Editor of the Staunton Vindicator
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR:--I have seen a letter from Mr. John F. Lewis to you, in which he refers
                        to a statement charging him with having given me information to enable me to
                        capture Custer's force of cavalry at Weir's Cave in 1864. As it might be
                        presumed that the information on which the charge was made emanated from me,
                        and being always willing to give even the devil his due, I think it proper
                        to state, at once, that Mr. Lewis gave me no information whatever, at any
                        time during the war, in regard to the enemy; and I have never intimated to
                        any one, either during or since the war, anything on which the charge in
                        question could be founded. At the time I was at Brown's Gap, in 1864, where
                        Mr. Lewis' residence was, he was from home, and I do not recollect of seeing
                        him at all during the war except at Staunton in the winter 1863-4, when he
                        came to that place for the purpose of bringing some pig-iron to be sent to
                        Richmond. At that time, I had a brief conversation with Mr. Lewis, and this
                        is the sole interview I have any recollection of of having had
                        with him, from the time we parted in Richmond as members of the Convention.
                        On the occasion of my seeing him at Staunton, at the time mentioned, after
                        he had left me, Major Jones, of Fauquier, who was the officer acting for the
                        Ordnance Department and the Nitre and Mining Bureau, at Staunton, came to me
                        and informed me, that Mr. Lewis had a contract with the Ordnance Department
                        at Richmond to furnish pig-iron for the Government, and that he had made
                        another contract with the Tredegar Iron Works Company in violation of his
                        contract with the Ordnance Department, and was then seeking to send some
                        iron to the said company which properly belonged to the Government. He
                        further stated that he had received orders to prevent the iron from being
                        sent to the Tredegar Iron Works, and wished to know if I would sustain him
                        in it, to which I replied in the affirmative; and the iron was stopped at
                        that time. What became of it afterwards, I do not know, as I soon left the
                        Valley for the army on the Rapidan. Of the facts about the contract I knew
                        nothing personally, but knowing Major Jones, I had no doubt whatever about
                        the entire accuracy of the information given by him.</p>
                    <p>At the time I made the attempt to capture Custer's force at or near Wier's
                        Cave, the information I acted upon was derived from our own scouts and
                        reconnaissance made by our cavalry, and I thought then, and still think, I
                        would have been able to capture the whole force, or the greater part of it,
                        if untimely intimation of our position had not been given by Brig. General
                        Wickham's opening with artillery on the wagon camp, in entire disregard of
                        my positive instructions. Not only then is Mr. Lewis entirely innocent of a
                        laudable design to do any harm to the invaders of his State in the matter
                        referred to, but I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction, formed
                        from information received while I was in the Valley, and confirmed by his
                        course since, that he would have been much more ready to give any
                        information whatever to the enemy, though that information might have caused
                        the beautiful Valley of his nativity, from the head waters of South River,
                        Christian's Creek, and Middle River, to where the Shenandoah tumbles into
                        the Potomac, and from the summit of the Blue Ridge to that of the great
                        North Mountain, to be converted into smouldering ruin and a desolate,
                        irreclaimable waste, utterly unfit for the habitation of man or beast, than
                        to have dropped a hint to any one on our side that would have led to the
                        capture of a solitary one of the invading horde; and I have been surprised
                        that any living being in the Valley should have been of a different opinion,
                        or have given Mr. Lewis credit for ever having had a solitary patriotic
                        impulse from the beginning. He says that if he had been at home, Sheridan
                        would not have destroyed his property. My recollection is, that it was
                        Hunter who destroyed his Iron-Works, just before the battle of Piedmont or
                        New Hope, in June 1864, and I think I can hardly be mistaken in this.</p>
                    <p>Yours very Respectfully,</p>

                    <p>TO THE VOTERS OF AUGUSTA COUNTY.</p>
                    <p>On the 6th day of August next you will be called on to determine by your
                        votes, whether you will subscribe $300,000 to the Stock of the Valley
                        Railroad Company. We have been appointed a Central Committee to use such
                        proper means and arguments and to disseminate such information as will
                        induce you to respond favorably to the question to be submitted for your
                        decision. You will understand us, then, as approaching you in no partisan
                        spirit, as the advocates of no individual or sectional interests, but as
                        friends of the proposition, that a great line of Railroad shall be carried
                        thirty-four miles through the heart of Augusta county, and that you, who we
                        think, will be recipients of immense benefits to flow from the construction
                        of this Road, shall help to make it. In various ways you have given your
                        confidence to many of us in times past: we think we have not heretofore
                        deceived you by our counsels, and we now unite (and in this we are
                        sustained, we believe, by every citizen of the county, in whom, at any time,
                        you ever reposed your general trust,) in earnestly urging you to vote for
                        the subscription. We are influenced in giving this advice, by considerations
                        too numerous to be stated here in detail, but we have carefully pondered
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Communities are generally influenced in their actions by two considerations.
                        First, do honor and good repute urge us to follow a certain line of conduct?
                        and Second, does self-interest incline us in that direction? We are
                        convinced that both of these considerations demand that you shall vote for
                        this subscription.</p>
                    <p>Augusta county is the Empire county of Virginia; it is the most populous and
                        wealthy county in the State. It has for many years been the favored
                        recipient of public monies, freely spent in its borders; it has been
                        distinguished by its support, and advocacy of internal improvements, and for
                        its public spirit; it has for many years past been earnestly desiring the
                        construction of a great Railroad thoroughfare through the Valley; it has, in
                        connection with delegations from all the Valley counties, gone, by its
                        delegates in large numbers, on two occasions, to the city of Baltimore; once
                        under the immediate auspices and personal lead of Gen Robert E. Lee, (to
                        whom the construction of this road is an object of peculiar interest;) and
                        has urged and entreated Baltimore to aid in this great enterprize. The
                        efforts of her citizens, in this regard, after an earnest struggle, have
                        been successful. Baltimore has agreed to subscribe one million of dollars,
                        the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company has agreed to subscribe another
                        million, nay, more, the sister counties along the line of the Road, have
                        subscribed $800,000, and the Town of Staunton $100,000. All this has been
                        done, in furtherance and part performance of what Augusta county has
                        demanded for many years should be done, and yet all this must go for
                        naught--must fall as water poured on the sand, without the co-operation of
                        Augusta. All the other subscriptions are conditional, and unless an
                        additional sum be subscribed by Augusta or some other county or town in the
                        Valley, they must all fail. We know of no other county which can or will
                        subscribe an additional sum. We confess that we shall feel humbled and
                        wounded in our reputation, as Augusta county men, if we turn our backs on
                        our friends at the crisis of trial, and refuse to unite with them; and the
                            moreso should the refusal be made for the reason urged by
                        some for pursuing this line of conduct that this, that somebody else will do the work and, we will get the benefits and
                        pay nothing for them. Take an illustration of this:--Six neighbors want a
                        road made thro' a district of country for the accommodation and convenience
                        of all; five of them raise and are ready to expend the means, on their part,
                        to complete the road. The sixth man, who happens to live midway between the
                        terminal points says to his neighbors--"I want the road very much, it will
                        be a great blessing to me, but as I think you are bound to have it any how,
                        without my contributions, I will do nothing and either live without the
                        road, or enjoy it at atyour expense."
                        This we say is not the utterance of an Augusta county man of the olden time
                        and we trust no such thought will be cherished and acted on by any of our
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Again self-interest governs communities:--This is too wide a field for
                        comment here, but we venture to say, that there is not a judicious man in
                        the county who will deny that, to the county as a whole, the construction
                        and working of this road will be immensely beneficial. In the construction
                        of it, simply, $1,250,000--(the far greater portion of it other peoples money)--must be spent in Augusta
                        county. We all know how the property holders and laboring men must thrive
                        and prosper in the midst of such an outlay. In the working of it, who can
                        enumerate the blessings it will confer upon our people? Located as we will
                        be just at the point of intersection of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and
                        the Valley Railroads, just at the point of competition our county in its
                        length and breadth will feel in all its interests the effect of reduced
                        rates of transportation on all its products and imports--its flour, corn,
                        bacon, beef, hay, livestock, iron and the many products it sends abroad, and
                        on the plaster, salt, fertilizers, agricultural implements and merchandise
                        it imports. Two great rival markets, Baltimore and Richmond, will compete
                        for our trade; two great rival lines will compete for our transportation.
                        Who can doubt that the cost of transportation will be greatly reduced? If
                        reduced even slightly it will pay thetax; ten cents on a barrel
                        of flour will save the county $10,000 a year; one dollar on a ton of plaster
                        (two dollars can easily be saved) will reduce the cost of that article about
                        $5,000. Consider, in addition, the saving in hay freight, on live stock and
                        other tonnage, and we must be of opinion that this subscription will be no
                        gift, but a wise and paying investment.</p>
                    <p>A great deal has been said about the burden of the tax. The real and personal
                        property of the whole county of Augusta, on the basis of the assessments of
                        1856, in part, is valued at $12,407,695. By the census of 1860, the real and
                        personal property of the county, exclusive of slaves, was estimated at
                        $16,000,000 in round numbers: and by the report of the Auditor of Virginia
                        of 1861, the value of the real estate of the county was $14,326,399, and of
                        the personal property $10,007,898. This last included the value of slaves,
                        the number of which was 4,708, which if averaged at $500 would produce the
                        sum of $2,354,000, showing an aggregate of about $22,000-000 of real and
                        personal broperty in the entire county. A portion of this
                        personal property, however, was not taxable.</p>
                    <p>But on the basis of 1856 alone, to pay the interest, the tax will be 15 cents
                        on each hundred dollars worth of property. So that if a man is worth $1,000,
                        he will pay $1.50 tax; if he is worth $10,000, he will pay $15.00 tax; if he
                        is worth $20,000, he will pay $30.00 tax--no more, no less--even if no
                        income at all be derived directly from the road. But here we have the
                        contract tendered to us by the Orange, Alexandria &amp; Manassas
                        Railroad Company, to take our road and work it at their own expense and pay
                        us for the use of the Valley Road sixty per cent of the gross receipts. That
                        is: $60 of every $100 of gross amounts for fare and freight received. The
                        road will begin to pay, then, as soon as it is finished, section by section.</p>
                    <p>Again: The subscription of Augusta will secure the prompt completion of the
                        whole line, and the profitable working of the entire improvement. Contracts
                        will be promptly, but prudently let; and the work along the whole line will
                        be steadily pushed to completion. Never, in Virginia, has a Railroad been
                        commenced under better auspices or with more certainty of success as to its
                        completion, and also as to its value and profitableness to the country
                        through which it will pass, than this. We earnestly urge the subscription as
                        the only means known to us to make sure these desirable results.</p>
