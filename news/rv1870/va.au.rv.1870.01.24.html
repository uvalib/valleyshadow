<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper discusses provisions of the bill readmitting Virginia to the
                    Union that the editors consider punitive.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Bill for the admission of Virginia, passed by both Houses of Congress,
                        will be found elsewhere. When Virginia occupied an acknowledged place in the
                        Union, it was a Union of Sovereign States, with equal rights. To day she is
                        re-admitted to a place among the States of the Union, not the old Union
                        which she assisted to establish but a new concern. Her act of admission is
                        also a penal statute.</p>
                    <p>It contains conditions to which no other State in the Union is subjected;
                        that she will never do certain things which other States have the full power
                        to do. It prescribes an oath to be taken by her officers and Legislators,
                        which obtains in the case of no other State, and attaches a penalty of
                        imprisonment and fine for taking said oath improperly, and yet it is claimed
                        that the Union to which she is now admitted is a Union of "equal States,
                        with equal rights and privileges."</p>
                    <p>Well it may be, but we confess our inability to see it, and are more than
                        pleased that there has been no uproarious rejoicing over the re-admission of
                        Virginia on the terms and conditions required.</p>
                    <p>The only part that we are disposed to rejoice over, is the fact that Virginia
                        has not been required to give her assent to the terms of the Bill of
                        Admission, for God knows she has eaten dirt enough already to sicken a dozen
                        "Mothers of States and Statesmen."</p>
                    <p>There may be some who are disposed to exult at the mere restoration of
                        Virginia, to whom we commend the following summary of what she has been
                        required to do or bear, in order to secure the boon (?) of restoration:</p>
                    <p>1. The ratification of the 13th amendment to the Federal Constitution,
                        abolishing slavery.</p>
                    <p>2. The repeal of her ordinance of secession.</p>
                    <p>3. The repudiation of the Confederate debt.</p>
                    <p>4. The adoption of the Bayne-Underwood constitution, giving the ballot to all
                        male negroes twenty-one years old, and making them all eligible to office;
                        and giving them control in a large proportion of the counties of the State.</p>
                    <p>5. The election of a Republican delegation to Congress.</p>
                    <p>6. The election of a Republican State ticket.</p>
                    <p>7. The ratification of the 14th amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>
                    <p>8. The ratification of the 15th amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>
                    <p>9. An oath from every member of the State Legislature, and every executive
                        and judicial officer of the State, to the effect that he does not come
                        within the terms of the 3d clause of the 14th amendment.</p>
                    <p>10. That the constitution of the State shall never be amended so as to
                        prevent persons from voting who are paupers, or who may not have paid their
                        taxes, or who may not know how to read or write.</p>
                    <p>11. That the said constitution of the State shall never be altered so as to
                        deprive any one of the right to hold office on account of color.</p>
                    <p>12. That the said constitution shall never be changed so as to deprive the
                        colored people of equal rights and privileges in connection with the public
                        schools of the State.</p>
                    <p>After rolling this delightful morsel under their tongues, if they be still
                        disposed to rejoice, why let them do it. Halloo at the top of your voices,
                        gentlemen, and let the world hear how loud you can shout, and for how
                        little.</p>
                <br>
