<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Rejoices in the wave of greater support for the idea of abandoning the
                    "Conservative" label in favor of rejoining the Democrats. Believes this course
                    of action the only way to defeat the Republicans and restore order to the state

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are pleased to see that the suggestions we made in our last meets with a
                        concordant sympathy from a number who have formerly been opposed, and of
                        them bitterly, to the Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>They clearly understand that to secure the success of the opposition to
                        Republicanism we must form a close union with the great National party now
                        so successfully opposing that party. That to organize for the next
                        Presidential Campaign there must be no break in the ranks--no
                        "Conservatives" in Virginia while there are only Democrats elsewhere. All
                        must be Democrats or perfect failure be the result.</p>
                    <p>We have been clearly of this opinion for a long while, but, on account of the
                        feeling engendered by old party prejudices, and for the good of our whole
                        people, we did not insist upon it. At this day a clearer view can be had of
                        the whole political field than heretofore, and prejudice has given away, to
                        a great extent, before stern facts. In consequence, the general desire is to
                        unite with that old organization, which has continued to battle with the
                        Republican party through good and ill, and is to-day reaping the result of
                        its incessant contest. The object is to restore the Government to its
                        pristine purity, and this, it is acknowledged can only be done through the
                        instrumentality of the Democratic party. It stands to-day the bulwark and
                        support of the country--the hope of the nation.</p>
                    <p>All who look to results in the future, will rejoice that a party exists
                        to-day upon which they can lean as a staff and support. The columns of
                        Democracy are rapidly increasing. Fall in and swell it to the utmost.</p>
                    <p>The long-roll of the next Presidential contest will be sounded ere long, and
                        the friends of good Government will be summoned to rally, to restore and
                        preserve the Constitution of our fathers. There must then be no wavering. He
                        who fails to oppose the infractions of Republicanism, had as well be with
                        that party. Quibbling will not answer. Dislike to names will not avail with
                        a people ground down by unjust and unnecessary taxation. But a manly
                        opposition to the extravagances of the party in power will be required--aye,
                        is necessary to accomplish the full defeat of that party, which has been so
                        favorably begun in the late elections. This done, and Radicalism very dead,
                        there will be time and opportunity afforded to all to unite with parties
                        differing on the issues of the day, and both striving to preserve the
                        government under the Constitution handed down to us. Then away with all
                        prejudice and let Democracy be the rallying cry until the Radicalism of
                        to-day has ceased to exist on American soil.</p>

<b>The Inharmonious Party</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper concurs with the New York Herald's prediction that the Republican
                    Party is on the verge of self-destruction. If the issue of rights for African
                    Americans does not irreparably divide them, then the debate over the tariff
                    will.<br>

<b>The New Road Law</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints a law passed by the legislature regarding the upkeep of
                    roads. Each township will have the responsibility to appoint a commissioner to
                    see that they are kept in good shape, and raise taxes for that effect.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Geo. W. Smiley, who stabbed Jos. Black, killing him, at the residence of John
                        W. Bush, in this place, on the 12th inst., and left immediately after the
                        difficulty, was brought back on Friday last, in the custody of a Deputy
                        Sheriff of Rockingham, and lodged in jail.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances of his arrest were as follows: Having reached his home near
                        Mt. Crawford, and having seen his family, he wrote a note to Deputy Sheriff,
                        Christian Miller, expressing his willingness to surrender himself to the
                        officers of the law, and requested him to come to his house and take him in
                        custody. Mr. Miller accordingly did so and brought him here as stated above.</p>
                    <p>Mayor Trout, having offered $100 reward for Smiley's arrest, Mr. Miller
                        called to see him and declined to take any reward, saying he had "only done
                        his duty as an officer." This fact having been reported to the City Council
                        by Mayor Trout, the Council passed the following resolution:</p>
                    <p>RESOLVED.--That Christian Miller, D.S. of Rockingham county,, deserves the
                        thanks of this Council, and of all good citizens for the disinterested and
                        prompt manner in which he has discharged his duty, in this case.</p>
                    <p>We learn that Mr. Smiley waives an examining trial and will be tried in
                        January before the Husting's Court of Staunton, in which Judge John Greene
                        Smith presides.</p>
