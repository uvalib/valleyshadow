                <transcript>
                    <p>There are several things of direct interest to the people of Staunton and
                        Augusta County, which we have called attention to in our columns, and which
                        elicited considerable interest at the time.</p>
                    <p>We again revert to these subjects, in the hope that all may again consider
                        them and that an united effort may be made to obtain their benefits.</p>
                    <p>First on the list is the securing of the Repair Shops of the great Chesapeake
                        &amp; Ohio Railroad. Located here they would increase our population
                        with a large and industrious class, which would increase largely the demand
                        at this point for the productions of our county, and place in circulation
                        here a very large amount yearly in addition to the cost of necessary
                        articles provided by our farmers. These shops would consume large amounts of
                        iron, steel, nails, timber of all kinds &amp;c., and would thus be a
                        nucleus around which would spring up Forges Rolling Mills, Nail Factories,
                        and Manufacturing establishments of various other kinds. These would add
                        largely to our population and be of immense pecuniary advantage to the
                        people of both town and county.</p>
                    <p>As a writer in these columns suggested some time since, it would pay
                        handsomely to purchase the ground and make a present of it to the Chesapeake
                        &amp; Ohio Company, and relieve them of taxation for a number of years,
                        to secure the location of their shops here. This is patent to all who
                        reflect on the subject, and we invite all to consider it anew, and confer
                        together as to the best course to pursue to secure the location of these
                        shops at this point.</p>
                    <p>The increase at once of our banking facilities demands our attention. All
                        acknowledge that we need greater facilities than we now have, and some
                        suggestions have been made through our columns looking to that end.</p>
                    <p>The most prominent were for the establishment of a Savings Bank with a
                        capital of $100,000, already chartered, and the taking up of the unpaid
                        stock of the Virginia Insurance Company. These were good suggestions and
                        both could be carried out without conflict.</p>
                    <p>The Savings Bank could be started with a fair capital paid up, and without
                        our community scarcely feeling it, and at the expiration of twelve months
                        would have a paid up capital of $100,000. This would add much to our Banking
                        capital, and, together with deposits loaned at a living rate of interest,
                        would make a large dividend to stockholders.</p>
                    <p>The Stock of the Virginia Insurance Company not paid up, or at least a
                        majority of it, can be secured. The shares are $25 each, in the reach of
                        nearly every one, and if taken it would have a paid up capital of $125,000.
                        The accretions from Insurance, if properly pushed, would in five years give
                        it a capital of at least $500,000, and continually increasing. This could be
                        loaned at a moderate rate of interest and would add much to the pecuniary
                        advantage of all.</p>
                    <p>We, of course, in a short article, can not <emph rend="italic">speake</emph>
                        in detail of the advantages or dwell upon those mentioned in so cursory a
                        manner. Nor is it our purpose just now. We only desire to call attention
                        anew to some subjects of importance, as we think, to all our people, in the
                        hope they may think and then <emph rend="italic">act</emph></p>
                    <p>In the mean time we propose to open at our office a list of names of those
                        who will take stock in either of the latter schemes, and invite all
                        interested to either open similar lists, or come forward and give us their
                        names. We also again urge one and all to take these subjects into
                        consideration, and let us not by inertness lose advantages we might possess
                        by merely making an effort.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On the 7th inst., the Radicals will make an attempt to reorganize their party
                        in this State and also to recruit from the supporters of Governor Walker. In
                        this they will be mistaken. The Anti-Radicals have a larger majority in the
                        State to day than when Governor Walker was elected. They may not be
                        organized like the Radicals will be, but they learned a thing or two in the
                        last gubernatorial election. They learned their own strength and best of all
                        how easy it was to increase it. It also opened the eyes of the colored
                        people. They feared, as they were told by the Radicals, that the election of
                        Gov. Walker would deprive them of their privileges as citizens. Finding this
                        to be false, they will, henceforth, have no fear in voting with their old
                        friends and present employers. They have or are learning that the interest
                        of the whites of the South is now their own interest. Those who voted with
                        the conservatives in the late Gubernatorial election are still jubilant over
                        their wisdom and foresight. Many who voted the Radical ticket are chagrined
                        and acknowledge their error, and promise in the future to cooperate, for the
                        best interests of all, with their old friends and former owners.</p>
                    <p>In truth and in fact, in the election of Governor Walker the Radical party in
                        Virginia was killed very dead, and all the powers of Senator Lewis and his
                        co-laborers can not revive it, unless the supporters of Walker assist. This
                        they are not likely, knowing their strength, to do. Indeed the break is from
                        the Republican party. The colored voters, as we have endeavored to show
                        above, who were the firmest reliance of the white Radicals, will be largely
                        with the conservatives. Then, unless we are greatly mistaken, on the 7th
                        inst., the Republican party in Virginia will have signed its death warrant.
                        From the signs of the times its power and influence is warning every where.</p>
                    <p>There will, however, be a conciliatory effort made on the 7th to draw in
                        those conservatives who were "on the fence" and perhaps some whose knees did
                        not <emph rend="italic">exhibit</emph>a tremor in the last election. On
                        account of the want of a thorough organization alone on the part of the
                        conservatives, we warn them not to be cajoled or flattered by what Senator
                        Lewis and his Radical friends may offer. He has betrayed your confidence
                        once; let that suffice. Besides all this you realized your power in the
                        hotly contested canvass of Walker and Wells, and a moment's reflection will
                        suggest numberless causes for a large increase of that power at this time.
                        Beware then of the Richmond parlor of the Radical spider.</p>

                    <p>The New Orleans <emph rend="italic">Times</emph>, on the authority of "a
                        large planter just returned from Chattanooga," states that by the regular
                        official accounts of the railroads at the latter place, it appears that
                        31,000 negroes have passed through on their way to the States of
                        Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. The <emph rend="italic">Times</emph> adds:</p>
                    <p>This influx is steadily increasing, and from the accounts which reach us of
                        the great satisfaction of the negroes from the old States who have emigrated
                        to this State, the high wages they command on the sugar and cotton
                        plantations, and the glowing accounts they write back to their relatives and
                        friends in the States of Virginia and the Carolinas, we should not be
                        surprised if the seaboard States were relieved, in a very brief period, of
                        their whole negro population.</p>

                    <p>The County Court has been in session since Monday last. Very little of
                        general interest transpired. The trial of Jas. Terrell, Alex Bush, Jessee
                        and Sam Harden (colored,) for breaking into the store-house of Mr. Charles
                        Haines, of Waynesboro', took place on Wednesday, and all the parties were
                        acquitted.</p>
                    <p>Alex Bush, Jesse and Sam Marden, colored, and Wm. Murray, colored, were
                        retained in custody and tried on Wednesday evening on the charge of stealing
                        40 gallons of Brandy from Simon Koiner's still-house, and acquitted. Murray
                        was re-arrested on the charge of stealing bacon from Daniel Wine. A <emph
                            rend="italic">nolle prosequi</emph> was entered in the cases of Primus
                        Bowles and Isaac Walker, charged with larceny.</p>

                    <p>The commencement of construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio and, in all
                        probability, the Valley Railroad also, will bring to this and adjacent
                        localities a large number of consumers. The supplies for them will be drawn
                        mostly from Augusta and adjoining counties. We therefore call the attention
                        of our farmers to this fact that they may make every effort to furnish the
                        greatest possible amount of produce to those engaged on these public works.</p>
                    <p>It will be the best sort of a home market for everything raised, and if both
                        of these lines are worked vigorously, our people will reap a harvest of
                        money, unexcelled in our previous history. Many of our farmers understand
                        this, but some are disposed still to despond on account of hard times. To
                        such we say, reflect but a moment and you will be repaid with the prospect
                        of a glowing prosperity in the near future.</p>
