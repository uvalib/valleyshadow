<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It may not be known to many in this locality that a charter is in existence
                        for a Savings Bank in this place with a capital of $100,000, the shares in
                        which are only $20 each. The establishment of this Bank at this time is very
                        much to be desired. Numbers have expressed themselves favorable to it and
                        their willingness to subscribe liberally for the stock. The idea is to loan
                        on good paper at a low rate of interest, and, while making a fair profit to
                        stockholders, give the greatest possible advantage and stimulous to the
                        business interests of community. It seems to us that the mere mention of an
                        institution which could afford a large accommodation to our people at a fair
                        interest would induce all to take stock in it. Such an institution would be
                        of great benefit to our merchants, mechanics and laboring men. They could,
                        all, on the plan proposed, take stock and pay it in almost without feeling
                        it. Then the advantage from the deposites of many who do not now deposit
                        with either bank, but who would deposit with such an institution, would be
                        immense to one and all in this community. From the fact that their money
                        would be safer on deposit than in their own pockets, and that it would not
                        be used as a means of extortion would induce our farmers generally to
                        deposit in such a bank. All of them have some surplus which could be
                        increased by taking stock in it and many farmers would take stock in
                        preference to loaning their money themselves and by this they would derive a
                        larger profit than they could possibly get themselves. This much merely to
                        call attention to what would be a great desideratum to this entire
                        community, and to advise those who feel an interest in the matter (and who
                        does not?) to push it and establish the Staunton Savings Bank. More banking
                        capital and facilities are needed here. Let us take it in hand and secure
                        them.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have received the following communication from a very practical gentleman
                        in this place and deem it of sufficient importance to give it a place in our
                        editorial columns. We shall be pleased to hear from him further on this
                        subject--and one, we beg leave to say, which is of the greatest importance
                        to our people.</p>
                    <p>SHALL STAUNTON BE A MANUFACTURING TOWN?</p>
                    <p>The early completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad is now a fixed fact.
                        I think it safe to say that by the 1st of July 1871 the road will be
                        completed to the coal fields, when the development of the inexhaustible
                        mines of Iron in this county will commence. Blast furnaces will spring up
                        all through our county, from the Blue Ridge to Goshen, along the line of the
                        Railroad. Millions of tons of the now hidden treasure will be taken from the
                        bowels of the earth and reduced to marketable products. The manufacture of
                        pig-iron is only the beginning of what we should have. After the Blast
                        Furnace comes Rolling Mills, Steel Factories, Foundrys, Machine Shops, and
                        Establishments for the manufacture of Agricultural Implements, to say
                        nothing of the manufacture of small wares, such as files, saws, cutlery and
                        all kinds of hardware.</p>
                    <p>The Blast Furnaces will be located near the mines, but the factories
                        mentioned will go up in or near the towns, or if property and taxes are too
                        high in the towns in existence, will build up towns at suitable places along
                        the road. A good suggestion has been made in one of your contemporaries,
                        which I hope our citizens who have building lots for sale will heed--viz: to
                        be satisfied with fair prices for their property and not drive capital away
                        by asking enormous prices. I would also suggest to those who have property
                        to rent to be content with a fair per cent on
                        their investments, or they may build up rivals in our neighboring towns
                        along the road.</p>
                    <p>There is much to be done to make Staunton what it can be made, a large
                        manufacturing town. The first thing to be done is to secure a good town
                        council, who have the ability to manage its affairs properly. They should
                        follow the example of St. Louis, Mo., Bloomington, Ill; and others; by
                        passing ordinances exempting from taxation for 10 or 20 years, all property
                        and capital employed in manufactories, on condition that parties begin
                        operations in say 2 years, which I think would insure investment here of
                        capital in manufacturing enterprises at once, so as to commence operations
                        by the time coal is reached. Can we afford to do this? Let us see. Suppose a
                        company builds a Rolling Mill, with a capacity sufficient to employ 500
                        hands, which will add to our population at least 2500 persons, who will
                        spend with our Merchants, Shoemakers, Doctors, Lawyers and others $100 per
                        head, per annum, (a low estimate) or in the aggregate $250,000. Would not
                        that item alone enable our Merchants and others to pay the Rolling Mill
                        Company's taxes. Now that is only one establishment. The Rolling Mill will
                        bring others. So it is plain that it would pay to adopt such a policy.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that we might induce the new management of the Chesapeake
                        &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., to establish their workshops here. I, as a
                        tax-payer, would be willing for our town authorities to buy the land they
                        may need and make them a present and then exempt them from taxes forever if
                        that would secure them. Their shops established here will form a nucleus
                        around which we could build up a considerable manufacturing interest, as
                        they would be large consumers of Bar Iron, and Steel, and all kinds of
                        hardware and lumber.</p>
                    <p>Let us follow the example of Bloomington, Ill; which, I think, has taken the
                        proper steps to build herself up. She has appointed a committee to
                        correspond with capitalists, who have means and manufacturing experience,
                        showing the advantages of their town. They have also a travelling committee
                        who have visited places where manufacturing is carried on and, at a meeting
                        of the citizens, on the 3rd of Nov. last, reports from the Committee were
                        read showing that manufactures, especially of Agricultural Implements,
                        greatly increased the commerce and substantial permanent prosperity of the
                        towns where they exist.</p>
                    <p>I have written more than I intended, but this subject is of such vast
                        importance I feel that something should be done to make our people take that
                        interest in it which they should. Some of the most prosperous manufactories
                        are in small towns in the midst of raw material and the consumer of their
                        goods there is thus saved a large amount in the transportation fees of raw
                        material to distant places for manufacture and another large amount in
                        paying return freight on manufactured articles. Besides employment is thus
                        given to thousands who would otherwise be idle and a burden on community.</p>
                    <p>The establishment of Manufactories throughout the country in towns and
                        villages is a sure road to a healthy material prosperity, and is a safeguard
                        against the absorption by powerful monopolies in any one manufacturing
                        interest.<br> A CITIZEN</p>
