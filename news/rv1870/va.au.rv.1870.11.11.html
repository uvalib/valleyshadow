                    and wagon, and a number of agricultural implements. The damage amounted to
                    between $1,200 and $1,500. The paper blames the fire on a "negro boy" who

                    <p>The returns of the election in this county are all in but have not been
                        opened by the canvassers and consequently we are unable to give the official
                        vote. Enough, however, is known to assert the election of all the nominees
                        of the County Conservative Convention, except Chas. T. Cochran nominee for
                        County Treasuer, who is defeated by Paul, independent
                        Conservative. Paul's majority will probably reach 400.</p>
                    <p>The Congressional returns have not been received from all the Counties of
