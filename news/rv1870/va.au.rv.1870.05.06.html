<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The new Registration will commence in this county on Tuesday next May 10th,
                        and continue till the 17th, when all, whether they have registered
                        heretofore or not, if they wish to vote, are required to come forward and
                        register. Some suppose because they have not been allowed to register
                        heretofore, that they cannot register now. This is a mistake. The
                        disfranchising clause was stricken out of the constitution by a large
                        majority of the popular vote. Consequently every man in Augusta, 21 years
                        old, can register and vote, provided he is not an idiot or lunatic, and has not been convicted either of bribery in elections,
                        embezzlement of public funds, treason or felony, or has not been engaged in
                        a duel since the adoption of the constitution.</p>
                    <p>The form of the registration oath may deter some from taking it. This oath is
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>"I, ---, do solemnly swear or affirm, that I am not disqualified from
                        exercising the right of suffrage by the Constitution framed by the
                        Convention, which assembled in the City of Richmond on the third day of
                        December, eighteeen hundred and sixty-seven: and that I will
                        support and defend the same, to the best of my ability."</p>
                    <p>Now, unless they come under one of the heads mentioned above, none are disqualified, by the constitution, from
                        registering and voting, no no matter what disabilities they may
                        have under the 14th amendment. Bear this in mind then.--If you have registered, you must register again. If you have been prevented from registering
                        from any, but the causes mentioned above, you certainly can register now, and vote. See the times and places given
                        elsewhere and be sure you present yourself at the proper places in your
                        township and register.</p>
