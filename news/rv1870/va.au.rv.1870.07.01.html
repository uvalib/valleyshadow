<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Highly praises the actions of Baldwin Alexander, a 17 year old newly
                    appointed cadet to the Naval Academy who refused to take the test-oath out of

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Baldwin Alexander, a youth of 17 years, of Pulaski, Co., Virginia, was
                        appointed, by Congressman Gibson, a cadet in the U.S. Naval Academy,
                        Annapolis, Md. He stood his examination successfully and made a most
                        favorable impression on the Examining Board and the Secretary of the Navy,
                        and his appointment was confirmed.</p>
                    <p>As a pre-requisite to his admission to the Academy, he was required to take
                        the test-oath. When it was presented, he told the authorities, that, though
                        but twelve years of age at the close of the war, the struggle in which his
                        friends and fellow-Southrons had engaged, had enlisted his earnest sympathy,
                        and to take the prescribed oath would be the basest perjury on his part, and
                        declined to take it.</p>
                    <p>With all the aspirations of a youth of seventeen, with the object, perhaps,
                        of his fondest hopes with all it prospective advantages almost in
                        his grasp, and but a child during the progress of our long protracted
                        struggle, yet, with a manliness far above his years, he resigned it all,
                        rather than tarnish his honor by swearing that he had not sympathized with
                        or countenanced the cause of the South. His noble conduct has won encomiums
                        for him from friend and foe. Senator Johnston tried to have him admitted
                        upon taking the oath to support the Constitution, but the Secretary of the
                        Navy decided the law was imperative and he must take the test-oath.
                        Representative Platt (Republican) declared that he would urge a special bill
                        for the relief of young Alexander. The New York
                        Tribune(Republican) makes it the occasion for a pointed editorial and
                        "trust that the young Virginian who is debarred from admission to the Naval
                        Academy because he declines to swear that he had no sympathy in the Southern
                        war, in which his family heartily enlisted, will not any longer be
                        proscribed. The test-oaths which boys are called upon to take before
                        admission to the national schools are a disgrace to our statute books. The
                        more oath-taking the more lying there will be, and the more children are
                        proscribed for the acts of their parents the more long-continued will be the
                        sectional bitterness. The administration of the test-oath to a boy who was
                        only twelve years old when the war closed, and who is still a minor, is an
                        absurdity which ought to secure the repeal of the statute."</p>
                    <p>The Tribune is right. This absurdity has kept the
                        most competent in the background to the great detriment of the country. If
                        it keeps Baldwin Alexander out of the Naval Academy, the Naval service, not
                        he, will be the loser. Such metal as makes up his composition will stand the
                        ordeal anywhere, and will win merited laurels in other fields.</p>

<b>Address of the Democratic and Conservative Congressmen to the People</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Prints an address by Democratic Congressmen calling on all conservative men
                    in the country to work hard to elect a Democratic majority in the upcoming
                    Congressional elections. Brought up issues of taxation, misrule, corruption,
                    etc. Also warns Southerners not to elect men who will not take the test-oath and
                    thus risk their disqualification from office.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democratic Senators and Representatives in Congress, have issued the
                        following address:</p>
                    <p>
                        To our Fellow-Citizens of the United States, Friends of
                            Constitutional, Economical and Honest Government:
                    </p>
                    <p>The undersigned beg leave to call your attention to the peculiar importance
                        of the elections which take place this year, and beg respectfully to submit
                        some suggestions for your consideration. By the State Legislatures to be
                        elected, nearly one-third of the United States Senate will be
                        chosen.--Nearly all the members of the next House of Representative are to
                        be elected next fall. Upon the coming elections there depends the question
                        whether the Democratic and Conservative element in the Senate shall be
                        increased and whether that element shall have a majority in the House of
                        Representatives, and as a consequence whether we shall have a
                        constitutional, economical and honest Government, or a continuance of the
                        revolutionary, extravagant and wasteful partisan rule; whether we shall have
                        general, uniform, just and constitutional legislation with reasonable
                        taxation and frugal expenditures, or unconstitutional, partial, unjust class
                        legislation, with oppressive and unequal taxation and wasteful expenditure.
                        That we have strong reasons to hope for a favorable result is plainly
                        apparent. Elections already held clearly show that the title of Reform has
                        set in with a power that cannot be resisted if no blunders be committed by
                        the friends of reform. If they do their duty and act wisely--if they throw
                        off all apathy and act with vigor and steadfastness--there is every reason
                        to hope their efforts will be rewarded by success. Let there be no
                        dissensions about minor matters; no time lost in the discussion of dead
                        issues; no manifestations of terror or proscriptive feeling; no sacrifice of
                        the cause to gratify personal ambition or resentment, and let the best men
                        be chosen for candidates, and we may hope to see our country redeemed from
                        misrule.</p>
                    <p>And in this connection we beg leave to say a word to our fellow-citizens of
                        the Southern States: Do not risk the loss of Senators or Representatives by
                        electing men who cannot take the test-oath, or who are under the disability
                        imposed by the fourteenth amendment, whatever may be said of the validity of
                        that amendment or of the test-oath act. You may rest assured that Senator
                        elected by the votes of members of the Legislature, who are held by the
                        Radicals to be thus disqualified, will not be permitted to take their seats,
                        and that members of the House of Representatives thus disqualified will also
                        be excluded. It is the plainest dictate of practical wisdom not to incur any
                        such risks. We hope soon to see the day when all disabilities will be
                        removed; but in the mean time do not, we entreat you, lose the opportunity
                        to strengthen the Democratic and Conservative force in Congress, and the
                        possibility--nay, probability, of obtaining a majority in the next House of
                        Representatives, by putting it into the power of our adversaries to
                        overthrow or disregard your elections.</p>
