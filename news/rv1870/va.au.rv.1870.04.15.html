<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The bane of the past of Virginia has surely not been a want of energy or
                        enterprise in her people, for they exhibited the contrary during and since
                        the war, in a very marked manner. It was rather a contentedness with doing
                        well, and an indisposition to rush into the swiftly flowing current of
                        American progress. Virginia, like a rich old mother, gave to her daughters
                        largely of her rich domain, and, satisfied that she was left with sufficient
                        to supply the wants of all still dependent upon her, was pleased to see her
                        children using every effort to make their part as rich and productive as the
                        old homestead and rejoiced that they were prosperous and prospering. She
                        felt that there was no necessity for her to use such exertions and pursue
                        the accustomed tenor of her way. The war however changed all this. It robbed
                        her largely of her accumulations and those who labored in her fields. With
                        the few left, it was necessary to work economically. She no longer has those
                        about her, whom she could afford to see waste their time in carrying water
                        from the spring, half a mile distant, and must dig a well near the house.
                        The cost of the well may be $300 or $400, yet the interest on that amount is
                        not nearly so much as the wages of a hand or hands to carry water. She can
                        not for like reason plow, plant or reap her own fields in the old way, but
                        finds it most economical to procure the most improved machinery--Although
                        the outlay is large and immediate, the increase of profit and the savings
                        are sure and continuous. She can not afford to take the slow old course of
                        the past but must row into the current and keep abreast of the progress of
                        the age. She must of necessity develope her resources, the first
                        step in which is the increase in her means of speedy and cheap
                        intercommunication.--This she understands and that the theory of the present
                        holds good in this as well as in other things. Her western daughters have
                        taught her that present expenditure in railroads and canals is a sure
                        precursor of greater prosperity in the future. That in each and every case
                        greater profits are derived thereby than the interest on the amount
                        expended. Hence, we find fresh interest awakened at all points in the State
                        on the subject of the construction or completion of railroads and canals. We
                        take it as an omen of greater prosperty and hail with pleasure
                        every new line of rapid communication proposed. From this spirit alone comes
                        the great wealth and progress of the West, and to this in the main, must
                        Virginia look for her greatest good. Especially is this the case in this,
                        our beautiful and productive Valley. Without the means of speedy
                        communication with the outside world, we have necessarily plodded on the old
                        way. Finding our inability to compete with less productive localities from
                        the cost and delay in transportation, there has been awakened a great
                        interest in the early construction of a line of railway throughout the
                        length of the Valley. The outlay will be extended through a series of years
                        but the advantages will accrue at once. Yearly, the saving in cost of
                        transportation of products, to say nothing of competing markets, will be
                        three, four, five, perhaps ten times the interest on the amount expended. In
                        truth and in fact we can not afford to do without it. Outsiders understand
                        this and are endeavoring to throw obstacles in the way of digging this big
                        well for our Valley farm, in order that we may still pay them high wages for
                        carrying water from a distant spring. Farmers, Mechanics, and others it is
                        for you to decide. Your experience in the use of improved implements even at
                        large outlay, will largely control your conclusions as to subscribing for
                        the completion of the railway line throughout the Valley. The two are
                        identical in results. The outlay in either case may be large, but the saving
                        is immense, and the percentage of the profits greatly increased. Would you
                        throw away your Reaper, Mower, Thresher and Cleaner and go back to your
                        Scythe, Cradle, and Flail? Then throw not away the advantages you are to
                        gain by the early construction of the great Valley Railroad.</p>
