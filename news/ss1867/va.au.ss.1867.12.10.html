<b>President Johnson's Message</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A full transcript of President Johnson's recent address to both houses of
					Congress, in which he argues that the most pressing danger facing the nation is
					the attempt "to Africanize the half of our country.".<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>
						Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of
							Representatives:
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>The continued disorganization of the Union, to which the President has so
						often called the attention of Congress, is yet a subject of profound and
						patriotic concern.-We may, however,, find some relief from that anxiety in
						the reelection that the painful political situation, although before untried
						by ourselves, is not new in the experience of nations. Political science,
						perhaps as highly perfected in our own time and country as in any other, has
						not yet disclosed any means by which civil wars can be absolutely prevented.
						An enlightened nation, however, with a wise and beneficent Constitution of
						free government, may diminish their frequency and mitigate their severity by
						directing all its proceedings in accordance with its fundamental law.</p>
					<p>When a civil war has been brought to a close, it is manifestly the first
						interest and duty of the State to repair the injuries which the war has
						inflicted, and to secure the benefit of the lessons it teaches as fully and
						as speedily as possible. This duty was, upon the termination of the
						rebellion, promptly accepted, both only by the Executive Department, but by
						the insurrectionary States themselves, and restoration, in the first moment
						of peace, was believed to be as easy and certain as it was indispensable.
						The expectations, however, then so reasonably and confidently entertained,
						were disappointed by legislation from which I felt constrained by my
						obligations to the Constitution, to withhold my assent.</p>
					<p>It is therefore a source of profound regret that, in complying with the
						obligation imposed upon the President by the Constitution, to give the
						Congress from time to time information of the state of the Union, I am
						unable to communicate ahy definitive adjustment satisfactory to the American
						People, of the questions which, since the close of the rebellion, have
						agitated the public mind. On the contrary, candor compels me to declare that
						at this time there is no Union as our Fathers understood the term, and as
						they meant it to be understood by us. The Union which they established can
						exist only where all the States are represented in both Houses of Congress;
						where one State is as free as another to regulate its internal concerns
						according to its own will: and where the laws of the central Government,
						strictly confined to matters of national jurisdiction, apply with equal
						force to all the people of every section. That such is not the present
						"state of the Union" is a melancholy fact; and we all must acknowledge that
						the restoration of the States to their proper legal relations with the
						Federal Government and with one another according to the terms of the
						original compact, would be the greatest temporal blessing which God, in his
						kindest providence, could bestow upon this nation. It becomes our imperative
						duty to consider whether or not it is impossible to effect this most
						desirable consummation.</p>
					<p>The Union and the Constitution are inseparable. As long as one is obeyed by
						all parties, the other will be preserved, and if one is destroyed both must
						perish together. The destruction of the Constitution will be followed by
						other and still greater calamities. It was ordained not only to form a more
						perfect union between the States, but to "establish justice, insure domestic
						tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare,
						and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." Nothing
						but implicit obedience to its requirements in all parts of the country will
						accomplish these great ends. Without that obedience, we can look forward
						only to continual outrages upon individual rights, incessant breaches of the
						public peace, national weakness, financial dishonor, the total loss of our
						prosperity, the general corruption of morals, and the final extinction of
						popular freedom. To save our country from evils so appalling as these, we
						should renew our efforts again and again.</p>
					<p>To me the process of restoration seems perfectly plain and simple. It
						consists merely in a faithful application of the Constitution and laws. The
						execution of the laws is not now obstructed or opposed by physical force.
						There is no military or other necessity, real or pretended, which can
						prevent obedience to the constitution, either North or South. All the rights
						and all the obligations of States and individuals can be protected and
						enforced by means perfectly consistent with the fundamental law. The courts
						may be everywhere open, and, if open, their process would be unimpeded.
						Crimes against the United States can be prevented or punished by the proper
						judicial authorities, in a manner entirely practicable and legal. There is,
						therefore, no reason why the Constitution should not be obeyed, unless those
						who exercise its powers have determined that it shall be disregarded and
						violated. The mere naked will of this Government, or of some one or more of
						its branches, is the only obstacle that can exist to a perfect union of all
						the States.</p>
					<p>On this momentous question, and some of the measures growing out of it, I
						have had the misfortune to differ from Congress, and have expressed my
						convictions without reserve, though with becoming deference to the opinion
						of the Legislative Department. Those convictions are not only unchanged, but
						strengthened by subsequent events and further reflection. The transcendent
						importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse for calling your
						attention to some of the reasons which have so strongly influenced my own
						judgment. The hope that we may all finally concur in a mode of settlement,
						consistent at once with our true interests and with our sworn duties to the
						Constitution, is too natural and too just to be easily relinquished.</p>
					<p>It is clear to my apprehension that the States lately in rebellion are still
						members of the National Union. When did they cease to be so? The "ordinances
						of secession," adopted by a portion (in most of them a very small portion)
						of their citizens, were mere nullities. If we admit now that they were valid
						and effectual for the purpose intended by their authors, we sweep from under
						our feet the whole ground upon which we justified the war. Were those States
						afterwards expelled from the Union by the war? The direct contrary was
						averred by this Government to be its purpose, and was so understood by all
						those who gave their blood and treasure to aid in its prosecution. It cannot
						be that a successful war, waged for the preservation of the Union, had the
						legal effect of dissolving it. The victory of the nation's arms was
						[UNCLEAR] the disgrace of her policy; the defeat of secession on the
						battlefield was not the triumph of its lawless principle. Nor could
						Congress, with or without the consent of the Executive, do anything which
						would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of separating the States from
						each other. To dissolve the Union is to repeal the Constitution which holds
						it together, and that is a power which does not belong to any Department of
						this Government, or to all of them united.</p>
					<p>This is so plain that it has been acknowledged by all branches of the Federal
						Government. The Executive (my predecessor as well as myself) and the heads
						of all the Departments have uniformly acted upon the principle that the
						Union is not only undissolved, but indissoluble. Congress submitted an
						amendment of the Constitution to be ratified by the Southern States, and
						accepted their acts of ratification as a necessary and lawful exercise of
						their highest function. If they were not not States, or were States out of
						the Union, their consent to a change in the fundamental law of the Union
						would have been nugatory, and Congress, in askidg it, committed a political
						absurdity. The Judiciary has also given the solemn sanction of its authority
						to the same view of the case. The Judges of the Supreme Court have included
						the Southern States in their circuits, and they are constantly in bane and elsewhere, exercising jurisdiction
						which does not belong to them, unless those States are States of the Union. </p>
					<p>If the Southern States are component parts of the Union, the Constitution is
						the supreme law for them, as it is for all the other States. They are bound
						to obey it, and so are we The right of the Federal Government, which is
						clear and unquestionable, to enforce the Constitution upon them, implies the
						correlative obligation on our part to observe its limitations and execute
						its guaranties. Without the Constitution we are nothing; by, through, and
						under the Constitution we are what it makes us. We may doubt the wisdom of
						the law, we may not approve of its provisions, but we cannot violate it
						merely because it seems to confine our powers within limits narrower than we
						could wish. It is not a question of individual, or class, or sectional
						interest, much less a party predominance, but of duty-of high and sacred
						duty-which we are all sworn to perform. If we cannot support the
						Constitution with the cheerful alacrity of those who love and believe in it,
						we must give to it at least the fidelity of public servants who act under
						solemn obligations and commands which they dare not disregard.</p>
					<p>The constitutional duty is not the only one which requires the States to be
						restored. There is another consideration which, though of minor importance,
						is yet of great weight.</p>
					<p>On the 22d day of July, 1861, Congress declared, by an almost unanimous vote
						of both Houses, that the war should be conducted solely for the purpose of
						preserving the Union, and maintaining the supremacy of the Federal
						Constitution and laws, without impairing the dignity, equality, and rights
						of the States or of individuals, and that when this was done the war should
						cease. I do not say that this declaration is personally binding on those who
						joined in making it, any more than individual members of Congress are
						personally bound to pay a public debt created under a law for which they
						voted. But it was a solemn, public, official pledge of the national honor,
						and I cannot imagine upon what grounds the repudiation of it is to be
						justified. If it be said that we are not bound to keep faith with rebels,
						let it be remembered that this promise was not made to rebels
						only.-Thousands of true men in the South were drawn to our standard by it,
						and hundreds of thousands in the North gave their lives in the belief that
						it would be carried out. It was made on the day after the first great battle
						of the war had been fought and lost. All patriotic and intelligent men then
						saw the necessity of giving such an assurance and believed that without it
						the war would end in disaster to our cause. Having given that assurance in
						the extremity of our peril, the violation of it now, in the day of our
						power, would be a rude rending of that good faith which holds the moral
						world together; our country would cease to have any claim upon the
						confidence of men;--it would make the war not only a failure, but a fraud.</p>
					<p>Being sincerely convinced that these views are correct, I would be unfaithful
						to my duty if I did not recommend the repeal of the acts of Congress which
						place ten of the Southern States under the domination of military masters.
						If calm reflection shall satisfy a majority of your honorable bodies that
						the acts referred to are not only a violation of the national faith, but in
						direct conflict with the Constitution, I dare not permit myself to doubt
						that you will immediately strike them from the statute book.</p>
					<p>To demonstrate the unconstitutional character of those acts, I need do no
						more than refer to their general provisions. It must be seen at once that
						they are not authorized. To dictate what alteration shall be made in the
						Constitutions of the several States; to control the elections of State
						legislators and State officers, members of Congress and electors of
						President and Vice-President, by arbitrarily declaring who shall vote and
						who shall be excluded from that privilege; to dissolve State legislatures or
						prevent them from assembling; to dismiss judges and other civil
						functionaries of the State, and appoint others without regard to State law;
						to organize and operate all the political machinery of the States; to
						regulate the whole administration of their domestic and local affairs
						according to the mere will of strange and irresponsible agents, sent among
						them for that purpose-these are powers not granted to the Federal Government
						or to any one of its branches. Not being granted, we violate our trust by
						assuming them as palpably as we would by acting in the face of a positive
						interdict; for the Constitution forbids us to do whatever it does not
						affirmatively authorize either by express words or by clear implication. If
						the authority we desire to use does not come to us through the Constitution,
						we can exercise it only by usurpation; and usurpation is the most dangerous
						of political crimes. By that crime the enemies of freegoverment in all ages
						have worked out their designs against public liberty and private right. It
						leads directly and immediately to the establishment of absolute rule; for
						undefeated power is always unlimited and unrestrained.</p>
					<p>The acts of Congress in question are not only objectionable for their
						assumption of ungranted power, but many of their provisions are in conflict
						with the direct prohibitions of the Constitution. The Constitution commands
						that a republican form of government shall be guaranteed to all the States;
						that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due
						process of law, arrested without a judicial warrant, or punished without a
						fair trial before an impartial jury; that the privilege of habeas corpus shall not be denied in time of peace;
						and that no bill of attainder shall be passed even against a single
						individual. Yet the system of measures established by these acts of congress
						does totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the substance of
						republican government in the ten States to which they apply. It binds them
						hand and foot in absolute slavery, and subjects them to a strange and
						hostile power, more unlimited and more likely to be abused than any other
						known among civilized men. It tramples down all those rights in which the
						essence of liberty consists, and which a free government is always most
						careful to protect. It denies the habeas corpus
						and the trial by jury. Personal freedom, property, and life, if assailed by
						the passion, the prejudice, or the rapacity of the ruler, have no security
						whatever. It has the effect of a bill of attainder, or bill of pains and
						penalties, not upon a few individuals, but upon whole masses, including the
						millions who inhabit the subject States and even their unborn children.
						These wrongs, being expressly forbidden, cannot be constitutionally
						inflicted upon any portion of our people, no matter how they may have come
						within our jurisdiction, and no matter whether they live in States,
						Territories, or districts. </p>
					<p>I have no desire to save from the proper and just consequences of their great
						crime those who engaged in rebellion against the Government; but as a mode
						of punishment the measures under consideration are the most unreasonable
						that could be invented. Many of those people are perfectly innocent; many
						kept their fidelity to the Union untainted to the last; many were incapable
						of any legal offence; a large proportion even of the persons able to bear
						arms were forced into rebellion against their will; and of those who are
						guilty with their own consent the degrees of guilt are as various as the
						shades of their character and temper. But these acts of Congress confound
						them all together in one common doom. Indiscriminate vengeance upon classes,
						sects, and parties, or upon whole communities, for offences committed by a
						portion of them against the governments to which they owed obedience, was
						common in the barbarous ages of the world. But Christianity and civilization
						have made such progress that recourse to a punishment so cruel and unjust
						would meet with the condemnation of all unprejudiced and right-minded men.
						The punitive justice of this age, and especially of this country, does not
						consist in stripping whole States of their liberties, and reducing all their
						people, without distinction, to the condition of slavery. It deals
						separately with each individual, confines itself to the forms of law, and
						vindicates its own purity by an impartial examination of every case before a
						competent judicial tribunal. If this does not satisfy all our desires with
						regard to Southern rebels, let us console ourselves by reflecting that a
						free Constitution, triumphant in war and unbroken in peace, is worth far
						more to us and our children than the gratification of any present feeling.</p>
					<p>I am aware it is assumed that this system of government for the Southern
						States is not to be perpetual. It is true this military government is to be
						only provisional, but it is through this temporary evil that a greater evil
						is to be made perpetual. If the guarantees of the Constitution can be broken
						provisionally to serve a temporary purpose, and in part only of the country,
						we can destroy them everywhere and for all time. Arbitrary measures often
						change, but they generally change for the worse. It is the curse of
						despotism that it has no halting place. The intermitted exercise of its
						power brings no sense of security to its subjects; for they can never know
						what more they will be called to endure when its red right hand is armed to
						plague them again. Nor is it possible to conjecture how or where power,
						unrestrained by law, may seek its next victims. The States that are still
						free may be enslaved at any moment; for if the Constitution does not protect
						all, it protects none.</p>
					<p>It is manifestly and avowedly the object of these laws to confer upon negroes
						the privilege of voting, and to disfranchise such a number of white citizens
						as will give the former a clear majority at all elections in the Southern
						States. This, to the minds of some persons, is so important, that a
						violation of the Constitution is justified as a means of bringing it about.
						The morality is always false which excuses a wrong because it proposes to
						accomplish a desirable end. We are not permitted to do evil that good may
						come. But in this case the end itself is evil, as well as the means. The
						subjugation of the States to negro domination would be worse than the
						military despotism under such they are now suffering. It was believed
						beforehand that the people would endure any amount of military oppression,
						for any length of time, rather than degrade themselves by subjection to the
						negro race. Therefore they have been left without a choice. Negro suffrage
						was established by act of Congress, and the military officers were commanded
						to superintend the process of clothing the negro race with the political
						privileges torn from white men.</p>
					<p>The blacks in the South are entitled to be well and humanely governed, and to
						have the protection of just laws for their rights of person and property. If
						it were practicable at this time to give them a government exclusively their
						own, under which they might manage their own affairs in their own way, it
						would become a grave question whether we ought to do so, or whether common
						humanity would not require us to save them from themselves. But, under the
						circumstances this is only a speculative point. It is not proposed merely
						that they shall govern themselves, but that they shall rule the white race,
						make and administer State laws, elect Presidents and members of Congress,
						and shape to a greater or less extent the future destiny of the whole
						country. Would such a trust and power be safe in such hands?</p>
					<p>The peculiar qualities which should characterize any people who are fit to
						decide upon the management of public affairs for a great State have seldom
						been combined. It is the glory of white men to know that they have had those
						qualities in sufficient measure to build upon this continent a great
						political fabric, and to preserve its stability for more than ninety years,
						while in every other part of the world all similar experiments have failed.
						But if anything can be proved by known facts-if all reasoning upon evidence
						is not abandoned, it must be acknowledged that in the progress of nations
						negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of
						people. No independent government of any form has ever been successful in
						their hands. On the contrary, wherever they have been left to their own
						devices, they have shown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism. In
						the southern States, however, Congress has undertaken to confer upon them
						the privilege of the ballot. Just releases from slavery, it may be doubted
						whether, as a class, they know more than their ancestors how to organize and
						regulate civil society. Indeed, it is admitted that the blacks of the South
						are not only regardless of the rights of property, but so utterly ignorant
						of public affairs that their voting can consist in nothing more than
						carrying a ballot to the place where they are directed to deposit it. I need
						not remind you that the exercise of the elective franchise is the highest
						attribute of an American citizen, and that, when guided by virtue,
						intelligence, patriotism, and a proper appreciation of our free
						institutions, it constitutes the true basis of a democratic form of
						government, in which the sovereign power is lodged in the body of the
						people. A trust artificially created, not for its own sake, but solely as a
						means of promoting the general welfare, its influence for good must
						necessarily depend upon the elevated character and true allegiance of the
						elector. It ought therefore to be reposed in none except those who are
						fitted morally and mentally to administer it well; for if conferred upon
						persons who do not justly estimate its vlaue and who are indifferent as to
						its results it will only serve as a means of placing power in the hands of
						the unprincipled and ambitious, and must eventuate in the complete
						destruction of that liberty of which it should be the most powerful
						conservator. I have therefore heretofore urged upon your attention the great
						danger "to be apprehended from an untimely extension of the elective
						franchise to any new class in our country, especially when the large
						majority of that class, in wielding the power thus placed in their hands,
						cannot be expected correctly to comprehend the duties and responsibilities
						which pertain to suffrage. Yesterday, as it were, four millions of persons
						were held in a condition of slavery that had existed for generations; to-day
						they are freemen, and are assumed by law to be citizens. It cannot be
						presumed, from their previous condition of servitude, that, as a class, they
						are as well informed as to the nature of our Government as the intelligent
						foreigner who makes our land the home of his choice. In the case of the
						latter, neither a residence of five years, and the knowledge of our
						institutions which it gives, nor attachment to the principles of the
						Constitution are the only conditions upon which he can be admitted to
						citizenship. He must prove, in addition, a good moral character, and thus
						give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to the
						obligations which he assumes as a citizen of the Republic. Where a
						people-the source of all political power-speak, by their suffrages, through
						the instrumentality of the ballot-box, it must be carefully guarded against
						the control of those who are corrupt in principle and enemies of free
						institutions, for it can only become to our political and social system a
						save conductor of healthy popular sentiment when kept free from demoralizing
						influence. Controlled, through fraud and usurpation, by the designing,
						anarchy and despotism must inevitably follow. In the hands of the patriotic
						and worthy, our Government will be preserved upon the principles of the
						Constitution inherited from our fathers. It follows, therefore, that in
						admitting to the ballot-box a new class of voters not qualified for the
						exercise of the elective franchise, we weaken our system of government,
						instead of adding to its strength and durability."-"I yield to no one in
						attachment to that rule of general suffrage which distinguishes our policy
						as a nation. But there is a limit, wisely observed hitherto, which makes the
						ballot a privilege and a trust, and which requires some classes a time
						suitable for probation and preparation. To give it an indiscriminately to a
						new class, wholly unprepared, by previous habits and opportunities, to
						perform the trust which it demands, is to degrade it, and finally to destroy
						its power; for it may be safely assumed that no political truth is better
						established than that such indiscriminate and all-embracing extension of
						popular suffrage must end at last in its overthrow and destruction.</p>
					<p>I repeat the expression of my willingness to join in any plan within the
						scope of our constitutional authority which promises to better the condition
						of the negroes of the South, by encouraging them in industry, enlightening
						their minds, improving their morals, and giving protection to all their just
						rights as freedmen. But the transfer of our political inheritance to them
						would, in my opinion, be an abandonment of a duty which we owe alike to the
						memory of our fathers and the rights of our children.</p>
					<p>The plan of putting the Southern States wholly, and the General Government
						partially, into the hands of negroes, is proposed at a time peculiarly
						unpropitious. The foundations of society have been broken up by civil war.
						Industry must be reorganized and justice re-established, public credit
						maintained, and order brought out of confusion. To accomplish these ends
						would require all the wisdom and virtue of the great men who formed our
						institutions originally. I confidently believe that their descendants will
						be equal to the arduous task before them, but it is worse than madness to
						expect that negroes will perform it for us. Certainly we ought not to ask
						their assistance until we despair of our competency.</p>
					<p>The great difference between the two races in physical, mental, and moral
						characteristics will prevent an amalgamation or fusion of them together in
						one homogeneous mass. If the inferior obtains the ascendancy over the other,
						it will govern with reference, only to its own interests-for it will
						recognize no common interest-and create such a tyranny as this continent has
						never witnessed.-Already the negroes are influenced by promises of
						confiscation and plunder. They are taught to regard as an enemy every white
						man who has any respect for the rights of his own race. If this continues,
						it must become worse and worse, until all order will be subverted, all
						industry cease, and the fertile fields of the South grow up into a
						wilderness. Of all the dangers which our nation has yet encountered, non are
						equal to those which must result from the success of the effort now making
						to Africanize the half of the country.</p>
					<p>I would not put considerations of money in competition with justice and
						right. But the expenses incident to "reconstruction" under the system
						adopted by Congress aggravate what I regard as the intrinsic wrong of the
						measure itself. It has cost uncounted millions already, and if persisted in
						will add largely to the weight of taxation, already too oppressive to be
						borne without just complaint, and may finally reduce the Treasury of the
						nation to a condition of bankruptcy. We must not delude ourselves. It will
						require a strong standing army, and probably more than two hundred millions
						of dollars per annum, to maintain the supremacy of negro governments after
						they are established. The sum thus thrown away would, if properly used, form
						a sinking fund large enough to pay the whole national debt in less than
						fifteen years. It is vain to hope that negroes will maintain their
						ascendancy themselves. Without military power they are wholly incapable of
						holding in subjection the white people of the South.</p>
					<p>I submit to the judgment of Congress whether the public credit may not be
						injuriously affected by a system of measures like this.-With our debt, and
						the vast private interests which are complicated with it, we cannot be too
						cautious of a policy which might, by possibility, impair the confidence of
						the world in our Government. That confidence can only be retained by
						carefully inculcating the principles of justice and honor on the popular
						mind, and by the most scrupulous fidelity to all our engagements of every
						sort. Any serious breach of the organic law, persisted in for a considerable
						time, cannot but create fears for the stability of our institutions.
						Habitual violation of prescribed rules, which we bind ourselves to observe,
						must demoralize the people. Our only standard of civil duty being set at
						naught, the sheet-anchor of our political morality is lost, the public
						conscience swings from its moorings, and yields to every impulse of passion
						and interest. If we repudiate the Constitution, we will not be expected to
						care much for mere pecuniary obligations. The violation of such a pledge as
						we made on the 22 day of July, 1861, will assuredly diminish the market
						value of our other promises. Besides, if we now acknowledge that the
						national debt was created, not to hold the States in the Union, as the
						tax-payers were led to suppose, but to expel them from it and hand them over
						to be governed by negroes, the moral duty to pay it may seem much less
						clear. I say it may seem so; for I do not admit
						that this or any other argument in favor of repudiation can be contained as
						sound; but its influence on some classes of minds may well be apprehended.
						The financial honor of a great commercial nation, largely indebted, and with
						a republican form of government administered by agents of the popular
						choice, is a think of such delicate texture, and the destruction of it would
						be followed by such unspeakable calamity, that every true patriot must
						desire to avoid whatever might expose it to the slightest danger. </p>
					<p>The great interests of the country require immediate relief from these
						enactments. Business in the South is paralyzed by a sense of general
						insecurity, by the terror of confiscation, and the dread of negro supremacy.
						The Southern trade, from which the North would have derived so great a
						profit under a government of law, still languishes, and can never be revived
						until it ceases to be fettered by the arbitrary power which makes all its
						operations unsafe. That rich country-the richest in natural resources the
						world ever saw-is worse than lost if it be not soon placed under the
						protection of a free Constitution. Instead of being, as it ought to be, a
						source of wealth and power, it will become an intolerable burden upon the
						rest of the nation.</p>
					<p>Another reason for retracing our steps will doubtless be seen by Congress in
						the late manifestations of public opinion upon this subject. We live in a
						country where the popular will always enforces obedience to itself, sooner
						or later, It is vain to think of opposing it with anything short of legal
						authority, backed by overwhelming force.-It cannot have escaped your
						attention that from the day on which Congress fairly and formally presented
						the proposition to govern the Southern States by military force, with a view
						to the ultimate establishment of negro supremacy, every expression of the
						general sentiment has been more or less adverse to it. The affections of
						this generation cannot be detached from the institutions of their ancestors.
						Their determination to preserve the inheritance of free government in their
						own hands, and transmit it undivided and unimpaired to their own posterity,
						is too strong to be successfully opposed. Every weaker passion will
						disappear before that love of liberty and law for which the American People
						are distinguished above all others in the world.</p>
					<p>How far the duty of the President, "to preserve, protect, and defend the
						Constitution," requires him to go in opposing an unconstitutional act of
						Congress, is a very serious and important question, on which I have
						deliberated much, and felt extremely anxious to reach a proper
						conclusion.-Where an act has been passed according to the forms of the
						Constitution by the supreme legislative authority, and is regularly enrolled
						among the public statutes of the country. Executive resistance to it,
						especially in times of high party excitement, would be likely to produce
						violent collision between the respective adherents of the two branches of
						the Government. This would be simply civil war; and civil war must be
						resorted to only as the last remedy for the worst of evils. Whatever might
						tend to provoke it should be most carefully avoided. A faithful and
						conscientious Magistrate will concede very much to honest error, and
						something even to perverse malice, before he will endanger the public peace;
						and he will not adopt forcible measures, or such as might lead to force as
						long as those which are peaceable remain open to him or to his constituents.
						It is true that cases may occur in which the Executive would be compelled to
						stand on its rights, and maintain them, regardless of all consequences. If
						Congress should pass an act which is not only palpable conflict with the
						Constitution, but will certainly, if carried out, prejudice immediate and
						irreparable injury to the organic structure of the Government, and if there
						be neither judicial remedy for the wrongs it inflicts, nor power in the
						people to protect themselves without the official aid of their elected
						defender; if, for instance, the Legislative Department should pass an act
						even through all the forms of law to abolish a co-ordinate department of the
						Government-in such a case the President must take the high responsibilities
						of his office, and save the life of the nation at all hazards. The so-called
						reconstruction acts, though as plainly unconstitutional as any that can be
						imagined, were not believed to be within the class last mentioned. The
						people were not wholly disarmed of the power of self-defence. In all the
						Northern States they still held in their hands the sacred right of the
						ballot, and it was safe to believe that in due time they would come to the
						rescue of their own institutions. It gives me pleasure to add that the
						appeal to our common constituents was not taken in vain, and that my
						confidence in their wisdom and virtue seems not to have been misplaced.</p>
					<p>It is well and publicly known that enormous frauds have been perpetrated on
						the Treasury, and that colossal fortunes have been made at the public
						expense. This species of corruption has increased, is increasing, and if not
						diminished will soon bring us into total ruin and disgrace. The public
						creditors and the tax-payers are alike interested in an honest
						administration of the finances, and neither class will long endure the
						large-handed robberies of the recent past.-For this discreditable state of
						things there are several causes. Some of the taxes are so laid as to present
						an irresistible temptation to evade payment. The great sums which officers
						may win by connivance at fraud create a pressure which is more than the
						virtue of many can withstand; and there can be no doubt that the open
						disregard of constitutional obligations avowed by some of the highest and
						most influential men in the country has greatly weakened the moral sense of
						those who serve in subordinate places.-The expenses of the United States,
						including interest on the public debt, are more than six times as much as
						they were seven years ago. To collect and disburse this vast amount requires
						careful supervision as well as systematic vigilance.-The system, never
						perfected, was much disorganized by the "Tenure of Office Bill," which has
						almost destroyed official accountability. The President may be thoroughly
						convinced that an officer is incapable, dishonest, or unfaithful to the
						Constitution, but, under the law which I have named, the utmost he can do is
						to complain to the Senate, and ask the privilege of supplying his place with
						a better man. If the Senate be regarded as personally or politically hostile
						to the President, it is natural, and not altogether unreasonable, for the
						officer to expect that it will take his part as far as possible, restore him
						to his place, and give him a triumph over his Executive superior. The
						officer has other chances of impunity arising from accidental defects of
						evidence, the mode of investigating it, and the secrecy of the hearing. It
						is not wonderful that official malfeasance should become bold in proportion
						as the delinquents learn to think themselves safe. I am entirely persuaded
						that under such a rule the President cannot perform the great duty assigned
						to him of seeing the laws faithfully executed, and that it disables him most
						especially from enforcing that rigid accountability which is necessary to
						the due execution of the revenue laws.</p>
					<p>The Constitution invests the President with the authority to decide whether a removal should be made in any
						given case, the act of Congress declares, in substance, that he shall only
							accuse such as he supposes to be unworthy of
						their trust. The Constitution makes him sole judge in the premises; but the statute takes away his jurisdiction,
						transfers it to the Senate, and leaves him nothing but the odious and
						sometimes impracticable duty of becoming a prosecutor. The prosecution is to be conducted before a tribunal
						whose members are not, like him, responsible to the whole people, but to
						separate constituent bodies, and who may hear his accusation with great
						disfavor. The Senate is absolutely without any known standard of decision
						applicable to such a case. Its judgment cannot be anticipated, for it is not
						governed by any rule. The law does not define what shall be deemed good
						cause for removal. It is impossible even to conjecture what may or may not
						be so considered by the Senate. The nature of the subject forbids clear
						proof. If the charge be incapacity, what evidence will support it? Fidelity
						to the Constitution may be understood or misunderstood in a thousand
						different ways, and by violent party men, in violent party times,
						unfaithfulness to the Constitution may even come to be considered
						meritorious. If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made
						out? Will it be inferred from acts unconnected with public duty, from
						private history, or from general reputation? Or must the president await the
						commission of an actual misdemeanor in office? Shall he, in the meantime,
						risk the character and interest of the Nation in the hands of men to whom he
						cannot give his confidence? Must he forbear his complaint until the mischief
						is done and cannot be prevented?-If his zeal in the public service should
						impel him to anticipate the overt act, must he move at the peril of being
						tried himself for the offence of slandering his subordinate? In the present
						circumstances of the country, some one must be held responsible for official
						delinquency of every kind. It is extremely difficult to say where that
						responsibility should be thrown, if it be not left where it has been placed
						by the Constitution.-But all just men will admit that the President ought to
						be entirely relieved from such responsibility, if he cannot meet it by
						reason of restrictions placed by law upon his action. </p>
					<p>The unrestricted power of removal from office is a very great one to be
						trusted even to a Magistrate chosen by the general suffrage of the whole
						people, and accountable directly to them for his acts. It is undoubtedly
						liable to abuse, and at some periods of our history perhaps has been abused.
						If it be thought desirable and constitutional that it should be so limited
						as to make the President merely a common informer against other public
						agents, he should at least be permitted to act in that capacity before some
						open tribunal, independent of party politics, ready to investigate the merit
						of every case; furnished with the means of taking evidence, and bound to
						decide according to established rules. This would guarantee the safety of
						the accuser when he acts in good faith, and at the same time secure the
						rights of the other party. I speak of course with all proper respect for the
						present Senate, but it does not seem to me that any legislative body can be
						so constituted as to insure its fitness for these functions.</p>
					<p>It is not the theory of this Government that public offices are the property
						of those who hold them. They are given merely as a trust for the public
						benefit, sometimes for a fixed period, sometimes during good behavior, but
						generally they are liable to be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing
						power, which represents the collective majesty and speaks the will of the
						people. The forced retention in office of a single dishonest person may work
						great injury to the public interests. The danger to the public service comes
						not from the power to remove, but from the power to appoint. Therefore it
						was that the framers of the Constitution left the power of removal
						unrestricted, while they gave the Senate a right to reject all appointments
						which, in its opinion, were not fit to be made. A little reflection on this
						subject will probably satisfy all who have the good of the country at heart
						that our best course is to take the Constitution for our guide, walk in the
						path marked out by the founders of the Republic, and obey the rules made
						sacred by the observance of our great predecessors.</p>
					<p>The present condition of our finances and circulating medium is one to which
						your early consideration is invited.</p>
					<p>The proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole
						value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question upon which
						political economists have not agreed. Nor can it be controlled by
						legislation, but must be left to the irrevocable laws which everywhere
						regulate commerce and trade. The circulating medium will ever irresistibly
						flow to those points where it is in greatest demand. The law of demand and
						supply is as unerring as that which regulates the tides of the ocean; and
						indeed currency, like the tides, has its ebbs and flows throughout the
						commercial world.</p>
					<p>At the beginning of the rebellion the banknote circulation of the country
						amounted to not much more than two hundred millions of dollars now the
						circulation of National Bank notes and those known as "legal tenders" is
						nearly seven hundred millions. While it is urged by some that this amount
						should be increased, others contend that a decided reduction is absolutely
						essential to the best interests of the country. In view of these diverse
						opinions, it may be well to ascertain the real value of our paper issues,
						when compared with metallic or convertible currency. For this purpose, let
						us inquire how much gold and silver could be purchased by the seven hundred
						millions of paper money now in circulation? Probably not more than half the
						amount of the latter-showing that when our paper currency is compared with
						gold and silver, its commercial value is compressed into three hundred and
						fifty millions. This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the
						Government, as early as may be consistent with the principle of sound
						political economy, to take such measures as will enable the holder of its
						notes and those of the National Banks to convert them, without loss, into
						specie or its equivalent. A reduction of our paper circulating medium need
						not necessarily follow. This, however, would depend upon the law of demand
						and supply, though it should be borne in mind that by making legal-tender
						and bank notes convertible into coin or its equivalent, their present specie
						value in the hands of their holders would be enhanced one hundred per cent.</p>
					<p>Legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded by
						the highest public considerations. The Constitution comtemplates that the
						circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value. At
						the time of the formation of that instrument, the country had just emerged
						from the War of the Revolution, and was suffering from the effects of a
						redundant and worthless paper currency. The sages of that period were
						anxious to protect their posterity from the evils which they themselves had
						experienced. Hence, in providing a circulating medium, they conferred upon
						Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, at the same
						time prohibiting the States from making anything but gold and silver a
						tender in payment of debts.</p>
					<p>The anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with that
						which was originally designed. Our circulation now embraces, first, notes of
						the National Banks, which are made receivable for all dues to the
						Government, excluding imposts, and by all its creditors, excepting in
						payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves; second,
						legal-tender notes, issued by the United States, and which the law requires
						shall be received as well in payment of all debts between citizens as of all
						Government dues, excepting imposts; and, third, gold and silver coin. By the
						operation of our present system of finance, however, the metallic currency,
						when collected, is reserved only for one class of Government creditors, who,
						holding its bonds, semi-annually receive their interest in coin from the
						National Treasury. They are thus made to occupy an invidious position, which
						may be used to strengthen the arguments of those who would bring into
						disrepute the obligations of the nation. In the payment of all its debts,
						the plighted faith of the Government should be inviolably maintained. But
						while it acts with fidelity toward the bondholder who loaned his money that
						the integrity of the Union might be preserved, it should at the same time
						observe good faith with the great masses of the people, who, having rescued
						the Union from the perils of rebellion, now bear the burdens of taxation,
						that the Government may be able to fulfill its engagements. There is no
						reason which will be accepted as satisfactory by the people, why those who
						defend us on the land and protect us on the sea; the pensioner upon the
						gratitude of the nation, bearing the scars and wounds received while in its
						service; the public servants in the various Departments of the Government;
						the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the army and the sailors of the
						navy; the artisan who toils in the nation's worshops, or the mechanics and
						laborers who build its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of
						war-should, in payment of their just and hard-earned dues, receive
						depreciated paper, while another class of their countrymen, no more
						deserving, are paid in coin of gold and silver. Equal and exact justice
						requires that all the creditors of the Government should be paid a currency
						possessing a uniform value. This can only be accomplished by the restoration
						of the currency to the standard established by the Constitution: and by this
						means we would remove a discrimination which may, if it has not already done
						so, create a prejudice that may become deep-rooted and wide-spread, and
						imperil the national credit.</p>
					<p>The feasibility of making our currency correspond with the constitutional
						standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived from our commercial
						statistics.</p>
					<p>The production of precious metals in the United States from 1849 to 1857,
						inclusive, amounted to $579,000,000; from 1858 to 1860, inclusive, to
						$137,500,000; from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, was $457,500,000-making the
						grand aggregate of products since 1849 $1,174,000,000. The amount of specie
						coined from 1849 to 1857, inclusive was $439,000,000; from 1858 to 1860,
						inclusive, $125,000,000; and from 1861 to 1867, inclusive,
						$310,000,00-making the total coinage since 1849, $874,000,000. Form 1849 to
						1857, inclusive, the net exports of specie amounted to $271,000,000; from
						1858 to 1860, inclusive, to $148,000,00; and from 1861to1867, inclusive
						$322,000,000-making the aggregate of net exports since 1849, $741,000,000.
						These figures show an excess of product over net exports of $433,000,000.
						There are in the Treasury $111,000,000 in coin, something more than
						$40,000,000 in circulation on the Pacific Coast, and a few millions in the
						National and other Banks-in all about $160,000,000. This however, taking
						into account the specie in the country prior to1849, leaves more than three
						hundred millions of dollars which have not been accounted for by
						exportation, and therefore may yet remain in the country.</p>
					<p>These are important facts, and show how completely the inferior currency will
						supersede the better, forcing it from circulation among the masses, and
						causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade, to add to the money
						capital of foreign lands. They show the necessity of retiring our paper
						money, that the return of gold and silver to the avenues of trade may be
						invited and a demand created which will cause the retention at home of at
						least so much of the productions of our rich and inexhaustible gold-bearing
						fields as may be sufficient for purposes of circulation. It is unreasonable
						to expect a return to a sound currency so long as the Government, by
						continuing to issue irredeemable notes, fills the channels of circulation
						with depreciated paper. Notwithstanding a coinage by our mints since 1849,
						of eight hundred and seventy-four millions of dollars, the people are now
						strangers to the currency which was designed for their use and benefit, and
						specimens of the precious metals bearing the national device are seldom
						seen, except when produced to gratify the interest excited by their novelty.
						If depreciated paper is to be continued as the permanent currency of the
						country, and all our coin is to become a mere article of traffic and
						speculation, to the enhancement in price of all that is indispensable to the
						comfort of the people, it would be wise economy to abolish our mints, thus
						saving the nation the care and expense incident to such establishments, and
						let all our precious metals be exported in bullion. The time has come,
						however, when the Government and the National Banks should be required to
						take the most efficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a
						resumption of specie payments at the earliest practicable period. Specie
						payments having been once resumed by the Government and banks, all notes or
						bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination than twenty dollars
						should by law be excluded from circulation, so that the people may have the
						benefit and convenience of a god and silver currency which in all their
						business transactions will be uniform in value at home and abroad.</p>
					<p>"Every man of property or industry, every man who desires to preserve what he
						honestly possesses, or to obtain what he can honestly earn, has a direct
						interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium-such a medium as shall be
						real and substantial, not liable to vibrate with [UNCLEAR], not subject to
						be blown down by the [UNCLEAR] of speculation, but to be made stable
						[UNCLEAR] A disordered currency is one of the [UNCLEAR] evils. It undermines
						the [UNCLEAR] necessary for the support of the social system, and encourages
						propensities destructive of his happiness; it wars against industry,
						frugality, and economy, and it fosters the evil spirits of extravagance and
						speculation." It has been asserted by one of our profound and most gifted
						statesmen, that "of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes
						of mankind, none has been more effective than that which deludes them with
						paper money.-That is the most effectual invention [UNCLEAR] the rich man's
						fields, by the sweat of the poor man's brow. Ordinary tyranny, oppression,
						excessive taxation-these bear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the
						community compared with a fraudulent currency, and the robberies committed
						by depreciated paper. Our own history has recorded for our instruction
						enough, and more than enough of the demoralizing tendency, the injustice,
						and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous and will-disposed of a
						degraded paper currency, authorized by law or in any way countenanced by
						Government." It is one of the most successful devices, in times of peace or
						war, expansions or revulsions, to accomplish the transfer of all the
						precious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the few,
						where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited in strong boxes under
						bolts and bars, while the people are left to endure all the inconvenience,
						sacrifice, and demoralization resulting from the use of a depreciated and
						worthless paper money. The condition of our finances and the operations of
						our revenue system are set forth and fully explained in the able and
						instructive report of the Secretary of the Treasury. On the 30th of June,
						1866, the public debt amounted to $2,783,425,879; on the 30th of June last
						it was $2,692,199,215, showing a reduction during the fiscal year of
						$91,226,664. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, the receipts were
						$490,634,010 and the expenditures $346,729,129, leaving and available
						surplus of $143,904,880. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal
						year ending June 30, 1868, will be $417,161,928, and that the expenditures
						will reach the sum $393,269,226, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of
						$23,892,702. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, it is estimated that
						the receipts will amount to $381,000,000, and that the expenditures will be
						$372,000,000, showing an excess of $9,000,000 in favor of the Government.</p>
					<p>The attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the necessity of a thorough
						revision of our system. Our internal revenue laws and impost system should
						be so adjusted as to bear most heavily on articles of luxury, leaving the
						necessaries of life as free from taxation as may be consistent with the real
						wants of the Government economically administered. Taxation would not then
						fall unduly on the man of moderate means; and while none would entirely
						exempt from assessment, all, in proportion to their pecuniary abilities,
						would contribute towards the support of the State. A modification of the
						internal revenue system, by a large reduction in the number of articles now
						subject to tax, would be followed by results equally advantageous to the
						citizen and the Government. It would render the execution of the law less
						expensive and more certain, remove obstructions to industry, lessen the
						temptations to evade the law, diminish the violations and frauds perpetrated
						upon it provisions, make its operations less inquisitorial, and greatly
						reduce in number the army of tax-gatherers created by the system, who "take
						from the mouth of honest labor the bread it has earned." Retrenchment,
						reform, and economy should be carried into every branch of the public
						service, that the expenditures of the Government may be reduced and the
						people relieved from oppressive taxation; a sound currency should be
						restored, and the public faith in regard to the national debt sacredly
						observed. The accomplishment of these important results, together with the
						restoration of the Union of the States upon the principles of the
						Constitution, would inspire confidence at home and abroad in the stability
						of our institutions, and bring to the nation prosperity, peace, and good
						will.</p>
					<p>The report of the Secretary of War ad interim
						exhibits the operations of the army and of the several bureaus of the War
						Department. The aggregate strength of our military force on the 30th of
						September last was 56,315. The total estimate for military appropriations is
						$77,124,704,707, including a deficiency in last year's appropriation of
						$13,600,000. The payments at the Treasury on account of the service of the
						War Department from January 1 to October 29, 1867-a period of ten
						months-amounted to $109,807,000. The expenses of the military establishment
						as well as the number of the army, are now three times as great as they have
						ever been in time of peace; while the discretionary power is vested in the
						Executive to add millions to this expenditure by an increase of the army to
						the maximum strength allowed by the law. </p>
					<p>The comprehensive report of the Secretary of the Interior furnishes
						interesting information in reference to the important branches of the public
						service connected with this department.</p>
					<p>The menacing attitude of some of the warlike bands of Indians inhabiting the
						district of country between the Arkansas and the Platte rivers and portions
						of Dakota Territory, required the presence of a large military force in that
						region. Instigated by real or imaginary grievances, the Indians occasionally
						committed acts of barbarous violence upon emigrants and our frontier
						settlements; but a general Indian war has been providentially averted. The
						commissioners under the act of the 20th July, 1867, were invested with full
						power to adjust existing difficulties, negotiate treaties with the
						disaffected bands, and select for them reservations remote from the traveled
						routes between the Mississippi and the Pacific.-They entered without delay
						upon the execution of their trust, but have not yet made any official report
						of their proceedings. It is of vital importance that our distant territories
						should be exempt from Indian outbreaks, and that the construction of the
						Pacific railroad, an object of national importance, should not be
						interrupted by hostile tribes. These objects, as well as the material
						interests and the moral and intellectual improvement of the indians, can be
						most effectually secured by concentrating them upon portions of country set
						apart for their exclusive use, and located at points remote from our
						highways and encroaching white settlements.</p>
					<p>Since the commencement of the second session of the thirty-ninth Congress,
						five hundred and ten miles of road have been constructed on the main line
						and branches of the Pacific railray.-The line from Omaha is rapidly
						approaching the eastern base of the Rocky mountains, whilst the terminus of
						the last section of constructed road in California, accepted by the
						Government on the 24th day of October last, was but eleven miles distant
						from the summit of the Sierra Nevada.-The remarkable energy evinced by the
						companies offer, the strongest assurance that the completion of the road
						from Sacramento to Omaha will not be long deferred.</p>
					<p>During the last fiscal year seven million, forty one thousand, one hundred
						and fourteen acres of public land were disposed of, and the cash receipts
						from sales and fees exceeded by one-half million dollars the sum realized
						from those sources during the preceding year. The amount paid to pensioners,
						including expenses of disbursement, was $18,619,956, and thirty-six thousand
						four hundred and eighty-two names were added to the rolls, to the rolls. The
						entire number of pensioners on the 30th of June last, was one hundred and
						fifty-five thousand, four hundred and seventy-four. Eleven thousand, six
						hundred and fifty-five patents and designs were issued during the year
						ending September 30, 1867, and at that date the balance in the Treasury to
						the credit of the Patent Fund was $286,607.</p>
					<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy states that we have seven squadrons
						actively and judiciously employed, under efficient and able commanders, in
						protecting the persons and property of American citizens, maintaining the
						dignity and power of the Government, and promoting the commerce and business
						interest of our countrymen in every part of the world. Of the two hundred
						and thirty-eight vessels composing the present navy of the United States,
						fifty-six, carrying five hundred and seven guns, are in squadron service.
						During the year the number of vessels in commission has been reduced twelve,
						and there are thirteen less on squadron duty than there were at the date of
						the last report. A large number of vessels were commenced and in the course
						of construction when the war terminated, and although Congress had made the
						necessary appropriations for their completion, the Department has either
						suspended work upon them or limited the slow completion of the steam
						vessels, so as to meet the contracts for machinery made with private
						establishments. The total expenditures of the Navy Department for the year
						ending June 30, 1867, were $31,034,011 [UNCLEAR]. No appropriations have
						been made or required since the close of the war for the construction and
						repair of vessels, for steam machinery, ordinance, provisions and clothing,
						fuel, hemp, etc., the balances under these several heads having been more
						than sufficient for current expenditures. It should also be stated to the
						credit of the Department that, besides asking no appropriations for the
						above objects for the last two years, the Secretary of the Navy, on the 30th
						of September last, in accordance with the act of May 1, 1820, requested the
						Secretary of the Treasury to carry to the surplus fund the sum of sixty-five
						millions of dollars, being the amount received from the sales of vessels and
						other war property, and the remnants of former appropriations.</p>
					<p>The report of the Postmaster-General shows the business of the Post-office
						Department and the condition of the postal service in a very favorable
						light, and the attention of Congress is called to its practical
						recommendations. The receipts of the department for the year ending June 30,
						1867, including all special appropriations for sea and land service and for
						free mail matter, were $19,978,693. The expenditures for all purposes were
						$19,285,483, leaving an unexpended balance in favor of the department of
						$743,210, which can be applied towards the expenses of the department for
						the current year.-The increase of postal revenue, independent of specific
						appropriations, for the year 1867 over that of 1866 was $850,040. The
						increase of revenue from the sale of stamps and stamped envelopes were
						$788,404 [UNCLEAR]. The increase of expenditures for 1867[UNCLEAR] those of
						the previous year was owing chiefly to the extension of the land and ocean
						mail service. During the past year new [UNCLEAR] conventions have been
						ratified and [UNCLEAR] in the United Kingdom of Great Britain, [UNCLEAR],
						Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, [UNCLEAR], North German Union, Italy,
						and [UNCLEAR] Government at Hong Kong, [UNCLEAR]largely the rates of ocean
						and land postage to and from and within those countries.</p>
					<p>The report of the acting Commissioner of Agriculture concisely presents the
						condition, wants and progress of an interest eminently worthy [INSERT of]
						the fostering care of Congress, and exhibits a large measure of useful
						results achieved during the year to which it refers.</p>
					<p>The re-establishment of peace at home, and the resumption of extended trade,
						travel, and commerce abroad, have served to increase the number and variety
						of questions in the department of foreign affairs. None of these questions
						however, have seriously disturbed our relations with other States.</p>
					<p>The Republic of Mexico, having been relieved from foreign intervention, is
						earnestly engaged in efforts to re-establish her constitutional system of
						government. A good understanding continues to exist between our Government
						and the Republics of Hayti and San Domingo, and our cordial relations with
						the Central and South American States remain unchanged. The tender, made in
						conformity with a resolution of Congress, of the good offices of the
						Government, with a view to an amicable adjustment of peace between Brazil
						and her allies on one side, and Paraguay on the other, and between Chili and
						her allies on the one side, and Spain on the other, though kindly received,
						has in neither case been fully accepted by the belligerents. The war in the
						Valley of the Panama is still vigorously maintained. On the other hand,
						actual hostilities between the pacific States and Spain have been more than
						a year suspended. I shall, on any proper occasion that may occur, renew the
						conciliatory recommendations which have been already made. Brazil, with
						enlightened sagacity and comprehensive statesmanship, has opened the great
						channels of the Amazon and its tributaries to universal commerce. One thing
						more seems needful to assure a rapid and cheering progress in South America,
						I refer to those peaceful habits without which States and nations cannot, in
						this age, well expect material prosperity or social advancement.</p>
					<p>The exposition of universal industry at Paris has passed, and seems to have
						fully realized the high expectations of the French Government.-If due
						allowance be made for the recent political derangement of industry here, the
						part which the United States has borne in this exhibition of invention and
						art may be regarded with very high satisfaction. During the exposition a
						conference was held of delegates from several nations, the United States
						being one, in which the inconveniences of commerce and social intercourse
						resulting from the divers standards of money value were very fully
						discussed, and plans were developed for establishing, by universal consent,
						a common principle for the coinage of gold. These conferences are expected
						to be renewed, with the attendance of many foreign States not hitherto
						represented. A report of these interesting proceedings will be submitted to
						Congress, which will no doubt justly appreciate the great object and be
						ready to adopt any measure which may tend to facilitate its ultimate
						accomplishment.</p>
					<p>On the 25th of February, 1862, Congress declared by law that Treasury notes,
						without interest, authorized by that act, should be legal tender in payment
						of all debts, public and private, within the United States. An annual
						remittance of $80,000, less stipulated expenses, accrues to claimants under
						the Convention made with Spain in 1834. These remittances, since the passage
						of that act, have been paid in such notes. The claimants insist that the
						Government ought to require payment in com. The subject may be deemed worthy
						of your attention.</p>
					<p>No arrangement has as yet been reached for the settlement of our claims for
						British depredations upon the commerce of the United States. I have felt it
						my duty to decline the proposition of [UNCLEAR] made by her Majesty's
						Government, because it has hitherto been accompanied by reservations and
						limitations incompatible with the rights, interest, and honor of our
						country. It is not to be apprehended that Great Britain, will persist in her
						refusal to satisfy these just and reasonable claims which involve the sacred
						principle of non-intervention-a principle henceforth not more important to
						the United States than to all other commercial nations.</p>
					<p>The West India Islands were settled and colonized by European States and
						simultaneously with the settlement and colonization of the American
						continent. Most of the colonies planted here became independent nations in
						the close of the last and the beginning of the present century. Our own
						country embraces communities which, at one period, were colonies of Great
						Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Russia. The people in West
						Indies, with the exception of those of the Island of Hayti, have neither
						attained nor aspired to independence, nor have they become prepared for
						self-defence. Although possessing considerable commercial value, they have
						been held by the several European States which colonized or at some time
						conquered them chiefly for purposes of military and naval strategy in
						carrying out European policy and designs in regard to this continent. In our
						revolutionary war ports and harbors in the West India Islands were used by
						our enemy, to the great injury and embarrassment of the United States. We
						had the same experience in our second war with Great Britain. The same
						European policy for a long time excluded us even from trade with the West
						Indies while we were at peace with all nations.-In our recent civil war the
						rebels, and their piratical and blockade-breaking allies, found facilities
						in the same ports for the work, which they, too successfully accomplished,
						of injuring and devastating the commerce which we are now engaged in
						rebuilding. We labored especially under this disadvantage-that European
						steam vessels, employed by our enemies, found friendly shelter, protection,
						and supplies in West Indian ports, while our own naval operations were
						necessarily carried on from our own distant shores. There was then a
						universal feeling of the want of an advanced naval outpost between the
						Atlantic coast and Europe. The duty of obtaining such an outpost peacefully
						and lawfully, while neither doing nor menacing injury to other States,
						earnestly engaged the attention of the Executive Department before the close
						of the war, and it has not been lost sight of since that time. A not
						entirely dissimilar naval want revealed itself during the same period on the
						Pacific coast. The required foothold there was fortunately secured by our
						late treaty with the Emperor of Russia and now it seems imperative that the
						more obvious necessities of the Atlantic coast should not be less carefully
						provided for. A good and convenient port and harbor, capable of easy defence
						will supply that want. With the possession of such a station by the United
						States, neither we nor any other American nation need longer apprehend
						injury or offence from any trans-Atlantic enemy. I agree with our early
						statesmen that the West Indies naturally gravitate to and may be expected
						ultimately to be absorbed by the Continental States, including our own. I
						agree with them also that it is wise to leave the question of such
						absorption to this process of natural political gravitation. The islands of
						St. Thomas and St. Johns, which constitute a part of the group called the
						Virgin Islands, seemed to offer us advantages immediately desirable, while
						their acquisition could be secured in harmony with the principles to which I
						have alluded. A treaty has, therefore, been concluded with the King of
						Denmark for the cession of those lands, and will be submitted to the Senate
						for consideration.</p>
					<p>It will hardly be necessary to call the attention of Congress to the subject
						of providing for the payment to Russia of the sum stipulated in the treaty
						for the cession of Alaska. Possession having been formally delivered to our
						commissioner, the territory remains for the present in care of a military
						force, awaiting such civil organization as shall be directed by Congress.</p>
					<p>The annexation of many small German States to Prussia, and the reorganization
						of that country under a new and liberal constitution, have induced me to
						renew the effort to obtain a just and prompt settlement of the long-vexed
						question concerning the claims of foreign States for military service form
						their subjects naturalized in the United States.</p>
					<p>In connection with this subject, the attention of Congress is respectfully
						called to a singular and embarrassing conflict of laws. The Executive
						Department of this Government has hitherto uniformly held, as it now holds,
						that naturalization, in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the
						United States, absolves the recipient from his native allegiance. The courts
						of Great Britain hold that allegiance to the British Crown is indefeasible,
						and is not absolved by our laws of naturalization. British judges cite
						courts and law authorities of the United States in support of that theory
						against the position held by the Executive authority of the United States.
						This conflict perplexes the public mind concerning the rights of naturalized
						citizens, and impairs the national authority abroad. I called attention to
						this subject in my last annual message, and now again respectfully appeal to
						Congress to declare the national will unmistakably upon this important
						question.</p>
					<p>The abuse of our laws by the clandestine prosecution of the African
						slave-trade from American ports or by American citizens has altogether
						ceased, and, under existing circumstances, no apprehensions of its renewal
						in this part of the world are entained. Under these circumstances it becomes
						a question whether we shall not propose to Her Majesty's Government a
						suspension or discontinuance of the stipulations for maintaining a naval
						force for the suppression of trade.</p>

						most obdurate of those plotters against the life of the nation who have made
						occasion for such a message from the Executive to the Legislative branch of

						measures of public policy, as a most unjust, unreasonable, and unchristian
						mode of punishment, involving the innocent with the guilty, as tending and

<b>Can a Radical Constitution be Defeated in Virginia</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Analyzes the numbers of registered voters, black and white, concluding that
					if whites all vote and vote as a bloc they can defeat the new Constitution.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Before the late elections the number of registered persons, white and black,
						was 221,754. Of this aggregate 116, 982 were whites, and 104,772 blacks,
						giving a white majority of 12,210. The vote cast for the Convention was
						14,835 whites and 92,507 blacks. The vote cast against the convention was
						61,249 whites and 638 blacks. Aggregate vote cast, 169,229-less 52,525
						registered votes not cast, 40,898 were whites and 11,627 blacks. Of the
						14,898 whites who voted for a Convention, it is safe to assume that not more
						than 5,000 are Radicals, who will vote for a Radical constitution, 5,000
						white Radicals added to the 104,000 registered blacks give 109,000 Radical
						aggregate. It is believed that the whole Radical strength has been
						registered. To offset this we have 111,982 white Conservatives registered,
						and from 15 to 20,000 to be registered, which would give us a Conservative
						vote against an offensive Radical constitution of-say from 125,000 to
						130,000.</p>
					<p>Is it not plain, then, that it is in our power if we all register who are
						entitled to register, and all vote who are entitled to vote, to defeat any
						constitution framed under the present reconstruction laws which shall not be
						agreeable to us?-Richmond Whig. </p>
