                    <p>The National Intelligencer thinks that the ultras at the North, have sent
                        sundry violent Radical emissaries to the South, to stir up the passions of
                        the people, and provoke riots and tumults; they hoping, that if this plan is
                        successful; it will be made a pretext for the getting up of a furious
                        crusade of public opinion in the North, the reassembling of Congress in
                        July, the impeachment and deposition of the President without delay, and the
                        passage of bills of confiscation of Southern lands, and perhaps the seizure
                        and execution of individuals. The Intelligencer, therefore, cautions the
                        Southern people to say nothing and do nothing which can give an excuse for
                        the proposed new plan of operations-"to keep their temper and maintain their
                        dignity."</p>

                    <p>The Philmathesians met on last Saturday night, with open doors, and the
                        fertile question-"Is the assassination of tyrants justifiable?" was
                        discussed before quite a crowd of ladies and gentlemen, by Messrs. Chewning
                        and Effinger in the affirmative, and Messrs. Moore and O'Ferrall in the
                        negative. The discussion was quite animated and interesting, and the young  orators displayed a high degree of moral
                        courage and considerable historical research. The vote on the question
                        stood:--affirmative,4; negative, 13. </p>
                    <p>They also elected a new corps of officers for the ensuing term of two months,

                    <p>"Radical threats of confiscation, and appeals to the negro-to bad passions
                        and violent crimes-are already forcing the people to believe that any other
                        party must be better and safer for them than the Republican party. The
                        present state of parties in Virginia is significant. Already the blacks have
                        taken an extreme position around the more violent Radical leaders-a position
                        that will render it impossible for the white voters there to join them, and
                        will, consequently, drive these white voters into the arms of any
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Botts who favors such action as will render it possible for whites and
                        blacks to act together as Union men and republicans is denounced by the
                        negroes as the enemy of republicanism. This is the legitimate result of the
                        recent radical campaigning and this will go much further. It will force all
                        men in the South who are not in favor of the policy of the extravagant few
                        to oppose the republican orators in the South to-day are building up the
                        democratic party far more efficiently than the democrats themselves could do
                        it."</p>
