				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>What we need, on the part of the members of the Conservative Convention, is
						the exercise of wisdom-the happy combination of the highest intelligence
						with prudence and discretion directed to the accomplishment of great and
						good ends. We adopt the sentiments and language of the <emph rend="italic"
							>Enquirer</emph> that "the Convention ought to be extremely prudent and
						guarded.-We want no windy declamation; we are too proud to lament over what
						is irretrievably lost, and we have no time for idle argument. The hour calls
						for action, and not for speculation: it is no use to go back to antiquity,
						and glory in the greatness of our Fathers; it is the present with which we
						have to do, and its stern realities present the situation with which we have
						to grapple. The illustrious body-for such it may become-must bear in mind
						that conservatism means not to uphold this party or that, nor to bring back
						old customs and secure special privileges, but <emph rend="italic">to
							preserve the Union under the Constitution</emph>. We have 'accepted the
						situation,' and we must frankly and honorably support it. Virginia is to
						remain for all time in the Union, and she must act as a part of the Union.
						What she wants is to resume her place among the sisterhood of States, to
						obtain her share in the government of the Republic, and above all things to
						secure permanent peace, under civil rule, to her children. Every other
						consideration must give way to this first necessity. </p>
					<p>The members of the Convention will, therefore, have to consult, not about
						what the present ought to be, but on what the future can be made. We must
						take matters as they are and make the most of them. To do this it will be
						necessary to use the utmost caution and prudence. There is nothing to be
						gained by appeals to the world, unless they are accompanied by our own
						earnest efforts-the world has no cars for those who do not help
						themselves.-Let us not rely too much upon promises made by Northern allies,
						nor to confidently indulge in expectations thus engendered. The late
						elections have been of incalculable advantage to our cause, but our duty is
						to let the North complete the work. The medicine is working admirably. We
						can do nothing better than to leave it alone.</p>
					<p>Not only the Radicals, but the whole North, will watch our Convention, and
						scrutinize its proceedings with jealous care. Every rash word, every hasty
						declaration, every ebullition of temper, will be carefully noted,
						interpreted in the most malignant spirit, and turned as a powerful weapon
						against us.</p>
					<p>This does not imply, by any means, that the Convention should be inactive.
						God forbid!-Composed of such men as we hope to see there, imbued with the
						spirit of prudence and self-control, demanded by the necessities of our
						situation, and acting conscientiously for the benefit of the whole State, it
						can do infinite good.-The simple assertion of the right of the white man to
						rule the State enounced in plain, dispassionate words, and sent forth by the
						representatives of an outraged, yet calm and dignified people, will have a
						grand effect. Moderation will command a respect which no violence of
						language and no pathos of feeling could ever evoke. The voice of the people,
						speaking with quiet determination, will find an echo in the hearts of every
						fair and just man. And fortunately for us, the race of such is not yet
						wholly extinct, even at the North, but growing daily, as we see by the
						elections and the altered tone of the Northern press."</p>

					<p>This is the word which should be passed along the Conservative lines now. It
						will be seen by the following that Gen. Kenton Harper, Sup't. of
						organization for the 7th Magisterial District, has acted with commendable
						promptness. We hope that his good example will be followed by all the other
						Superintendent of organization. Below we publish his note to us, and the
						list of appointments made by him for his District. <lb/></p>
					<p>
						<emph rend="italic">R. Mauzy, Esq.:</emph>
					</p>
					<p>Dear Sir-I send you a list of my appointments for the Seventh Magisterial
						District, which please publish in your next paper. It does not suit me to
						ride over the District <emph rend="italic">just now, and our people ought to
							be at work as soon as possible</emph>. I think by the aid of the papers
						of the county, each individual appointed will be notified before I can reach
						them. This is my apology. </p>
					<p>Yours with respect,</p>
					<p>KENTON HARPER.</p>
					<p>December 1, 1867. <lb/></p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Appointments for Committees for the Seventh Magisterial
							District</emph>. </p>
					<p>The following appointments have been made by the Superintendent of
						organization for the Seventh Magisterial District, under the Resolution of
						the Conservative Meeting held at the court-house of Augusta county, on the
						25th ult.</p>
					<p>Wm. D. Anderson, I. J. Parkins, Wm. Crawford, Wm. Shumate, John A. Patterson,
						Wm. Gamble, U. D. Poe, Dr. Trevey, Sam'l Bell, Theophilus Gamble, Thos.
						Burke, Levi Fishburn, Benj. Hawkins, Rich'd Hamrick, John Seawright, Cyrus
						Brown, Jacob Shreckhise, Bethuel Herring, S. D. Trotter, Jas. Jordan, Dr.
						Wm. Crawford, Dr. Wm. Bell, Wm. Wilson, Christian Eakle, Jas. Poague, R. A.
						Curry, Peter Johnston, Courtney Roller, Mansfield Hamrick, P. Link, W. P.
						Sheets, Jacob Roller, Josiah Neff, J. C. Webb, Peter Echard, Frank Farrow,
						George Calhoon, Peter E. Houff, Jos. N. Woodward, Stuart Crawford, Thomas P.
						Wilson, Wm. Howell and P. Dice.</p>
					<p>The object is to organize the voters in each neighborhood <emph rend="italic"
							>by tens</emph>, every one of whom shall consider himself a committee to
						see that each one of his ten are at the polls, and also that those in his
						neighborhood who have hitherto failed to register shall do so when the lists
						are again opened. </p>
					<p>No white man of common intelligence, with the proper instincts of his race,
						can fail to appreciate the fearful magnitude of the impending crisis. If we
						neglect the peaceful means in our power to defeat the iniquity meditated
						against us, history affords no adequate example of the horrors to which we,
						as a people, will be subjected. Let us be wise then, in time, and exert our
						utmost energies to avert them.</p>

					<p>The County Court has again postponed the election in this County on the
						question of voting a subscription of $3o0,000 to the stock of the Chesapeake
						and Ohio Railroad. The election day has been postponed to the 3rd Thursday
						in January. We think it would be well to postpone it till the fate of the
						Constitution, which will be submitted by the convention, shall be determined
						by the vote of the State.-Our citizens will not be much inclined to vote for
						a county subscription of $300,000 till they are assured that the State
						Government will not pass into the hands of Radicals and negroes, for they
						know that, in that event, their State taxes will be oppressively burdensome,
						as they are in West Virginia. Should the Constitution be defeated, and the
						fact be established that this State will not be governed by Radicals, then
						we believe that our people should and would vote the subscription-the whites
						alone voting. On the contrary, we believe that, if the vote can be taken
						before that assurance can be given, the subscription will be defeated. For
						this and other reasons we believe it would be well to postpone the election
						till the fate of the Constitution be determined.</p>

					<p>As the rigors of winter will soon be upon us, our citizens should make some
						provision for supplying the wants of the poor in our midst. As one of the
						means of doing so, we would suggest that the Lyceum charge for admittance
						when lectures will be delivered before that body. In this way, a
						considerable sum, during the winter, could be raised. It would add greatly
						to the interest of such occasions, and would furnish an incentive to persons
						to agree to deliver lectures, as they would then not only furnish an
						entertainment to the Lyceum, but would be the means of supplying the wants
						of destitute citizens. We do not propose that this should supersede any
						other plan that may be adopted, but suggest it as one of the means,
						auxiliary to others, by which a considerable sum could be raised and a deal
						of good be thereby accomplished. We hope the Lyceum will consider an adopt
						this suggestion. Whilst it will be furnishing its members with a "feast of
						reason," let it also be supplying the means to buy bread and wood for the
						destitute poor.</p>

					<p>Died, on the 28th of November, 1867, at Cedar Hill, on Naked Creek, the late

						language is inadequate to describe. She was a member of Trinity Protestant
						Episcopal Church, at Staunton, and in all her lucid moments, in the whole
						period of her wreck of bodily and mental health, she evinced a Godly
						reverence of the most devout character; and there is no doubt of her soul
						now being in the bosom of eternal repose. Her wonted spirit was that of the

				<head>Hon. A. H. H. Stuart's Speech</head>

				<transcript>
					<p>As our paper went to press within a few hours after the adjournment of the
						meeting held in the court-house, on Monday of last week, we could not do
						more than give the proceedings of the body, and had not time or space to
						give the substance of the able speeches of Hon. A. H. H. Stuart and Col.
						John B. Baldwin. We now furnish below the substance of the speech of Hon. A.
						H. H. Stuart as reported by himself, and the report may, therefore, be
						relied upon as being substantially correct. It was published in the <emph
							rend="italic">Valley Virginian</emph> of Wednesday last. It should be
						remembered that this is not a literal and full report, but merely the
						skeleton giving some idea of the views expressed so ably and forcibly and
						eloquently by the speaker. He said: </p>
					<p>It had not been his purpose to utter a word in reference to the matter now
						before the meeting, but as the gentlemen who had spoken had confined
						themselves exclusively to the specific propositions which had been
						submitted, he felt impelled to say a few words on the general subject now
						under consideration. He was afraid that the people had not sufficiently
						awakened to the magnitude of the issues now before the country, and their
						deep personal interest in them. This was manifest from the fact-the shameful
						fact-that more than two thousand of the intelligent registered voters of
						Augusta had failed to attend the polls. The effect of this apathy had been
						to endanger the success of the Conservative candidates. Heretofore, when
						political contests had taken place in Virginia, they were in regard to the
						choice of men who were to administer the Government under the Constitution,
						and in reference to mere questions of administrative policy. But now far
						more important issues demanded the notice of the people. The questions now
						presented for decision of the people affected not merely the policy of the
						administration, but the very existence and peace of civil society A wicked
						attempt is now made by an unscrupulous party, in violation of the
						Constitution and of every obligation held sacred among men, to subvert the
						whole structure of our institutions, and to invert the position of the
						elements of which it is composed. It has always been received as an axiom in
						politics that the virtue and intelligence of the constituent body were the
						only safe foundation on which free government could rest. The stability of
						all representative republican governments depends on the amount of these
						qualities possessed by those entrusted with the elective franchise. The
						effort no is to disregard this cardinal principle, and to sink the virtue
						and intelligence of the country and bring its ignorance and vice to the
						surface, as the controlling power of the government. He need not depict the
						consequences of such a process. All must see that the results would be the
						utter overthrow of all securities for life, liberty and property.-And yet
						with a full knowledge of these facts the dominant party in Congress, not
						having the fear of God before their eyes, but seduced by the instigation of
						the Devil-in violation of the obligations of the Constitution-of the
						sanctity of the official oaths-and of their duty to their duty to their
						fellow men were persistently seeking to fasten upon us degradation and ruin.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart, then, dwelt earnestly on the duty of every man to use every
						effort in his power, to avert from our beloved country such fearful
						calamities. It was a duty which every man, who was allowed to register, owed
						to himself, to register and to vote. The man who failed to do so was false
						to his country-falls to his face-false to the principles of freedom and to
						every obligation of patriotism.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart said he had never been the advocate of universal suffrage, even
						when suffrage was confined to white men. He thought George Mason stated the
						true principle, in the Virginia Bill of Rights, when he limited it to those
						who had a permanent interest in and common attachment to the community. But
						if such limitations were proper then, how much more so are they now, when a
						new element, so potent for mischief, and so ignorant of the practical
						pairings of all political questions, was introduced into our political
						community.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart said that slavery was <emph rend="italic">forever</emph> dead in
						the United States, and he doubted if there was a single man in the sound of
						his voice, who would be willing to have it re-established. All are ready to
						treat it as a thing of the past, and he believed that all were disposed to
						treat the negro race fairly and kindly. For himself, he entertained and
						always had cherished the kindest feeling for them. He had sought to do his
						duty by those who had been his slaves, and he believed they cherished for
						him the kindest sentiments. Since their emancipation they had not hesitated
						to apply to him for such favors as they needed, and he was happy to accord
						them. He believed that if the negroes had been let alone, they would have
						got on in harmony with the whites. But mischievous and designing men had
						been sent among them, to deceive and mislead them. The recent elections
						showed that they had been successful. It was natural that these ignorant and
						confiding people should be misled. He was not disposed to deal harshly with
						them for this error. It was not their fault, but that of the knaves who
						deceived and betrayed them. But the time was now at hand when the colored
						people must decide, with their eyes open, what their future course would be.
						If they persisted in arraying themselves against the Southern whites, they
						must take the consequences of their folly. They certainly were intelligent
						enough now to know who were their best friends. They could decide who fed
						and clothed and sustained them. They knew they got all their employment from
						the people of the South, and not of the North. If they would go North, they
						would find how they are treated there, and how they would be excluded from
						factories and from most all the profitable avocations of life. In this
						connection he referred to the attempt of the son-in-law of Fred. Douglas to
						run a hack in Rochester when his hack was broken up and his personal safety
						endangered. </p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart, then, referred to the falsehood of the allegation that the people
						of the North were willing to confer the elective franchise, and other
						political rights on the negroes. In refutation of this he referred to the
						50,000 majorities in Ohio and New York against the proposition, and
						proportionate majorities in other States.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart said he had always been satisfied that Abolitionism was not the
						offspring of any kind feeling to the negro. He believed it had its birth in
						hostility to the whites of the South, in part, but in a larger degree to the
						cupidity of the North. The population of the North was overcrowded. Access
						to the great West was now difficult. They wanted an outlet in the South;
						they wanted the profits of the employments now pursued by the negroes; they
						wanted to get rid of the negroes, that they might get their places. In a
						word, the Northern hive is ready to swarm, and they wish to occupy and
						possess our goodly heritage. He had long believed that this was the true
						philosophy of Abolitionism, but it was only lately that it had been openly
						avowed. Heretofore there had been a flimsy veil of humanity thrown over it,
						but recently all disguise had been thrown off, and it is acknowledged that
						Abolitionism was founded in hostility, to the negro. In proof of this, Mr.
						Stuart referred to the celebrated Helper Book-"The Impending Crisis"-which
						contained the most elaborate and vigorous assault on slavery that had ever
						been published. This book was considered so important, that it was endorsed
						and commended to public favor by a large majority of Northern members of
						Congress, and by a larger portion of the Northern press.</p>
					<p>That work has done its office. Slavery has been abolished. That was the first
						act in the drama and now the curtain rises on the second. Helper, the
						accredited organ of the Abolition party, is now out with a second book
						called by the fantastic title of "Nojoque." The very first sentence in this
						second book is substantially as follows:--"If I were to say that my object
						in writing this book is not merely to write the negro out of the United
						States, but out of existence, it would be simply God's truth." And, in a
						recent publication by Helper in the <emph rend="italic">National
							Intelligencer</emph>, he says that his great object is to drive the
						negro out of the country by colonization or extermination. He says, in
						substance, that as long as the negroes were cared for and protected by
						intelligent and influential masters, it was impossible to displace or remove
						them. But, now that they are deprived of that protection, the work is of
						easy accomplishment. </p>
					<p>Here, said Mr. Stuart, is a frank avowal of the truth. Here is the whole
						story. The object was to get the negro out of the country.-To effect this
						the protection of the master must be withdrawn. The attack could not be made
						successfully in front where the masters were defended by the Constitution,
						and the negroes shielded by the master. Abolitionism was a flank movement on
						the negro. It was intended to cut the cord which bound him to his master,
						and secured for him the protection of the master. It was intended to turn
						him loose on the community, friendless and helpless, where he would readily
						fall a victim to the knavish designs of his pretended friends. This has been
						done, and now the cry for colonization comes from Helper and his associates.
						Drive the negro out to make room for the hungry hordes of the North. The
						people of the South have not yet responded to this appeal. The next step is
						to array the negroes against the whites of the South and thus provoke a
						collision of races. If they are finally successful in this, then the negroes
						will be without friends, South or North, and there will be one general,
						simultaneous movement of the whites, North and South, to get rid of the
						whole race, and removal or extermination must close the drama. The colored
						people should be made to understand the true condition of things, and if
						they then choose to rush madly on their fate, they must bear the
						consequences of their own folly.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart urged activity and organization for the coming struggle. He held
						that it was important that every man should regard it his duty to use active
						means to have every registered voter at the polls. The issues were almost as
						important as those of life or death. Those who failed to do their duty now,
						deserved the penalty inflicted on deserters in the face of an enemy.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart said that after the war, there was a general and prudent desire on
						the part of property-holders to avail themselves of amnesties and pardons so
						as to avoid confiscation.-He was one of those who never feared there would
						be a general confiscation by Congress.-But he did believe there was serious
						danger of what was substantially confiscation, by enormous taxation under
						State authority now. Those who owned no property would wield the power. They
						would bear no share of the burden of taxation, but would reap all the
						profits, and they would levy taxes with a heavy hand, until people would be
						obliged to sell their lands to escape the assessment on them, for all
						imaginable objects. He adverted to and commented on the system of taxation
						proposed in South Carolina and explained its practical bearings.</p>
					<p>He touched on other topics and closed with an earnest appeal to every man
						present not only to ponder well what he had said, but to bear his
						admonitions to every neighborhood and to urge all, to one last earnest,
						united and patriotic effort to save our beloved State from the degredation
						and ruin with which she is threatened.</p>
