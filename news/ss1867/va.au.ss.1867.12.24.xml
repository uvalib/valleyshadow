                    <p>Though, before the dawn of to-morrow's Christmas morn will purple the Eastern
                        sky, the Editor of this journal will be "o'er the mountains and far away,"
                        yet, through its columns, he takes great pleasure in tendering its many
                        generous readers the kindly and friendly compliments of the season-<emph
                            rend="italic">wishing each and all a "merry Christmas and a happy new
                            Year</emph>." For <emph rend="italic">forty-five</emph> years this
                        journal has expressed its kindly greetings to its numerous readers.-No paper
                        has better reasons for expressing kindly feelings for expressing kindly
                        feelings for its readers, for none has a list of better subscribers. We hope
                        that they will live to enjoy many years of health, peace, happiness and
                        prosperity, and that their cares and troubles may diminish as their years
                        increase. Could our wishes be granted, the ears of the readers of this
                        journal would be greeted for many years more with that grand Christmas
                        anthem, which, "on Christmas day, beginning at Jerusalem in the Church of
                        the Sepulchre of our Lord, has traveled with the star that stood above his
                        cradle, from region to region, from communion to communion, and from tongue
                        to tongue, till it has compassed the land and sea, and returned to melt away
                        upon the sides of Mount Zion."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>With the Norfolk <emph rend="italic">Virginian</emph>, we feel that "the
                        supreme duty of the hour is to preserve the public liberties. This is no
                        empty phrase, no idle declaration. It means escape from negro rule based on
                        the arrogant assumption that the true white men of the South have no rights
                        which need be respected. It means escape from ruinous taxes, disqualifying
                        oaths, negro police, proscription in trade as well as in politics, equal (?)
                        seats in public schools, hotels, theatres, public vehicles, and churches.
                        The public liberties, then, include a great deal, fellow-citizens, and the
                        man who fails to understand this truth is indeed sanguine, or insane. We beg
                        you to run over the list of taxes, oaths and other cruel oppressions which
                        the people of West Virginia and Tennessee groan under. In the latter State,
                        the negroes, after having taken on several occasions, forcible possession of
                        the trains, have just been authorized by law to ride with white people in
                        all public conveyances. Now, when the scum of population, the low whites and
                        the ignorant blacks get possession of the Legislature, what earthly chance
                        could there be for a decent citizen to escape their oppression? There can be
                        but one answer to this.-A white man or conservative negro would find himself
                        the object at once of plunder and oppression. We all admit this. We all feel
                        this. Hence we say that the supreme duty of the hour is for us to preserve
                        the public liberties.</p>

                <summary>Argues that the "supreme duty of the hour is to preserve the public
                    liberties" by ensuring that "the scum of population, the low whites and the
                    ignorant blacks" do not control the Legislature. If they do so, the author
                    contends, "a white man or conservative negro would find himself the object at
                    once of plunder and oppression."</summary>

                    <p>During the last three months, from September 18th to December 18th, 9,285
                        barrels of flour were inspected by B. F. Fifer, Flour Inspector for the town
                        of Staunton. The grades were as follows: Extra, 6,550; Family, 900;
                        Superfine, 1,500; Fine, 250; and musty 85 barrels.</p>
                    <p>We suppose that this flour did not average less than <emph rend="italic"
                            >eleven</emph> dollars per barrel in this market.-Upon this estimate,
                        the flour inspected here, within the three months mentioned, yielded the sum
                        of <emph rend="italic">one hundred and two thousand one hundred and thirty
                            five dollars</emph> ($102,135). </p>

                    <p>Mr. Walter Davis, of this county, has sold his farm containing two hundred
                        and fifty acres, to Mr. Jacob Hernsberger, of Rockingham county at $40 per
                        acre.</p>
                    <p>We welcome Mr. Hernsberger to Augusta county. He is a man of character, and
                        will be a valuable acquisition to the citizenship of good "old Augusta."
                        Many persons from Rockingham have become citizens of this county, and as
                        they are valuable citizens, the good people of this county are prepared to
                        welcome more of the same sort. Come along-a hearty greeting awaits you.</p>

                    <p>Pursuant to a notice published in the <emph rend="italic">Spectator</emph> of
                        the 17th inst., a meeting was held for the purpose of forming an association
                        for protecting the citizens against horse thieves. Mr. E. Geeding was called
                        to the Chair, and J. H. Heizer, elected Secretary. </p>
                    <p>The object of the meeting was briefly explained by the Chair, and the
                        following committee appointed to draft a constitution, viz:</p>
                    <p>Dr. Joseph Wilson, Rev. P. Fletcher, Sam'l C. Wilson, H. B. Sieg, W. M.
                        Dudley, and on motion, the Chair was added.</p>
                    <p>They drafted a constitution for the society to which they gave the name of
                        the "Churchville Horse-thief Detective Club."</p>
                    <p>The constitution was submitted to the meeting, and, with a few alterations,
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>On motion, a committee of five was appointed to solicit an increase of
                        membership.</p>
                    <p>The Chair appointed Messrs. Samuel C. Wilson, H. Geeding, B. Crawford, W. M.
                        dually and J. H. Heizer.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then proceeded to the election of officers, which resulted
                        unanimously, as follows, viz: E. Geeding, President; J. H. Heizer,
                        Secretary, and H. B. Sieg, Treasurer.</p>
                    <p>It might be proper here to state that one important article in the
                        constitution provides that, if a horse be stolen the Club shall award a very
                        handsome reward to any one who shall recover the horse and capture the
                        thief, who shall, upon trial, be convicted.</p>
                    <p>On motion, the meeting adjourned to meet on Wednesday, December 25th, at 10
                        o'clock, A. M., for the more complete organization of the Club.</p>
                    <p>E. GEEDING, Chairman.</p>
                    <p>J. H. HEIZER, Secretary.</p>
