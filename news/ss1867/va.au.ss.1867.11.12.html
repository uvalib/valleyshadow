<b>Conservative Convention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses approval for the proposed "Conservative Convention" to be held in
                    Richmond to "ensure concert of action" among the conservatives of the state. The
                    editor recommends that a meeting be held at the Staunton Court House to select
                    local delegates to the Convention.<br>(Names in announcement:   Stuart,   Baldwin)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We approve of the suggestion, which seems to be concurred in by all the
                        papers which have expressed an opinion upon the subject, to hold a
                        Conservative Convention in Richmond, on Wednesday, the 11th of December,
                        that a plan of campaign may be agreed upon which will ensure concert of
                        action, on the part of the Conservatives, throughout the State. The
                        Convention should be composed of the greatest and wisest men of the State.
                        We hope that a large meeting will be held here on Monday, the 25th of this
                        month, (court day), for the purpose of appointing delegates to the proposed
                        Conservative Convention, and that our ablest, wisest, and most reliable
                        citizens will be selected to represent the noble Conservatives of this great
                        country, which, at the next election, will speak in tones of thunder its
                        opposition to Radical rule and negro domination. Those who were silent in
                        the recent election will, in the next, speak the more emphatically, that
                        none may misunderstand the sentiments they entertain. They will not again
                        give the Radicals an opportunity to claim their silence as evincing sympathy
                        with Radicalism and approval of negro suffrage. If the Conservative
                        Convention adopt the policy of voting down the ratification of the
                        Constitution-as it is more than probable it will-then will the voice of
                        Augusta be heard above that of any other county in proclaiming her emphatic
                        and determined opposition to ratification. The people by that time will be
                        thoroughly aroused to a sense of their duty-if the proper organization be
                        adopted and carried into effect-and they will manfully perform it.-Stuart,
                        Baldwin and other able speakers in this county should enter the field, and
                        their eloquent voices should be heard in every neighborhood calling upon the
                        people to rally to the rescue of the State.</p>
                    <p>P. S.-After the above was in type, we received the Richmond papers containing
                        the following call issued by the Executive Committee of the Conservative

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Summarizes recent elections from a variety of states, which the author

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Such a re-action in public sentiment as has taken place in the Northern and
                        Western States, as exhibited by the recent elections, is unprecedented.
                        These elections show that the hope of such reaction, which we have
                        entertained and expressed since the adoption by Congress of the Radical
                        scheme of reconstruction was well founded, and that, if the people of the
                        South had been enabled, by united opposition to the call of Conventions, to
                        gain more time, as we hoped they would, they would now have nothing to
                        dread-relief would certainly have reached them in time to save them from the
                        doom they have such just reason to dread. As it is, whilst we have some
                        reason to hope, our fate is still involved in doubt.</p>
                    <p>We give below the results of the recent elections which show how strongly the
                        tide is setting in against Radicalism.</p>
                    <p>NEW YORK. This State, which had a Republican majority of near 14,000, now
                        gives a Conservative majority of 40,000, being a Republican loss of 54,000.
                        To be safe we give the majority at 40,000, though the Conservative State
                        Central Committee claim that the majority is 50,000, which would make the
                        Republican loss 64,000. The General Assembly is Conservative.</p>
                    <p>MASSACHUSETTS. Even in this State which, like Ephraim, is joined to its
                        idols, the Republicans lose about 40,000. Their victory was like that of
                        Pyrrhus, and one more such would ruin them.</p>
                    <p>NEW JERSEY. This State, like New York, has left the Republican ranks, and has
                        taken its position in the ranks of the Conservative States. The
                        Conservatives carried the State by 12,000 majority, being a loss to the
                        Republicans of near 14,000. The Legislature stands as follows: Senate, 10
                        Republicans to 11 Conservatives. In the House, 15 Republicans to 30
                        Conservatives.</p>
                    <p>MARYLAND. In this State, the Conservatives elected every officer, and carried
                        the State by 40,000 majority.</p>
                    <p>There's life in the old land yet,</p>
                    <p>Maryland, my Maryland.</p>
                    <p>KANSAS. This blood-stained and wool-dyed abolition State was nearly redeemed,
                        to the utter surprise of Radicals and Conservatives, and the Constitutional
                        amendment recognizing negro suffrage is reported to have been rejected. In
                        this State female suffrage was submitted to the vote and defeated.</p>
                    <p>MINNESOTA. The reported Republican majority is about 4,000. The majority last
                        year was 10,209. Whether negro suffrage was defeated is yet in doubt.</p>
                    <p>WISCONSIN. Reported Republican majority about 5,000. Last year it was 23,000.</p>
                    <p>MICHIGAN. No returns that we have seen. We suppose it has gone Republican by
                        greatly reduced majority.</p>

                    <p>The Ladies' Davis Association of Mississippi, prompted by those feelings of
                        sympathy and love which suffering excites and greatness of character warms
                        into active feeling, have decided to appeal to their countrywomen in all
                        portions of Virginia, and to ask their aid in carrying out the noble design
                        of providing a home for Ex-President Davis.</p>
                    <p>The privations to which the war has reduced so many of us, we have not felt
                        so severely as he. He is debarred from entering the arena of active life to
                        provide for the present comforts and future wants of those who look to him
                        as husband and father, for protection and support. We feel it would be a
                        work of supererogation to address you in order to arouse your sympathy and
                        enlist your interest for the great Representative of the Southern people,
                        who sacrificed all and suffered in our stead. There is not a heart in all
                        this Southern land of ours that need be awakened to a just appreciation of
                        all that is sublimely glorious-all that is sad and mournfully touching
                        connected with that household name, which inspires more patriotic enthusiasm
                        than all the laurelled heroes of antiquity.</p>
                    <p>The ladies of every county in the State are urgently solicited to appoint
                        committees to raise contributions.</p>

                    <p>A meeting was held on Court day to take the initiatory steps to canvass every
                        district in the county and procure names for the formation of a Society or
                        Company to forward as speedily as possible the above scheme. The colored

                        see who can subsist the longest under the new order of things. We hope the
                        scheme will be pushed forward with energy, and that by Spring we may have
