                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS.-Whilst we are watching the movements of the Radical
                        Congress, would it not be well to look a little at home in these days of
                        trial and affliction? What is the condition of things?</p>
                    <p>Are we exercising towards one another a spirit of kindness, forbearance,
                        charity, sympathy and benevolence? Is not the very reverse the truth? We
                        seem to have entered into a sort of race of devil take the hindmost; so that
                        I swim, don't care who sinks. It is all right enough that people should
                        honestly and fairly work to repair their injured fortunes and improve their
                        condition, but at the same time they should take care of the rights and
                        feelings of their neighbors. Perhaps all this is somewhat brought about by
                        what we call hard times. This leads us to inquire, what has brought about
                        hard times?</p>
                    <p>The first that I will mention is, our taxes are heavy. It requires a great
                        deal to pay them. This is a necessary evil. Secondly, our pride. We are too
                        fond of dress and show. We have not, as we should have done, withstood the
                        temptation put before us after our downfall.-Our women, mighty good if kept
                        within proper bounds, have been fruitful in bringing about pecuniary
                        troubles. We have exhausted our money, what we had, and run on credit upon
                        the merchant, notwithstanding his pasteboard written thereon, "positively no
                        credit," in large letters.</p>
                    <p>The next that I will mention, is after the break down, there came into
                        existence, as if by magic, two institutions in our town with all the
                        paraphernalia of banks. Whether these institutions rest upon credit, money
                        or the representative of money, we shall not stop to enquire. Perhaps the
                        remains of the defunct Confederacy was made to help in some way. They spread
                        themselves out and have had many a poor fellow dancing attendance upon them,
                        holding themselves out as great blessings to the community. Negotiables
                        passed round and freely. Some were so fortunate-fortunate, did I
                        say?-unfortunate as to get their notes through; renewals and curtails came,
                        no notices being given of the time of maturity. Neglect and overlooking them
                        comes protests, then comes a meeting of the Directors; they gravely and
                        formally refer all protesed paper to a committee to select such as must be
                        sued upon them comes from the Valley National, or National Valley, I don't
                        now recollect, some 14 or 15 suits in one day in one of the courts-pretty
                        well for one day.-Why all this?</p>
                    <p>Some are shrewdly guessing that we have in service, in Richmond, a body of
                        men called the Legislature of Virginia, who are hammering away at the repeal
                        of the usury laws-the wires being pulled in certain quarters to have done,
                        and our banking gentry are getting ready for that great event in Virginia,
                        call in the money, get rid of all six per cent. paper, then come in with
                        negotiables, then we can select from the highest premiums and best endorsed
                        paper. Who doubts our religion or respectability, since the taking of all we
                        can get has been legalized.</p>
                    <p>What is the Legislature doing, Messrs. Editors? In my judgment they are
                        expressing themselves to the imputation of holding on for the sake of the
                        per diem, gobbling up the hard earnings of the people, and playing into the
                        hands of the favored few, booted and spurred, ready to ride legitimately by
                        their action.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Messrs. Editors, let me here, as one over whose head a good
                        many years have passed, who has had his fingers burnt once at six per cent.,
                        caution all against debt, especially against putting their hands to
                        negotiable paper. The devil is under it.</p>

                    <p>On Wednesday last, the Legislature of Virginia rejected the proposed
                        constitutional amendment with only one 
                        dissenting vote-W. D. Lewis, of Fairfax county. In the Senate, the vote was
                        unanimous. </p>
                    <p>Virginia has the fortitude to endure with calm resignation the wrongs which
                        may be inflicted upon her by the strong hand of power, but she has the
                        courage and self-respect to refuse to be particeps

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the last session of Congress, the House of Representatives passed a bill
                        granting suffrage to the negroes of the District of Columbia. It was not
                        passed in the Senate at that session because, the elections being about to
                        take place and knowing that it would be vetoed by the President, they were
                        afraid to risk the elections upon the question of negro suffrage, and
                        determined to postpone it till the elections were over. As soon as they
                        could, after the re-assembling of Congress, they passed the bill. The
                        President promptly vetoed it in a message, the argument of which is
                        conclusive and unanswerable. Congress took no time to consider it, but, as
                        previously determined upon, passed the bill over the veto as soon as the
                        reading of it was concluded.</p>

                    <p>The great source of embarrassment to the people of the South is the denial of
                        our political rights by the Radical Congress, and money from beyond the
                        limits of the Southern States will not flow in till our political rights

                        better. The denial of political rights to the South embarrasses those who
                        have property, and grievously oppresses those who have no property. The poor
                        who have only their labor to depend upon are the chief sufferers. The
                        Radicals profess great friendship for the colored population of the South,
                        but their policy oppresses them grievously. With the Richmond Times , "we can conceive of no class of men who
                        would be more benefitted by the restoration of the South to her political
                        rights and privileges than the negroes. The pall of gloom and suffering
                        which hangs over the South is the result of political influences and
                        apprehensions, affecting our persons and property. But the conditions which
                        affect, and the circumstances of distress and uncertainty which surround us,
                        growing out of Congressional action already taken or anticipated, visit upon
                        the negro more terribly than upon the whites at whom the blows are aimed.
                        Let us explain what we mean, and let the critical see if the facts of
                        political economy and common sense do not sustain us. </p>
                    <p>We suppose it will be admitted that the condition of the laborers in all the
                        counties and communities depends upon the prosperity of their employers. If
                        the capitalists suffer, the labor employed by their capital suffers in a
                        still greater degree, because labor has no resources to fall back upon. The
                        negroes of the South cannot prosper until the whites prosper, and the whites
                        cannot prosper as long as they are threatened with ruin and political
                        disfranchisement. When success shall once more attend our efforts to
                        retrieve our ruined fortunes; when wealth and plenty shall once more smile
                        upon our land, the negroes will be the first to bask in the sunshine of our
                        prosperity. As long as we are poor; as long as Congress by its action drives
                        capital from our borders and forbids its entrance; as long as we are
                        ostracized from all participation in the Government; as long as our status  is unsettled there will be a depression in
                        fortune, morals and education in the South, and this condition will tell
                        more terribly upon the blacks than the whites; because the former have not
                        reached that position that will enable them to battle with adversity and
                        successfully struggle with competitors in the sharp contest for food,
                        raiment and shelter. </p>
                    <p>If our political troubles and disturbances were composed in the dawn of that
                        prosperity which would begin to arise among the capitalists, the
                        land-holders of the South, the negro would find increase in wages, and
                        consequently an amelioration in every physical, social, moral and religious
                        point of view. Poverty prevents education, causes crime, and produces actual
                        physical suffering. We assert it as an axiom, which admits of no argument,
                        that the negro can only thrive through the thrift and happiness of the
                        Southern whites; and the Radicals have fatally lost sight of the fact that
                        every measure of hate and vengeance which they level at us hits Cuffee twice
                        as hard as it does the "rebels." Nor will they help his condition by making
                        him a voter, for the power to vote does not carry with it the faculty or
                        means of making a livelihood; and if an interest in politics shall cause
                        Cuffee to attend public meetings, go to barbecues and fish-fries, and
                        discuss national questions at all country stores and cross-road groggeries,
                        then the boon of suffrage will not prove profitable in broad and [unclear]
                        point of view.</p>
                    <p>If the Radicals really want to help the negroes they cannot do so more
                        effectually than by refraining to blast the future of the Southern whites.
                        Suppose a pestilence or an earthquake were to take off every white in Dixie,
                        has any one ever reflected how the negroes would get along after we were all
                        gone? If he has not, let him consider their condition in Africa, Jamaica,
                        Hayti and in all places where he works out his own salvation.</p>
