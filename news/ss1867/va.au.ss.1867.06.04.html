<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We have frequently urged the great importance of registering. If we could
						speak in a piece of thunder, we would say to all our people, "register, REGISTER, that you
							may be qualified to vote." A vote is worth a thousand times as
						much no as ever before, and every one who can, should qualify himself to
						vote by registering as soon as the registering offices are open. We think
						that committees of active, patriotic men should be appointed in every
						neighborhood in every county of the State whose duty it should be to see
						that every man who can, should register. We hope
						that a thorough and efficient system of organization will be adopted. There
						should be no delay, for results transcendently important depend upon it. In
						the language of the Norfolk Virginian, "it is
						abundantly plain that no time should be lost by the people of Virginia in
						perfecting local organizations for the purpose of bringing to the polls
						every man in the Commonwealth, who is qualified as an elector, at this
						crisis in our history. We are confronted by an organization perfect in its
						drill and discipline, and if the Anglo-Saxon element is to retain its fair
						share of political power, it must display that energy and courage which have
						heretofore marked that race from the days of Hastings down to Appomattox
						Court House. We are called upon now to fight a battle in which we have at
						stake as much as was lost at either of the fights to which we have alluded.
						If we are beaten through our own neglect of the plain duty before us, then
						we shall deserve all that may befall us."</p>

						front-to a most beautiful arbor, erected in the back yard of the Seminary,
						where the ceremonies of crowning the queen took place. The exercises
