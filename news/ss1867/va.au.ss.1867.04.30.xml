                    <p>In the meeting of Freedmen here, on Monday night, the 15th inst., among other
                        resolutions, adopted the following:</p>
                    <p>"<emph rend="italic">Resolved </emph>, That we hold in reverent remembrance
                        the memories of those who fell in the cause of freedom, and, especially, of
                        Abraham Lincoln, 'the good,' the signer of our deed of emancipation, and the
                        last martyr." </p>
                    <p>In a speech delivered at Charleston, Illinois, September, the 18th, 1858,
                        Abraham Lincoln said;</p>
                    <p>"I will say that <emph rend="italic">I am not, nor ever have been in favor of
                            making</emph> VOTERS or JURORS of NEGROES, <emph rend="italic">or of
                            qualifying them to hold office</emph>, nor to intermarry with white
                        people; and I will say, in addition to this, that there is a physical
                        difference between the white and black races which, I believe, will FOREVER
                        forbid the two races living together on terms of social and POLITICAL
                        EQUALITY. * * * I; as much as any other man am in favor of having the <emph

                        the platform and are forbidden to ride inside. Attempts have recently been
                        made in Richmond, Charleston and Mobile by colored persons to force
                        themselves inside. The object seems to be effect a collision between the
                        whites and colored people, that capital for the Radical party may be made.
                        The Radicals will be sure to make casts' paws of the colored people to
                        effect their purposes, however much the colored people may be injured by it.
                        They care nothing for the interests of the black man. Political capital is
                        their object. So they strengthen their party they care not what becomes of
                        the black man.</p>

                    <p>In discussing the plan of reconstruction embraced in the
                        Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger bill, the Louisville, (Ky.,) <emph
                            rend="italic">Courier </emph> gives the argument advanced by those who
                        favor compliance with it, and then forcibly replies to it as follows: "It is
                        argued that the adoption of this scheme is not left to the option of the
                        Southern people, but that it will necessarily, and from the very nature of
                        the pan itself, be forced upon them, and that if they refuse to participate
                        in the re-organization of the State governments, the work will be done for
                        them by the negroes and the worst class of the white population, and that
                        they cannot afford to take this risk. They can better afford to take it, as
                        we conceive, than they can afford to take this risk. They can afford to lend
                        their sanction to and put their indorsement upon such proceedings.
                        Infinitely better would it be to let even the military authorities do the
                        detestable work than for the Southern people to cut themselves off from all
                        hope of future relief from the injustice now being practiced upon them by
                        acquiescing in what all of them condemn and abhor. The reign of radicalism
                        cannot be perpetuated.-The irritation and the exasperations which originated
                        in the war will be modified and ameliorated by time. A returning sense of
                        magnanimity and justice in the Northern mid will correct the errors of the
                        present, and then, when the wretches, who are now triumphing in Southern
                        weakness and exulting over its inability to resent or resist their
                        oppression, shall be swept from the places which they now disgrace in a
                        whirlwind of popular indignation, then, if those people have been true to
                        themselves, they can make their appeal for justice with confidence and hope.
                        But, if they have themselves voluntarily run their wrists into the handcuffs
                        and placed the chains upon their own limbs, they will have no alternative
                        but to endure the evils they have brought upon themselves. </p>
                    <p>Suppose that the negroes framed the governments and carried them on, does any
                        sane man believe that a sufficient number of people in the North would not
                        be disgusted and shamed by such a spectacle to bring about a revolution in
                        the Government, and at once remove such reproach to republican institutions?
                        Most assuredly such would be the consequence. There are enough
                        right-thinking men in the North who would not tolerate such a state of
                        things to make, with the Democratic party, such a majority as would put an
                        end to radicalism promptly and forever. Common sense teaches that no such
                        outrage upon decency, no such perversion of the purpose of government would
                        be permitted to endure.</p>
                    <p>It is the apprehension that the remedy suggested would be too long delayed,
                        and that in the meantime all would be doubt, uncertainty and degradation,
                        which is no driving the Southern people to accept the reconstruction plan
                        proposed. But, on the other hand, there is not the slightest assurance or
                        guaranty that when they have complied with all of these onerous and
                        insulting conditions, when they have made the negro their political equal,
                        admitted him to assist in passing their laws and constitutions, when they
                        have placed the brand of shame and inferiority on thousands of their noblest
                        men, that they will have found any relief or advanced on step in the road of
                        restoration. Under no possible circumstances will they be admitted until
                        after another Presidential election, and every humiliating concession they
                        make will dispirit their Northern friends, deprive them of their sympathy,
                        and result in the election of a Radical candidate for the Presidency."</p>

                        of our well known Teachers-have associated themselves together for the
                        purpose of conduction an Institution long needed in the Valley of Virginia,
                        where young men may qualify themselves for the various business pursuits of
                        life. The course for the present will embrace: Penmanship; Commercial
                        Arithmetic; Commercial correspondence; Forms and Customs; Book-keeping-by
                        single and double entry; Natural Philosophy; Chemistry; Geology, and
                        Engineering-embracing surveying by the various modes now in use. This course
                        will be ultimately extended, and they will be aided by competent assistants.
                        They will retain their present positions in their respective schools.-Their
                        advertisement will appear in our next issue. We wish success to this
                        important enterprise.</p>

                    <p>In the Lyceum on Monday night, the 22nd instant, the semi-annual election of
                        officers took place with the following result:</p>
                    <p>Col. Bolivar Christian was re-elected President; Col. James H. Skinner was
                        elected Vice-President; Robert M. Guy, Esq., Secretary and Leonidas Points,
                        Esq., Treasurer. All of these officers were unanimously elected.</p>
                    <p>After the election, Prof. J. H. Hewitt delivered to a crowded house his
                        lecture, the subject of which was: "<emph rend="italic">Hints to the
                        Ladies</emph>." </p>
                    <p>The lecture was in the highest degree satirical and humorous, and was really
                        enjoyed by the audience, especially by the ladies, who constituted a
                        considerable proportion, if not a majority of the auditors. The lecture was
                        as full of <emph rend="italic">hints </emph> as an egg is of meat, which
                        were presented in the disguising garb of irony; but the "optics keen" of the
                        ladies present did not fail to see them in their true characters, and to
                        appreciate their just merits. It is not often that the ladies have the
                        fortune to be addressed in such plain frank and candid terms. Young single
                        men usually <emph rend="italic">address </emph> them in honeyed and candied
                        phrases, but the lecturer, being a married man with the frosts of many
                        winters on his locks, could afford to venture to address them in honest and
                        candid terms. Though his remarks were more candid than candied, we have no
                        doubt but that the ladies will <emph rend="italic">preserve </emph> and keep
                        them for use in <emph rend="italic">family jars</emph>. </p>

                    <p>We call the attention of our readers to the fact that the Staunton Musical
                        Association, which is composed of the Professors of music and amateur
                        singers of this place, will give their first entertainment on Friday night
                        week, May 10th, in the Chapel of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institution.
                        Bradbury's highly pleasing Oratorio of "Esther, or the Beautiful Queen,"
                        will be rendered on this occasion, in addition to which there will be two
                        grand classic choruses by Mozart and Rossini. The solos, duets trios,
                        quartettes and choruses will be well sustained and rendered with fine
                        effect. None should fail to attend this grand entertainment, as it will
                        afford a rich and rare musical feast. The programme has been in rehearsal
                        for some time, under the direction of Dr. J. L. Brown, the accomplished base
                        singer, which will ensure its being rendered in the best style.-The grand
                        organ-one of the finest in the State-played by Prof. Ettinger, will add
                        greatly to the effect of the heavy choruses. Under the constitution of this
                        society persons can procure a certificate of honorary membership, by
                        applying to the Treasurer, Mr. D. W. Drake, on payment of $3, which
                        certificate will entitle the holder to admission to all concerts and
                        rehearsals of the society. We would suggest this as an appropriate time for
                        persons to become honorary members.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In the meeting of the freedmen in this place on Monday, the 15th inst.,, at
                        which delegates wee appointed to the Radical Convention which assembled in
                        the African Church in Richmond on the 17th inst., on motion, it was made
                        part of the duties of the executive committee to invite Gen. Echols to
                        address them. In compliance with this invitation, Gen. Echols addressed them
                        in the Court-house on Saturday night last. The Courthouse was filled with
                        persons of both colors who were anxious to hear the address to be delivered
                        under such novel circumstances. After Gen. Echols, the following colored men
                        addressed the the meeting:--Henry Davenport, James Scott, Benj. Downey and
                        Philip Roselle.</p>
                    <p>Our limited space prevents us from reporting the speeches and proceedings as
                        fully as we would like to do. We have space only to notice the main points
                        made by the Speakers.</p>
                    <p>On the nomination of Philander Ransom (colored), Philip Roselle (colored) was
                        elected to preside as chairman. On motion, Mr. W. H. H. Lynn, Editor of the
                            <emph rend="italic">Vindicator </emph>, was requested to act as
                        Secretary. The Chairman introduced Gen. Echols, who then addressed the
                        meeting. </p>
                    <p>He expressed his thanks for the compliment implied in the invitation to
                        address them. He would frankly tell them what he conceived to be the duties
                        of both the whites and the blacks. The history of the world had no record of
                        such a change as had recently taken place in the government of this country.
                        Three hears since, there were four millions of slaves in this country; now
                        they are free in all their actions, personal and political. A monstrous
                        change to be wrought in so short a time. That change not only confers
                        privileges to be enjoyed, but also imposes duties to be discharged. He
                        explained the legislation by which this change had been effected. He read
                        the supplementary bill to the Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger bill, and
                        explained its several provisions. He said that he knew their hearts leaped
                        with joy that they were free, no longer slaves, and had the right to vote
                        for men to make the laws. This right has its responsibilities, and they
                        should exercise it aright. He would not flatter them, but would tell them
                        frankly that they are ignorant-he knew and would confess their ignorance. He
                        was disinterested, as he belongs to the disfranchised class, and they cannot
                        by their votes, confer any office upon him.-What is best for them is best
                        for him. He advised them to vote for the Convention, and to vote, for
                        delegates to that Convention, for honest and intelligent men, such as they
                        know to be their friends, such as they would entrust their money to, and get
                        to write their wills. He cautioned them against such as would remind them of
                        real or imagined past wrongs. He entertained no vindictive feelings towards
                        any one, was anxious for peace, and desired to see the blood-stains blotted
                        out. He warned them against such as would seek to array them in hostility to
                        their former masters. They would be told that the Northern people
                        emancipated them, and that they should be grateful to them, and should vote
                        with the Radicals. It was not the purpose of the Northern people to
                        emancipate them-for three years after the war commenced the intention was
                        not to do so, but the natural drifting of the war brought it about whether
                        they desired it or not. No Northern State ever emancipated their slaves
                        without compensation. When slavery was not longer profitable, they adopted
                        prospective emancipation. They sold their slaves to the South before the
                        arrival of the time when they would be free under their acts of prospective
                        emancipation.-Massachusetts brought more slaves from Africa than any other
                        State. The reproach of slavery rests upon the North as well as the South.
                        Some presuming upon your ignorance, will tell you that, unless you support
                        the Radical party, you will again be reduced to slavery. This is a miserable
                        bugbear, an insult to your common sense.</p>
                    <p>Don't mingle with any party as a body-don't draw a line of demarcation
                        between yourselves and the whites-don't array class against class-each
                        should act for himself upon his own judgment and choice. Don't bind your
                        consciences by pledges in secret meetings. If you array yourselves against
                        the whites in your State, you must be the party injured. The whites have the
                        advantage of property, money, education and numbers-there being 400,000,
                        more whites than blacks in this State. The State is as large a family, and
                        the members should live in peace, and they are mutually dependent the one
                        upon the other. If you unite with the Radical party, your places will be
                        filled with the German and Irish immigrants, which would finally result in
                        the destruction of your race. In Rochester, N. Y., they destroyed the hack
                        of a son-in-law of Fred. Douglas, because they would not allow a colored man
                        to drive a hack in competition with them.-In illustration of the mutual
                        dependency of all branches of society, he read Aesop's fable of the belly
                        and the other members of the body. If all the members shall not work in
                        peace and harmony, gaunt famine with emaciated frame, skinny fingers, and
                        cadaverous countenance will stalk through the land. Have you no love for
                        those with whom you have been raised? He, the speaker, felt the warmest
                        affection for his servant boy and for the old colored woman who nursed him.
                        You have been told that confiscation would come if you would enable the
                        Radicals to succeed. Would you desire that [One responded, "yes." A voice
                        said, "he don't belong to this community." In the event of confiscation,
                        this country would be intolerable. It would uproot all society, would
                        encourage robbery, murder &amp;c. You don't desire it, but you can't get
                        it if you do. Wilson says the S. S. S. Bill is a finality.</p>
                    <p>The true course to adopt is, not to unite <emph rend="italic">as a
                        class</emph> with any party-let each one think and act for himself as a
                        freeman should. Every tub should stand on its own bottom. Don't act like a
                        flock of sheep, and all jump as the bellwether jumps. </p>
                    <p>In reference to their social duties, he advised them to be honest, truthful,
                        sober and faithful to their marriage vows. He advised them to be industrious
                        and economical-to get homes where they could repose beneath their own vine
                        and fig tree-to support their ministers and churches-to educate their
                        children and to impress the virtues of honesty and truth upon their minds.
                        Let politics alone as much as possible. Organize a Savings Bank, and deposit
                        your savings in it. They will increase with time, like the rolling
                        snow-ball. Follow the course recommended, and you will be happy and
                        contented-if not, you will be ruined. Make friends and not enemies. Your
                        destiny is in your own hands. Thanking them for their attention, the speaker
                        concluded. On motion of Dennis Harris, (colored), the meeting unanimously
                        voted thanks to General Echols for the delivery of his address.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Lawson, (colored) said, was then called for, but he declined to
                        speak as ministers should not make political speeches. HENRY DAVENPORT,
                        (colored), said, "speaking is teaching that's certain." He was happy to say
                        the day had come for the first time for the colored and white man to meet
                        together upon equal terms. God help us to live together as brethren! My
                        brethren, my fellow-citizens, my fellow-travelers to the bar of God, with a
                        warm heart and a welcome hand I great you.</p>
                    <p>JAMES SCOTT, (colored), enquired how it was that they were there. He
                        complimented General Echols, but said his speech reminded him of a
                        fable-that of the boys and the frogs. He was for praising the bridge that
                        carried him over safely. He was for the party which made him free. He knew
                        his friends-even a dog knew his friends.</p>
                    <p>BENJAMIN DOWNEY, (colored), said he was "independently happy to-night." He
                        would look not only first on one side of the picture and then on the other,
                        but would "<emph rend="italic">bust </emph> the picture open and look in the
                        middle of it." He knew the black man well, but not the white man, though he
                        had lived with him 64 years. Why did the Southern people wait so long before
                        becoming such good friends? He was about to "bring the music out of it." The
                        only objection he had to General Echols was, he commenced to late. He was a
                        great orator, fine scholar-he did not understand all he said and some of the
                        white folks did'nt understand some of it neither. White folks, South, never
                        taught them A. B. C.-the Yankees did. White folks not as thankful as they
                        ought to have been to nigger for taking care of their families whilst they
                        were in the war. </p>
                    <p>PHILIP ROSELLE, (colored), --Chairman of the meeting--said that, since he had
                        been free, he had been more careful in his conduct towards others than
                        before, because when he was a slave he had a master who would protect him
                        and whip anyone who would mistreat him-now he had not. Some said the North
                        set him free, and some said the South, for if the South had not "fit" there
                        would have been no war, and if there had been no war they would not have
                        been free. He did not care who set him free. Looking at Major A. M. Garber,
                        he said: "I belonged to Maj. Garber's father, and I suppose if he had known
                        that fighting would set me free, he would not have <emph rend="italic">fit
                        </emph>. He thought rents were too high and wages too low. He would not
                        receive Gen. Echol's land but if a slice of Col. M. G. Harman's would be
                        surveyed and allotted to him he would take it, as he had belonged to and
                        worked for him a number of years. At the conclusion of his remarks, the
                        meetings adjourned. </p>
                    <p>The drift of the feelings of the freedmen was clearly exhibited, as every
                        Radical sentiment expressed by any of their speakers was applauded to the
                        echo. The meeting was highly enjoyed by all present. The happy hits made by
                        the colored speakers were greatly enjoyed by the whites.-The tone of all the
                        speakers was friendly with the exception of James Scott. The tone of his
                        voice, which cannot be disguised, betrayed embittered feelings towards the
                        Southern people.-The meeting on the whole was a treat as rich as it was
                        novel.</p>

                <summary>A summary of the speeches made last Saturday night to a meeting of freedmen
                    by Gen. Echols and three "colored men." The author reports that "the meeting on
                    the whole was a treat as rich as it was novel" despite the obviously Radical
                    inclinations of the black people in attendance.</summary>
