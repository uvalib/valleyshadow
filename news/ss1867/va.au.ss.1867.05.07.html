					<p>We concur with the Enquirer that "there is no reason why any one should
						refuse to register and vote; and there is every reason why every one should
						register and vote. The whole thing is, indeed, irregular and unsanctioned by
						law; but our government being overthrown by a force which we cannot resist,
						it is our duty, while submitting to the evils of the military domination,
						not o reject its mitigations. This is entirely clear; and hence every one
						who is allowed to do so, ought to register and to vote, in order to make our
						provisional condition as tolerable as possible. Those who may be permitted
						to vote, owe it as a duty to such as may be excluded, to exercise the
						privilege for the common protection. They should take care  of the proscribed, by registering and voting.</p>

<b>Colored People in our Midst</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Explains to readers that in the current political crisis "whites must be
					united, and must remember that therein lies their security." By contrast, the
					piece continues, blacks must be separated into two groups: "the negroes who do
					not intend to be friendly to us," whose votes should not be courted, and "the
					sensible and reasonable of the colored people," who "should be encouraged, and
					recognized as friends."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Enquirer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We extract the following from an editorial of the Richmond Enquirer . It says that, "in our addresses to the
						new class of voters, there is one thing which we must remember: We cannot
						bid against such as Hunnicutt, and the Radicals, for the favor of the idle
						and worthless and foolish among the colored people. Hunnicutt was opposed to
						letting negroes have churches, and the Radicals will not let them vote where
							they  live; but they will promise not only
						votes, but anything and everything, down here.
						Whatever we may concede, they will offer more; and will not stop short in
						their bids of the most improper and impossible promises, including social
						equalities and intimacies.-They can promise anything
						, for they will feel none of the inconveniences. </p>
					<p>It is plain we cannot enter the political market to
						bid for this class of negroes. They are Hunnicutt's lawful prey: and
						he has filled their heads and hearts with all manner of mischief. We can
						only expect the sensible and reasonable of the colored people, to understand
						the objects and the arts of the persons who would mislead them, and to see
						that their true interest lies in maintaining practicable and amicable
						relations with the white community. It is to these, therefore, we ought to
						address ourselves. The madness of the others will have to run its length.
						They are determined to be the enemies of the whites, and they must take
						their own course. What consequence will be to themselves, it needs no
						prophet to tell. </p>
					<p>We need be under no uneasiness on account of those who are thus following
						Hunnicutt.-Their number is so small, compared with the whites, that the
						latter, if only reasonably united will outvote them three to one. But we
						wish specially to urge two points: First, that the whites must be united,
						and must remember that therein lies their security. And second: That we
						engage in no wild chase after the favor of those among the negroes who do not intend to be friendly to us, and who are
						letting our enemies and theirs, lead them to their ruin. We have lowered
						ourselves in some cases, in pressing our kindness upon these. They are not
						to be conciliated and we are full able to defy them-let them take their
						course, and let us recognize them in the character of enemies, which they
						choose to assume. The other portion of the colored people, however, should
						be encouraged, and recognized as friends, co-operating with us in promoting
						the common harmony and the common good. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In speaking of Col. Baldwin, and the address delivered by him at the
						adjournment of the House of Delegates, the Norfolk Virginian , edited by Jas. Barron Hope, says: </p>
					<p>This pure minded and courageous gentleman spoke in a tone of melancholy,
						which was entirely in harmony with the gloomy aspect of affairs, but it was
						the melancholy of a resolute spirit, which can look an adverse destiny in
						the face without quailing. The main points of his address are contained in
						the following extracts, which we commend to the attention of our readers:</p>
					<p>[Then follows, that portion of the address which urges the duty of all who
						can to register and vote for suitabls delegates.
						Then the Virginian  proceeds to say:] </p>
					<p>"We have italicized several passages, which our readers will recognize as
						embodying opinions and advice which we have earnestly urged upon them. We
						make this remark in no spirit of vulgar egotism, but for the purpose of
						reinforcing our own judgement with the utterances of a trusted public
						servant of courage and sagacity. We repeat to our readers, the key to the
						position is marked down on the map in one word-REGISTER."</p>
