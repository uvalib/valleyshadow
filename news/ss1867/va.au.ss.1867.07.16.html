                    <p>Died of paralysis, near Versailles, Morgan county, Mo. Mrs. CHRISTIANA
                        ARGENBRIGHT, on the 19th of June, 1867.</p>
                    <p>The subject of this notice was born near Staunton, Va., August 23rd, 1776,
                        and at the time of her death was near 91 years old. She resided in Augusta,
                        until the Fall of 1855, when she emigrated to Missouri with her eldest son.</p>
                    <p>For a number of years previous to her removal to Missouri, she had been a
                        member of the Lutheran church, and died as tranquil as a summer's sun sinks

                    <p>Yet again we hope to meet thee,</p>

                        the 72nd year of her age.</p>
                    <p>Mrs Carroll was one of the oldest inhabitants of Staunton, and was known as a
                        good and kindhearted woman-beloved by all who knew her. She had only to be
                        known to be loved. Under many years of suffering, from general debility, she
                        exhibited the highest degree of christan fortitude and patience-never
                        murmuring or complaining. In her last moments, while surrounded by all her
                        children and a number of relatives and friends, she expressed a willingness
                        to "depart and be with Christ, which is far better"-thus leaving the bright
                        testimony behind that she enjoyed the comforts and consolation of an
                        unwavering faith in God, her spirit took its everlasting flight, and now
                        rests in the bosom of her savior. "Blessed are the dead which die in the
                        Lord: yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their
                        works do follow them."</p>
                    <p>She leaves a large circle of relatives and friends to mourn their irreparable
                        loss</p>
