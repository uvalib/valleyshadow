				<transcript>
					<p>Our readers will thank us for devoting so much of our space in this issue to
						the publication of the proceedings of the Grand Conservative State
						Convention, which assembled in Richmond, on Wednesday last, the 11th inst.
						It was in the most emphatic sense a great grand and glorious Convention. It
						was great in numbers, intelligence, character and patriotism; grand in its
						high, pure, and noble purposes, and glorious in its spirit, harmony, good
						feeling, and the successful accomplishment of the important objects for
						which it assembled. The assemblage in one body of the representative
						intelligence, virtue and patriotism of this grand "Old Commonwealth."
						Presented a sublime spectacle. It furnished incontestable evidence that the
						spirit still survives which will ultimately rescue Virginia from the
						disastrous fate which threatens, and will enable her sons to sing the songs
						of triumph, and to glory in the restoration of the constitutional liberty.
						The fires of liberty are still burning brightly upon the altars of their
						hearts, and they are justly inspired with the hope that, if they do their
						whole duty manfully and resolutely, success will crown their patriotic
						efforts to save Virginia from a worse fate than has ever befallen so
						deserving a people, and will rescue her from the outrageous tyranny of
						Radical rule, and the humiliation and degradation of negro domination.</p>
					<p>The resolutions, unanimously adopted by the Convention, will meet the
						approbation of our people. It is useless to say that <emph rend="italic"
						>we</emph> endorse them <emph rend="italic">cordially</emph>, for they
						express the same views which we have entertained and expressed, from week to
						week, in these columns from the close of the war to the present time. In the
						advocacy of them, there has been, on our part, no variableness or shadow of
						turning-we have been as true to them as the needle to the pole. Our good and
						patriotic people will, we know, endorse them as heartily as ourselves. </p>
					<p>They will, also, approve the system of organization adopted by the
						Convention. It is the same that this good Old County inaugurated at the last
						County Court, at the wise suggestion of her distinguished son-Col. John B.
						Baldwin. He was the author of the plan of organization adopted by the State
						Convention. Augusta had the honor of furnishing the permanent President of
						that large and able body of men, and, also, as just remarked, the author of
						the plan of organization adopted by it.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stuart presided with dignity, ability and efficiency. The brief address
						delivered by him on taking the Chair was recognized by all as exceedingly
						appropriate to the times and the occasion. We heard many express their
						sentiments in reference to it. All concurred in cordial approval. Besides
						these distinguished men, Augusta County had other representatives in the
						Convention of more than ordinary ability, among them, Thomas J. Michie, Esq.
						We felt proud of the number, and the intelligence, and the character of the
						Augusta delegation.-Verily, when asked for her jewels, Augusta County, like
						the mother of the Gracchi, can triumphantly point to her sons.</p>
					<p>It now devolves upon her less distinguished, <emph rend="italic">but not less
							patriotic</emph>, sons to do <emph rend="italic">their</emph> duty.-The
						hopes of Virginia now rest especially, if not wholly, upon the action of her
						obscure, but patriotic, sons. She expects every native son of hers to do his
						duty, and also every resident within her borders who wears a white
						skin-nature's livery of the superior race. It is in vain that Generals plan
						battles, if their soldiers will not fight. It is in vain that the assembled
						wisdom of the State have adopted a plan of organization, if the <emph
							rend="italic">masses</emph> of the people shall fail to do the duty
						assigned them. <emph rend="italic">Every man, without exception, has a great
							and solemn duty to perform.</emph> The failure of <emph rend="italic"
							>one</emph> man to do his duty, may result in the utter ruin of the
						State. We would earnestly urge upon each and every one to resolve to do his
						duty to his State, to himself, his wife and children. The dearest interest
						of all are now imperiled. Every other consideration should now be
						subordinated to the rescue of the State from Radical rule, which involves
						loss of liberty, tyrannous proscription and oppressive taxation, and from
						negro domination which involves humiliation, degradation and a war of races,
						which would be a ruthless war of extermination, sparing neither age nor sex.
						Woe to the man, clothed in the livery of the superior race, who shall fail
						to labor for the rescue of his State and people. He will be ostracized from
						society, he will be pointed at with the finger of scorn-in a word, he will
						be <emph rend="italic">anathema maranatha</emph>. </p>

				<transcript>
					<p>The circular addressed to the Editors of the conservative papers of this
						State by the Editors of Staunton, suggesting the propriety of conferring
						together that the Press of the State might act in concert in the approaching
						election in which the fate of Virginia will be determined, was responded to
						most favorably, and in compliance therewith, the Editors of most of the
						Conservative journals of the State met in Convention on the evening of the
						12th inst., in one of the parlors of the Ballard House in Richmond-an
						elegant room provided for them for that purpose by the liberal and
						generous-hearted proprietors of that large and excellent Hotel-Messrs Jno P.
						Ballard &amp; Sons.</p>
					<p>Maj. J. H. KELLEY of the <emph rend="italic">Fredericksburg Herald</emph>,
						was elected President, and Jas. A. Cowardin, Senr., of the Richmond <emph
							rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>, was elected Secretary of the Convention.
						When the Convention was thus organized, W. H. H. Lynn, of the Staunton <emph
							rend="italic">Vindicator</emph>, offered a resolution approbating the
						action of the Conservative State Convention, and pledging the Conservative
						press to earnest support of its policy. </p>
					<p>R. W. Hunter of the Winchester <emph rend="italic">Times</emph>, objecting to
						its phraseology, on motion of R. H. Glass, of the Lynchburg <emph
							rend="italic">Republican</emph>, the Chair appointed the following
						committee of five to prepare business for the consideration of the
						Convention. </p>
					<p>Glass, of the Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph>; Coman of the
							<emph rend="italic">Enquirer and Examiner</emph>; Hunter of the <emph
							rend="italic">Winchester Times</emph>; Bouldin of the <emph
							rend="italic">Danville Times</emph>; Mauzy of the <emph rend="italic"
							>Staunton Spectator</emph>. </p>
					<p>The committee reported the following resolution, which was <emph
							rend="italic">unanimously</emph> adopted: </p>
					<p>Resolved, That we approve the action taken by the Conservative Convention of
						the State of Virginia, which adjourned this day, and that we congratulate
						the people of Virginia upon the wisdom and patriotism which have
						characterized their representatives in said Convention.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. A. M. Garber, of the <emph rend="italic">Valley
						Virginian</emph>, modified by several amendments, </p>
					<p>Resolved, That it is the desire of this Convention to form an association, to
						be known as the Associated Press of Virginia.</p>
					<p>Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the President of this
						Convention to draft a constitution and by-laws for such an association.</p>
					<p>The President appointed the following gentlemen to compose the committee:</p>
					<p>Messrs. Cowardin of the Dispatch, McDonald of the Whig, Coleman of the
						Enquirer and Examiner, Foster of the Norfolk Day Book, and Button of the
						Lynchburg Virginian.</p>
					<p>On motion of Dr. George W. Barby, of the <emph rend="italic">Native
						Virginian</emph>, </p>
					<p>Resolved, That the thanks of this convention be tendered to Messrs. Ballard
						&amp; Sons for the use of their rooms during our session.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Little, of the <emph rend="italic">Fredericksburg
						News</emph>, the convention then adjourned. </p>
					<p>On the adjournment of the convention, tickets were presented to the Editors
						inviting them to partake of a banquet tendered them by Messrs. Jno. P
						Ballard &amp; Sons . At half past 9 o'clock P. M. they were invited to
						enter the banquet hall where stood a long table tastefully decorated and
						filled with the most delicious delicacies that ever tempted the appetite or
						gratified the palate of the most fastidious epicure. We adopt the report of
						the <emph rend="italic">Enquirer and Examiner</emph>, which is as follows: </p>
					<p>"The affair was organized by selecting the elder Mr. Cowardin, of the
						Dispatch, as President of the board, with Messrs. George W. Bagby, of the
						Native Virginian, , and George R. Barr of the Abingdon Virginian, as vice
						presidents.</p>
					<p>On either hand of the president appeared Messrs. A. H. H. Stuart and John B.
						Baldwin, well known to the country as among the ablest and noblest of
						Virginia's sons, who had been invited as guests on the occasion. Besides
						these gentlemen, were present Messrs. Washington, of the National
						Intelligencer, Hotchkiss, formerly of Stonewall Jackson's staff, Zeph.
						Turner, of the county of Rappahannock, and F. R. Farrar, of Amelia county,
						("Johnny Reb.") The assemblage of editors comprised members of the
						fraternity from all parts of the State and presented an array of talent,
						genius, learning and patriotic devotion to State and country such as it is
						difficult to bring together. Indeed, we think we are not claiming too much
						for the fraternity in saying that, this assemblage of the gentlemen of the
						editorial profession contained as great an amount of these qualities as can
						be found in an equal number of gentlemen from any other calling.</p>
					<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the ample supply of delicious viands,
						wines, liquors, and cigars provided by Messrs. Ballard &amp; Sons, the
						liberal hosts, received entire justice at the hands of all present. After
						these things had been satisfactorily discussed and disposed of, the "feast
						of reason and flow of soul" began.-Some of the regular toasts were as
						follows:</p>
					<p>"Virginia." Responded to by Col. R. E. Withers, of the Lynchburg News, in a
						most happy strain of patriotic devotion to the grand Commonwealth, "the
						mother of us all," as he feelingly described her.</p>
					<p>"The Union and the Constitution." Responded to by James McDonald, Esq., of
						the Whig with marked ability and just appreciation of the blessings of
						Constitutional liberty under a Constitutional Union.</p>
					<p>"Andrew Johnson, President of the United States." Responded to by Ro. H.
						Glass, Esq., of the Lynchburg Republican.</p>
					<p>"The Conservative Press of the Northern States." Responded to by L. Q.
						Washington, Esq., of the National Intelligencer.</p>
					<p>Besides these, quite a number of other regular toasts and some volunteer ones
						were appropriately responded to by Messrs. Stuart, Baldwin, Hotchkiss,
						Turner, Farrar, Button of the Lynchburg Virginian, Cameron, of the
						Petersburg Index, Garber of the Valley Virginian, Wartman of the Staunton
						Spectator, Lynn of the Staunton Vindicator, Bouldin of the Danville Times,
						Finks of the Warrenton Index, Cannon of the Warrenton Sentinel, Little of
						the Fredericksburg News, Hunter of the Winchester Times, Sheets of the
						Leesburg Mirror, Houston of the Fincastle Herald, Lyle of the Christiansburg
						Southwest, Foster of the Norfolk Day Book, Barr of the Abingdon Virginian,
						Bagby of the Native Virginian, the elder and the younger Cowardin of the
						Dispatch, Shields and Gilman of the Whig and others.</p>
					<p>We regret that our space precludes a further notice of this pleasant affair,
						but cannot omit to mention the graceful manner in which Mr. John P. Ballard,
						the veteran of Virginia hotel proprietors, and his genial whole-soul,
						stirring and accommodating sons, expressed their appreciation of the
						complimentary toasts proposed in their honor.</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>MR. EDITOR.-It is true we have much, so very much, to occupy our attention,
						in these trying times, that this subject may be regarded by many as too
						trivial to waste a thought upon. But as we are endeavoring to recover our
						condition before the war, in almost every respect, it certainly will not be
						argued that our roads are unnecessary to that end. To a stranger from one of
						the States North of us, Pennsylvania for instance, who may pass through our
						county, in any direction, will conclude we are rapidly approaching that
						normal condition, when sleds only were used and tobacco hogsheads were <emph
							rend="italic">rolled</emph> to market. Where is the <emph rend="italic"
							>blame</emph> to lie for want of better roads? Is it in the system, or
						the shameful manner in which it is carried out? It rests at the door of
						both, but as no hope of change can be entertained, can not the present
						system be improved? Unquestionably it can. If the County Court, aided by the
						Attorney for the Commonwealth would scan more closely the character and
						qualification of the surveyors appointed, the <emph rend="italic"
						>first</emph> step would be taken. To travel over the county just after the
						1st of June, or 1st of November, and see the manner in which some of our
						most important roads are worked, you would conclude that some of our
						surveyors had not been gifted with a quantum of brains equal to that
						contained in the head of that famous bird which, by its <emph rend="italic"
							>cackling</emph>, on a certain night, saved the city of Rome from
						pillage and destruction. But I want to enlist the attention of Court,
						surveyors and people on this subject, and will recur to it, with your
						permission, again. </p>

				<transcript>
					<p>The Convention of the white people of Virginia-who are <emph rend="italic"
							>the</emph> people of Virginia-called to consider the condition of the
						country and devise measures necessary to preserve the dignity, peace, and
						prosperity of the State at this period of apprehension and peril, assembled
						in the Theatre in Richmond, Dec. 11, at 11 o'clock. The original call for
						this meeting was issued by the Executive Committee of the Conservative Party
						of Richmond. The demand for such a convention-for a free conference of the
						Commonwealth-under the public exigency, was so apparent that the Richmond
						Committee very properly took the initiative, and their call met universal
						approval and concurrence throughout the State. The result was exhibited in
						the grand assemblage. </p>
					<p>We have not in our day beheld such a body of the representative men of the
						State. It embraces the first talent and weight of character of the people.
						Its numbers were large, and its dignity remarkable. The peril of the day
						added force o the august character of the assembly. The earnestness and the
						manly and determined expression of every face gave the fitting appearance of
						an earnest body of men, loyal and true in their grand allegiance to their
						country and their God.</p>
					<p>The list of delegates includes some of the greatest men of the State, some of
						whom (in advanced age) speak to us as ambassadors from the heroic and
						virtuous age which achieved the independence of the United States, and gave
						to them the noble institutions that have conferred so much security,
						prosperity, and fame upon the nation-institutions which, rightly and
						honestly administered, would have perpetually secured these great objects
						and ends of society. The sage counsels of these venerable citizens it is the
						good fortune of the Convention to possess.</p>
					<p>The contemplation of such a body of men taking counsel amongst themselves as
						to how to save the State from the worst of evils was most cheering to all
						who had the good fortune to be present. Its action must be salutary and
						effective.</p>
					<p>THE ORGANIZATION.</p>
					<p>AT 11 o'clock the Convention as called to order by the Hon. Willoughby
						Newton, who nominated as temporary chairman the venerable Thomas J.
						Randolph, of Albemarle (the grandson of Thomas Jefferson, the author of the
							<emph rend="italic">Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights
							of Virginia</emph>.) </p>
					<p>The nomination was unanimously carried, and Mr. R. T. Daniel of Richmond, at
						the request of Mr. Newton, conducted Mr. Randolph to the chair; upon
						assuming which he thus addressed the Convention:</p>
					<p>Gentlemen of the Convention,--Some forty or fifty years ago a good many young
						men had assembled, and proceeded to organize a convention, and looking over
						the list of names proposed for the various officers of it, they found one
						old gentleman, and as he was fit for nothing else, they determined to make
						him temporary chairman. I presume I am entitled to the same consideration.
						[Laughter.]</p>
					<p>Gentlemen, when the election for the so-called Convention, or whatever it is,
						which is now sitting in the capitol of this State, took place, the fact was
						made known of a perfect organization and entire array of race against race,
						and that the negroes, under the guidance of a few renegades, had ranged
						themselves against the white people of the State. [Applause.] This fact
						brought to the mind of every man in the community, in the course of four and
						twenty hours, a sense of danger, and the necessity which existed for the
						organization amongst the white men of a White Man's party. [Applause.] It is
						apparent, then, that the grand object of the assembling of this Convention
						was with a view to this end; and there never has been a period on the
						history of this country, when, as the French man said "a great talent for
						silence" was so eminently required as at this time and in this Convention.
						[Applause.] When General Lee surrendered, the people of Virginia submitted
						absolutely, unconditionally unreservedly, and in good faith, to the
						authority of the United States Government. Whatever opinions had been
						previously entertained upon the doctrine of secession were at once abandoned
						as impracticable. The people of Virginia have fully, unreservedly,
						persistently, and most faithfully observed that obedience to the laws and
						authority of the United States. They have not forfeited that ancient
						sobriquet of Virginia which in the "early days" she acquired, of
						"Law-abiding Virginia."</p>
					<p>Gentlemen, we are not to think of the idea, nor is it to be for a moment
						entertained, that this perfect and absolute submission to the authority of
						the United States will argue in us any lessened love of liberty and
						deviation from the path of honor-that, gentlemen, in the heart of
						Virginians, is impossible. The old grandame, with her little nurslings
						grouped around her, recounting to them the deeds, and virtues, and fame, of
						their ancestor; the mother, with her modest daughter, inspiring a love of
						liberty; the father and son aspiring to the fame of their ancestors-a
						perfect love of liberty and the duties of truth and courage. [Applause.]
						National liberty should be forever dear to every southern heart. It was
						imperishable on the field of battle among our perishing patriots-it has been
						indestructible amid the conflagration of the cities, towns, and dwellings of
						our country.</p>
					<p>We may look forward, gentlemen, with full faith in the assurance of a day of
						relief. [Applause.] I thank you, gentlemen, for the honor you have done me.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Z. Turner, the proceedings were opened with prayer by the
						Rev. Dr. Hoge, who invoked the throne of Divine Grace, in a language both
						feeling and appropriate, to guide the counsels of the Convention to the best
						results for the good of society and the State.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Christian, of Augusta, the editors of the <emph
							rend="italic">Whig</emph>, <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph>, and
							<emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>, were appointed temporary
						secretaries of the Convention. </p>
					<p>On motion of Christian, the rules of the House of Delegates were adopted for
						the government of the Convention.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Z. Turner, a committee of thirteen was appointed by the
						Chair to recommend officers for the permanent organization of the
						Convention, consisting of the following gentlemen: Z. Turner, of
						Rappahannock; Bolivar Christian, of Augusta; W. R. Staples, of Montgomery;
						O. R. Funsten, of Clarke; E. C. Burks, of Bedford; Wm. Martin, of Henry; A.
						D. Dickinson, of Prince Edward; Robert Whitehead, of Nelson; Raleigh T.
						Daniel of Richmond; R. H. Coleman, of Caroline; John Goode, of Norfolk;
						James M. Wilcox, of Charles City; and m. R. Garnett, of Essex.</p>
					<p>The committee retired, and the calling of the role was commenced by the
						Secretaries; but was interrupted by the reappearance of the committee, who
						reported the following nominations for permanent officers, which were
						approved by acclamation-viz:</p>
					<p>For President: A. H. H. Stuart, of Augusta.</p>
					<p>For Vice-Presidents: R. M. T. Hunter, of Essex; Sam'l. McDowell Moore, of
						Rockbridge; Robert T. Preston, of Montgomery; Thomas S. Flourney, of
						Halifax; James L. Kemper, of Madison; C. W. Newton, of Norfolk; William H.
						Macfarland, of Richmond; James A. Walker, of Pulaski; John Randolph Tucker,
						of Loudoun; R. W. Hunter of Winchester; and Wood Bouldin, of Charlotte.</p>
					<p>For Secretaries: H. K. Ellyson of the <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>;
						James McDonald, of the <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph>; and W. D. Coleman,
						of the <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph>. </p>
					<p>Messrs. Z. Turner and R. O. Funsten conducted Mr. Stuart to the Chair;
						whereupon he thus addressed the Convention:</p>
					<p>Gentlemen of the Convention,--I thank you for the honor you have done me in
						calling me to preside over a Convention which embodies so large a share of
						the virtue, intelligence, and patriotism of Virginia.</p>
					<p>We have assembled, gentlemen, under circumstances of peculiar interest and
						solemnity. This is no Convention to advance the interests of a mere party.
						Thank Heaven, if the late fearful conflict has done no other good, it has
						effaced all old party lines and subdued all party irritations. We come
						together not as Whigs or Democrats, but as Virginians, earnestly devoted to
						the promotion of the interests and honor of our common mother.</p>
					<p>Nor have we come together in an factious spirit or with any aggressive
						purpose.</p>
					<p>Whatever opinions individual members of this Convention may have entertained
						in the past as to the right of a State to withdraw from the Union, I think I
						may safely affirm that they have been abandoned as impracticable. The
						questions arising out of those opinions have been referred to as the
						arbitrament of arms, and having been decided adversely, all now feel that
						they are bound in honor, as well as impelled by interest, to stand by the
						award.</p>
					<p>The people of Virginia now desire repose, and they earnestly seek a
						restoration of their constitutional relations of the Union as the best means
						of affording it. They feel, too, that the material interests of all parts of
						our widely extended country are impaired and our liberties imperiled by the
						longer continuance of the present unhappy strive, and we seek a restoration
						of the Union as the most efficient remedy for all the evils of which we
						complain.</p>
					<p>When the war ceased we were told that if we annulled our ordinances of
						succession, and repudiated the Confederate debt, and perfected the
						emancipation of our slaves by adopting the constitutional amendment, we
						would be restored to our constitutional rights. To these conditions we
						promptly acceded, because they involved no sacrifice of our self-respect and
						we were attended by no national degradation. We have faithfully fulfilled
						all these conditions, and yet our rights are withheld. May we not, under
						these circumstances, appeal to the justice and good faith of the North for
						the redemption of the promises thus made to us?</p>
					<p>Looking to events which have happened in other southern States, the people of
						Virginia have been led to fear that a policy is to be inaugurated here which
						tends, if It be not designed, to subvert our whole social fabric and to
						bring the land of Washington, Henry, Jefferson, Madison, and Marshall, under
						the dominion of an alien and inferior race. We should be false to all the
						instincts of humanity-false to all the blood which courses through our
						veins-false to every obligation and duty to ourselves, our kindred, and our
						country, if we did not earnestly protest against and seek to arrest so
						fearful a calamity.</p>
					<p>We hope our fears may be unfounded. We hope we may be spared this attempted
						degradation. But it is the part of prudence to guard against all
						contingencies. It is for this purpose that we have all met to take counsel
						together today. We wish with one united voice to appeal to the patriotic
						people of the North to come to our relief and stay the hands of those who
						would oppress and degrade us.</p>
					<p>We desire, further, to perfect our organization, so that all who desire that
						this shall continue to be a white man's government may be able to act in
						concert, and by one vigorous and united effort save ourselves from ruin and
						disgrace. We prefer military rule to the despotism of an ignorant rabble.
						And we wish to declare, with earnestness and emphasis, that, come what may,
						we and those we represent can never agree that this shall be any other than
						a white man's government. Our rights may be wrested from us by violence, but
						we will never agree that our proud old mother shall be presented in the
						attitude of consenting to her own degradation. Mr. Stuart, who was warmly
						applauded during his address, having concluded, the Vice-presidents were
						invited to seats; and, having taken them, presented an array of talent,
						dignity of character, and imposing personal presence, that has been rarely
						equalled anywhere.</p>
					<p>The roll call of delegates was then called, which is so long that we cannot
						publish it in full. The following is the list of Augusta and the surrounding
						counties:</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Augusta</emph>:-J. D. Imboden, R. W. Burke, Robert Cowan,
						Bolivar Christian, W. F. Smith, J. M. McCue, H. G. Guthrie, John B. Baldwin,
						G. P. Baker, C. R. Mason, E. W. Bagley, Richard Cuttlett, H. M. Bell, W. S.
						McChesney, J. W. Bell, George Baylor, W. H. H. Lynn, J. D'Orsay Hanger,
						George A. Bruce, R. Mauzy, A. H. H. Stuart, J. E. Guy, Dr. Samuel Kennerly,
						A. M. Garber, Jr. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Bath</emph>.-J. A. McClung, C. P. Bryant, H. N. Richards,
						J. L. Eubank, Joseph Mayse, Geo. Mayse. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Highland</emph>.-W. W. Fleming, J. W. Myers, G. W.
						Fraley. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Rockbridge</emph>.-William W. McLaughlin, William
						Frazier, John Letcher, R. J. Echols, S. McDowell Moore, F. T. Anderson. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Rockingham</emph>.-Samuel Bowman, John C. Woodson, Dr.
						Burke Chrisman, J. M. Liggett, J. G. Sprinkle, Dr. T. H. V. Brown, J. H.
						Wartman, J. S. Duckwall, Jacob Fuller, J. E. Rooller, George Grattan, J. S.
						Hansberger. </p>
					<p>The tedious business of the roll being ended.</p>
					<p>R. T. Daniel offered the following resolution, which, after some cursory
						debate and the voting down of several immaterial propositions to amend, was
						adopted:</p>
					<p>"<emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That a committee of thirteen be
						appointed to prepare business for the Convention, to whom shall be referred
						all propositions and motions relating to the objects for which it has
						assembled." </p>
					<p>The following gentlemen were appointed to the committee in accordance with
						this resolution: Messrs. R. T. Daniel, Z. Turner, R. M. T. Hunter, William
						Martin, W. R. Staples, John B. Baldwin, Thomas S. Bocock, James M. Wilcox,
						E. M. Campbell, James Barbour, Geo. W. Boiling, John Goode, and John R.
						Tucker.</p>
					<p>[One of the ablest committees ever appointed in the State.]</p>
					<p>To give time for the committee to prepare a report, the disposition was to
						adjourn at once. After a good deal of talk, it was finally determined that
						when the Convention adjourns it will adjourn until 7 o'clock P. M.</p>
					<p>And then, on motion, the Convention adjourned. <lb/></p>
					<p>EVENING SESSION.</p>
					<p>The Convention was again called to order at 7 o'clock by the President. The
						scene presented was more imposing than that of the morning. The brilliant
						lights brought out the picture in bold relief. The parquette was filled
						altogether with members of the Convention, and presented a sea of manly and
						intellectual faces. The second tier was adorned by the beauty and grace of a
						number of the gentler sex. The whole assemblage was one full of dignity and
						beauty. It will be forgotten by those who saw it.</p>
					<p>Some resolutions were offered; which, under the rule, were referred to the
						Committee on Business. Mr. Daniel, from the Committee on the Business of the
						Convention, made the following report; which was adopted:</p>
					<p>"The committee to whom was referred the preparation of business for the
						Convention, and the consideration of resolutions referred to it, beg leave
						to report that various subjects of importance be considered by the
						Convention and several important resolutions have been referred to it, which
						the committee has had under consideration, but that time has not been
						allowed to report on them fully; and therefore the committee ask leave to
						sit again.</p>
					<p>"And with a view to elicit a larger and more varied expression of public
						opinion on the matters referred than probably will be obtained by the
						committee as now constituted, it is respectfully suggested that it be
						enlarged so as to consist of twenty-one members."</p>
					<p>The Chair then added the following eight gentlemen to the Business Committee,
						in accordance with the report-viz., Messrs. O. B. Finney, of Accomac; John
						Letcher, of Rockbridge; Fayette McMullen, of Smyth; Moses Walton, of
						Shenandoah; Nathaniel Alexander, of Mecklenburg; James B. Kello, of
						Southampton; and E. W. Massey, of Clarke.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Martin, of Henry, the Convention resolved that, when
						adjourned, it would adjourn until 11 o'clock the next day.</p>
					<p>A good deal of conversational debate then ensued as to whether the Convention
						should adjourn at once or remain in session for a time to hear speeches. One
						or two gentlemen favored the latter course. The great body of the assembly
						appeared to take a different view, and to concur with a remark made by Mr.
						Berry, of Richmond, that it would be better not to go to speaking-"somebody
						might say something bad."</p>
					<p>The Chair suggested that there was nothing before the Convention, and
						therefore no question which a gentleman could speak upon. But if the
						assembly desired it, they could remain in mass meeting and hear speeches
						after the adjournment.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Christian, of Augusta, the Convention then adjourned.</p>
					<p>The multitude remained, and there were calls for "Hunter," "Tucker,"
						"Baldwin," "Letcher," and others.</p>
					<p>Governor Lecher advanced towards the footlights of the stage, and admonished
						the assemblage of the peculiar applicability at this time of the old adage,
						"A still tongue makes a wise head." This drew forth roars of laughter and
						applause, in the midst of which the assembly dispersed, awarding to the
						speech the credit of being one of the best that ever was made. <lb/></p>
					<p>THURSDAY, December 12, 1867</p>
					<p>The Convention adjourned on yesterday to 11 o'clock to-day; but the Committee
						on Business not being ready to report, the President did not call the
						meeting to order until near 12 o'clock.</p>
					<p>The proceedings were opened with prayer by the Rev. Mr. Peterkin. <lb/></p>
					<p>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.</p>
					<p>Mr. Daniel, from the Committee on Business, made the following report:</p>
					<p>"The Committee on Business beg leave to report:</p>
					<p>"That they have prepared a series of resolutions which they submit for the
						approval of the Convention.</p>
					<p>"They report a plan of general organization of the Conservative voters of the
						State, which they submit in like manner, the details of which are numerous,
						and need not be set forth.</p>
					<p>"They recommend to the Convention that a committee of five be appointed by
						the President of the Convention, whose duty it shall be to prepare and
						publish at such times as the State Executive Committee (if one be appointed)
						may deem advisable, an address on behalf o the people of Virginia to the
						people of the United States.</p>
					<p>"Several other important matters have been referred to the committee:</p>
					<p>"An address to the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States;
						another address to the senate and House of Representatives in Congress
						assembled, from Colonel Moore, of Rockbridge.</p>
					<p>"A series of resolutions submitted by Mr. W. W. Hancock, of Chesterfield.</p>
					<p>"A resolution proposing a committee to confer with General Schofield upon the
						propriety of disarming the negroes of the Commonwealth and suppressing
						military drills among them, and other matters connected with that subject.</p>
					<p>"A resolution to the effect that this is a white man's government, and that
						it is the mission of the Conservative party North and South, to preserve it
						as such.</p>
					<p>"A series of resolutions adopted by a public meeting in Hanover.</p>
					<p>"A resolution that it is expedient for the Convention to memorialize Congress
						on the subject of our grievances, and also to address the people of the
						northern, western and eastern States on the same subject.</p>
					<p>"A resolution by Mr. Turner, of Richmond, that an address to the people of
						Virginia be prepared by the committee and reported to the Convention, and
						also a plan of organization for the State at large.</p>
					<p>"All of which the committee have had under consideration; but from the extent
						and magnitude of the topics presented, and the shortness of time which could
						be employed in maturing such measures as they suggest (farther than they are
						embraced in the former part of this report), the committee recommend that
						these several matters be referred to the Central Executive Committee, should
						one be appointed, to be properly disposed of.</p>
					<p>"All of which the committee respectfully submit. R. T. DANIEL, Chairman.
						<lb/></p>
					<p>THE RESOLUTIONS.</p>
					<p>The Convention took up the resolutions reported by the committee, and they
						were read by Mr. J. R. Tacker (their author), as follows:</p>
					<p>"1. This Convention doth recognize that by the results of the late war
						slavery has been abolished; and it doth declare that it is not the purpose
						or desire of the people of Virginia to reduce or subject again to slavery
						the people emancipated by the events of the war and by the amendment to the
						Constitution of the United States.</p>
					<p>"2. This Convention doth declare that Virginia of right should be restored to
						her federal relations with the Government of the United States; and that it
						is not in the contemplation of the people of Virginia to violate or impair
						her obligations to the Federal Union, but to perform them in good faith.</p>
					<p>"3. This Convention doth solemnly declare and assert that the people of
						Virginia are entitled to all the rights of freedom, and all the guarantees
						therefor, provided by the Constitution of the United States; and they insist
						on the same as unquestionable; and that the said Convention, which all were
						sworn to support does not justify the governing of Virginia by any power not
						delegated by it, nor ought she, under it, to be controlled by the Federal
						Government, except in strict accordance with its terms and limitations.</p>
					<p>"4. This Convention doth declare, in the language of a resolution adopted by
						a public meeting held at the Cooper Institute, in the city of New York:
						"That the policy which continues to subject the people of ten States of the
						Union to an irresponsible government, carried on by military power, is
						inconsistent with the express provisions of the Constitution of the United
						States, and is subversive of the fundamental ideas of our Government and of
						civil liberty; and the object for which this great wrong has been persisted
						in, as now being disclosed to the people of this country and to the world-to
						wit, To subject the white people of these States to the absolute supremacy,
						in their local governments and in their representation in the Senate and
						House of Representatives, of the black race just emerged from personal
						servitude, is abhorrent to the civilization of mankind, and involves us and
						the people of the northern States, in consequence of surrendering one-third
						of the Senate and one-quarter of the House of Representatives, which are to
						legislate over us, to the dominion of an organized class of emancipated
						slaves, who are without any of the training, habits or traditions of
						self-government."</p>
					<p>"5. This Convention, for the people of Virginia, doth declare that they
						disclaim all hostility to the black population; that they sincerely desire
						to see them advance in intelligence and national prosperity, and are willing
						to extend to them a liberal and generous protection. But that while, in the
						opinion of this Convention, any Constitution of Virginia ought to make all
						men equal before the law, and should protect the liberty and property of
						all, yet this Convention doth distinctly declare that the government of the
						States and of the Union were formed by white men to be subject to their
						control; and that the suffrage should still be so regulated by the States as
						to continue the Federal and State systems under the control and direction of
						the white race.</p>
					<p>"6. That in the opinion of this Convention the people of Virginia will
						sincerely co-operate with all men throughout the Union, of whatever name or
						party, who will labor to restore the Constitutional union of the States
						under the control of the whole race."</p>
					<p>The resolutions evidently met the hearty approval of the Convention from the
						applause with which their most striking passages were received. At the
						conclusion of the reading,</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Weisiger, the vote was taken upon them in a body, and they
						were unanimously adopted. <lb/></p>
					<p>PLAN OF ORGANIZATION.</p>
					<p>Mr. Johnson (Marmaduke) called for the reading of the Plan of Organization
						reported by the committee, and Mr. Baldwin (the author) read it as follows:
						<lb/></p>
					<p>I. A STATE COMMITTEE-</p>
					<p>To consist of thirty-three members, nine of whom shall be located in
						Richmond-viz.:</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">A Chief Director</emph>, who shall be chairman of the
						committee, and shall, subject to its control, have the chief direction
						throughout the State of all matters relating to organization, registration,
						and voting. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Eight Associate Directors</emph>, who shall be members of
						the committee, shall act as aids to the Chief Director, and shall each,
						subject to his direction, have special charge of one congressional district. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Twenty-four Consulting Members</emph>, three of whom
						shall reside in each congressional district and who may be convened by the
						Resident Committee whenever in their judgment it shall be proper. <lb/></p>
					<p>II. A COMMITTEE FOR EACH COUNTY AND CITY-VIZ:</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">A Superintendent for the County or City</emph>, who shall
						act as chairman of the committee, shall act as aid to the Associate Director
						for the district, and shall subject to his discretion, have special charge
						of the county or city. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">A Superintendent for each Registration District</emph>,
						who shall be a member of the committee, shall act as aid to other county or
						city superintendent, and shall, subject to his discretion, have special
						charge of his own district. </p>
					<p>These local committees will be charged with the duty of maintaining the
						completeness and efficiency of the local organization-shall advise the State
						Committee of any local matters requiring attention, and shall be specially
						charged with providing the means to defray necessary expenses. <lb/></p>
					<p>III. DISTRICT ORGANIZATION.</p>
					<p>1. The registered voters willing to act and vote with the Conservatives will
						be formed by "Tens," in each of which one member will be <emph rend="italic"
							>Leader</emph>. </p>
					<p>2. <emph rend="italic">Five tens</emph> will be organized as a "<emph
							rend="italic">fifty</emph>," and to each fifty there will be a "chief."
						[ITAL chief] </p>
					<p>3. The "<emph rend="italic">Chiefs of Fifty</emph>" will be chosen by the
							<emph rend="italic">Superintendent</emph> in each <emph rend="italic"
							>district</emph>; will act as his aids, and will each, subject to his
						discretion, have special charge of his own <emph rend="italic">fifty</emph>. </p>
					<p>4. The "<emph rend="italic">Leaders of Ten</emph>" in each <emph
							rend="italic">fifty</emph> will be chosen by the <emph rend="italic"
							>chief</emph>; will act as his aids, and will each, subject to his
						discretion, have special charge of the organization and supervision of his
						own <emph rend="italic">ten</emph>. <lb/></p>
					<p>IV. ORGANIZATION-HOW FORMED AND KEPT UP.</p>
					<p>1. The State Committee will be chosen by authority of the State Convention,
						and will maintain its organization by removing members, filling vacancies,
						&amp;c., as occasion may require.</p>
					<p>2. The county and city committees will be chosen by popular meetings, or by
						country or city committees already formed; and when chosen will supersede
						all other local committees.-They also will have the power, by removals,
						filling vacancies, etc., to keep up their organization.</p>
					<p>3. In all other cases the officer appointing may remove and fill vacancies,
						however occurring; and if any county or city shall fail to appoint a
						committee, the State Committee may make the appointment.</p>
					<p>There were accompanying the plan some special details, which it is not
						necessary to publish.</p>
					<p>The plan, being read, was unanimously adopted.</p>
					<p>This plan was ordered to be referred to the Executive Committee.</p>
					<p>On motion, the President was authorized, at his leisure, to appoint the
						committees required by the action of the Committee on Business. <lb/></p>
					<p>RECONSTRUCTION BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.</p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. John T. Anderson, the Executive Committee was instructed to
						inquire into the expediency of adopting measures for testing the validity of
						the acts of Congress called the reconstruction acts by the adjudication of
						the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
					<p>[Pending this question a brief debate occurred, in which Mr. Anderson
						expressed his views of the importance of the question presented by this
						resolution. General Imboden gave the history of his own case as to his right
						to vote, now before the United States Court. Mr. Goode explained that the
						Legislature did not take up the subject, because Mississippi and Georgia had
						already brought up the question of the constitutionality of the
						reconstruction laws.; and Mr. Anderson replied that he considered Virginia
						was especially called upon by the course of Georgia and Mississippi to join
						them in their effort to test this question. Mr. Aylett thought the matter
						had better be referred to the Executive Committee; and that the course being
						agreed to, the resolution was adopted.]</p>
					<p>Mr. McDowell Moore, of Rockbridge, remarking that as the business of the
						Convention was completed, it would be better to adjourn, moved that the
						Convention adjourn <emph rend="italic">sine die</emph>; and the Convention
						adjourned accordingly. </p>
					<p>[The name of John Bell Bigger, as one of the secretaries of the Convention,
						was accidentally omitted in the report of yesterday's proceedings.]</p>
					<p>[The name of Dr. E. M. Campbell, of Washington, was omitted in the report of
						the names of the Committee on Business, on which he was appointed.]</p>
					<p>The following committees, appointed by Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, President of the
						Conservative Convention were announced, viz: <lb/></p>
