<b>Passage of the Bill for the Government of the Southern States</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An account of the negotiations between the Senate and the House on the
					Reconstruction bill, including a copy of the bill as finally passed.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>On Wednesday, the 13th inst., the military bill offered by Thad. Stevens, and
						which we published last week, passed the House of Representatives by a vote
						of 109 to 55. In the Senate on Saturday, the 16th, Mr. Sherman offered a
						substitute for Stevens' military bill, which was adopted by a vote of 32 to
						3-Messrs. Buckalew, Davis and Saulsbury voting in the negative. Mr.
						Doolittle moved an additional section that no sentence of death under this
						act shall be carried into execution without the approval of the President.
						Adopted-yeas 21, nays 16. The bill as thus amended, passed the Senate by a
						vote of 29 to 10.</p>
					<p>On Monday, the 18th, the House refused to concur in the amendments of the
						Senate and asked a committee of conference. On Tuesday, the 19th, the Senate
						insisted on its amendments and refused to appoint a committee of conference.
						On the same day the House voted against agreeing to the amendments of the
						Senate by a vote of 98 nays to 73 yeas, and then the motion for a committee
						of conference was agreed to without a division. Messrs. Stevens,
						Shellabarger and Blaine being appointed the committee of conference on the
						part of the House.</p>
					<p>On Wednesday, the 20th, Mr. Wilson moved to concur with the Senate Amendment
						with the addition of a proviso to fifth section. [See proviso at the end of
						fifth section of the bill as adopted.] Mr. Shellabarger moved an amendment
						to the amendment to come in as a new motion. [See section sixth of the bill
						as adopted.] Mr. Shellabarger's amendment was adopted by a vote of 98 to 70.</p>
					<p>The question then recurred on agreeing to Mr. Wilson's motion-to concur with
						the Senate amendment, with the amendment offered by Mr. Wilson, as that was
						amended on the motion of Mr. Shellabarger.</p>
					<p>The vote was taken by yeas and nays, and resulted-yeas 125, nays 46-a strict
						party vote. So the Senate amendment, as thus modified was agreed to, and the
						bill was (at quarter past one) sent back to the Senate.</p>
					<p>The bill as thus amended was sent to the Senate, where, after some discussion
						and the defeat of several proposed amendments, it was adopted, as amended in
						the House, by the vote of 35 to 7.</p>
					<p>The following is the bill as passed by both Houses of Congress: COPY OF THE
						BILL</p>
					<p>WHEREAS, no legal State governments or adequate protection for life or
						property now exist in the rebel States of Virginia, North Carolina, South
						Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, Texas and
						Arkansas, and whereas, it is necessary that peace and good order should be
						enforced in said State until loyal and republican State governments can be
						legally established; therefore,</p>
					<p>Be it enacted, &amp;c, That said rebel States
						shall be divided into military districts and made subject to the military
						authority of the United States, as hereinafter prescribed; and for that
						purpose Virginia shall constitute the first district, North Carolina and
						South Carolina the second district, Georgia, Alabama and Florida the third
						district, Mississippi and Arkansas the fourth district, and Louisiana and
						Texas the fifth district. </p>
					<p>SEC. 2. That it shall be the duty of the President to assign to the command
						of each of said districts an officer of the army not below the rank of
						brigadier general, and to detail a sufficient military force to enable such
						officer to perform his duties and enforce his authority within the district
						to which he is assigned.</p>
					<p>SEC. 3. That it shall be the duty of each officer assigned as aforesaid to
						protect all persons in their rights of person and property to suppress
						insurrection, disorder and violence, and to punish or cause to be punished
						all disturbers of the public peace and criminals, and to this end he may
						allow local civil tribunals to take jurisdiction of and try offenders, or,
						when in his judgment it may be necessary for the trial of offenders, he
						shall have power to organize military commissions or tribunals for that
						purpose; and all interference under color of State authority with the
						exercise of military authority under this act shall be null and void.</p>
					<p>SEC. 4. That all persons put under military arrest by virtue of this act
						shall be tried without unnecessary delay, and no cruel or unusual punishment
						shall be inflicted; and no sentence of any military commission or tribunal
						hereby authorized, affecting the life or liberty of any person, shall be
						executed until it is approved by the officer in command of the district; and
						the laws and regulations for the government of the army shall not be
						affected by this act, except in so far as they may conflict with its
						provisions: Provided , That no sentence of death
						under the provisions of this act shall be carried into effect without the
						approval of the President. </p>
					<p>SEC. 5. That when the people of any one of the said rebel States shall have
						formed a constitution of government in conformity with the Constitution of
						the United States in all respects framed by a convention of delegates
						elected by the male citizens of said State twenty-one years old and upward,
						of whatever race, color, or previous condition, who have been resident in
						said State for on year previous to the day of such election, except such as
						may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion, or for felony at
						common law; and when such constitution shall provide that the elective
						franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications
						herein stated for election of delegates; and when such constitution shall be
						ratified by a majority of the persons voting on the question of ratification
						who are qualified as electors for delegates, and when such constitution
						shall have been submitted to Congress for examination and approval, and
						Congress shall have approved the same; and when said State, by a vote of its
						Legislature, elected under said Constitution, and when said constitution,
						shall have adopted the amendment to the Constitution of the United States
						proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and known as article fourteenth, and
						when said article shall have become a part of the Constitution of the United
						States, said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress,
						and Senators and Representatives shall be admitted therefrom on their taking
						the oath prescribed by law, and ten and thereafter the preceding sections of
						this bill shall be inoperative in said State: Provided
						, that no person excluded from the privilege of holding office by
						said proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States shall be
						eligible to election as a member of the convention to frame a constitution
						for any of said rebel States; nor shall any such person vote for members of
						said convention. </p>
					<p>SEC. 6. And be it further executed, That until the
						people of the said rebel States shall be by law, admitted to representation
						in Congress of the United States, any civil governments that may exist
						therein shall be deemed provisional only, and, in all respects, subject to
						the paramount authority of the United States at any time, to abolish,
						modify, control or supersede the same; and, in all elections to any office
						under such provisional governments, all persons shall be entitled to vote,
						and none others, who are entitled to vote under the provisions of the fifth
						section of this act; and no person shall be eligible to any office, under
						such provisional governments, who would be disqualified from holding office
						under the provisions of the third article of said constitutional amendment. </p>
					<p>The following is the third article of the constitutional amendment to which
						reference is made in the last clause of the bill:</p>
					<p>SEC 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in congress, or elector
						of President or Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under
						the United States, or under any States, who, having previously taken an oath
						as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as member
						of any State Legislature, or as an Executive or judicial officer of any
						State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged
						in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid and comfort to
						the enemies thereof; but Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each
						House, remove such disability.</p>

<b>"Southern Loyalists"</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excoriates Southerners who call themselves loyalists and warns that
					"negroes, if invested with the right of suffrage . . . would inevitably prefer a
					man of their own color" to a white Radical.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lynchburg News</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The "Southern Loyalists," as they inappropriately call themselves, are
						actuated, not by a spirit of patriotism and love of constitutional liberty,
						but by an inordinate greed for the spoils of office and the exercise of
						power. To accomplish their ends, they misrepresent the feelings and conduct
						of the Southern people, and favor the enfranchisement of the negroes and the
						disfranchisement of nineteen-twentieths of the Southern whites. The
						Lynchburg News  very properly says, that "the
						anxiety to secure political power and place lies at the bottom of all the
						mendacious complaints, and fictitious persecutions of which the "loyal"
						citizens of the South have so loudly complained, but the difficulty of
						securing the object of their earnest aspirations seems almost
						insurmountable. The truth is, that they are in so contemptible a minority
						that it is difficult to frame any measure, which permits white men to vote
						at all, which will not insure the defeat of these very patriotic gentlemen.
						The only chance for their promotion seems to lie in the enactment of some
						such bill as that of Elliott's, conferring suffrage on the negroes and
						disfranchising the whites. But even this scheme is by no means certain to
						result in their advancement, for the effect of such a law would be the
						selection of negroes to fill the various offices. The Radicals who suppose
						that the negroes, if invested with the right of suffrage, would vote for
						them, reckon without their host. They would inevitably prefer a man of their
						own color, and the disfranchised whites, who would really control
						nine-tenths of the negro vote, would have no hesitation in using their
						influence in favor of some respectable and honest negro, rather than for one
						of those suffering martyrs who have such a yearning desire to monopolize all
						the offices of the State.</p>

<b>Negro Suffrage Inevitable if Sherman's Bill Becomes a Law</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the "ingenious malignancy" of the Reconstruction bill will
					ensure that whatever course the South takes there will be "no refuge from negro
					suffrage" and encourages the ablest lawyers in the General Assembly to challenge
					the bill before the Supreme Court, "where it will be thoroughly demolished."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Times</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The "Reconstruction bill" is framed with such ingenious
							malignancy, that whether we adopt the constitutional amendment or prefer
							to continue in our present unrepresented condition, we cannot avoid
							negro suffrage. * * * * * * * </p>
					<p>If this bill becomes a law, at the Virginia elections, in May next, for
						Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General and members of the General
						Assembly, every male negro in Virginia above the age of
							twenty-one will be entitled to vote. Nor are we permitted to allow this
							election to go by default, for the Alexandria Constitution provides that
							these elections shall take place in May next. We are denied the
						privilege of seeking refuge in a purely military despotism by the abolition
						of this provisional government, for it rests with the Federal Government,
						and not with ourselves, to determine whether this State government shall be
						continued or abolished. </p>
					<p>Whether, therefore, we adopt the "constitutional amendment," with negro
						suffrage, and Congressional representation "annexed." or prefer to continue
						as we are, we cannot, if SHERMAN'S bill becomes a law, avoid almost
						immediate negro equality at the ballot box.</p>
					<p>The Alexandria Constitution says we shall have
						certain elections in the spring, and the SHERMAN'S bill says that at those
						elections, all male negroes twenty-one years of age shall be allowed to
						vote. </p>
					<p></p>
					<p>We lose no time in pointing out to our readers the horns of the dilemma upon
						which this bill impales us. It allows no refuge from negro suffrage, and
						there is no escape except through the agency of the Supreme Court.</p>
					<p>The monstrous features of this bill should at once receive the attention of
						the ablest lawyers of the General Assembly, and steps should be taken to
						have it brought under the fire of the Supreme Court, where it will be
						thoroughly demolished.</p>
