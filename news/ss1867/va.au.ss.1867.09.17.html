<b>How the Radicals Will Vote</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Radicals will vote unanimously for a Convention to further
					their ultimate goal "of securing the permanent domination of the Radical party"
					and implies that a vote for a Convention equates to a vote for the Radical
					agenda.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The reconstruction bills were passed by the Radical Congress for the purpose
						of securing the permanent domination of the Radical party. Through the
						instrumentality of these reconstruction bills, they expected to gain as much
						or more in the South, than they would probably lose by reaction in the
						North, if they could, by persuasion or threats, induce the Southern States
						to comply with them, by calling conventions and adopting constitutions of
						the character prescribed in these bills. In this way, the South would be
						radicalized, and the strength of the South would be added to the Radical
						party. With this object accomplished, the rule of the Radical party would be
						ensured, beyond peradventure, for an indefinite period, if not for all time.
						So well is this understood, that there is not a Radical in the South, white
						or black, who does not favor the call of conventions and the adoption of
						constitutions in compliance with the plan of reconstruction devised and
						prescribed by the Radical Congress. Show us a Radical, white or black, and
						we will show you a man who will vote in favor of a Convention. Show us a
						sympathiser, with the purpose of the Radicals, and we will show you a man
						who will vote for a Convention. Show us a man who will vote for a
						Convention. Show us a man who expects to be benefited by the ascendancy of
						the Radical party, either by the hope of office or the expectancy of
						patronage in any form, and we will show you an ally of that party who will
						vote for a Convention. Those who will vote for a Convention to comply with
						the Radical plan of reconstruction, will vote exactly as every Radical,
						white and black, will vote, and just as every Radical paper in the South
						urges them to vote. So anxious are the leading Radicals that the South
						should reconstruct upon their plan that they endeavor to coerce the South to
						do so by threatening confiscation if they fail to comply with their wishes
						in that respect. Should the Southern States adopt the Radical plan of
						reconstruction, the heart of every Radical, North and South, white and black
						would throb with joy, and the hearts of the friends of constitutional
						liberty North and South, would ache with emotions of despondency, if not of
						despair. The opponents of the Radicals, North and South, are opposed to
						compliance with the Radical plan of reconstruction, and the friends of the
						Radicals, North and South, are in favor of it. If you are a Radical, vote
						for a Convention; if not, vote against it. If you wish to vote with  Radicals, vote for
						 a Convention; if you wish to vote in opposition to them, vote against  it.</p>

<b>The Amnesty Proclamation</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that President Johnson's Amnesty Proclamation, found in another
					column of this issue of the Spectator, is opposed by the Radicals because "they
					fear it may prevent them from perfecting their scheme of establishing negro rule
					in the South." On the other hand, the writer contends that "the white people of
					the entire country will greet this proclamation with unqualified approval."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In another column will be found the new Amnesty Proclamation which was issued
						on Saturday. It extends amnesty to all engaged in the rebellion, who take
						the oath set forth in the proclamation, except three specified classes.
						These are:</p>
					<p>1. The chief executive officers, heads of departments, foreign agents and
						State governors under the rebel confederacy, military officers above the
						rank of brigadier general, and naval officers above the rank of captain.</p>
					<p>2. All who were guilty of cruelty to Union prisoners.</p>
					<p>3. Those who, at the time they seek to avail themselves of the proclamation,
						are in custody of the civil, military or naval authorities, and are held to
						bail, and all persons implicated in the assassination of President Lincoln.</p>
					<p>The oath to be taken by the seeking amnesty pledges loyalty to the Union and
						all Constitution, and the faithful observance of the laws relating to the
						emancipation of slaves. The Cabinet was a unit in recommending it, and it is
						in exact accordance with the terms offered to the rebels at the time of
						Lee's surrender. Of course the Radicals denounce it; but all their
						objections are founded on the fact that they fear it may prevent them from
						perfecting their scheme of establishing negro rule in the South. The white
						people of the entire county will greet this proclamation with unqualified
						approval.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We learn from passengers by the Southside cars, that a riot occurred in
						Farmville, yesterday, between the Yankee soldiers stationed there and the
						negroes of the town, which resulted in one soldier being shot through the
						head and killed, another dangerously, and perhaps mortally wounded from a
						blow on the head with a fence rail, and several others more or less injured.
						Some four or five negroes were dangerously wounded, and a number of others
						slightly. The riot commenced early in the day and was not quelled until
						dinner time. The origin of the disturbance was as follows:</p>
					<p>A difficulty occurred Monday afternoon, between the colored bar-keeper at
						Booker's Hotel, and a couple of Yankee soldiers, which resulted in the
						negro's being badly beaten. Yesterday morning, a number of negroes, armed
						with every available weapon, such as pistols, knives, sticks, clubs, fence
						rails, &amp;c., appeared on the streets, and being met by a half dozen
						or more soldiers, the fighting commenced. The negroes were constantly
						reinforced until they numbered several hundred, the soldiers also receiving
						accessions to their numbers. The officer commanding the soldiers, ordered
						such of them as were not engaged in the riot, to the scene of conflict to
						suppress it. Upon arriving, however, instead of attempting to stop the
						fighting, they pitched into the negroes, and a general melee ensued,--with
						the result above stated. The negroes were finally driven off, and quiet
						restored, though a renewal of the fight is momentarily to be apprehended.
						But one citizen, we are informed, took part in the affray, and he received a
						considerable whipping for his pains.-Lynch. News.

					<p>It becomes our painful duty to record a most shocking and painful accident
						which occurred in Greenville, on last Saturday evening about three o'clock.
						Mr. Stuart A. McGuffin, son of E. T. McGuffin, Esq., in company with Mr.
						James G. Apple, were handling an old army musket, which they supposed to be
						empty, but unfortunately for the subject of this notice, it contained a
						cartridge which was discharged through his head. They were exercising in the
						manual of "inspection of arms"-Apple pitched the gun to McGuffin who cocked
						it and pitched it back to Apple, who seized it about the breach, and, it is
						supposed, touched the trigger, causing it to snap and discharge its contents
						in the forehead of the unfortunate McGuffin, who died in about two hours
						afterwards. The gun was old and rusty and had no cap on the tube. McGuffin
						was 24 years old. This sad and fatal occurrence inflicts a most painful

					<p>Death has removed another member of our mystic circle. Brother THOMAS R.
						BLACKBURN is no more-he has gone to that bourn whence no traveler returns.</p>
					<p>Brother Blackburn identified himself with Masonry in early manhood, and
						attested his devotion to the principles of the Order through the years of

					<p>He was emphatically a man of energy and usefulness. For more than a quarter

						of our Hal being tried to the Plumb, Square and
						Level, was pronounced by him to be "well formed,
							true and trusty." </p>
					<p>Bro. Blackburn was a sincere Christian, and an upright man and Mason. He will
						greet us no more around our sacred Altar. He has finished his earthly
						labors, and passed from the terrestrial  to the
							celestial  Lodge above to be forever in the
						presence of the Grand Master of the Universe. </p>

						condolence to the Widow and family of our deceased Brother. </p>
					<p>Resolved , that the foregoing preamble and these

<b>Amnesty--A Proclamation by the President of the United States</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Transcript of President Johnson's Amnesty Proclamation, issued on September
					7.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Whereas, in the month of July, a. D. 1861, the two Houses of Congress, with
						extraordinary unanimity, solemnly declared that the war then existing was
						not waged on the part of the Government in any spirit of oppression, nor for
						any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor for the purpose of overthrowing
						or interfering in with the rights or established institutions of the States,
						but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to
						preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the
						several States unimpaired, and that as soon as these objects should be
						accomplished, the war ought to cease; and, whereas, the President of the
						United States, on the 8th day of December, A. D. 1863, and on the 26th day
						of March, 1864, did, with the objects of suppressing the then existing
						rebellion, of inducing all persons to return to their loyalty, and of
						restoring the authority of the United States, issue proclamations offering
						amnesty and pardon to all persons who had directly or indirectly
						participated in the then existing rebellion, except as in those
						proclamations what specified and reserved; and, whereas, the President of
						the United States did, on the 29th day of May, A. D. 1865, issue a further
						proclamation with the same objects before mentioned, and to the end that the
						authority of the Government of the United States might be restored, and that
						peace, order and freedom might be established; and the President did by the
						said last-mentioned proclamation proclaim and declare that he thereby
						granted to all persons who had directly or indirectly participated in the
						then existing rebellion, except as therein excepted, amnesty and pardon,
						with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and except
						in certain cases where legal proceedings had been instituted, but upon
						condition that such persons should take and subscribe an oath therein
						prescribed, which oath should be registered for permanent preservation; and
						, whereas, in and by the said last mentioned proclamation of the 29th day of
						May, 1865, fourteen extensive classes of persons therein specially described
						were altogether excepted and excluded from the benefits thereof; and
						whereas, the President of the United States did, on the 2d day of April,
						1866, issue a proclamation declaring that the insurrection was at an end,
						and was thenceforth to be regarded; and, whereas, there now exists no
						organized armed resistance of misguided citizens, or others to the authority
						of the United States, in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia,
						North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi,
						Florida and Texas, and the laws can be sustained and enforced therein by the
						proper civil authority, State or Federal, and the people of said states are
						well and loyally disposed, and have conformed, or, if permitted to do so,
						will conform, in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out
						of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibiting
						slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States; and,
						whereas, there no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend within
						the States which were involved in the late rebellion any renewal thereof, or
						any unlawful resistance by the people of said States to the Constitution and
						laws of the United States; and, whereas, large standing armies, military
						occupation, martial law, military tribunals, and the suspension of the
						privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and the
						right of trial by jury are in time of peace dangerous to public liberty,
						incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen contrary to the
						genius of spirit of our free institutions, and exhaustive of the National
						resources, and ought not therefore to be sanctioned or allowed, except in
						cases of actual necessity, for repelling invasion or suppressing
						insurrection or rebellion; and, whereas, a retaliatory or vindictive policy
						attended by unnecessary disqualifications, pains, penalties, confiscations
						and disfranchisements, now, as always, could only tend to hinder
						reconciliation among the people and National restoration, and repress
						popular energies and National industry and enterprise; and, whereas, for
						these reasons it is now deemed essential to the public welfare and to the
						more perfect restoration of constitutional law and order that the said last
						mentioned proclamation so as aforesaid issued on the 29th day of May, 1865,
						should be modified, and that the full and beneficent pardon conceded thereby
						should be opened, and further extended to a large number of the persons who,
						by its aforesaid exceptions, have been hitherto excluded from Executive
						clemency. </p>
					<p>Now therefore be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United
						States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the full pardon described in the
						said proclamation of 29th of May, 1865, shall henceforth be opened and
						extended o all persons who directly or indirectly participated in the late
						rebellion, with the restoration of all privileges, immunities, and rights of
						property, except as to property with regard to slaves, and except in cases
						of legal proceedings under the laws of the United States; but upon this
						condition, nevertheless, that every such person who shall seek to avail
						himself of this proclamation shall take and subscribe the following oath,
						and shall cause the same to be registered for permanent preservation in the
						same manner and with the same effect as with the oath prescribed in the said
						proclamation of the 29th of May, 1865, namely:</p>
					<p>"I, ----, do solemnly swear (or affirm), in presence of Almighty God, that I
						will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of
						the United States and the Union of the States there-under and that I will in
						like manner abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which
						have been made during the late rebellion with reference to the emancipation
						of slaves. So help me God."</p>
					<p>The following persons and no others are excluded from the benefits of this
						proclamation and of the said proclamation of the 29th of May, 1865, viz:</p>
					<p>1. The chief or pretended chief executive officers, including the President
						and Vice-President, and heads of departments of the pretended Confederate or
						rebel Government, and all who were agents thereof in foreign States and
						countries, and all who held or pretended to hold in the service of the said
						pretended Confederate Government a military rank or title above the grade of
						brigadier General, or naval rank or title above that of captain, and all who
						were or pretended to be Governors of States while maintaining abetting, or
						submitting to and acquiescing in the rebellion.</p>
					<p>2. All persons who in any way treated otherwise than as lawful prisoners of
						persons who in any capacity were employed or engaged in the military or
						naval service of the United States.</p>
					<p>3. All persons who at the time they may seek to obtain the benefits of this
						proclamation are actually in civil, military, or naval confinement or
						custody, or legally held to bail either before or after conviction, and all
						persons who were engaged directly or indirectly in the assassination of the
						late President of the United States, or in any plot or conspiracy in any
						manner therewith connected. In testimony whereof I have signed these
						presents with my hand, and have caused the seal of the United States to be
						hereunto affixed.</p>
					<p>Done at the city of Washington the 7th day of September, 1867.</p>
					<p>[SEAL.] 7th day of September, 1867.</p>
					<p>ANDREW JOHNSON.</p>
					<p>By the President of the United States.</p>
					<p>William H. Seward, </p>
