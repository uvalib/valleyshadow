				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>We have frequently urged the great importance of registering. If we could
						speak in a piece of thunder, we would say to all our people, "<emph
							rend="italic">register</emph>, REGISTER, <emph rend="italic">that you
							may be qualified to vote</emph>." A vote is worth a thousand times as
						much no as ever before, and every one who can, should qualify himself to
						vote by registering as soon as the registering offices are open. We think
						that committees of active, patriotic men should be appointed in every
						neighborhood in every county of the State whose duty it should be to see
						that <emph rend="italic">every</emph> man who can, should register. We hope
						that a thorough and efficient system of organization will be adopted. There
						should be no delay, for results transcendently important depend upon it. In
						the language of the Norfolk <emph rend="italic">Virginian</emph>, "it is
						abundantly plain that no time should be lost by the people of Virginia in
						perfecting local organizations for the purpose of bringing to the polls
						every man in the Commonwealth, who is qualified as an elector, at this
						crisis in our history. We are confronted by an organization perfect in its
						drill and discipline, and if the Anglo-Saxon element is to retain its fair
						share of political power, it must display that energy and courage which have
						heretofore marked that race from the days of Hastings down to Appomattox
						Court House. We are called upon now to fight a battle in which we have at
						stake as much as was lost at either of the fights to which we have alluded.
						If we are beaten through our own neglect of the plain duty before us, then
						we shall deserve all that may befall us."</p>

					<p>The Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">News</emph> says that the desperate

						the more discreet and business portion of the Northern discreet and business
						portion of the Northern people to put a stop to the political agitations
						which so harass an distract the country, and which are telling with fearful
						import on the financial and business circles. Revenue receipts daily falling
						off, production diminishing, industry paralyzed, population starving, farms
						and plantations growing up in jungle, mobs and violence-all these are the
						fruits of Radical supremacy, and the substantial businessmen of the North
						will soon perceive that the only means left of averting the threatened
						catastrophe, is to depose from power, a party which has evinced so little

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The little girls of the primary department of the Augusta Female
						Seminary-Miss Mary Julia Baldwin, Principal-had a May party, on last Friday
						evening, which was attended by a large number of persons, both old and
						young. This occasion afforded a large amount of enjoyment to all the young
						ladies who participated, and the visitors and older persons were most highly
						entertained, and gratified at the happy sight of witnessing the little ones
						enjoying themselves so finely. The young ladies, dressed in white and
						garlanded with flowers, marched from their school-room-the tallest in
						front-to a most beautiful arbor, erected in the back yard of the Seminary,
						where the ceremonies of crowning the queen took place. The exercises
						consisted of a number of addresses made and songs sung by the children,
						after which they repaired to a table in front of the church, which was
						bountifully supplied with refreshments and good things generally, where the
						children feasted luxuriously on sweet things, which ended the ceremonies of
						the occasion. "Long live the queen!"</p>

					<p>We invite attention to the announcement of commencement exercises of the
						Wesleyan Female Institute, commencing on the 20th, and concluding on the
						25th inst. The programme indicates that the occasion will be one of unusual
						interest and will afford a literary entertainment equal to the reputation of
						the principal and his able corps of assistants.</p>
					<p>It will be seen that the Rev. Wm. E. Munsey will make the commencement
						address; this, of itself, will add a rare attraction. To hear this
						distinguished and unrivalled pulpit orator-the greatest intellectual genius
						of the present day-will amply repay all who attend these exercises. Though
						commencing under the most unfavorable circumstances, yet this institution
						has been conducted, during the past session, with marked ability and
						success.</p>
					<p>The Rev. Wm A. Harris, is now at the head of this institution, has been a
						most successful President of some of the most distinguished female colleges
						in the South. Aided by Prof. Leoniadas Points, and accomplished scholar, a
						graduate of the University of Va., Prof. Hewitt, graduate of West Point,
						long known as a successful teacher of music; Dr. C. R. Harris in the chair
						of Physiology, and y other competent assistants, we can reasonably
						anticipate a bright and prosperous future for the Wesleyan Female
					Institute.</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Valley Railroad, was held at
						the Court-House on Monday, May 27, 1867.</p>
					<p>On motion of General Echols, Dr. Graham of Rockbridge, was called to the
						Chair, and Capt. Jed Hotchkiss, of Staunton, appointed Secretary.</p>
					<p>Col. M. G. Harman then submitted his report as President of the Company,
						which, on motion of Bolivar Christian, Esq., was referred to a Committee of
						five to be appointed by the Chair. Messrs. Christian, Yost, Echols, H. M.
						Bell and J. Wayt Bell were named as the Committee.</p>
					<p>While this Committee was preparing its report, on motion, the Secretary read
						to the meeting the report of James L. Randolph, Chief Engineer of the Balt.
						&amp; O. R. R., on the survey made under his direction of the V. R. R.
						Company.</p>
					<p>The Committee to whom the report of the President was referred, have had the
						same under consideration, and respectfully recommend that the same be
						approved and accepted.</p>
					<p>That authority be given as asked, as the President and Directors may think
						best.</p>
					<p>That the amendments of the Charter made at the last session of the
						Legislature be accepted.</p>
					<p>Respectfully, Submitted,</p>
					<p>B. CHRISTIAN,</p>
					<p>JOHN ECHOLS,</p>
					<p>H. M. BELL,</p>
					<p>S. M. LOST,</p>
					<p>J. WAYT BELL.</p>
					<p>On motion the report of the Committee was received and unanimously adopted.</p>
					<p>Major s. M. Yost moved that the present officers of the V. R. R. Co. be
						re-elected, this motion was seconded and unanimously carried.</p>
					<p>Col. M. G. Harman then made some remarks upon the present prospects of the
						road, and gave his reasons for anticipating its early completion.</p>
					<p>Bolivar Christian, Esq., made some remarks upon what had been accomplished,
						and complimented the President for his successful management in securing
						charters and amendments for the ultimate benefit of the Valley Railroad.</p>
					<p>Mr. Patton, of Rockbridge, made some remarks, saying that his county had
						complied with every requisition that had been made upon it. It had been
						asked to subscribe a certain amount of stock by its citizens, and it had
						furnished it; to subscribe $100,000 as a Company, and it had subscribed it,
						and now it was ready to do more, if necessary. He claimed that Rockbridge
						was the banner county in this movement, and only asked that other counties
						should follow her leadership.</p>
					<p>On motion of Col. Allan the following resolution was adopted:--</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the President and Directors and the
						Valley Railroad be requested to ask the County Courts of the different
						counties through which the Road passes to submit the question to the people
						of said counties, "whether they will pay the State taxes on said Road when
						completed?" </p>
					<p>On motion of Mr. Patton the meeting adjourned <emph rend="italic">sine
						die</emph>. </p>
