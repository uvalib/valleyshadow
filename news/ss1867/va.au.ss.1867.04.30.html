                        last martyr." </p>

                        made in Richmond, Charleston and Mobile by colored persons to force

                        whites and colored people, that capital for the Radical party may be made.
                        The Radicals will be sure to make casts' paws of the colored people to
                        effect their purposes, however much the colored people may be injured by it.
                        They care nothing for the interests of the black man. Political capital is

                    <p>In discussing the plan of reconstruction embraced in the
                        Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger bill, the Louisville, (Ky.,) Courier  gives the argument advanced by those who
                        favor compliance with it, and then forcibly replies to it as follows: "It is
                        argued that the adoption of this scheme is not left to the option of the
                        Southern people, but that it will necessarily, and from the very nature of
                        the pan itself, be forced upon them, and that if they refuse to participate
                        in the re-organization of the State governments, the work will be done for
                        them by the negroes and the worst class of the white population, and that
                        they cannot afford to take this risk. They can better afford to take it, as
                        we conceive, than they can afford to take this risk. They can afford to lend
                        their sanction to and put their indorsement upon such proceedings.
                        Infinitely better would it be to let even the military authorities do the
                        detestable work than for the Southern people to cut themselves off from all
                        hope of future relief from the injustice now being practiced upon them by
                        acquiescing in what all of them condemn and abhor. The reign of radicalism
                        cannot be perpetuated.-The irritation and the exasperations which originated
                        in the war will be modified and ameliorated by time. A returning sense of
                        magnanimity and justice in the Northern mid will correct the errors of the
                        present, and then, when the wretches, who are now triumphing in Southern
                        weakness and exulting over its inability to resent or resist their
                        oppression, shall be swept from the places which they now disgrace in a
                        whirlwind of popular indignation, then, if those people have been true to
                        themselves, they can make their appeal for justice with confidence and hope.
                        But, if they have themselves voluntarily run their wrists into the handcuffs
                        and placed the chains upon their own limbs, they will have no alternative
                        but to endure the evils they have brought upon themselves. </p>
                    <p>Suppose that the negroes framed the governments and carried them on, does any
                        sane man believe that a sufficient number of people in the North would not
                        be disgusted and shamed by such a spectacle to bring about a revolution in
                        the Government, and at once remove such reproach to republican institutions?
                        Most assuredly such would be the consequence. There are enough
                        right-thinking men in the North who would not tolerate such a state of
                        things to make, with the Democratic party, such a majority as would put an
                        end to radicalism promptly and forever. Common sense teaches that no such
                        outrage upon decency, no such perversion of the purpose of government would
                        be permitted to endure.</p>
                    <p>It is the apprehension that the remedy suggested would be too long delayed,
                        and that in the meantime all would be doubt, uncertainty and degradation,
                        which is no driving the Southern people to accept the reconstruction plan
                        proposed. But, on the other hand, there is not the slightest assurance or
                        guaranty that when they have complied with all of these onerous and
                        insulting conditions, when they have made the negro their political equal,
                        admitted him to assist in passing their laws and constitutions, when they
                        have placed the brand of shame and inferiority on thousands of their noblest
                        men, that they will have found any relief or advanced on step in the road of
                        restoration. Under no possible circumstances will they be admitted until
                        after another Presidential election, and every humiliating concession they
                        make will dispirit their Northern friends, deprive them of their sympathy,
                        and result in the election of a Radical candidate for the Presidency."</p>

                        officers took place with the following result:</p>
                    <p>Col. Bolivar Christian was re-elected President; Col. James H. Skinner was
                        elected Vice-President; Robert M. Guy, Esq., Secretary and Leonidas Points,
                        Esq., Treasurer. All of these officers were unanimously elected.</p>
                    <p>After the election, Prof. J. H. Hewitt delivered to a crowded house his
                        lecture, the subject of which was: "Hints to the
                        Ladies." </p>
                    <p>The lecture was in the highest degree satirical and humorous, and was really
                        enjoyed by the audience, especially by the ladies, who constituted a
                        considerable proportion, if not a majority of the auditors. The lecture was
                        as full of hints  as an egg is of meat, which
                        were presented in the disguising garb of irony; but the "optics keen" of the
                        ladies present did not fail to see them in their true characters, and to
                        appreciate their just merits. It is not often that the ladies have the
                        fortune to be addressed in such plain frank and candid terms. Young single
                        men usually address  them in honeyed and candied
                        phrases, but the lecturer, being a married man with the frosts of many
                        winters on his locks, could afford to venture to address them in honest and
                        candid terms. Though his remarks were more candid than candied, we have no
                        doubt but that the ladies will preserve  and keep
                        them for use in family jars. </p>

                    <p>He expressed his thanks for the compliment implied in the invitation to
                        address them. He would frankly tell them what he conceived to be the duties
                        of both the whites and the blacks. The history of the world had no record of
                        such a change as had recently taken place in the government of this country.
                        Three hears since, there were four millions of slaves in this country; now
                        they are free in all their actions, personal and political. A monstrous
                        change to be wrought in so short a time. That change not only confers
                        privileges to be enjoyed, but also imposes duties to be discharged. He
                        explained the legislation by which this change had been effected. He read
                        the supplementary bill to the Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger bill, and
                        explained its several provisions. He said that he knew their hearts leaped
                        with joy that they were free, no longer slaves, and had the right to vote
                        for men to make the laws. This right has its responsibilities, and they
                        should exercise it aright. He would not flatter them, but would tell them
                        frankly that they are ignorant-he knew and would confess their ignorance. He
                        was disinterested, as he belongs to the disfranchised class, and they cannot
                        by their votes, confer any office upon him.-What is best for them is best
                        for him. He advised them to vote for the Convention, and to vote, for
                        delegates to that Convention, for honest and intelligent men, such as they
                        know to be their friends, such as they would entrust their money to, and get
                        to write their wills. He cautioned them against such as would remind them of
                        real or imagined past wrongs. He entertained no vindictive feelings towards
                        any one, was anxious for peace, and desired to see the blood-stains blotted
                        out. He warned them against such as would seek to array them in hostility to
                        their former masters. They would be told that the Northern people
                        emancipated them, and that they should be grateful to them, and should vote
                        with the Radicals. It was not the purpose of the Northern people to
                        emancipate them-for three years after the war commenced the intention was
                        not to do so, but the natural drifting of the war brought it about whether
                        they desired it or not. No Northern State ever emancipated their slaves
                        without compensation. When slavery was not longer profitable, they adopted
                        prospective emancipation. They sold their slaves to the South before the
                        arrival of the time when they would be free under their acts of prospective
                        emancipation.-Massachusetts brought more slaves from Africa than any other
                        State. The reproach of slavery rests upon the North as well as the South.
                        Some presuming upon your ignorance, will tell you that, unless you support
                        the Radical party, you will again be reduced to slavery. This is a miserable
                        bugbear, an insult to your common sense.</p>
                    <p>Don't mingle with any party as a body-don't draw a line of demarcation
                        between yourselves and the whites-don't array class against class-each
                        should act for himself upon his own judgment and choice. Don't bind your
                        consciences by pledges in secret meetings. If you array yourselves against
                        the whites in your State, you must be the party injured. The whites have the
                        advantage of property, money, education and numbers-there being 400,000,
                        more whites than blacks in this State. The State is as large a family, and
                        the members should live in peace, and they are mutually dependent the one
                        upon the other. If you unite with the Radical party, your places will be
                        filled with the German and Irish immigrants, which would finally result in
                        the destruction of your race. In Rochester, N. Y., they destroyed the hack
                        of a son-in-law of Fred. Douglas, because they would not allow a colored man
                        to drive a hack in competition with them.-In illustration of the mutual
                        dependency of all branches of society, he read Aesop's fable of the belly
                        and the other members of the body. If all the members shall not work in
                        peace and harmony, gaunt famine with emaciated frame, skinny fingers, and
                        cadaverous countenance will stalk through the land. Have you no love for
                        those with whom you have been raised? He, the speaker, felt the warmest
                        affection for his servant boy and for the old colored woman who nursed him.
                        You have been told that confiscation would come if you would enable the
                        Radicals to succeed. Would you desire that [One responded, "yes." A voice
                        said, "he don't belong to this community." In the event of confiscation,
                        this country would be intolerable. It would uproot all society, would
                        encourage robbery, murder &amp;c. You don't desire it, but you can't get
                        it if you do. Wilson says the S. S. S. Bill is a finality.</p>
                    <p>The true course to adopt is, not to unite as a
                        class with any party-let each one think and act for himself as a
                        freeman should. Every tub should stand on its own bottom. Don't act like a
                        flock of sheep, and all jump as the bellwether jumps. </p>
                    <p>In reference to their social duties, he advised them to be honest, truthful,
                        sober and faithful to their marriage vows. He advised them to be industrious
                        and economical-to get homes where they could repose beneath their own vine
                        and fig tree-to support their ministers and churches-to educate their
                        children and to impress the virtues of honesty and truth upon their minds.
                        Let politics alone as much as possible. Organize a Savings Bank, and deposit
                        your savings in it. They will increase with time, like the rolling
                        snow-ball. Follow the course recommended, and you will be happy and
                        contented-if not, you will be ruined. Make friends and not enemies. Your
                        destiny is in your own hands. Thanking them for their attention, the speaker
                        concluded. On motion of Dennis Harris, (colored), the meeting unanimously
                        voted thanks to General Echols for the delivery of his address.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Lawson, (colored) said, was then called for, but he declined to
                        speak as ministers should not make political speeches. HENRY DAVENPORT,
                        (colored), said, "speaking is teaching that's certain." He was happy to say
                        the day had come for the first time for the colored and white man to meet
                        together upon equal terms. God help us to live together as brethren! My
                        brethren, my fellow-citizens, my fellow-travelers to the bar of God, with a
                        warm heart and a welcome hand I great you.</p>
                    <p>JAMES SCOTT, (colored), enquired how it was that they were there. He
                        complimented General Echols, but said his speech reminded him of a
                        fable-that of the boys and the frogs. He was for praising the bridge that
                        carried him over safely. He was for the party which made him free. He knew
                        his friends-even a dog knew his friends.</p>
                    <p>BENJAMIN DOWNEY, (colored), said he was "independently happy to-night." He
                        would look not only first on one side of the picture and then on the other,
                        but would "bust  the picture open and look in the
                        middle of it." He knew the black man well, but not the white man, though he
                        had lived with him 64 years. Why did the Southern people wait so long before
                        becoming such good friends? He was about to "bring the music out of it." The
                        only objection he had to General Echols was, he commenced to late. He was a
                        great orator, fine scholar-he did not understand all he said and some of the
                        white folks did'nt understand some of it neither. White folks, South, never
                        taught them A. B. C.-the Yankees did. White folks not as thankful as they
                        ought to have been to nigger for taking care of their families whilst they
                        were in the war. </p>
                    <p>PHILIP ROSELLE, (colored), --Chairman of the meeting--said that, since he had
                        been free, he had been more careful in his conduct towards others than
                        before, because when he was a slave he had a master who would protect him
                        and whip anyone who would mistreat him-now he had not. Some said the North
                        set him free, and some said the South, for if the South had not "fit" there
                        would have been no war, and if there had been no war they would not have
                        been free. He did not care who set him free. Looking at Major A. M. Garber,
                        he said: "I belonged to Maj. Garber's father, and I suppose if he had known
                        that fighting would set me free, he would not have fit
                        . He thought rents were too high and wages too low. He would not
                        receive Gen. Echol's land but if a slice of Col. M. G. Harman's would be
                        surveyed and allotted to him he would take it, as he had belonged to and
                        worked for him a number of years. At the conclusion of his remarks, the
                        meetings adjourned. </p>
                    <p>The drift of the feelings of the freedmen was clearly exhibited, as every
                        Radical sentiment expressed by any of their speakers was applauded to the
                        echo. The meeting was highly enjoyed by all present. The happy hits made by
                        the colored speakers were greatly enjoyed by the whites.-The tone of all the
                        speakers was friendly with the exception of James Scott. The tone of his
                        voice, which cannot be disguised, betrayed embittered feelings towards the
                        Southern people.-The meeting on the whole was a treat as rich as it was
                        novel.</p>
