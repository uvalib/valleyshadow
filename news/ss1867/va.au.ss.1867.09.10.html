                    <p>The anticipated and wished for tide of reaction against usurping Radicalism
                        has commenced its flow-the sober second thought of the people is beginning
                        to have its effect.</p>
                    <p>The result of the election in Vermont argues nothing against this statement,
                        for to say that Vermont has been carried by the Republicans is like saying
                        that, "the Dutch have taken Holland," for Vermont, like Ephraim, is joined
                        to its idols. The cheering news is flashed along the electric wires from
                        California that that State has been redeemed from the debasing thralldom of
                        the Republican party, and "refuses longer to march under its black and
                        bloody banner.'-The reaction against the Radicals which commenced last
                        Spring is growing in strength, and, in time, it will overthrow their abused
                        and ill-used power. In the language of the National Intelligencer , "the political reaction which commenced with the
                        early spring of this year is widening and deepening. New Hampshire started
                        the ball by reducing the Radical majority heavily. Connecticut followed with
                        a result revolutionizing the politics of the State. Rhode Island did better
                        than last year, though manufacturing monopolists rule the State. Great gains
                        upon Radicalism were made in West Virginia. Kentucky repudiated it
                        overwhelmingly, as did Maryland in the election of delegates to the
                        Constitutional Convention. In municipal elections in several of the States
                        the drift against Radicalism has been plainly observable. </p>
                    <p>Best of all, these victories have been achieved by the people themselves
                        almost without leaders or disciplined organization; without money and
                        offices, or a suitable canvass by popular and effective public speakers;
                        without a numerous and able press, and without political tracts wherewith to
                        instruct the people upon the vital ideas of the day and the hour. The
                        reaction begun so well by the people themselves has progressed with most
                        satisfactory results, and is destined to utterly overthrow the hydra-headed
                        monster of usurpation, disunion, and corruption, with the falling of the
                        leaves.</p>

                    <p>The Charlottesville Chronicle  says that, at the
                        Convention in Richmond, "the negroes deliberately shoved the white man off
                        of their platform, and told him in plain words that they wanted none of his
                        company; and now it turns out that there are 110,000 white voters in the
                        State (omitting eight counties not reported, but which will swell the
                        majority) and 90,000 colored voters. We do not think, with these figures,
                        that we need be bullied. If a stand-up fight is insisted on-by all means let
                        us have it. We are willing to give them a fair share of the spoils yet, if
                        they are reasonable-say the whole Congressional delegation. We shall have to
                        send persons who can take the oath, and as the white circle of selection is
                        limited, we should be willing to yield this for the sake of peace.-The place
                        is worth $5,000 a year, with the franking privilege."</p>

                    <p>"But it is a waste of time to dwell longer over the question of fact. That
                        the negroes have been diligently, and by all manner of appeal and
                        persuasion, organized as against the whites of Virginia and the South, is
                        known to everybody. It is useless to quibble or refine about it. It is they,
                        under the lead of bad counselors, who have made a black man's party. By so
                        doing they necessarily made a white people's party. If A and B separate
                        themselves from C and D they leave C and D together, as truly as if the
                        latter had made the movement. If the blacks withdraw themselves from the
                        whites and organize against them, they at the same time throw the whites
                        together as against the blacks. The party that contains all the black men in
                        the State, and is opposed to nearly every white man in the State, is per force a black man's party. The whites will
                        necessarily resist them, and will, to that extent, form a white man's party.
                        The whites will necessarily resist them, and will, to that extent, form a
                        white man's party. Such is, at this day, the division of the population of
                        Virginia,--brought about by the bad men who would use the negroes to get
                        into office!" <br>* * * * * * * </p>
                    <p>"It requires no sage to foresee what is coming. The white people will stick
                        together. If there are any who are now purposing to go with the negroes to
                        get office, they will be cured of it before election day! As soon as the
                        issue is fairly seen, and the blood warms up a little, each color will go to
                        its kind! There is more probability, that well-disposed black men, seeing
                        the folly and ruin of their course, and knowing that their race commenced
                        the distinct organization, will go to the support of their white neighbors,
                        and friends, than there is that the Whig and
                        Flournoy and Gordon will join the negro party. The latter is absolutely
                        impossible." <br>* * * * * * * </p>
                    <p>"We present these considerations that they may reach the minds of the negroes
                        as well as the white people. Unless the negroes wish to become involved in
                        the wrong and ruin of forming a black man's party, they would better quit
                        that organization without delay. We call upon all white men to open their
                        eyes to the state of the ease, and to take at once their proper, natural and
                        inevitable station, with their own color, as against a hostile organization.
                        Those who delay to do it will certainly be brought to shame and

                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS:--It Seems to be understood that the order for the election,
                        to test the sense of the people for or against a Convention, and for the
                        choice of members to act, in case a Convention is called, will be issued
                        within the next 10 days. It is further understood, unofficially, that the
                        election will be held on or about the 15th of October next.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore time that the thoughts of our people should be turned to the
                        subject, with a view to intelligent action. Whatever opinions may prevail on
                        the question of calling a Convention, there can be no doubt as to the
                        necessity of electing intelligent and reliable men to represent us in that
                        body, if it is held. It is true that many, to whom the people of Augusta
                        were accustomed to look as their representatives, in times that have passed,
                        are now disfranchised; but there are still a number of intelligent and
                        upright gentlemen who are eligible. I take it that any one is capable of
                        being elected, who is authorized to vote. Among those who are eligible, and
                        in all respects worthy of confidence, are Jos. A. Waddell, John N. Hendren,
                        H. M. Bell; James Bumgardner, George M. Cochran, Jr., Wm. Withrow, Jr., Dr.
                        T. W. Shelton, Matthew Pilson, Powell Harrison, Marshall Hanger, &amp;c.
                        These names are mentioned, not to the exclusion of many others that could be
                        enumerated, who are well-qualified for such a trust, but merely to indicate
                        to the people by examples the wide range of selection that is still open to
                        them. As there are about 5000 voters in this country, there are 5000 persons
                        capable of being elected; and it will be the fault of the people, if, out of
                        this large number they do not make a wise selection.</p>
                    <p>Let the people then think about this matter-talk it over among
                        themselves-compare opinions, and then act with decision and firmness. If
                        ever there was a time when it was necessary for the people to act with
                        caution and circumspection, this is the time. No man should seek the
                        position of member of Convention, and on the other hand no man ought to feel
                        at liberty to decline it, if his services are required by the people. The
                        country has just claims on all her sons which no one can properly
                    ignore.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"The town of Staunton is 'beautiful for situation.' Like Damascus of old, it
                        may be truly called the 'gem of the mountains.' For good order, sobriety,
                        and intelligence, it enjoys an enviable name. It is rapidly extending its
                        limits and is probably the scene of more activity and quantities of flour
                        daily arrive here; the most of which, I observe, is shipped to Richmond. The
                        hotel accommodations are excellent. The Virginia Hotel, where we tarried for
                        a short time, is deservedly popular. More accommodating and polite servants
                        we have never see in any hotel. <br>* * * * * * * * * </p>
                    <p>"While in Staunton, we formed the acquaintance of the Rev. Wm. E. Munsey,
                        whose pulpit efforts have attracted so much attention throughout the State.
                        We have not had the pleasure of hearing him preach, but would judge from our
                        intercourse with him in the social circle that the strength of his great
                        intellect has not been overrated. He possesses a mind of great analytical
                        and logical power, and one cannot converse with how without being impressed
                        with its comprehensiveness.</p>
                    <p>Mr Munsey, in appearance, is rather remarkable. His head is nearly hairless;
                        cheek bones prominent; chin narrow; eyes very penetrating and restless; nose
                        sharp; head unusually large, and his brow remarkable broad and high, with
                        jutting promontories of thought on either side.-He is about six feet two
                        inches high, and very slender. He is at present in feeble health, and is now
                        traveling in the mountains, seeking to improve it. He is a close student,
                        and very thorough in his preparation for the pulpit. Besides, Mr. Munsey is
                        an humble and artless Christian. His amiable disposition endears him to his
                        friends, and adds an additional luster to his character."</p>
