<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Louisville (Ky.) Courier  says that whatever
                        may be said of the Jacobins, lack of boldness is not among their sins. They
                        have resolved to control this Government for another presidential term, and
                        they have but little hesitation as to the means by which this object is to
                        be accomplished. They find the President in their way, and they propose to
                        impeach him. The Supreme Court thwarts some of their villainy, and
                        immediately they take steps to render that great tribunal incapable of
                        further harm. They find that if they should succeed in turning the President
                        tout of office, they will be compelled, unless the law is changed, to have
                        another election forthwith, and they are not sure but the popular
                        indignation which would be aroused by the expulsion of the President from
                        his office, would work a sufficient change in the public mind to defeat
                        their candidate, which would of course upset all their plans. To obviate
                        this difficulty they have already prepared a bill in Congress to suit the
                        possible emergency. It provides that in case there being no President or
                        Vice-President an election shall be held when ordered by
                            Congress. In the meantime, the Speaker of the Senate, if thee is
                        one, and the Speaker of the House, if there is not, shall hold the office.
                        Thus they expect to keep the power in the hands of their party, in utter
                        contempt of the popular will.-When will the American people return to their
                        senses, and throttle this fell spirit of Jacobinism, which is leveling all
                        the bulwarks of constitutional liberty before it?</p>

                    <p>"In the criminal courts of this country, whenever the blackest felon is
                        arraigned at the bar of justice to answer for his crimes, each juror before
                        he is permitted to sit in the case, is asked by the Judge 'whether he has

                        accused?' If he has, he is disqualified as a juror. By this rule which
                        protects felons, is Charles Sumner qualified to sit in trial and judgment
                        upon the President? If the laws do not accord the right of peremptory
                        challenge to Andrew Johnson; if there is no one to ask Senators 'whether
                        they have formed or expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the
                        accused,' where are Charles Sumner's shame and conscience if he shall desire
                        to sit in the trial of the man whom he but yesterday vilified and denounced,
                        when he knew at the time that if Andrew Johnson should be impeached, he
                        would be a member of the court? Such a shameless want of delicacy, we
                        believe, would send a hurricane of hissing scorn at the man whom Brooks'
                        righteous rattan once banished from the Senate for a twelve-month."</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To the Members of the Lewisburg Thespian Society. <br></p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN:--Our manager received the copy of the "Lewisburg Times" sent him
                        by you a few days since, and returns his thanks for it. In reply to the
                        challenge therein, we beg to say, that being simply novices in the art of
                        acting, we feel that our incompetency will not permit us to accept the trial
                        for the championship which you propose, and must therefore, respectfully
                        decline. We have never, for a moment, entertained the idea that ours is THE
                        Thespian Society, and could not think, for several reasons, of attempting to
                        rob you of the laurels, which you say none but yourselves have a right to,
                        so we are satisfied to let you wear them all. Were we patronized and favored
                        by our citizens as the Yankee Show and Yankee Wyman were, could easily
                        entertain and accept such propositions as the one you have made us. As it
                        is, we are now in a fair way to offer the people here some inducements  to attend our entertainments, having
                        recently secured the services of some good players, and having now in
                        rehearsal some excellent pieces which cannot fail, we think, to gain us
                        large audiences. We have discovered that we must do more
                         than the Circus and Wyman in order to get our townspeople to sustain
                        us, and when we succeed in doing this, and we are making every effort to do
                        so, we may accept your challenge, for then  we
                        can find judges enough here which will obviate the necessity of our going to
                        Lewisburg, as we would be obligated to do, were we to accept your challenge
                        now. We were organized for the benefit of patriotic and charitable objects,
                        but we have not paid the debt incurred in building our stage yet, much less
                        given any of the aforementioned commendable objects the proceeds of one or
                        more of our entertainments as we had hoped to do. </p>
                    <p>We have several flourishing female schools here which our sisters and
                        sweethearts attend, but the teachers object to their coming to our
                        entertainments, because they say they are not perfectly moral and insist
                        upon the girls going to hear dry (to them) political and financial debates
                        at the Lyceum instead.</p>
                    <p>We have been wondering whether or not these same teachers think that we,
                        proud as we are of our esteem for the ladies and of our respect for ourselves, would bring anything before them in the
                        way of a play which would be the least  immoral,
                        when we so carefully avoid the selection of obscene plays. </p>
                    <p>We cannot speak for the Harrisonburg Thespians, gentlemen, who, we believe,
                        like everything down there will do occasionally, are "on a bust," though we
                        expect you will hear from them in due time. For the present, at any rate, we
                        beg to decline your challenge, and to be Yours respectfully,</p>
                    <p>STAUNTON THESPIANS.</p>
