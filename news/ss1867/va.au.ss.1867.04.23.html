<b>A Word to Freedmen</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Referring to a meeting of freedmen held in Staunton last week, the editor

					<p>If the resolutions adopted by the Freedmen in the meeting held in this place
						on Monday night, the 15th inst., express the views and purposes of that
						class in our midst-which we very much doubt-the adoption of them, if they
						adopted them understandingly, indicates that they will draw the line of
						demarcation distinctly between themselves and the great mass of the whites
						in the elections. This course, on their part, would be folly approximating
						madness. They should have sense enough to know that if they assume a
						position of antagonism to the whites, that they, the colored people, will be
						the sufferers. The whites have the advantages of numbers, of capital and
						property, of intelligence and education. The whites constitute the
						employing, and the blacks the employed class. The whites are now disposed to
						affiliate politically in a friendly spirit with the blacks, and the blacks
						should meet them in the same spirit. If the blacks should, however, organize
						for the purpose of acting in solid phalanx against the whites, as their
						action in that meeting would seem to indicate, they must know that the
						inevitable consequence will be that the whites will unite against them. Then
						the weaker party would be pushed to the would be pushed to the wall, and the
						blacks would repent of their mad folly when too late to repair it. Their
						true course is to rely upon and to act with those whom they have known for
						years to be their friends, and to avoid taking counsel from strangers,
						however plausible, and however loud in their professions of friendship. They
						should be careful not to make enemies of the persons among whom they live,
						and upon whom they must remain dependent. If they throw down the gauntlet of
						defiant opposition, they may rest assured that it will be taken up by the
						whites.</p>

					<p>We have been called on by Mr. E. L. Houff a delegate from Augusta to the
						African Church pow-wow, at whose request we publish the subjoined, preamble
						and resolutions which were offered by him in that body and were unanimously
						and contemptuously voted "under the table." Mr. H., who seems to be a
						sensible and well-meaning person, is satisfied that he was entirely out of
						place in any such body, and that the convention was got up and controlled by
						corrupt and designing (white) men for their own selfish ends. He will take
						care, in the future, not to be caught in any such company. The following is
						the paper which was submitted by Mr. H., and which expresses his own
						sentiments and, as he assures us those of the "Union" men of Augusta.</p>
					<p>"Whereas, The State of Virginia, as well as the whole of the Southern States,
						saw fit to secede from the General Government of the United States; and as
						the result of the secession involved in the country in four years' war, the
						most terrible that has ever been waged on this Continent, and as the States
						thus seceded are at this time held by the United States Government as
						conquered provinces; therefore be it.</p>
					<p>"1. Resolved , That we, a portion of the citizens
						of Virginia in convention assembled, for the purpose of bringing back our
						State to the faith of our fathers while differing with the advocates of
						secession from the commencement of the political strife to the present time,
						yet we recognize them as friends and fellow citizens of a common country;
						and as all classes should work harmoniously together for the purpose of
						building up our dilapidated country and perpetuating the interests of our
						beloved State, we do hereby ask the Congress of the United States, in the
						name of the loyal citizens of Virginia, and in behalf of our misguided
						friends, that no portion of their property be confiscated on account of the
						part taken by them in the late rebellion. </p>
					<p>"2. Resolved , That as Union men, we are desirous
						of fostering harmony in our beloved land, and intend to uphold the Union
						party and perpetuate its success by all legitimate means. </p>
					<p>"3. Resolved , That we abide by the laws made by
						Congress to govern the State of Virginia, and we deem it our duty to uphold
						the Union now and forever one and inseparable. </p>
					<p>"4. Resolved , That we, the Union of men of
						Virginia, throw to the breeze our banner with the inscription: 'The Union, the Constitution, and the Enforcement of the
							Laws.'"</p>

<b>Conservatism vs. Radicalism</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Ridicules the Valley Virginian for characterizing the resolutions of the
					recent meeting of freedmen as "conservative" when in fact they appear to the
					author as "radical." Includes a copy of the preamble and resolutions produced at
					the meeting.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. N. C. Brackett,  Philip Roselle)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Valley Virginian, in its notice of the
						proceedings of the meeting of freedmen, which was held in this place on
						Monday night, the 15th inst. Stated that "conservative
						 resolutions were adopted unanimously," and, in commendation, said:
						"The colored people have done well, as we expected-white men, do your part."
						We were pleased to see it stated that the freedmen had unanimously adopted
							"conservative  resolutions," and were
						consequently surprised to find, when the preamble and resolutions appeared
						in the Vindicator , that they were so different
						from what we had expected. We expected "conservative
						" resolutions, and lo! They were radical .
						We suppose that the editor of the Valley
						Virginian had neither seen the resolutions, nor heard them read, and
						that he had been misinformed as to their character. </p>
					<p>We will not comment upon the character of these resolutions at this time, but
						merely publish them as we find them in the last Vindicator . The preamble and resolutions are as follows:
						PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTIONS. </p>
					<p>We, the freedmen of Augusta county, in mass meeting assembled, do recognize
						in the events of the late war the judgment and mercies of Divine Providence
						in sweeping, as with the bosom of destruction, the foul wrong of human
						bondage from the face of our country, and trusting to Him for guidance, we
						will strive to use our personal and political freedom for the glory of His
						name, and the advancement of the moral and material interest of all. And,
						whereas, we are called upon to exercise the great privilege of the
						franchise, it is due to our friends in other States, as well as to our
						fellow-citizens in Virginia, that we define our political belief on the
						great questions of the day, and seek such national political association as
						will add strength to freedom, and, also, see to it that in the Constitution
						about to be framed for the government of ourselves and posterity, we ask no
						more than justice, nor accept less than safety.</p>
					<p>Therefore, be it</p>
					<p>Resolved , That our grateful thanks are due to the
						gallant armies of the United States who, under Providence, followed the flag
						of Liberty and Union until victory crowned their efforts. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That we hold in reverent remembrance
						the memories of those who fell in the cause of freedom, and especially, of
						Abraham Lincoln, "the good," the signer of our deed of emancipation, and the
						last martyr. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That our profound gratitude is due to
						those friends in the 39th Congress who, step by step, have perfected for our
						security the legitimate fruits of successful contest. Resolved , That, as our late masters were not themselves legally
						responsible for withholding from us our natural rights, so we enter upon the
						exercise of them "with malice towards none, with charity towards all." </p>
					<p>Resolved , That, as we believe the principles
						dominant in the 39th Congress to be just, as well as necessary for our
						future security, we identify ourselves, and seek affiliation with the
						National Union Republican Association at Washington, and elsewhere. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That, believing in principles before
						men, we will not support by our votes, at the coming elections, any
						candidates who will not pledge themselves faithfully to advocate our wants,
						and insist upon what we believe to be our wants and shall enforce strict
						responsibility to such pledges. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That we demand, </p>
					<p>1st. That all elections. National, State and Local, shall be by secret
						ballot.</p>
					<p>2nd. That no man shall be ineligible to office by reason of sect or color.</p>
					<p>3rd. That trial by Jury of peers is a right not to be withheld from any man,
						and we demand admission to the Jury list, as well as the Poll list.</p>
					<p>4th. That thinking Major-General Schofield for his General Order, No. 2,
						March 15th , 1867, we demand that the "prohibition of whipping or maiming as
						a punishment of any crime, misdemeanor, or offence," be made part of organic
						law of the State.</p>
					<p>5th. That while we are willing, to the utmost of our ability, to bear our
						share of the necessary burden of taxation, we demand equal distribution
						between person and property, and that careful provision be made in the State
						Constitution, and Legislatures hereafter assembled under its provisions, to
						prevent absolutely, and forever, the payment, by taxation, directly or
						indirectly, or any debt contracted by any State, or Corporation, for the
						support of the late Confederacy, or the armies thereof.</p>
					<p>6th. That, believing ignorance to be, the fruitful parent of crime, wrong and
						discord, we demand extraordinary State provision for the free education of
						the young of all classes.</p>
					<p>7th. That we deprecate the attempt, wherever or however made, to deter us
						from the free and untrammeled exercise of the franchise, and look with
						contempt upon any who are willing to sell this dear bought right for "a mess
						of pottage."</p>
					<p>8th That; believing we ask no more than justice and safety demand, we pledge
						ourselves to support, by our votes, men committed to the principles set
						forth herein, and no others-and firmly realizing that union is strength, we
						will lay aside all private dissensions, and unite as one man in support of
						those candidates whose nominations are ratified at mass meetings, to be held
						at the call of the Executive Committee.</p>
					<p>On motion, an Executive Committee was appointed, with power to fill
						vacancies, and it was made part of the duties to wait upon General Echols,
						and other prominent citizens, and request them to address the freedmen at
						such time and places as may be convenient. Delegates were also appointed to
						the Convention to meet at Richmond, April 17th. Rev. N. C. Brackett,
						Superintendent of the Freedmen's Schools, and Philip Roselle, (colored),
						were chosen delegates to said Constitution.</p>
