<b>Christmas Greeting</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Though, before the dawn of to-morrow's Christmas morn will purple the Eastern
                        sky, the Editor of this journal will be "o'er the mountains and far away,"
                        yet, through its columns, he takes great pleasure in tendering its many
                        generous readers the kindly and friendly compliments of the season-wishing each and all a "merry Christmas and a happy new
                            Year." For forty-five years this
                        journal has expressed its kindly greetings to its numerous readers.-No paper
                        has better reasons for expressing kindly feelings for expressing kindly
                        feelings for its readers, for none has a list of better subscribers. We hope
                        that they will live to enjoy many years of health, peace, happiness and
                        prosperity, and that their cares and troubles may diminish as their years
                        increase. Could our wishes be granted, the ears of the readers of this
                        journal would be greeted for many years more with that grand Christmas
                        anthem, which, "on Christmas day, beginning at Jerusalem in the Church of
                        the Sepulchre of our Lord, has traveled with the star that stood above his
                        cradle, from region to region, from communion to communion, and from tongue
                        to tongue, till it has compassed the land and sea, and returned to melt away
                        upon the sides of Mount Zion."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>With the Norfolk Virginian, we feel that "the
                        supreme duty of the hour is to preserve the public liberties. This is no
                        empty phrase, no idle declaration. It means escape from negro rule based on
                        the arrogant assumption that the true white men of the South have no rights
                        which need be respected. It means escape from ruinous taxes, disqualifying
                        oaths, negro police, proscription in trade as well as in politics, equal (?)
                        seats in public schools, hotels, theatres, public vehicles, and churches.
                        The public liberties, then, include a great deal, fellow-citizens, and the
                        man who fails to understand this truth is indeed sanguine, or insane. We beg
                        you to run over the list of taxes, oaths and other cruel oppressions which
                        the people of West Virginia and Tennessee groan under. In the latter State,
                        the negroes, after having taken on several occasions, forcible possession of
                        the trains, have just been authorized by law to ride with white people in
                        all public conveyances. Now, when the scum of population, the low whites and
                        the ignorant blacks get possession of the Legislature, what earthly chance
                        could there be for a decent citizen to escape their oppression? There can be
                        but one answer to this.-A white man or conservative negro would find himself
                        the object at once of plunder and oppression. We all admit this. We all feel
                        this. Hence we say that the supreme duty of the hour is for us to preserve
                        the public liberties.</p>

                        barrels of flour were inspected by B. F. Fifer, Flour Inspector for the town
