                    <p>MR. EDITOR:--I send you a part of a spirited paper, the "West and South,"
                        published in Cincinnati, Ohio, and a strong advocate of the rights of the
                        State. We cannot expect, even an approach to liberty or to our conditions as
                        it was under our Constitution thirty years ago, until the doctrine of States
                        rights is fully recognized and acted upon in conducting the affairs of
                        Government. I send an article from the pen of Agassiz, the celebrated
                        savant, in which he demonstrates that the negro, now our
                            superior, as rulers construe the principles of our government and
                        carry them out, is as distinct in his bones, blood,
                            &amp;c. from as that which exists between the horse and the
                        ass-or eagle and the owl. Who can study this subject and doubt for one
                        moment that the Maker of us all did not intend the race to be subservient too and the slave of the white man? Ye this is only a subject to amuse ourselves
                        with now. Jocho has changed places with his master, the
                            organ grinder. </p>
                    <p>CUDJOE. <br><br> ----- </p>
                    <p>The Races.</p>
                    <p>In a recent lecture delivered by Prof. Agassiz, that gentleman took the
                        following position in regard to the white and black races:</p>
                    <p>"I have pointed out over a hundred specific differences between the bonal and
                        nervous systems of the white man and negro. Indeed, their frames are alike
                        in no particular. There is not a bone in the negro's body which is
                        relatively the same shape, size, articulation, or chemically of the same
                        composition as that of the white man. Even the negro's blood is chemically a
                        very different fluid from that which courses in the veins of the white man.
                        The whole physical organism of the negro differs quite as much from the
                        man's as it does from that of the chimpanzee-that is, in his bones, muscles,
                        nerves and fibers, the chimpanzee has not much further to progress to become
                        a negro, than a negro has to become a white man. This fact science
                        inexorably demonstrates. * *</p>
                    <p>"Climate has no more to do with the difference between the white man and
                        negro than it has between that of the negro and the chimpanzee, or than it
                        has between the horse and ass, or the eagle and the owl. Each is a distinct
                        and separate creation. The negro and the white man were created as
                        specifically different as the owl and the eagle. They were designed to fill
                        different places in the system of nature. The negro is no more a negro by
                        accident or misfortune that the owl is the kind of bird it is by accident or
                        misfortune. The negro is no more the white man's brother than the owl is the
                        sister of the eagle, or than the ass is the brother of the horse. How
                        stupendous and how simply, is the doctrine that the Almighty Maker of the
                        Universe has created inherent species of the lower animals, to fill
                        different places and offices in the grand economy of nature!"</p>

<b>Fall In</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The white men of Virginia, says the Norfolk Virginian, have been patient until patience has almost ceased to be
                        a virtue. They have expressed again and again, publicly and privately, their
                        desire to live in peace and amity with the freedmen of the State. But all in
                        vain. The large majority of the colored population have net all their
                        expressions of good-will, all their kindly overtures, all their concessions
                        with insult and disdain. We have occupied the positions of the man who,
                        finding himself surrounded by enemies, holds out an olive branch in hopes of
                        pacifying their anger by the mere sight of the symbol of peace. Goaded by
                        the white malignants who have made use of them as ready tools, and wild with
                        the freedom so suddenly thrust upon them, the negroes of the South with some
                        honorable exceptions, are deaf to the voice of reason. They have
                        misunderstood the sentiments of the whites; they have mistaken forbearance
                        for fear; silence for terror. It is high time that they should be undeceived
                        on a matter in which deception is criminal alike to them and to ourselves.
                        It is high time that the white men speak out and let these negroes and their
                        factious leaders know that they are not the masters of the situation. We
                        have the mastery of the field, if we will but stretch out our hands and take
                        it. The-hand-around-the-hat party have concentrated the negroes for their
                        own uses. To meet this the white men of Virginia must concentrate, and
                        concentrated they will present a phalanx of patriotism, intelligence and
                        influence that will crush to imponderable dust the amalgamated masses of
                        factious men that disturb our State. Some of our colored population are
                        still at heart the friends of law and order; and if an opportunity is given
                        them, they will gladly escape from anarchy and agrarianism to an
                        organization sufficiently strong to guarantee them protection. But whatever
                        course they may take, ours is clear. We are strong enough of ourselves if we
                        will be either undertake nor overrate our strength. </p>
                    <p>The Anglo-Saxon must awake, the white man must be up an doing. We must number
                        our force; we must see that there are no stragglers, that every man is at
                        his post-and answers to his name when the roll is called. To all who value
                        their property, their persons, their liberties, their lives, we say, "FALL

<b>Interesting Church Case</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Details a case currently before the Circuit Court involving the local

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We had in our Circuit Court last week a case which excited a good deal of
                        attention and interest. The Methodist Congregation of Staunton, worshipping
                        in the Church property which they have occupied for over fifty years,
                        recently took a vote under the act of the last Legislature to determine to
                        which branch of the Church they would for the future belong. It appeared
                        that there were 118 persons entitled to vote, of whom 101 voted to adhere to
                        the Methodist Church South, and the other 17 either failed or refused to
                        vote.</p>
                    <p>This action of the congregation was reported to the Circuit Court to be
                        entered upon the record as the law requires.</p>
                    <p>When the papers were presented in Court by Col. Baldwin as counsel for the
                        congregation, he was met by Mr. Woodson, of Harrisonburg, and Major Bell, of
                        Staunton, who offered a petition or remonstrance signed by Rev. Conser, who
                        claims to be the preacher in charge of the true Methodist congregation at
                        Staunton, but who seems to be without a flock,, and by Rev. Lawson, a
                        colored preacher who has charge of the large colored congregation
                        worshipping at their own Church in Staunton. The petition was also signed by
                        five other persons of whom Mrs. Rachael Phelps, the mother of the Presiding
                        Elder of the northern branch of the Church is the representative of Rev.
                        Conser's party, and A. Shoveller, P. Rozelle, P. Ransom and D. Davenport are
                        colored men well known in Staunton and belonging to the flock of Rev.
                        Lawson. These petitioners objected-</p>
                    <p>1. That the Methodist Church in Staunton is built upon a lot which was
                        conveyed for the use of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and that it belongs
                        to right of the members of that Church.</p>
                    <p>2. That the congregation now in possession of the Church do not belong to the
                        Methodist Episcopal Church-but have resolved to go with the Methodist Church
                        South, and consequently have lost their right to the property.</p>
                    <p>3. That the petitioners and others, belonging to the two congregations
                        represented by them, are the true members of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
                        and as such are entitled to the Church property and</p>
                    <p>4. That the act of the Legislature under which the proceedings have been had
                        is unconstitutional and void, and the whole movement without validity, and
                        the papers relating to it ought not to be admitted to record.</p>
                    <p>For the congregation it was replied:</p>
                    <p>1. That the title to the Church property could not be tried in this
                        proceeding, except so far as this congregation has a right to it, and that
                        if others claim an adverse right they must sue for it in regular form.</p>
                    <p>2. That the object of the law of the last legislature was to protect local religious congregations who when their Church
                        divided were compelled to make choice between the different branches of it,
                        and to allow them in such cases to take their property with them, and that
                        it was the purpose of this congregation to claim the benefit of that
                        protection. </p>
                    <p>3. That the petitioners, while they claim to be Methodists, do not pretend to
                        belong to this congregation, and of course have no right to interfere with a
                        proceeding which concerns this congregation alone and cannot effect the
                        rights of any other parties, and that the law of Virginia recognizes only
                            "religious congregations," each of which is,
                        under the law, district from all others, even of the same Church. </p>
                    <p>4. That in this proceeding the Court will confine its inquirers to the
                        regularity and fairness of the steps taken to ascertain the determination of
                        the congregation, and will hear no objection which is not founded upon some
                        suggestion that by reason of fraud, accident or mistake the vote has not
                        been correctly taken or reported.</p>
                    <p>5. That the Court will not undertake to pass upon the constitutionality of
                        the law until the question is distinctly presented in an issue fairly made
                        between proper parties-so that a decision will end the controversy.</p>
                    <p>The discussion took a wide range upon all the points and upon the issues
                        hereafter to arise out of the subject-but the Court refused to entertain the
                        objections of the Petitioners upon the ground that they did not claim to be
                        members of the congregation whose action they opposed, and that in this
                        proceeding the only legitimate inquiry is as to the regularity and fairness
                        of the congregational vote according to the provisions of the act of
                        Assembly.</p>
                    <p>The papers being found regular were ordered to be entered on the minutes.</p>
                    <p>We are not informed whether the controversy is likely to be prosecuted
                        farther-but we have heard that there is some talk of claiming the church for
                        the negroes, on the ground that they constituted a majority of the
                        congregation and that they were unlawfully, and against their consent turned
                        out of the congregation and ejected from the Church. On the other hand it is
                        stated, and we think truly, that as soon as the war closed the negroes of
                        their own choice separated from the white people in their religious
                        matters-withdrew from the congregations to which they had been attached, and
                        formed two new congregations under their own preachers. Certain it is that
                        for two years past the worship of the two races in our town has been
                        entirely separate, and we have been under the impression that the separation
                        was not only voluntary, but in perfect good will, and that the white people
                        contributed freely toward building churches for the negro congregations.</p>
                    <p>Some of the questions presented in the argument of this case, and in the
                        opinion of the Court, are of grave importance, and of general interest,
                        involving not only large amounts of Church property, but principles much
                        cherished by our people.</p>
                    <p>The law of Virginia, while it refuses to recognize churches as property holders, allows a local "religious congregations" to hold such property as
                        may be necessary "as a place for a public worship, or as
                            a burial place, or a residence for a minister," and the recent
                        legislation has been intended to secure to the local congregations the right
                        not only to select their Church connections in time of Church divisions, but
                        to take with their pastors, their altars and their dead. The time has hardly
                        yet come when such a privilege will be denied them.-That a church which has

                    <p>We are willing, says the Lynchburg Virginian, to
                        let everybody "vote as he will;" but if colored men who are inveigled into
                        Union leagues, so-called, and other secret political societies, for the
                        purpose of controlling their individual will and consolidating their vote
                        for the Radical party against the white people of the South, choose to be
                        used for such a purpose, we should allow them the freedom of seeking
                        employment of their radical friends at the North. This is the sort of
                        freedom that now exists there and is sanctioned by Congress. No man, even
                        though he may have fought gallantly through the late war, in the Federal
                        army, can escape the ruthless proscription of that party in Congress, if he
                        is not of it, or dares to be conservative. The rule should hold good against
                        Radicalism as well as in its favor. Having set the example, we do not see
                        how they could object to the inauguration of this policy South. We will not
                        persecute any man for his mere opinions; but, in politics, we should do as
                        the Radicals are now doing,--dispense favors to our friends, or, at least,
                        to those who are not our enemies. We want peace, concord and a restored
                        Union. If our views had prevailed in 1860, there would have been no
                        secession, no war, and , we honestly believe, no Republican party, worth the
                        name, to-day. But, all these evils have come upon us, and we propose to
                        remove the effect of them, so far as that may be possible, by removing the
                        greatest impediment to a restored Union-the Radical party.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a recent social gathering a young lady informed me that she never sewed!
                        What do you suppose was the nature of my reflections on hearing that
                        declaration? I said to myself, either that girl speaks falsely, or else she
                        is very lazy. Never sews! Who then, I queried, make your dresses and cloaks,
                        your skirts and bow? Who repairs the rips in your pretty gaiter-boots and
                        darns the holes in your stockings? Is it your aged mother, or your more
                        industrious sister? Or do you hire all your sewing done? Should this last
                        supposition be the case, may you never marry! And the chances are you never
                        will. Not one young man in a hundred can afford to marry a woman who
                        habitually neglects household duties. Young man, if it should ever be your
                        fortune to hear a woman declare that she never sews, beware, shun her as you
                        would the chills and fever. Be insane enough to make such an one your wife,
                        and before the honeymoon is over the horrors of button-less shirts and
                        heelless hose will be upon you; your fair lady's sewing would be done by
                        others, while she moped in idleness, or rioted in fashionable dissipation.
                        Then farewell to your dreams of domestic felicity; they would fade as summer
                        flowers at the touch of frost. I have repeatedly heard ladies, educated and
                        intelligent ladies, declare with actual pride, their ignorance of the art of
                        cooking. "They could not make a cup of coffee to save their lives; and as to
                        making a loaf of good bread or cooking a simple dinner, that is out of their
                        power. Poor miserable unfortunates! Doubtless, mothers are much to blame for
                        thus neglecting their daughters' education, but surely there is no sensible
                        girl who could not, by the exercise of a little energy, perfect herself in
                        this most needful branch of domestic knowledge. False pride, in almost every
                        case, is the only barrier in the way.</p>
                    <p>It is not considered "genteel"-how I abominate that word!-to do anything
                        useful, and a fashionable Miss would consider herself disgraced should she
                        be seen with her hands in the dough, or caught in the act of sweeping a
                        room. If a young lady of the present day can thump the piano, use a few
                        French phrases, dance, flirt, and do nothing generally, her education is
                        accomplished-she is considered "finished."-Aunt Susie.</p>
