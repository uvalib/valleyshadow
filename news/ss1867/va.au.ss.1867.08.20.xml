                    <p>There is nothing more certain than that, under the negro rule which the
                        radicals have imposed upon the Southern States, the white people will be
                        compelled to leave, and that ere long the whole Southern portion of our
                        country will be a vast negro province. Ex-Governor Perry, of South Carolina,
                        in a late letter, truthfully and forcibly says "it is idle folly to tell the
                        people of South Carolina that capital and immigration will flow into the
                        State when reconstructed on the Black Republican platform.-On the contrary,
                        as soon as this negro government is organized, every dollar of foreign
                        capital South Carolina will be withdrawn, and not one cent will come here
                        seeking investment. Nor will any foreigners move here to settle, under negro
                        rule, and the confusion and disturbance which it will give rise to in the
                        State. Mr. Calhoun predicted, years ago, that if the negro was set free the
                        northern people would insist on his right o suffrage, and, if allowed, the
                        negroes would seize the government and the white people would have to leave
                        the State."</p>

                <origin>New York Herald</origin>
                <commentary>"One of the most striking and significant articles that we have seen in
                    the political weather cock, the New York Herald, for a long time, appears in its
                    issue of Friday last. It is a leading editorial on the Johnson-Stanton
                    imbroglio, commencing as follows:"</commentary>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>"The rupture between President Johnson and the refractory and defiant
                        Secretary of War, considered in connection with recent events and
                        developments bearing upon Southern reconstruction, brings forward the new
                        issue of Southern negro supremacy into bold relief. It is morally certain
                        that the stringent anti-rebel and universal negro suffrage policy of
                        reconstruction now pursued in the South the ten excluded States will be
                        reorganized and reinstated in Congress by the predominant negro vote. Let us
                        see what is the inevitable drift of this business, as now progressing, from
                        the facts and figures before us."</p>
                    <p>The Herald then figures up a victory for the new voters with their few white
                        allies, in every Southern State. Evidently alarmed at the portentous display
                        of its own figures, it submits the following:</p>
                    <p>"Thus it appears from the developments and all the evidence before us
                        touching the reconstruction programme of Congress, that if carried out
                        according to the laws as applied by Secretary Stanton and the present
                        commanders of the five military districts, the whole ten of the States
                        involved in this ordeal will be at the mercy of the blacks. We are called,
                        then, to meet the question of the probable consequences of this negro
                        supremacy. The return of twenty, thirty, or forty colored Senators and
                        Representatives to Congress is but an item among the results which may be
                        reasonably anticipated.-The consequences of negro ascendancy in the
                        Legislature of this or that State are most to be feared when we consider the
                        unsettled balances as slaves which these Southern blacks will be apt to
                        enforce against their late white masters. Some very significant hints in
                        this direction have already been thrown out in the resolutions of the negro
                        reconstruction meetings of South Carolina. We know, too, that those Northern
                        white radical stumpers in the South who have most broadly suggested the
                        possible application from Congress of 'Old Thad Steven's' panacea of
                        confiscation have excited the liveliest enthusiasm among the blacks. Is it
                        any wonder, then, that Ex- Gov. Perry, of South Carolina, and other leading
                        Southern men counsel the policy of quiet submission to their present
                        military government indefinitely as preferable to this reconstruction and
                        restoration scheme, which will place the State absolutely under the control
                        of the blacks? Do we not also perceive that in this matter there is an
                        opening for a decisive political diversion on the part of President Johnson
                        in his execution of these reconstruction laws in the interval to the next
                        meeting of Congress?</p>
                    <p>"Granting that the Northern States are prepared for the recognition and
                        acceptance of equal suffrage to the blacks, is New York, or is Pennsylvania,
                        or is Ohio prepared for the full-blown experiment of negro supremacy in ten
                        Southern States, as contemplated by republican radicals in Southern
                        reconstruction? Assuming that if, with a conservative acting Secretary of
                        War, in the place of Stanton, and with five military commanders of Mr.
                        Johnson's way of thinking in the places of the five commanders who think and
                        act according to the gospel of Mr. Stanton-assuming that the result will be
                        to delay the work of Southern restoration for even two or three years-will
                        this not be wiser than to rush headlong into this danger of Southern negro
                        supremacy? Will not the inevitable tendency of negro supremacy in South
                        Carolina, for example, be to drive out the white population or to
                        precipitate that war of races which, if commenced, will be apt speedily to
                        ripen into a war on both sides of indiscriminate extermination? Will social
                        harmony or peace, or financial confidence, or active and systematic industry
                        ever be restored in the South under the threatening danger of negro
                        supremacy?</p>
                    <p>"We cannot answer these questions truly without recognizing the sagacity and
                        wisdom of President Johnson's policy of giving to the Southern whites as far
                        as possible under the terms of Congress a chance to recover their lost
                        ground, and to take the lead in Southern reconstruction. We are, indeed, so
                        far impressed with the idea that in this view of the question he stands in a
                        strong position that we feel bound to advise him to make the most of his
                        opportunity in bringing the issue before the people of the Northern States
                        for their 'sober second thought' upon it in the coming fall elections. There
                        is no security, and there are a thousand dangers, in the radical programme,
                        which now distinctly foreshadows the placing of the elate governing whites
                        of the South under the political control and subject to the caprices and
                        revenges of the black race, relieved but yesterday from the moral darkness,
                        oppression, wrongs and disabilities of African slavery.-These dangers are so
                        menacing that they must be appreciated by thinking Northern men.-We hold,
                        accordingly, that the time at last has come for a Northern reaction, and,
                        the time, therefore, for decisive measures on the part of President
                        Johnson."</p>
                    <p>There is food for thought in the above.</p>

                        astronomical problems, it would not have been a more insane proceeding than
                        that of this great American people insisting upon bodies of ignorant negroes
                        co-operating with them in reconstructing this magnificent Republic, and

                        folly, and then comes the melancholy conclusion that if free governments are
