                <transcript>
                    <p>No philanthropist can philosophize upon the past, present and future of the
                        Negro without feelings of anxiety as to his fate. While the negro was in a
                        state of slavery, interest, if no higher motive, prompted his owner to care
                        for his health and well-being. Waving here the abstract question of the
                            <emph rend="italic">right </emph> to hold him in this condition, we
                        assert that the negro, while held in slavery, was a careless and happy
                        being. He had not thought or care for the future. His master fed and clothed
                        him; nursed him when he was sick and looked after his welfare generally.
                        While in this condition, the increase of the black population was in greater
                        ratio than the white. </p>
                    <p>Gen. Howard, Chief of the Freedmen's Bureau, who ought to know the facts has
                        recently published a statement, in which he says, that since the
                        commencement of the war, the negroes have decreased in numbers one million
                        three hundred thousand. This may seem a startling fact, and no doubt the
                        war, and the peculiar position of the negro, may have contributed in some
                        degree to this result. But without either of these agencies, that the
                        negroes, in their present condition, should diminish in numbers, is only in
                        accordance with all history in reference to that subject. All the facts we
                        have in the premises go conclusively to show, that <emph rend="italic">two
                            different races cannot live together upon the terms of equality</emph>.
                        One or the other will fade away and become extinct. </p>
                    <p>When white settlements were first planted upon our Northern shores, it was
                        estimated that in New England there were three hundred thousand Indians. All
                        that are now left of them are about two hundred of the Penobscot tribe at
                        Old Town in Maine, and a small remnant of the Stockbridge tribe in
                        Massachusetts. What has become of them? They have not emigrated. Neither
                        war, pestilence nor famine has done the work. Nor were the Indians reduced
                        to slavery.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, the noble and pious Elliott spent his life in the attempt to
                        Christianize and civilize them. But with all the fostering care of the
                        whites, and their efforts to elevate the Indian to a social equality with
                        themselves, by an inevitable law, inherent in the nature of things, they
                        have faded away before the progress of civilization like dew before the
                        rising sun. Their fate in New England is but a presage of their fate all
                        over the continent. Already have they passed away from the Great Valley of
                        the Mississippi, and are found only beyond the pale of civilization in our
                        Western wilds, an soon they will be known only history.</p>
                    <p>Less than a hundred years ago Capt. Cook discovered the Sandwich Islands. At
                        that time he estimated that the number of inhabitants at four hundred
                        thousand. A recent estimation makes their number at this time less than
                        eighty thousand. These natives were found so docile and tractable that it
                        was supposed they could easily be Christianized, civilized and elevated to a
                        point of social equality with the whites who settled amongst them, and
                        extermination is the result-in a few years not a native will be found upon
                        those islands. In both these cases the people than have become extinct were
                        the natives of the soil, while the negro is but an exotic on this continent.
                        We do not mention this latter fact to prove that the whites will become
                        extinct and the negroes remain. On the contrary, it is always the inferior
                        race that passes away before the superior; and certainly the facts and
                        history both show that the negro is the inferior race, and consequently must
                        become extinct; for, if the Indian and Sandwich Islander could not sustain
                        themselves on their native soil against the superior race who invaded them,
                        can the negro sustain himself in a country which is his only by adoption?
                        Then the fate of the negro is surely read in the history of the races which
                        we have cited. Slowly and gradually he must fade away, and become extinct on
                        this continent.</p>
                    <p>Between the African and the Caucasian, the Creator has, for some wise
                        purpose, erected a barrier as impassable as the gulf between the righteous
                        and the wicked, and all the puerile efforts of puny men can no more overcome
                        the former than the latter. Until they can change the color of the African's
                        skin, and make a white man out of a negro, they cannot elevate the negro to
                        a moral, social and political equality of the whites. The attempt to do so
                        has always failed and always will fail; and not only will it prove a
                        failure, but it will result in the extermination of the negro. To attempt to
                        give him this equality dooms him to death.-<emph rend="italic">Dover (N. H.)

                <transcript>
                    <p>The cotton and sugar lands of the South are among the finest fields for
                        enterprising settlers in the world. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi,
                        Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina cover some 300,00 square miles, an
                        area as large as France and Great Britain. They have a population of about
                        four and a half millions. France and England have a population of sixty
                        millions. The country, it thus appears has about one-thirteenth of the
                        population it can maintain. There is room for fifty-odd millions of people
                        in South Carolina and on the Gulf.</p>
                    <p>But it is developed that this magnificent empire is to be placed under the
                        political control of some two and a quarter millions of negroes. They have
                        under the operation of the late acts of Congress, become the heirs and
                        occupiers of all this territory. They will legislate for it, and governor
                        it. The white man will live there by sufferance. They can elect the
                        Governor, the Legislature, the judiciary, the magistracy, the sheriffs, the
                        clerks, and all the State and many of the county officials.</p>
                    <p>Now the question arises, who is going to move into such a community? What
                        young man from the North, wishing to seek his fortune, is going to settle in
                        New Orleans, to be governed by a negro mayor and a negro board of city
                        officials? What respectable laboring man in Illinois or Indiana is going to
                        drop down the Mississippi into the State of Mississippi or Alabama, to find
                        himself in a Haytien Empire?</p>
                    <p>The present law of the country amounts to a prohibition against moving from
                        the North into the South. There are narrow-minded white men in the South,
                        who say they prefer negroes to Yankees, and that they want no Northern
                        immigrants. Their views are literally realized by the working of the
                        existing laws. The Yankees are shut out from the Cotton States by a
                        blockading squadron which cannot be evaded.-There is a wall established
                        between the population of the North and the fertile fields of the South more
                        compact and impassable than the earthen rampart which Hadrian built in
                        Britain between the River Tyne and the Solway Frith, to shut out the Picts
                        and Scots.</p>
                    <p>The Ancient Britons were so annoyed by the irruptions of the Saxons from the
                        Cimbric Chersonese that they instituted an officer whom they called the
                        "Count of the Saxon Shore,' whose especial business it was to keep out the
                        invaders. Every President of a board of Registration in the South is a
                        "Count of the Saxon Shore," the result of whose labors is to keep off all
                        incomers-although they come with the spade instead of the sword.</p>
                    <p>We do not agree with our old Bourbon party that it is to our interest to keep
                        the Northern man out of the South. We believe, when he comes here, he will
                        be not only a valuable accession to our labor, but that he will become one
                        of us. We therefore want him. And we therefore want to show him that under
                        the present arrangement he is "excluded from the territories." The North
                        insisted on keeping the old territories open and free, so that Northern men
                        might go there and settle. They carried their point, as in our opinion they
                        ought to have done, for the idea of fastening slavery on the virgin soil of
                        the Republic was the great blunder and sin of the South. We have now ten
                        other territories-once Sovereign States-the finest soil in the world, and at
                        the very door of the densely populated North: shall the Northern people be
                        permitted to settle in these territories? That is the question. They have
                        the abstract right: but shall they be permitted to settle in these
                        territories? Shall they <emph rend="italic">practically </emph> enjoy and
                        exercise this privilege? </p>
                    <p>If you can make the climate unhealthy for a Northern constitution, you can
                        nullify their abstract right. If you can make it dangerous for a Northern
                        man to show himself among the elate Confederates, his abstract right is
                        nothing. If you can set up some form of civil government or some prevailing
                        religious creed which is obnoxious to him, you may still shut him out.-Or if
                        you can secure a heavy Coolie or Chinese immigration, it may disgust and
                        drive him off. <emph rend="italic">Or if you can Africanize the South-that
                            is the thing.</emph></p>
                    <p>So that, as matters stand, the white people of the Gulf States as ruined, and
                        the white people of the Northern States are prohibited from migrating to the
                        South. Universal white misery. The blacks alone rejoice. It is a saturnalia
                        for them. They do not look into the future. They harbor no anxieties. They
                        are suddenly governors, State attorneys, judges, militia generals: their
                        only thought is of the present.</p>
                    <p>It is a magnificent empire to consecrate to an idea. It is a noble race, the
                        white race of the South, to sacrifice to a Borriobeolagha experiment. It is
                        a wonderful instance of self-abnegation-that of the restless Northern man
                        giving up one-forth of the united States to two millions of negroes-to
                        practice in-when a single State or Territory would be an ample play ground.</p>
                    <p>Now, can this thing last? Is it in human nature, or common sense, to keep up
                        this aim?</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">It cannot be done</emph>. The Republican party cannot
                        violate the public sentiment of the North. It must either come down from its
                        pegs, or be supplanted. The cry may be suppressed for the occasion, but it
                        must ultimately find vent-"<emph rend="italic">This country belongs to the
                            white man!</emph>" </p>
                    <p>The colored man may live in the South in peace; he cannot live here, if he
                        institutes war on the white race. Backed up by the military power of the
                        North, he can temporarily out-vote the whites in the Gulf States, and
                        establish there negro governments; but the moment he has achieved this
                        object under the lead of short-sighted and self-seeking white adventurers,
                        his empire-and more-will be wrested from him. Then the North will feel and
                        perceive that <emph rend="italic">they </emph> too are involved in such a
                        policy; that the South, which they have claimed the right to visit and to
                        settle in, is barred against them. Then a political party will spring up by
                        an irresistible impulse-whose only platform will be, "Give us a share in the
                        rich domain of the South!" This is the inevitable issue of what is now
                        occurring in the South. </p>

                        the Governor of a great State like Virginia, and would add nothing to his
                        strength as a candidate for election for another term. The people of this
                        State would vote for him with more willingness, (or rather with less
                        unwillingness) if he were to remain at his post of duty in Richmond, and
                        would not go "stumping" over the State delivering speeches containing
                        sentiments obnoxious to the better class of its citizens, and depriving the
                        farmers of needed labor by causing the negroes to leave their work to go to
                        hear his speeches. If the people be reduced to to the straitened alternative
                        of voting for Pierpont or Hunnicutt, the majority, we suppose, will vote for
                        the former, but will feel that such preference would not imply much of a
                        compliment-being a choice of evils-not that they dislike Peirpont's views
                        the less, but that they dislike Hunnicutt's the more. </p>
                    <p>P. S.-After the above was in type, we were informed by those who heard the
                        Governor's speech here that it constituted of pointless generalities, and
                        that he did not assail here, as he did in Harrisonburg, the institutions of
                        learning in the State. He made no allusion to his allegations against the
                        clergy, or his remark in reference to General Stonewall Jackson.</p>

                <summary>Governor Peirpont spoke yesterday in the Staunton Court House. The editor
                    did not hear the speech, suspecting that it "would reflect no credit on the
                    Governor of a great State like Virginia." If the contest for Governor is between
                    Peirpont and Hunnicutt, the writer argues, most will vote for Peirpont but only
                    as "a choice of evils."</summary>

                    <p>The country is apt to run into opposite extremes on the negro question, after
                        the Radical physic has made the people sick. It does not become us to
                        inquire now into the remote and merely possible results of a conflict of
                        races and parties involving the most vital and exciting issues that ever
                        distracted a people. Whatever those consequences of agitation or collision
                        may be, we are not responsible for them, as we did not bring on the
                        hostility out of which they may arise. The issue was forced upon us in spite
                        of protest, warning and expostulation. The Radical party is accountable for
                        it, and for all the grim tragedies which may constitute the natural
                            sequel.-<emph rend="italic">Lynchburg Republican</emph>.</p>

                        Springs, and that he would return the sums borrowed as soon as he got there.
                        He did not return the money, and, we learn, did not receive a draft, and
                        failed to pay his board at the Springs. He has returned, and gone, it is

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Sunday, the 25th, about 10 o'clock, a young man was passing near G. B.
                        Stuart &amp; Co.'s mill, on South River, mounted on a small bay
                        stallion. Something in his appearance attracted the attention of Mr. G. W.
                        Peaco, who lives on Stuart's farm, and he entered into conversation with the
                        stranger. From the confused account the man gave of himself and his horse,
                        Mr. Peaco became strongly impressed with the belief that the fellow had
                        stolen the horse. After some parley, he charged him with having stolen him.
                        He at once said: "well, if you think so, you can take him," and forthwith
                        dismounted. Mr. Peaco said I will take the horse and you also, and advanced
                        upon him, whereupon the fellow drew a revolver and made a speedy retreat
                        through the bushes. Mr. Peaco being alone and without arms, hastened to his
                        house and got his gun, and summoned some of his neighbors and went in
                        pursuit, but the fellow made good his time and effected his escape, leaving
                        the horse, saddle, bridle, and a bundle of clothing in possession of Mr.
                        Peaco.</p>
                    <p>The supposed thief was a large athletic man, about 20 years of age with a
                        large scar under one of his eyes. The bundle of clothing contained a calico
                        shirt and two collars, wrapped in a red figured cotton handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>The horse is a good one, of medium size, and well formed. He seems never to
                        have been shod, though, from his mouth he appeared to be 10 or 11 years old.
                        In the course of conversation the man stated that he had come from Amherst
                        and was on his way to Staunton.</p>
                    <p>The horse and clothing are at G. B. Stuart's residence, about 3 ½ miles above
                        Waynesborough, where the owner of the horse can get him.</p>
