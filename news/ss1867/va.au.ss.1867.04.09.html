<b>A Colored Man's View of the Situation</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Includes a copy of a speech Beverly Nash recently delivered in Columbia in
					which he explained that "it is not our desire to be a discordant element in the
					community, or to unite the poor against the rich." Nash expressed his belief
					that, "in public affairs," blacks "must unite" with their "white fellow
					citizens."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We published yesterday, (says the Charleston Courier
						, a condensed report of the proceedings of a mass meeting of the
						colored people, which was held in Columbia on Monday last. For the
						edification of that class of "philanthropists" in the North, and their
						sporadic missionaries in this military district, who hug the delusion that
						the changed relations of the two classes of our people will engender
						irrepressible conflict, we take pleasure in reproducing from one of our
						Columbia exchanges a full report of the speech of Beverly Nash, a colored
						citizen, with the brief reportorial introduction as follows: "As a matter of
						curiosity, we give his speech verbatim , merely
						smoothing the rough edge, and dropping the peculiarities of accent and
						pronunciation." </p>
					<p>Fellow-Citizens-I have been taken somewhat by
						surprise, and am not prepared to say all that I want to on this occasion:
						but we know what we have come here for. We have come to celebrate the right
						of suffrage-the one thing needful to place us on a common platform as
						citizens. The question has been asked whether we are prepared for this
						condition of things or not. I do not blame our people for their doubts on
						this subject, because our former condition was calculated to make them
						doubt, but whether we are prepared or not, we are now entitled to vote under
						the recent law. I must confess that I do not like that law in all respects,
						because it disfranchises gentlemen in whom we have more confidence than
						anybody else, and forbids them to represent our country as it should be
						represented in the councils of the people. My doctrine is that every man,
						whether ignorant or not, who is compelled to pay taxes, is entitled to vote.
						It is a matter of public policy what we should be, because there is a
						discontented element in our midst, composed of the ignorant people of both
						classes, which would be greatly disturbed if they were prevented by a
						convention of the State from exercising the right to vote, and we should
						have a revolution in a tea-kettle. For the purpose of peace and quiet,
						therefore, in our State, I want to see everybody vote except the women. I
						believe, my friends and fellow-citizens, we are not prepared for this
						suffrage. But we can learn. Give a man tools, and let him commence to use
						them, and in time, he will learn a trade. So it is with voting. We may not
						understand it at the start, but in time, we shall learn to do our duty. </p>
					<p>It has been said that Calhoun was master of South Carolina, Clay the dictator
						of Kentucky, and Webster the emperor of Massachusetts.-But hereafter we are
						to vote for principles not men. And we have good men in our midst; men who
						are our friends, and have proved, by their acts, that they are the friends
						of the State. In these gentlemen we have confidence,
							until they have proved that they do not deserve it. I do not believe
							that there is a man in this district who, if you will reason with him
							about these things; will not agree with what I say. We recognize the
							Southern white man as the true friend of the black man. You see
						upon that banner the words "United we stand, divided we fall," and if you
						could see the seal of the society which that banner represents, you would
						find the white man and the black man standing with their arms locked
						together, as a type of the friendship and the union which we desire. We feel
						that the white man has not understood the black man as the black man has
						understood the white man; and if the citizens of South Carolina had all
						acted after the close of the war as these gentleman have done to-day, and
						spoken their kind sentiments as freely, our State would not regret the loss
						of twenty-thousand colored citizens, who have gone abroad because they had
						not sufficient confidence to stay. </p>
					<p>After the remarks we have heard to-day, we believe there is a better time
						coming. Twelve months ago Mr. Gibbes said: "Fellow-citizens, we are willing
						to meet you half way;" and we are glad to say that the representatives and
						public men of Richland district have done so on the present occasion. We
						feel that we are understood here, and we believe that colored me will
						hereafter enjoy the rights and privileges which now belong to their race.
							There is less prejudice here, less prejudice
							everywhere South of the Potomac against the colored man, than is North
							of it. I saw in Washington, a few days ago, men more violently
						opposed to our advancement than any gentleman here; and we knew that the
						States of New Hampshire, Ohio, and perhaps some others have refused that
						political equality which exists and has been accorded in South Carolina. It
						is our duty, therefore, to identify ourselves with this soil. Here we have
						grown from childhood to manhood. Many of us, white and black, have been
						brought up together; we love the people; we respect their honor; we know
						their worth; and I ask whether, under these circumstances, having the power
						to do so, we ought not to petition Congress to remove the disability which
						shuts out that portion of our people from the elective franchise in whom we
						have such long-tried confidence? </p>
					<p>If we are to have a convention in the State for the purpose of changing its
						constitution, let it be a convention full of intellect and power.-If the
						black man is to cast a vote, let him rest that vote upon a standard of
						ability, and not be contented to see a body of men who are not competent to
						discharge the high duties that will be required of them. We know the old
						saying, that "fools rush in where angles fear to tread." If, therefore, you
						elect ignorant men, you will have a bad constitution. Give us, then, the
						good men of the State. I would rather trust men who took
							up arms and went to the battle-field, and has come home with his
							honorable sears, believing in the justice of his cause than he who
							skulked from duty, and now claims to be a Union man[Cheers.] Such
						a one is unworthy the contempt of even a negro. I would rather trust General
						Hampton riding at the head of his column, shouting to his men to follow,
						than any man who has stayed at home, and, when his country was in danger,
						hunted for an iron-clad or rat-hole. [Cheers.] And so would you. [That's
						so."] We don't believe in those people who, since the war, have dodged
						around the corners, declaring they were "Union men." ["No, no."] When I hear
						a Southern man say he was a "Union man," I know he is a traitor. When I
						heard a Northern man say he was a Southern man during the war, I know he is
						a traitor. But when I hear a colored man say he was a Union man, I believe
						him from my heart. Whenever the telegraph announced a Southern victory the
						black man trembled; but whenever the tidings came of a northern victory we
						rejoiced, because we felt that we were that much nearer freedom.-To-day,
						thank God, we enjoy the result of that freedom. We stand before the world
						invested with a political equality with the white man.-We can vote. </p>
					<p>Hon. Edward Arthur, "sotta voce.-You are more than
						our are equals, Nash, in one sense, because we are disfranchised. </p>
					<p>The speaker.-Yes, sir, and we are not going to let the halls of Congress
						remain silent until you are permitted to vote. It is the men of your class
						and your ability who recognize our wants and whom we desire to see
						reinvested with the power of doing good. It is with the men of your class
						with whom we want to vote on the great questions of the day, and by whom we
						wish to be counseled and directed.</p>
					<p>It is not our desire to be a dis-cordant element in the community, or to
						unite the poor against the rich. We want to live together in harmony-to go
						to work and restore the lost credit of the State. As General Hampton has
						said "our destinies depend upon each other." The white man has land, the
						black man has labor, and labor is worth nothing without capital.-We must
						help to create that capital by restoring confidence, and we can only restore
						confidence by electing proper men to fill our public offices.</p>
					<p>There are said to be sixty thousand colored voters and forty thousand white
						voters in South Carolina. Look what a power you have for good or for evil.
						But, fellow citizens, be sure that you use that power with intelligence, and
						to the end that South Carolina, with which your interests are all
						identified, may enjoy the prosperity which it gives. When citizens come
						forward and meet us as gentlemen have done to-day, we have no right to doubt
						the future I look upon today as our Fourth of July. And if we do our duty,
						we shall prove ourselves worthy of the great privilege with which we have
						been invested. It is true, the majority of colored men may not be able to
						vote intelligently, but you will be educated. In the four weeks preceding
						the first election in this district you will be taught more about voting
						than the people of Ireland or England ever did know.-There never was a
						people who have gained so much as we have done. But a little while ago we
						were slaves. Now we are freemen. It has been declared that we shall have a
						voice in public affairs. In these public affairs we must unite with our
						white fellow citizens. They tell us that they have been disfranchised, yet
						we tell the North that we will never let the halls of Congress be silent
						until we remove that disability. Can we afford to lose from the councils of
						the State our first men? Can we spare judges from the bench? Can we put
						fools, or strangers in their position? No, fellow-citizens, no! Gloomy would
						be that day, indeed. We want in charge of our interests only our best and
						ablest men. And then, with a strong pull, a long pull and a pull together,
						up goes South Carolina. [Cheers.]</p>

<b>The Connecticut Election</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Finds cause for optimism in the results of recent elections in Connecticut,
					where Democrats and Conservatives won victories, and suggests that "the
					disastrous flood-tide of Radicalism has reached its height."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In the elections which took place in Connecticut, last week, the Democrats
						and Conservatives carried the State and defeated the Radicals in one of the
						most hotly contested canvasses which ever occurred in that State of "steady
						habits." The Democrats and Conservatives elected their candidates for
						Governor, and the whole State ticket save one, and three out of four of
						their candidates for Congress, which will subtract six from the Radical
						majority in Congress, as it will take three from the Radical party add three
						to the Conservative opposition. The majority for Governor was 967 and the
						majority in the elections of members of Congress was about 1800.</p>
					<p>We have entertained the belief for some time and so expressed ourselves
						through the columns of this paper, that the disastrous flood tide of
						Radicalism had reached its height, and that we might soon expect to witness
						evidences that the refluent ebb was about to take place. Our belief has been
						confirmed by all the elections which have recently taken place. The
						municipal elections in the Northern cities, the reduced Radical majority in
						the State election in New Hampshire, and the triumphant victory in
						Connecticut, all testify to the important fact that the reaction in the
						North, so devoutly wished, has truly begun most auspiciously.</p>
					<p>We would repeat the hopeful sentiment we expressed in our issue of the 19th
						ult: "The people of the South should be of good cheer-they should not yield
						to despair, for there are signs that the destructive tide of Radicalism is
						about to ebb. The Ark of the Constitution may find an [UNCLEAR] to rest upon
						sooner than we expect. We are now looking out with hope to see the return of
						the dove with the olive branch of peace."</p>
					<p>We cherish the hope that the potential voice of the great mass of the people
						will be heard proclaiming, to the surging sea of Radicalism so thickly
						strewn with wreaks of Constitutional Liberty, "thus far shalt thou go, and
						no farther!"</p>
					<p>Whilst in hers despaired, we continued to hope. Though the night was dark, we
						believed we saw a few rays of light which betokened the approach of dawn.
						That belief has been confirmed, and our hopes strengthened and we think we
						can confidently say with John Milton:</p>
					<p>"I did not err, there does a sable cloud</p>
					<p>Turn forth her silver-lining in the night."</p>
					<p>We conceive it to be true wisdom to turn our eyes from the sable folds to the
						silver lining which brightens its edge-to cease to peer painfully into the
						deep darkness and to look at the grey dawn of a more auspicious day.</p>

<b>For or Against the Convention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges readers to vote against calling a Convention to comply with the

					character" that it swept the Conservatives to victory in Connecticut.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In the election on the 1st inst., in Connecticut, which resulted in the
						defeat of the Radical party, the battle was fought, and the Conservative
						victory was won upon the issue of Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger act. This act
						is of such an outrageous character, so volatile of the Constitution and the
						principles of republicanism that a New England State, at the first election
						after its passage, stamps it was the seal of her condemnation, and yet we,
						the people of Virginia, whose rights it violates, are recommended by some of
						our own people to give our consent  to it, by
						voting for a Convention for the purpose of doing what that act thus
						unconstitutionally prescribes. </p>
					<p>Was such a spectacle ever presented before in the whole history of the world?</p>
					<p>It is left to our option to vote for or against the Convention. We are as
						much at liberty to vote against it as for it. If we are in favor of the
						provisions of that act, we should vote for the Convention; but if we are
						opposed to them, as is the case with an overwhelming majority, we should
						vote against it.</p>
					<p>The supplementary act to the Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger act submits the
						question whether we will vote for or against a Convention, to comply with
						the unconstitutional provisions of that act, to the choice of the people. At
						the polls, they will give an authoritative expression of their choice. If
						they vote for the Convention, it will be understood that they desire to
						comply with the provisions of the S. S. S. bill, for that desire will be
						thus expressed and recorded in the most potential form. Those who are

					<p>MR. EDITOR:--Will you permit me to call attention to the claims of a

					<p>The Doctor's botanical acquirements have placed at his disposal an immense

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>On Monday night, the 1st instant, Col. Bolivar Christian, delivered a lecture
						before the Staunton Lyceum to a very large and appreciative audience. For an
						hour and a half the audience. For an hour and a half the audience was deeply
						interested by the eloquence of the lecturer and the entertaining and amusing
						incidents mentioned by him illustrating the habits and customs of the early
						settlers of this Valley. His subject was the character of the people of the
						Valley of Virginia, and especially that portion of them in this part of the
						Valley who descended from the "Scotch-Irish," who, at an early period,
						settled in this portion of the Valley. He showed conclusively from their
						history that they have been distinguished for moral and physical courage.
						The former was shown by their firmness and persistence in what they believed
						to be right, and the latter by their brave conduct in their contests with
						the savage foes of the forest, and by their distinguished heroism in the
						battles of the American revolution. The conduct of the "Stonewall Brigade"
						in the recent war, composed in great part of the descendants of the class of
						citizens alluded to by the lecturer, shows that the sons are worthy and
						their patriotic and heroic sires. Their physical courage, at least, has not
						degenerated, and we do not believe that their moral courage-a much higher
						quality-has depreciated. We believe that the moral courage of the present
						generation of these people will establish that they are worthy descendants
						of their illustrious sires. Whilst the lecturer was depicting so truthfully
						and graphically the moral courage of the ancestors of our people, we
						wondered if it could be possible that they had so degenerated in moral
						courage as that they could be coerced by threats or seduced by blandishments
						to vote for a convention to yield compliance to a congressional act not only
						unconstitutional but subversive of their cherished rights-the inheritance of
						their noble ancestors. We could not then, and do not now, believe it. Credat Judaeus Apella.</p>
