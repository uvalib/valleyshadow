                    <p>We approve of the suggestion, which seems to be concurred in by all the
                        papers which have expressed an opinion upon the subject, to hold a
                        Conservative Convention in Richmond, on Wednesday, the 11th of December,
                        that a plan of campaign may be agreed upon which will ensure concert of
                        action, on the part of the Conservatives, throughout the State. The
                        Convention should be composed of the greatest and wisest men of the State.
                        We hope that a large meeting will be held here on Monday, the 25th of this
                        month, (court day), for the purpose of appointing delegates to the proposed
                        Conservative Convention, and that our ablest, wisest, and most reliable
                        citizens will be selected to represent the noble Conservatives of this great
                        country, which, at the next election, will speak in tones of thunder its
                        opposition to Radical rule and negro domination. Those who were silent in
                        the recent election will, in the next, speak the more emphatically, that
                        none may misunderstand the sentiments they entertain. They will not again
                        give the Radicals an opportunity to claim their silence as evincing sympathy
                        with Radicalism and approval of negro suffrage. If the Conservative
                        Convention adopt the policy of voting down the ratification of the
                        Constitution-as it is more than probable it will-then will the voice of
                        Augusta be heard above that of any other county in proclaiming her emphatic
                        and determined opposition to ratification. The people by that time will be
                        thoroughly aroused to a sense of their duty-if the proper organization be
                        adopted and carried into effect-and they will manfully perform it.-Stuart,
                        Baldwin and other able speakers in this county should enter the field, and
                        their eloquent voices should be heard in every neighborhood calling upon the
                        people to rally to the rescue of the State.</p>
                    <p>P. S.-After the above was in type, we received the Richmond papers containing
                        the following call issued by the Executive Committee of the Conservative
                        party of that city:</p>
                    <p>"The Executive Committee of the Conservative party in Richmond, obeying the
                        indications of the sentiments of the people of Virginia, and without any
                        intention to dictate to them, but acting because there is no recognized body
                        to provide for such a contingency, invite the people of the various counties
                        and cities to assemble in primary meetings and appoint delegates to a
                        Convention to be held in the city of Richmond, on Wednesday, the 11th of
                        December, for the purpose of effecting an organization of the Conservatives
                        of the State.</p>
                    <p>H. K. ELLYSON, Pres't.</p>
                    <p>JAS. R. BRANCH, Sec'y.</p>
                    <p>P. S.-Since the above was in type, a number of gentlemen have united in the
                        following request:</p>
                    <p>"We are requested to state that a public meeting will be held at the
                        Court-house, on the first day of November County Court, to appoint delegates
                        for Augusta to the Conservative Convention to assemble in Richmond, on the
                        11th of December next."</p>

                    <p>Is there a negro in the South so blind as not to be able now to see that he
                        has nothing, absolutely nothing, to hope from the people of the North, and
                        that he must so act as to secure and preserve the good-will of the people of
                        the South, among whom his lot for weal or woe is cast, or be left a helpless
                        outcast, denied all sympathy, kindness, employment, and protection? As the
                        vine to the trellis, or the ivy to the tower, so should he cling for support
                        to the white man of the South. The emissaries of Radicalism are actively
                        engaged in severing, one by one, the ties which mind him to his best
                        friend-the Southern white man. He should spurn their counsel, turn a deaf
                        ear to their professions of affected friendship, mistrust their sincerity,
                        leave the secret leagues into which he has been entrapped, and cling with
                        increased tenacity to those who have, in the past, shown both the ability
                        and disposition to protect, employ and kindly treat him.</p>

                    <p>Such a re-action in public sentiment as has taken place in the Northern and
                        Western States, as exhibited by the recent elections, is unprecedented.
                        These elections show that the hope of such reaction, which we have
                        entertained and expressed since the adoption by Congress of the Radical
                        scheme of reconstruction was well founded, and that, if the people of the
                        South had been enabled, by united opposition to the call of Conventions, to
                        gain more time, as we hoped they would, they would now have nothing to
                        dread-relief would certainly have reached them in time to save them from the
                        doom they have such just reason to dread. As it is, whilst we have some
                        reason to hope, our fate is still involved in doubt.</p>
                    <p>We give below the results of the recent elections which show how strongly the
                        tide is setting in against Radicalism.</p>
                    <p>NEW YORK. This State, which had a Republican majority of near 14,000, now
                        gives a Conservative majority of 40,000, being a Republican loss of 54,000.
                        To be safe we give the majority at 40,000, though the Conservative State
                        Central Committee claim that the majority is 50,000, which would make the
                        Republican loss 64,000. The General Assembly is Conservative.</p>
                    <p>MASSACHUSETTS. Even in this State which, like Ephraim, is joined to its
                        idols, the Republicans lose about 40,000. Their victory was like that of
                        Pyrrhus, and one more such would ruin them.</p>
                    <p>NEW JERSEY. This State, like New York, has left the Republican ranks, and has
                        taken its position in the ranks of the Conservative States. The
                        Conservatives carried the State by 12,000 majority, being a loss to the
                        Republicans of near 14,000. The Legislature stands as follows: Senate, 10
                        Republicans to 11 Conservatives. In the House, 15 Republicans to 30
                        Conservatives.</p>
                    <p>MARYLAND. In this State, the Conservatives elected every officer, and carried
                        the State by 40,000 majority.</p>
                    <p>There's life in the old land yet,</p>
                    <p>Maryland, my Maryland.</p>
                    <p>KANSAS. This blood-stained and wool-dyed abolition State was nearly redeemed,
                        to the utter surprise of Radicals and Conservatives, and the Constitutional
                        amendment recognizing negro suffrage is reported to have been rejected. In
                        this State female suffrage was submitted to the vote and defeated.</p>
                    <p>MINNESOTA. The reported Republican majority is about 4,000. The majority last
                        year was 10,209. Whether negro suffrage was defeated is yet in doubt.</p>
                    <p>WISCONSIN. Reported Republican majority about 5,000. Last year it was 23,000.</p>
                    <p>MICHIGAN. No returns that we have seen. We suppose it has gone Republican by
                        greatly reduced majority.</p>

                        qualified voters under the laws of the United States. The votes polled will
                        be recorded and returned in three separate classes, as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The votes of all white registered voters</p>
                    <p>2. The votes of all colored registered voters.</p>
                    <p>3. The votes of all persons who are qualified voters under the laws of

                        at large to ponder well upon this base treachery of their especial
                        guardians. They must, upon a moment's reflection, see that it is no love for
                        them, no desire to elevate their political or social standing, which has
                        here placed the ballot in their hands. Else why is it that the Radicals are
                        not actuated by the same motives to bestow the right of voting upon them in
                        the free States? It is merely that they may be used as "cat's paws," to
                        secure the luscious chestnuts of the U. S. Treasury to the hungry, greedy
                        Radical monkeys who infest its portals. It was for no other object under

                    <p>On Wednesday, the 6th instant, near Hebron church in this county, Dr. C. H.
                        Perrow, Medical Adviser of the Piedmont Life Insurance Company, was severely
                        and probably seriously hurt. His horse fell with him, and his nose was
                        broken, his lips cut, his head badly hurt-there being an indentation of the
                        frontal bone. His skillful medical attendant, Dr. Wm. S. McChesney of this
                        place, thinks there is no fracture of the skull. Dr. Perrow is at the house
                        of Mr. J. T. Mitchell where proper attention is given him.</p>

                    <p>Some weeks since Abram Shaffer, near Augusta Springs, finding that bears were
                        making depredations at night on his corn, and observing by their tracks that
                        they crossed the fence into the field at a particular spot, fixed his gun or
                        stakes and attached a wire to the trigger in such a way that, in pursuing
                        their accustomed path, they must disturb the wire. The next night he was
                        successful in killing two by one discharge, an old one and a half grown cub.
                        The latter's head was blown to pieces and fell in its track, the old one ran
                        a hundred yards and both were dead when he found them. The old one weighed
                        100 lbs. net. He has discovered continued depredations on his corn, but
                        can't find that they come into the field at one place.</p>
                    <p>Hudson Michael, in same neighborhood, carried 17 coon skins and one opossum
                        skin to the tanner, as the result several before day-excursions after the
                        varmints. It appears they are plenty. The scarcity of meat in the mountains,
                        cause the bears to be more destructive on corn and farm stock.</p>

                    <p>The Ladies' Davis Association of Mississippi, prompted by those feelings of
                        sympathy and love which suffering excites and greatness of character warms
                        into active feeling, have decided to appeal to their countrywomen in all
                        portions of Virginia, and to ask their aid in carrying out the noble design
                        of providing a home for Ex-President Davis.</p>

                        work of supererogation to address you in order to arouse your sympathy and
                        enlist your interest for the great Representative of the Southern people,
                        who sacrificed all and suffered in our stead. There is not a heart in all
                        this Southern land of ours that need be awakened to a just appreciation of
                        all that is sublimely glorious-all that is sad and mournfully touching
                        connected with that household name, which inspires more patriotic enthusiasm
                        than all the laurelled heroes of antiquity.</p>
                    <p>The ladies of every county in the State are urgently solicited to appoint
                        committees to raise contributions.</p>

                        people have drawn the line separating themselves from the white men; let us
                        see who can subsist the longest under the new order of things. We hope the
                        scheme will be pushed forward with energy, and that by Spring we may have
                        1,000 or 1,500 white laborers and voters in the county-let them be Swede,
