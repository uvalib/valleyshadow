					<p>CHILLICOTHE, Ohio, March 15th 1867.</p>
					<p>MESSRS. EDITORS:--According to the late action of the "Rump Congress,"
						Virginia is no longer Virginia. Her people are no longer the proud freemen
						who boasted of their good old State, and of her prestige and renown; but are
						slaves in a much worse condition than any who are to be found on any portion
						of the globe.-Her territory bought by our father's blood, and handed down to
						us by them for an inheritance is now united to that of the old "North
						State," and is styled, "District No. 1," to be governed by a military
						officer, invested with more power and authority than the most despotic
						monarch ever claimed. Officers who know about as much of justice as a pig,
						will have the making and executing of laws, instead of such men as Stuart,
						Baldwin, Rives and others.-</p>
					<p>It seems as if the clouds are growing darker and more gloomy over the
						Southern people.-The "Military Bill" may be but an entering wedge, to be
						followed by others much more grinding and onerous. Already you hear hints of
						a confiscation bill, which is to sweep away what little there remains of
						wealth in the South.</p>
					<p>It is certainly hard to bear all of this with meekness and resignation, but
						so we are commanded to do by the Great Ruler. If the people will look to God
						for help in their great trial and suffering, He will not cast them off. How
						appropriately can they now cry out like the Psalmist, "hide not thy face
						from me in the day when I am I trouble; incline thine ear unto me; in the
						day when I call answer me speedily."</p>
					<p>Now is the time for them to show to the world, how much superior they are to
						the fanatics who are usurping the Government. Let them and their
						Legislatures go quietly on, and take no action on the bills now being
						passed.-Negro suffrage and other radical hobbies will be forced upon them,
						but let them be silent and submit with patience, and all will yet be right.</p>
					<p>The original Constitution will be entirely done away with; the Supreme Court
						will also go by the board and lastly the President will be impeached; and it
						is to be hoped by that time they will have reached the end of their rope,
						and their ruin be effected. Enough of this however.</p>
					<p>The space you give to enigmas &amp;c., prove to be quite interesting.
						"School Girl" and "Chips" seemed to be <orig reg="sparring">sparing</orig>
						at each other, in quite a lively manner, and from indications "Chips" is
						getting the worst of it. If he will take the advice of one who has
						experienced school girl treatment, of one who, (in acting parlance,) made a
						good start, but was distanced on the "home stretch," he will quit the field
						and conclude that silence is the better part of valor. </p>
					<p>Texas must be a great State, judging from "Magnolia's letters." He has
						certainly found the great Eldorado, sought for in vain ever since the first
						Spanish Invasion. He will probably be the means of putting some of your
						young men in the notion of emigrating to so fine a country. If any should go
						it would be very judicious in them to try and find some fair damsel willing
						to become a "better half," and thus be placed in a better condition to make
						a fortune in a new country. However, that advice sounds something like
						furnishing a stick with which one's own head might be broken, for as has
						been previously remarked your marriage column is already uncomfortably long.</p>
					<p>Mrs. Lippincott, (Grace Greenwood,) one of the strong minded of her sex
						lectured in this city last evening. Her subject was, "The Heroic in common
						life." And the heroes whom she particularly praised were John Brown, Ben
						Butler, Parson Brownlow and others of such stamp. The "poor persecuted
						colored race" was also brought up from which she produced many acts of
						heroism performed by the sons of Africa. She is a firm advocate for woman's
						rights, wants to vote, and do every thing else a man does. With the
						exception of the Democrats and Conservatives her audience applauded her
						loudly. She has quite pleasing manners and a very fine address, and is well
						calculated to carry away a crowd of fanatics.-She could fill a woman's place
						better if she were at home taking care of Mr. L's household. A woman greatly
						adorns society, when she stays in the place allotted to her by the Almighty,
						but when she leaves it, she becomes one of the common herd, and should be
						regarded as such. Respectfully yours,</p>
					<p>JOHNNY REB.</p>
					<p>Our correspondent is mistaken. Va. alone constitutes military District No. 1.
						The old "North State" is in another district.</p>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>I desire Messrs. Editors, to make through your columns, a few suggestions in
						regard to the market and market laws.</p>
					<p>For some time past the market regulations of the town of Staunton have been
						hidden in some convenient corner, and were comfortably forgotten; and
						experience, in the meantime, has shown that they are not at all necessary to
						comfortable existence.</p>
					<p>If the trade in "flesh-fruit, fish, foul, butter, eggs, &amp;c.," is left
						unfettered by market ordinances it will naturally and speedily fall into the
						channels most convenient to buyer and seller, and all arbitrary regulations,
						disturbing this natural adjustment will do positive injury to both.</p>
					<p>Now, under this system of no market law which we have long enjoyed, a market
						is practically established for butter, eggs, vegetables, fruits,
						&amp;c., at every store in town, and for flesh, fish and fowl at the
						shops of our enterprising butchers, open at all hours and accessible at all
						times, where the consumer can find the articles he needs, and purchase in
						such quantities as his immediate wants require.</p>
					<p>This arrangement also increases and relieves trade, the town merchant being
						thus enabled to exchange his goods to his country customers for supplies,
						which he immediately furnishes to his customer in town-saving a large amount
						of capital and diminishing the demand for currency, at present so scarce.</p>
					<p>The consumer will universally agree, that it is a great convenience to be
						able at all hours to obtain supplies, instead of being compelled to hurry at
						day light, on market morning, to the market house, and lay in supplies for
						two or three days, incurring the risk of purchasing more than he needs, or
						being destitute should accidental circumstances increase the consumption of
						his family. The present arrangement is of great direct advantage to the
						butchers, and of indirect advantage to his customers. He can now butcher his
						supplies in exact proportion as they are demanded at his counter, and is not
						compelled to hear the risk of having dead meats left over to his loss on
						market mornings, or of having an insufficient quantity on hand to supply his
						customers, to the damage of his trade. He can thus afford to sell cheaper.</p>
					<p>The entire trade under the present arrangement is governed by the law of
						supply and demand and controlled by competition, much more equitable, to all
						parties, than the wisest market regulations.</p>
					<p>Now it is proposed by the town council after the first of April next, to put
						an entire stop to this arrangement and substitute for it the forgotten
						regulations which are re-published in the Spectator of last week. This will
						be to the great and manifest inconvenience of all concerned, and the
						question is submitted to those who have control of the matter-Whether the
						present arrangement ought not to be left alone.</p>
					<p>Yours respectfully, B.</p>

					<p>The Society met on last Saturday night, and the term for which the officers
						were elected having expired, they proceeded to the election of officers for
						the ensuing term of two months. All the old officers were re-elected, with
						the exception of that Vice President ; Mr. C. A. Richardson was elected to
						that office, and, the President being absent, presided over the
						deliberations of the society with marked ability and dignity. The officers
						are as follows: Herber Ker, President; C. A. Richardson, Vice President; C.
						Taylor, Secretary, and C. C. Wheat, Treasurer.</p>
					<p>"Which wields the greater influence-wealth or knowledge?" was discussed with
						great animation by a large number of the members present. Messrs. Herber
						Ker, C. Taylor, Fred Effinger, W. M. Chewning and C. W. Turner made speeches
						of considerable length and displayed a high degree of eloquence and oratory.
						The vote being taken it was decided in favor of "knowledge.</p>
					<p>We are happy to announce that this society is in a flourishing condition, and
						we are glad to see so much interest manifested, on the part of our young men
						, in the cultivation of their literary and oratorical talents.</p>
					<p>The question for discussion on next Saturday night is a practical one, and it
						is expected that the society will have quite a spirited and interesting
						time. The question is-"Are the young men of the South justifiable in
						emigrating?"</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>The following is a copy of the bill as it finally passed both Houses:</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">An Act supplemental to an act entitled an act to provide
							for the more efficient government Of the rebel States, passed March, 2,
							1867, and to facilitate restoration</emph>. </p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Be it enacted, &amp;c.</emph>, That before the 1st
						day of September, 1867, the commanding General in each district defined by
						an act entitled an act to provide for the more efficient government of the
						rebel States, approved March, 2, 1867, shall cause a registration to be made
						of the male citizens of the United States twenty one years of age and
						upwards, resident in each county or parish in the Stat or States included in
						his district, which registration will include only those persons who are
						qualified to vote for delegates by the act aforesaid, and who shall have
						taken subscribed the following oath or affirmation: </p>
					<p>"I, -----------, do solemnly swear or affirm, in the presence of Almighty
						God, that I am a citizen of the State of -------------; that I have resided
						in said State for ---------- months next preceding this day, and now reside
						in the county of -----------, or parish of -------, in said State, as the
						case may be; that I am twenty one years old; that I have not been
						disfranchised for participation in any rebellion, or civil war against the
						United States, nor for felony committed against the laws of any State or of
						the U. S.; that I have never been a member of any State Legislature, nor
						held any executive or judicial office in any State, and afterwards engaged
						in insurrection against the United States, and given aid or comfort to the
						enemies thereof; that I have never taken an oath, as member of Congress of
						the United States or as an officer of the United Stats, or as a member of
						any State Legislature, or as an Executive or Judicial officer of any State,
						to support the Constitution of the United States, and afterwards engaged in
						insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort
						to the enemies thereof; that I will faithfully support the Constitution and
						obey the laws of the United States, and will do the best of my ability
						encourage others so to do-so help me God."-Which oath or affirmation may be
						administered by any registering officer.</p>
					<p>Section 2. That after the completion of the registration hereby provided for
						in any State at such time and places therein as the commanding general shall
						appoint and direct of which at least thirty days' public notice shall be
						given, an election shall be held of delegates to a Convention for the
						purpose of establishing a Constitution and civil government for such State
						loyal to the Union; said Convention in each State (except Virginia) to
						consist of the same number of members as the most numerous branch of the
						State Legislature of such State in the year 1860, to be apportioned among
						the several districts, counties or parishes by such State by the commanding
						general, giving to each representation in the ratio of the voters registered
						aforesaid, as nearly as may be. The Convention in Virginia shall consist of
						the same number of members as represented in the territory now constituting
						Virginia in the most numerous branch of the Legislature, of said State in
						the year 1860, to be apportioned as aforesaid.</p>
					<p>Section 3. That at said election, the registered voters of each State shall
						vote for or against a Convention to form a Constitution therefore under this
						act. Those voting in favor of such a Convention shall have written or
						printed on the ballots by which they vote for delegates, as aforesaid, the
						words "for a Convention"; and those voting against such a convention shall
						have written or printed on such ballots the words "against a Convention."
						The persons appointed to superintend said election, and to make return of
						the votes given thereat, as herein provided, shall count and make return of
						the votes given for an against a convention; and the commanding general, to
						whom the same shall have been returned, shall ascertain and declare the
						total vote in each State for and against a convention. If a majority of the
						votes given on that question shall be for a Convention, then such Convention
						shall be held shall be held as hereinafter provided; but if a majority of
						said votes shall be against a Convention, then no such Convention shall be
						held under this act. <emph rend="italic">Provided </emph>, that such
						Convention shall not be held unless a majority of all such registered voters
						shall have voted on the question of holding such a convention. </p>
					<p>Section 4. The commanding general of each district shall appoint such loyal
						officers, or persons, as may be necessary, not exceeding three in each
						election district in any State, to make and complete the registration,
						superintend the election, and make return to him of the votes, list of
						voters, and of the persons elected as delegates by a plurality of the votes
						cast at said election; and upon receiving said returns, he shall open the
						same, ascertain the persons elected as delegates according to the returns of
						the officers who conducted said election, and make proclamation thereof; and
						if a majority of the votes given on that question shall be for a convention,
						the commanding general, within sixty days from the date of election, shall
						notify the delegates to assemble in Convention at a time and place to be
						mentioned in the notification; and said convention, when organized shall
						proceed to frame a Constitution and civil government according to the
						provisions of this government according to the provisions of this act and
						the act to which it is supplementary, and when the same shall have been so
						framed, said constitution shall be submitted by the Convention for
						ratification to the persons registered under the provisions of this act, at
						an election to be conducted by the officers or persons appointed by the
						commanding general as hereinbefore provided, and to be held after the
						expiration of thirty days from date of notice thereof, to be given by said
						Convention; and the returns thereof shall be made to the commanding general
						of the district.</p>
					<p>Section 5. That if, according to said returns, the Constitution shall be
						ratified by a majority of votes of the registered electors qualified as
						herein specified, cast at said election, at least one-half of all the
						registered voters voting upon the question of such ratification, the
						President of the Convention shall transmit a copy of the same, duly
						certified, to the President of the United States, who shall forthwith
						transmit the same to Congress, if then in session, and if not in session,
						then immediately upon its next assembling; and if it shall moreover appear
						to Congress that the election was one at which all the registered and
						qualified electors in the State had an opportunity to vote freely and
						without restraint, fear, or the influence of fraud, and if Congress shall be
						satisfied that such constitution meets the approval of a majority of the
						qualified electors in the State, and if the said constitution shall be
						declared by Congress to be in conformity with the provisions of the act to
						which this is supplementary, and the other provisions of said act shall have
						been complied with, and the said Constitution shall be approved by Congress,
						the State shall be declared entitled to representation, and Senators and
						Representatives shall be admitted therefrom as therein provided.</p>
					<p>Section 6. All elections in the States mentioned in the said "act to provide
						the more efficient government of the rebel States" shall, during the
						operation, of said act, be by ballot; and all officers making the said
						registration of voters and conducting elections shall, before entering upon
						the discharge of their duties, subscribe an oath faithfully to perform the
						duties of their sad office, and the oath prescribed by act approved July 2,
						1862, entitled "an act to prescribe an oath of office": <emph rend="italic"
							>Provided </emph>, That if any person shall knowingly and falsely take
						and subscribe any oath in this act prescribed, such person so offending, and
						being thereof duly convicted, shall be subject to the pains, penalties, and
						disabilities which by law are provided for the punishment of the crime of
						willful and corrupt perjury. </p>
					<p>Section 7. That all expenses incurred by several commanding generals, or by
						virtue of any orders issued, or appointments made by them under or by virtue
						of this act, shall be paid out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise
						appropriated.</p>
					<p>Section 8. That the Convention for each State shall prescribe the fees,
						salary, and compensation to be paid to all delegates, and other officers and
						agents herein authorized or necessary to carry into effect the purposes of
						this act not herein otherwise provided for, and shall provide for the levy
						and collection of such taxes on the property in such State as may be
						necessary to pay the same.</p>
					<p>Section 9. That the word "article" in the sixth section of the act to which
						this is supplementary, shall be construed to mean "section."</p>
