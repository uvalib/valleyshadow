<b>Riots in the South</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that riots have recently occurred in Mobile, Alabama, and
                    Brownsville, Tennessee, and attributes them to "Radical incendiaries" whose
                    "object is to excite our people to tumults and riots, and thus justify harsher
                    legislation than any which has yet characterized Congress."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The teachings of the Radicals who have been addressing the negroes in various
                        parts of the South are beginning to bear their fruits, and the spirit of
                        lawlessness prevails wherever they have appeared. In Mobile, Ala., on
                        Tuesday last; whilst the Radical Judge Kelly was speaking, three men were
                        killed-one white and two negroes. A number were wounded, among them one
                        policeman. A large majority of the shots were fired by negroes, but few of
                        the whites present were armed. On Monday, the day before the riot at Mobile,
                        a serious riot also occurred at Brownsville, Tennessee. Three negroes and
                        two white men were shot, but none fatally.</p>
                    <p>If the Radical incendiaries be permitted to continue their inflammatory
                        appeals to the negroes, we may expect to hear of serious riots in all parts
                        of the South. These speakers are leading the negroes to their doom.</p>
                    <p>The Richmond Times  says that the "professional
                        agitators have been left almost without pretext for agitation, and the
                        unscrupulous leaders of the extreme Radicals have been filled with dismay at
                        the indications of the decadence of their power. As these malignant enemies
                        of peace and order must perish with the base passions which have given them
                        strength, it is perfectly evident that they have determined to goad the
                        people of the South to deeds of folly or violence by turning loose their
                        most vituperative and incendiary orators in our midst.-Their object is to excite our people to tumults and riots, and thus
                            justify harsher legislation than any which has yet characterized
                            Congress. This is the evident object of Kelly's mission, and it
                        is most deeply to be regretted that he has been to some extent successful in
                        Mobile. </p>
                    <p>These riots do us incalculable damage, and his African Church speech, Mr.
                        Greeley admitted that the great Radical triumph of 1866 was mainly due to
                        the New Orleans and Memphis riots.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Sunday School Union of this place held a most interesting session in the
                        Methodist Church on Sunday afternoon last, at 3 Â½ o'clock. A large number of
                        the Episcopal brethren, who were here in attendance on the Council, were
                        present an delivered interesting addresses on the subject of Sunday Schools.
                        The Rev. Geo. B. Taylor presided and introduced the speakers. The order of
                        exercises were as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Opening Hymn-Lovely Land, sung by all the
                        Schools. </p>
                    <p>2. Prayer by Rev. Mr. Curtis,</p>
                    <p>3. hymn-Hosanna, sung by all the schools. </p>
                    <p>4. Address, by Rev. C. J. Gibson, of Hanover county.</p>
                    <p>5. Hymn-Rose of Sharon Schools. </p>
                    <p>6. Address, by Rev. Mr. Dashiel, of Richmond.</p>
                    <p>7. Hymn-O won't you be a Christian while you're
                        young? </p>
                    <p>8. Address, by Rev. Dr. Andrews, of Shepherdstown.</p>
                    <p>9. Hymn-Sunday School Battle Song-Schools. </p>
                    <p>10. Benediction, by Rev. Jas. McKabe, of Md.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Gibson's address was on the great importance of bringing children
                        unto Christ through the means of Sabbath Schools. His remarks were addressed
                        principally to the Officers, Teachers and Parents of children, and were both
                        interesting and instructive.</p>
                    <p>Rev. T. G. Dashiel's address was directed exclusively to the children and was
                        amusing and entertaining to both young and old.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Dr. Andrew's address was condemnatory of the light and trifling Sunday
                        School literature of the present day, and recommendatory of a more general
                        use of the Sacred Scriptures alone in our Sabbath Schools.</p>
                    <p>The next meeting of the Society will be held in June next, at which time
                        there will be an election of officers for the ensuing year. It is hoped that
                        all the schools will interest themselves in this organization and unite in
                        the effort to advance the cause of Sunday schools. Due notice of the time
                        and place of the next meeting will be given.</p>
