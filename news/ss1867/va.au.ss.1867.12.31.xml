                    <p>Ere this issue of the Spectator will have reached many of its patrons, the
                        old year will be numbered with the past, and we will be engaged in a hand to
                        hand conflict with the trials and difficulties of the year eighteen hundred
                        and sixty-eight. We hope that our columns during the year that is just
                        closing, have served to enliven many dull hours and brighten many moments
                        that would otherwise have been dark and dreary. The old year, whose hoary
                        look and decrepit form is just now nearing the point where he is destined to
                        topple over the brink of the awful labyrinth of the past, has furnished the
                        date of innumerable tales of woe and sorrow-many thrilling and heart rending
                        events-many deeds of darkness and atrocity-many hearts have been made to
                        feel the excruciating pangs of affliction; and, on the contrary, some have
                        enjoyed the most felicitous hours of their lives. But hold! The old man
                        totters-he is becoming more and more feeble. See! he falls over the
                        precipice and clings to a twig standing just on brink-his nerves are
                        gradually giving way-relaxing-the last pulse beats and he goes tumbling down
                        the abyss of time, to be buried deeper and deeper as each succeeding year
                        follows in his wake. And now, the new year is in our front, and we all must
                        enter upon it and act our parts in the various plays of life with which we
                        may come in contact. We trust the future may have luscious fruits in store
                        for us and that, before the close of the year 1868, we may all be found in
                        the enjoyment of the civil, religious and political rights for which our
                        sainted sires spilled their precious blood. We wish all our patrons a happy
                        and prosperous New Year.</p>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spectator</emph> is mourning as a mark of respect for
                        the memory of its founder, GEN'L KENTON HARPER-a most conspicuous and valued
                        citizen of Augusta, who died at his home, "Glen Allen," on Christmas
                        evening, the 25th inst., aged sixty-six years. </p>
                    <p>Our limited space this week permits only a passing sketch of the more
                        prominent events serving to illustrate his civil and military life. It must
                        suffice to say that in all the particulars pertaining to the various and
                        responsible offices of Magistrate of the county, Mayor and magistrate of
                        Staunton, President of the Valley Bank, Visitor of the State Institutions,
                        and Representative of Augusta in the Legislature of Virginia, he discharged
                        faithfully, efficiently and punctiliously, his whole duty.</p>
                    <p>KENTON HARPER was born in Chambersburg, Pa., and soon after coming of age,
                        settled in Staunton. Born of the same stock as the early settlers of
                        Augusta, he naturally assimilated with her people, and manifested through a
                        life a full sympathy in all their sentiments, and an ardent zeal in
                        advancing all their interests.</p>
                    <p>In 1823 he established the "Staunton <emph rend="italic">Spectator</emph> and
                        continuously for sixteen years conducted it with such signal spirit and high
                        toned dignity as to win for it a character and reputation of which the
                        people of Augusta were justly proud. </p>
                    <p>Soon after leaving the editorial office he was-without solicitation on his
                        part-selected and appointed under President Fillmore, as United States agent
                        to the Indian Territory. In this capacity he was distinguished for stainless
                        integrity and high administrative talent. Subsequently he held the position,
                        under the same administration, of confidential Assistant to the Secretary of
                        the Interior-Hon. A. H. H. Stuart-and was designated for many duties of
                        special trust and confidence. At the end of his official term he returned to
                        his farm-"Glen Allen" as his home for the remainder of his days.</p>
                    <p>The chivalrous nature and patriotic spirit of Gen. Harper marked him for
                        military life, but with this his ever delicate health seriously interfered.
                        In the war with Mexico he was Captain of the Volunteer company from Augusta,
                        and during the campaign of the Virginia Regiment, his soldierly demeanor was
                        so marked that Gen. Wool of the U. S. Army selected him over many officers
                        of higher rank, both in the regular and volunteer service, and appointed him
                        to a Military Governorship in Northern Mexico, with a Brigadier Generals'
                        command. He was officially commended for the manner in which he filled that
                        most responsible position.</p>
                    <p>In 1861 he was Major General of the Va. Militia, and instantly upon the
                        secession of his State, on authority by telegraph from Governor Letcher, he
                        took the field with only a hurried passing farewell to his family, marched
                        to Harper's Ferry, captured that all important post, accomplished the
                        removal of invaluable ordnance stores and machinery from that exposed point
                        and secured its use for his otherwise almost unarmed Virginia. His friends
                        have felt that full justice was never done General Harper for this timely
                        and efficient service. There exists documentary evidence for the assertion
                        that the successful removal of the machinery and munitions of the war from
                        Harper's Ferry to safety in the interior of Virginia, and the efficient
                        organization, subsistence and equipment of the volunteer troops so hastily
                        gathering there, was under most peculiar difficulties, due to the energy,
                        skill, and sagacity of General Kenton Harper.</p>
                    <p>When the Militia was superseded by the Volunteer system Gen. Harper accepted
                        the position of Colonel of the 5th Va. Infantry. His command most gallantly
                        met and checked the advance of Patterson's army a Falling Waters-that
                        brilliant opening to the long series of battles that have since made
                        historic the Valley of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>At the first battle of Manassas he led his gallant regiment-and that he did
                        his duty there may be well inferred from the fact that in his immediate
                        presence occurred that ever memorable incident now become immortal,
                        when-according to Col. Harper's own version of it to the writer-just at that
                        critical point in the battle as the brave General Bee rallying his own
                        wavering ranks approached Jackson's still firm lines, Col. Harper saluted
                        him, as if for orders, and to Bee's inquiry as to "What troops are
                        these?"-replied "The 1st Va. Brigade-General Jackson's."-Whereupon the
                        chivalrous South Carolinian, instantly wheeling his horse and rising in his
                        stirrups shouted forth upon the field his now successful rallying call:
                            "<emph rend="italic">Rally here! Look how these Virginians stand like a
                            Stonewall!</emph>" </p>
                    <p>Being refused even a brief furlough to visit his dying wife, he resigned his
                        commission and hastened home in time only to attend her sad funeral. He
                        subsequently accepted the position of Colonel of Reserves, and was engaged
                        in the affairs at Waynesboro' and elsewhere and at the disastrous battle of
                        Piedmont held the Augusta Reserves firmly in position to the very last.</p>
                    <p>In private life General Harper was a most estimable man. He was the very soul
                        of honor-was true as steel to his friends, and if in a long public life his
                        ardent temperament at times brought him in collision with any he ever bore
                        himself only as a manly and generous foe.</p>
                    <p>For forty years he was a member of the Presbyterian church, and his pastor
                        publicly testified at his funeral to his ever consistent christian
                        character, and to the special evidence given of his sincere and genuine
                        piety, and his confident trust and faith in his Redeemer. He was calmly
                        conscious all throughout his last illness, that death was steadily and
                        surely approaching, and with his characteristic moral courage made all due
                        preparation, serenely awaited the sad event, and saying most reverently "I
                        would not live alway-I ask not to stay," trustingly yield up his spirit to
                        God who gave it.</p>
                    <p>Thus has passed from among us another of the marked men of our county; one
                        who has contributed by all his private demeanor and his patriotic public
                        spirit to give a still higher tone to the character and reputation of
                        Augusta. His memory we should not willingly let die, his example of a
                        virtuous life and peaceful death should long remain to point to each of us
                        the lesson of the fine linss he so truly illustrated:</p>
                    <p>"So live that when thy summons comes to join</p>
                    <p>The innumerable caravan, which moves</p>
                    <p>To that mysterious realm where each shall take</p>
                    <p>His chamber in the silent halls of death,</p>
                    <p>Thou go-not like the quarry slave at night,</p>
                    <p>Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed</p>
                    <p>By an unialtering trust, approach thy grave</p>
                    <p>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch</p>
                    <p>About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams."</p>

                    <p>WE are pained to record a most distressing accident, which occurred on the
                        Virginia Central Railroad, near Buffalo Gap, on last Thursday,--The
                        particulars of the accident, as related to us by Mr. Geo. W. Pelter, the
                        engineer who was running the engine at the time of the occurrence, are about
                        as follows: As Mr. Pelter was running his engine round a curve near Buffalo
                        Gap station, he observed a hand car approaching him with great rapidity, and
                        he immediately reversed steam, and just about the time his engine stopped,
                        the hand car came in collision. There was no train attached to the engine
                        and it was running backwards, with the tender in front.-Mr. George
                        Gillespie, section master, and a Miss Dinkle, Mr. William Critzer, his wife
                        and little daughter were on the hand car, and the latter a child about nine
                        years old, was instantly killed, and Mrs. Critzer had her right arm so
                        severely mangled, as to require immediate amputation.-The balance of the
                        party escaped without injury.</p>
                    <p>We understand that there is no blame attached to Mr. Pelter, as he was
                        running his engine under orders, and that the party on the hand car were
                        pleasure riding, in violation of positive order from the superintendent.</p>

                    <p>Whereas, the Congress of the United States have required a Convention to be
                        called in the State of Virginia for the purpose of framing a Constitution
                        for the State,</p>
                    <p>And whereas, from the action which has been taken by similar conventions
                        which have been held in other Southern States, there are good grounds to
                        apprehend that the Virginia Convention now in session may recommend to the
                        people a Constitution which will bring the State under the control of the
                        negro race;</p>
                    <p>And whereas, in the opinions of this association, such a result would be most
                        disastrous to the best interest of the State, by transferring the political
                        power of the State to the most ignorant portion of its population, and
                        ultimately burthening the land and property of the people with onerous
                        taxation, imposed by those who would own but a small portion of the property
                        of the State.</p>
                    <p>1st. Be it, therefore, resolved, that in the event of the adoption of such a
                        Constitution by the Convention, we pledge ourselves to each other, and to
                        our fellow-citizens generally, to make every fair and honorable effort to
                        defeat the ratification of such Constitution by the people; and to that end
                        we will not only vote against its ratification ourselves, but we will
                        diligently exert ourselves to induce every voter in our respective
                        neighborhoods to attend the polls and record their votes against it.</p>
                    <p>2d. Resolved, that we will cherish the kindest feelings towards the freedman,
                        taking care to explain to him how his best interest will be promoted by
                        cultivating friendly relationship with the people with whom they live.</p>
                    <p>3rd. Resolved, that our great aim should be to escape negro supremacy in the
                        State, and that we will exert ourselves to the utmost extent of our power
                        and influence to save ourselves and our race from this calamity and
                        disgrace.</p>
                    <p>4th. We, the undersigned, do cordially endorse the above resolutions, in
                        spirit and letter, unhesitatingly pledge ourselves to carry them out
                        practically at the ballot box.</p>
                    <p>On motion, the Chairman appointed leaders of tens whose duty it shall be to
                        obtain signers to the above.</p>
                    <p>The following gentlemen were ten appointed, to wit: J. S. Ellis, Esq., Capt.
                        C. Hall, W. L. Hunter, J. A. Fitch, B. F. Cochran, Alex. Coyner, G. Harman,
