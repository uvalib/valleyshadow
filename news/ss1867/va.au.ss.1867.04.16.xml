				<head>The Convention Question</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>But a few months since the Legislatures of every Southern State, by almost
						unanimous votes rejected most emphatically, the proposed amendment to the
						Constitution on the ground chiefly that it would not be honorable to
						disfranchise those who had been acting with and for the masses of the
						people. Our own Legislature, with only one dissenting voice, rejected it,
						and chiefly for the reason that the honor of the State forbade its adoption.
						Now, by act of Congress, the question is submitted to the vote of the people
						at the polls whether they will vote for or against a Convention to comply
						with the provisions of an unconstitutional act of Congress which requires,
						not only the adoption by the Legislature of this same Constitutional
						amendment which the Legislature rejected for the reason stated, but also the
						incorporation into the Constitutions of the Southern States, of the right of
						universal negro suffrage.</p>
					<p>If the honor of the State forbade the adoption of the Constitutional
						amendment two months ago-and that was the position of all the presses and
						people save the Radical presses and their supporters-how can the people now,
						consistently with honor, vote for a Convention to comply with an act which
						requires the adoption of the same amendment?</p>
					<p>The act containing these requirements is palpably, grossly, unmistakably,
						confessedly, unconstitutional. We are under sworn obligations of fidelity to
						the Constitution. Can we, consistently with our obligations, recognise the
						validity of, or yield our acquiescence to, such unconstitutional
						legislation?</p>
					<p>It is submitted to the vote of the people at the polls whether they will vote
						for or against a Convention to adopt a Constitution in compliance with the
						provisions of this unconstitutional legislation. They are as free to vote
						against it as for it.</p>
					<p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig </emph>, in noticing the views of this
						paper in reference to voting for or against a Convention, presents but two
						considerations in opposition to them-one the groundless dread of the
						Hunnicutt faction, and the other the fact that the negroes will vote for the
						Convention. Hunnicutt inspires contempt, but not dread in the minds of the
						masses of the people. </p>
					<p>That the other consideration-that the negroes will vote for a
						Convention-furnishes any reason, much less a conclusive one, as the <emph
							rend="italic">Whig </emph> seems to think, why the whites should do so,
						strikes us, and will strike the masses of our people, "as a most lame and
						impotent conclusion." The negroes, the <emph rend="italic">Whig </emph>
						assumes, will vote for the Convention because the constitution, which is
						required to be adopted under the act calling it, will grant them the right
						of suffrage. To many whites this will furnish a strong reason why they
						should vote against the Convention. </p>

					<p>We hold and believe we can demonstrably prove, says the Petersburg <emph

						the Republican party, are not now and never were the enlightened, liberal
						and true friends of the negroes. Who are they? Where do they live and from
						whom did they spring? They are New Englanders, or of New England descent,
						almost without exception; for it is well known that the great body of the
						Western people are descended from New England emigrants. And now consider
						what has always been the policy of those Eastern States towards the colored
						race? Who brought them from their native land to this country? Chiefly New
						Englanders, in New England ships. Who sold them into perpetual bondage? New
						Englanders. Who bought them and worked them in those Northern States as long
						as their labor was profitable? New Englanders-the fathers of the present
						Abolition Republicans. Who sold them and removed them to the South after
						their labor had become unprofitable in the North? Abolitionists and their
						fathers. Who continued to bring them from their native land in Northern
						ships and to sell them to the West Indies and elsewhere for gain-purely for
						money-long after they had ceased to be profitable as laborers in New
						England? Northern Abolitionists and their fathers. And it was proposed by
						Congress to stop the salve trade, and put an end to the wicked traffic, who
						voted against its continuance? Mark this: Virginia! And who voted <emph
							rend="italic">for </emph> its continuance? Mark this: Massachusetts-the
						Abolitionists and their fathers!! These are facts which can neither be
						ignored nor gainsaid; for history has them in her faithful record.</p>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>At a recent meeting of Radicals, or "Red Stings," as they are called in that
						section, at Wytheville, Va., a tall good looking colored gentlemen by the
						name of Wilson Leewood, a preacher, arose and spoke earnestly to his
						brethren for some time; he stated that he was in favor of seeing his race
						conduct themselves as Christian men, polite and respectful to all, honest
						and truthful; and he knew if they would do this they would receive the
						respect of all; that he knew they were now ignorant and they would have to
						be careful who they selected as their friends; that in selecting men for
						office they must select gentlemen who were respectable, and competent and
						could be relied upon, and not suffer themselves to be duped by those who
						wanted to make tools of them to get into office and then discard them. He
						cautioned them too against men who had nothing but false promises and deceit
						to offer them, and told them that their true friends were those to whom they
						had to look for employment-that they would have to live among and must
						cultivate the friendship of the better class of Southern white people.
						Altogether his speech was very sensible and well received by the decent
						portion of the audience "without distinction of color" as was sufficiently
						evinced by the encouraging plaudits which he received.</p>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>We have always been kindly disposed to the blacks, and have believed that
						such was the case with most of our people, and, consequently, have uniformly
						maintained that the best friends they have are the people of the South. None
						but friendly feelings should exist between the whites and blacks of the
						South. We concur with the <emph rend="italic">Houston </emph> (Texas) <emph
							rend="italic">Telegraph </emph> that it is all important in view of the
						new right of suffrage conferred upon the negroes by Congress. Those among us
						who are inclined to impose upon negroes, or to treat them in such way as to
						engender strife between them and the whites are, without thinking of it, the
						worst enemies of the country. We have but few such men, but we have some,
						and we owe it to ourselves to discountenance them. It is true, the conduct
						of some negroes is often vexatious in the extreme; so is the conduct of many
						white men. And our own theory, that the negroes are an inferior race, should
						cause us to treat them with forbearance. It is no credit to any white man to
						have quarrels with negroes, under present circumstances especially. And,
						then, there are many things to be said in favor of the negroes. Nine-tenths
						of them were staunch Confederates during all the war, except where armies of
						invasion demoralized them. Three-fourths of the able-bodied blacks would
						have volunteered in the Confederate army had it been permitted. And they are
						not at all responsible for their emancipation, nor for the effort to place
						them upon an equality with the whites. Whatever their faults-and all races
						have faults-they are the most docile people in the world, and are as true as
						steel to their friends. Those of the Southern people who manifest kindness
						and friendship for them can exercise a stronger and better influence over
						them than any other class. And it is now the highest patriotic duty, as it
						was a humane and Christian duty before, that every Southern man should be a
						friend to the negroes; and to have influence with them, and seek to guide
						them for good in their new position. Otherwise, they will fall into the
						hands of bad men, and mischief will be the result. "A word to the wise,
						etc." </p>

					<p>STAUNTON. April 1st 1867.</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Messrs. N. K. Trout &amp; R. Manzy</emph>, </p>
					<p>Gentlemen;</p>
					<p>I have been deeply pained to learn that a controversy, arising out of
						differences on political questions has spring up between you. Being
						persuaded that this difficulty has been the result of some misunderstanding,
						and cherishing for both of you sentiments of cordial friendship and esteem,
						I earnestly beg that you will consent to refer all matters in difference
						between you, to the arbitrament of mutual friends, and would respectfully
						suggest as referees, Thos. J. Michie, Esq, J. B. Baldwin, John N. Hendren,
						Esq., and Joseph A. Waddell or any of them.</p>
					<p>In the present disturbed condition of our country, I should regard a
						political difference between two gentlemen, who enjoy so large a share of
						public confidence as peculiarly unfortunate.</p>
					<p>Very Respectfully, yours &amp;c.,</p>
					<p>A. H. H. STUART. <lb/></p>
					<p>We hereby agree to refer all matters in difference between us to the
						arbitrament of T. J. Michie, Esq., Col. J. B. Baldwin, John N. Hendren and

					<p>N. K. TROUT,</p>
					<p>R. MAUZY.</p>
					<p>April 1st, 1867. <lb/><lb/></p>
					<p>AWARD.</p>
					<p>After careful examination of the correspondence between Mr. Trout and Mr.
						Mauzy and of the editorial to which it refers, we are of opinion that while
						the editorial was characterized by a severity of criticism which we do not
						approve, yet it does not contain any reflection on the motives or conduct of
						Mr. Trout which was intended to be offensive to him personally.</p>
					<p>We think, therefore that the remarks of Mr. Trout in reference to Mr. Mauzy
						on Friday last ought to be withdrawn. We are further of opinion that as the
						interruption in the friendly intercourse between Mr. Trout and Mr. Mauzy had
						its origin in a misapprehension, which no longer exists, there is no reason
						why their former relations shall not be restored.</p>

				<origin>Charlottesville Chronicle</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>For many years to come the destiny and happiness of all the people now living
						in the South are bound up together. We have here a very uncommon thing, two
						different races living together. A great change has suddenly come upon both
						races. The white race is no longer a race of masters. Formerly rich, they
						are now poor. The colored race by one bound became in a moment <emph
							rend="italic">free </emph>. Every colored person may now go where and
						when he pleases. He is a <emph rend="italic">free man</emph>, and a full
						citizen. This is not all; by another bound they have become <emph
							rend="italic">voters </emph>.-They will take part in the government of
						the country. No people was ever so suddenly, so rapidly lifted up. </p>
					<p>Shall we live happily together? Or shall we hate each other, and quarrel, and
						bear malice?</p>
					<p>Let us all try and get on together. The land is big enough. Let the whites
						accommodate themselves to the new state of things. Let them be polite and
						kind to all, and be always ready to accord to every man whether white or
						colored, his full rights. Kindness is the most powerful engine in human
						society; haughtiness, bitterness, and anger, accomplish but little. We will
						warrant that an employer who is kind and considerate with those who work for
						him, will have their respect and get on in his business. Pay them punctually
						what you owe then. Let them see and feel that you are scrupulously <emph
							rend="italic">just </emph>. Bear with their harmless prejudices; have
						not we (the whites) ten thousand vanities? Does not a hoop turn the head of
						a white woman as well as a colored woman? Does not the same poor human heart
						beat under the most snowy and the most jet-black bosom? Is a colored man or
						woman sick? Visit them. Are they in want of shelter, lend them a vacant
						cabin. Are they hungry? Give them bread. Is your servant high-tempered? Bear
						with it-for, it may be, you have a temper of your own. Is he lazy?-mayhaps,
							<emph rend="italic">you </emph> are lazy. Is he a church member, and
						very inconsistent? Perchance <emph rend="italic">you </emph> are a
						church-member, and with ten fold inducement to a consistent christian life,
							<emph rend="italic">you </emph> excite the surprise of your neighbors by
						your sharp practices, or your love of meat and drink, or your bad temper, or
						your facile conscience. </p>
					<p>Now we make bold to say, that the behavior of the colored people in this
						State, since they were set free, <emph rend="italic">has surprised</emph>
						all fair-minded white people. We do not believe the white people under the
						same circumstances, would have behaved so well by twenty per cent. They have
						shown the greatest <emph rend="italic">moderation </emph>. They have passed
						from plantation hands to freedom and the ballot without outward excitement.
						They still touch the had, and call us "master" when they pass us. By a kind
						word you can engage them to anything. What crimes have they committed? They
						have <emph rend="italic">stolen </emph> a good deal, we admit; and how much
						would white folks have stolen under the same circumstances? The perpetual
						wonder with us is, that there is <emph rend="italic">so much</emph> honesty
						among the colored people. What chance have they had? What mother taught them
						to pray in infancy? Taught them about the Savior as they grew a little
						older? sent them to Sunday School? took them to Church? gave them the
						example of her beautiful life? What father laid upon them the spell of his
						restraining influence? What <emph rend="italic">public sentiment</emph> kept
						them in the path of duty and of upright life? </p>
					<p>Consider what appeals have been made to them by designing <emph rend="italic"
							>Northern friends</emph>. Consider what prejudices have been played
						upon. Consider how they have been preached to about their "rights" by those
						who kick them at home. Poor creatures, it seems to us as if God had helped
						them to keep within bounds. </p>
					<p>We just say this-that if we had been a born nigger-reared out in a mud cabin,
						with no knowledge of God, with no knowledge of anything, surrounded by a
						public sentiment that tolerated dirt, swearing, Sabbath breaking, stealing,
						lying-we should have been hung long ago.</p>
					<p>But a word to our colored friends: you are ignorant, you are poor, you are
						helpless, you are surrounded by many temptations. You have been suddenly
						elevated so high that you are in great danger of having your heads turned.
						Designing people are seeking to use you to help forward their own schemes.
						Some of you-more particularly those who have lived in towns-have picked up
						some knowledge of the world. The great body of your race know no more than
						little children.</p>
					<p>There are about three millions of you in the South proper. There are about
						six millions of white people in the South. In this State there are about
						500,000 colored people, and about 700,000 white people. In the fourteen
						Southern States (counting Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri) you outnumber
						the whites in only two States-South Carolina and Mississippi.-In all the
						other old slave-holding States, the whites are in a majority. By white
						people coming here from the North and from Europe, the white population will
						steadily, perhaps rapidly, increase; your race will not increase; it may
						fall off in numbers. You will see therefore that you cannot afford to
						quarrel with the whites.-Besides that, the whites have all the property and
						have education. It is as much your interest as that of the whites that we
						should get on pleasantly together. If the two races quarrel; both will
						suffer-the whole South will suffer.-If we have good government, and peace,
						and quiet, <emph rend="italic">all </emph> will prosper. If we make good
						crops, all will be fed. If we wrangle and jar; if the whites oppress the
						laborer, or if the laborer does not do his part by his employer, <emph
							rend="italic">both </emph> will suffer. </p>
					<p>By the right to vote, you have acquired and immense power to protect
						yourselves. If you use this power without abusing it, if you are prudent,
						the legislatures of the States will pass kind laws to protect you, and the
						courts of the country will enforce them.</p>
					<p>Remember that although you are free, and although you will vote, you are
						still the <emph rend="italic">laboring class of the country</emph>. Do not
						abuse the freedom which God has given you by forgetting your position in
						society. Do not undertake to be a fine gentleman. Do not put on airs. Attend
						to your business, do your daily work, do it well, deal honestly and
						uprightly; and you will command respect. Live peaceably with the whites.
						Make them your friends. They can do you infinite harm, if you make them
						enemies. They can persecute you to death in a thousand ways which no laws
						can reach. Remember that in the late convulsions of the country all the
						fruit has been gathered by you; all the dregs of the cup have been drained
						by the whites. Be contented with the blessings which God has bestowed upon
						you, and do not by a grasping spirit blast the prospects which lie before
						you. What you want is to gather your families together, to reap the fruits
						of honest labor, to have protection from injustice. Beware of the
						loud-mouthed babblers that would pit you against the whites. If you become
						pitted against the whites, it is a game which two can play at: the whites
						will become pitted against <emph rend="italic">you </emph>. It will be a
						death-struggle. The stronger race will overpower the weaker. Let there be no
						strife between the races, let them work <emph rend="italic">together </emph>
						for the whole country. Do you attend to your business and let politics
						alone. What you want is bread and meat and decent clothing and a neat little
						house or room to live in. Try and lay by something and have your children
						taught to read and write, and make them go to Church and to Sunday School
						and keep them clean. When you learn to read, read <emph rend="italic">the
							Bible </emph>, and learn from the fountain-head what Religion is. </p>
					<p>Don't be <emph rend="italic">suspicious </emph> of the white people: be frank
						and open with them: speak your mind. </p>
