				<head>State Elections--Policy of the South</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>As the people of this State will, in a few months, be called upon to elect
						both Federal and State officers, it becomes them to consider calmly and
						dispassionately what course wise and enlightened patriotism dictates they
						should pursue-what spirit they should manifest-what the character of the
						officers they should elect. The first demand of patriotism, at this time, is
						to adopt that line of policy which will tend most speedily and successfully
						to restore the administration of the Government to the constitutional basis
						designed by its distinguished and patriotic founders, and to restore to the
						people all the constitutional rights which have been unjustly wrested from
						them. These are withheld from them by the Radicals now in power, and these
						Radicals are sustained by a considerable portion of the people of the North
						whose sentiments are based upon the prejudices entertained against the
						people of the South, growing out of the attitude of the South in the late
						bloody strife, and these prejudices are kept alive by interested Radicals in
						the North, and their unscrupulous allies in the South, who believe, or
						rather <emph rend="italic">affect </emph> to believe, that the people of the
						South are not sincere in their professions of acquiescence in the results of
						the war-that they are disloyal and hostile to the Government of the United
						States, and still cherish secession and rebellious sentiments. </p>
					<p>The belief of these things on the part of the masses, who have been imposed
						upon by interested office holders, to a great extent have induced them to
						elect Radicals to office, and to turn a deaf ear to the appeal of the South
						for equality of constitutional rights. The great Conservative and
						constitutional party of the North, upon whose success depends the hopes of
						the South, relies for success chiefly, if not in fact solely, upon the <emph
							rend="italic">wisdom, prudence, moderation and conservatism of the
						South</emph>. They are watching the conduct of the people of the South with
						the greatest anxiety, hoping that it will be such, in all respects, as will
						disprove all the charges brought against them by the Radicals and their
						Southern allies. The hopes of the Radicals, on the contrary, rest upon the
						commission, on the part of the people of the South, of such blunders or
						indiscreet acts as would tend to confirm in the minds of the Northern
						people-too prone to such belief-the charges of disloyalty which they so
						persistently prefer against them. It would be well to bear in mind that it
						does not require much to convince those whose minds are already poisoned
						with prejudice against us. </p>
					<p>"Trifles, light as air,</p>
					<p>Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong</p>
					<p>As proofs of holy writ."</p>
					<p>Impressed with this view, we regret to see the coarse adopted by some of the
						Press of the State, in recommencing the people to select their chief
						officers men who were distinguished either by their prominence as leading,
						active <emph rend="italic">original secessionists</emph>, or by
						distinguished <emph rend="italic">military </emph> service during the war.
						If the people should be so unwise-we have no idea, however, that they will
						be-as to act upon this advice, and should elect persons to office for the
							<emph rend="italic">reason </emph> that they were <emph rend="italic"
							>original secessionists</emph>, or had rendered distinguished <emph
							rend="italic">military </emph> service, they would, in our opinion,
						commit that kind of "political blunder," which Talleyrand said was "worse
						than a crime." They would, by such elections, depress, dishearten and
						paralyze the conservative party at the North, whilst they would give "aid
						and comfort" to the enemies of the South, and a cheer of rejoicing would run
						along the whole line of Radical forces, for their charges would, in the
						minds of the people of the North, be sustained by </p>
					<p>"confirmations strong</p>
					<p>As proofs of holy writ," and the hopes of the Conservatives would be
						extinguished in the blackness of despair.</p>
					<p>The election of such officers, <emph rend="italic">for the reasons
						mentioned</emph>, would be a misfortune, at least, if not a calamity. </p>
					<p>We observe that one of the ablest journals of the State, which, at the last
						election for members of Congress, advocated the debasing policy of electing
						such only as would agree to take an oath that they had never sympathized
						with the cause of the South, and had never given any encouragement, aid or
						comfort to any who participated in the struggle for independence, has now
						swung to the opposite extreme, and is zealously urging the policy we have
						been deprecating. New converts are proverbial for their fervid and
						intemperate zeal, and it is said that a "renegade is worse than ten Turks."
						That journal is now endeavoring to make amends for the degradation of its
						position at the other election. It is ashamed or the quantity of dirt it ate
						on that occasion when humbly crawling up on its belly, and is now acting the
						salamander, and no food cooler than fire will be eaten by it. The policy
						that journal now advocates is only less reprehensible than that it advocated
						at the former election. It is not a safe <emph rend="italic"
						>file-leader</emph>, and the soldiers, whose favor it is now currying as
						well as the people generally, will be too wise to follow it-they are
						sensible and patriotic and will not pursue a course which would inflict such
						misfortunes upon the country. </p>
					<p>It is useless to inform the readers of the <emph rend="italic">Spectator
						</emph> that we would not favor the election of any man who had not been,
						and was still, true to the South, and to the Constitutional rights of the
						whole people. He should be a patriot, firm, tried and true, a man of fine
						intellect, with a character for integrity, and public and private virtue,
							<emph rend="italic">sans peur et sans reproche</emph>, without fear and
						without reproach, unimpeached and unimpeachable. This State is blessed with
						a sufficient number of men of this kind, who were not instrumental in
						precipitating the conflict of sections to fill all her chief offices, and
						from this class, at this time, for the reasons before alluded to, they
						should be selected. These views we have been constrained by a sense of
						patriotic duty to express, and hope that they will be considered and
						reflected upon in the same spirit with which they have been written-with a
						sincere view of arriving at a proper decision as to our duties under the
						existing circumstances </p>

					demonstrate a rebellious spirit. "It does not require much," the editor
					explains, "to convince those whose minds are already poisoned with prejudice
					against us."</summary>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p> Since the emancipation of the colored population of the South, we have
						frequently told them that their condition is <emph rend="italic">no better
							than that of the whites</emph>-that with the acquisition of of freedom
						they became burdened with the responsibilities of freemen, and will find
						that, in many respects, their immunities are not as great as they were
						before. Many, no doubt, thought this was a strange position, and that the
						remark was made more in jest than in earnest.-But some now are beginning to
						experience the full force of the truth of the assertion. When slaves, if
						they were guilty of larceny, they were given a few stripes and let off
						without any other punishment. Now, however, when charged with this offence,
						too frequently committed by them, they are thrown into prison, and if found
						guilty, sent for a number of years to work in the penitentiary, just as
						white people are treated who are found guilty of the same offence. </p>
					<p>Before emancipation, practising the <emph rend="italic">free-lovism</emph>
						advocated by a portion of the demoralized people of the North, they selected
						their inamoratos and cohabited with them <emph rend="italic">ad
						libitum</emph>.-When they desired a change, they selected another, and
						enjoyed perfect immunity from all the penalties attaching to the offence of
						bigamy. Like the Mormons they enjoyed a plurality of wives, and jealous
						wives had not the power to have them imprisoned and punished for their
						infidelity. Now, however, the liberties of the freedman are no greater than
						those possessed by a white man, and he is not permitted to cohabit as man
						with wife, and to desert his free-love dulcinea and marry another woman. A
						freedman named Samuel Hall has recently committed this offence in Rockingham
						county, and the result is that he is now in prison charged with the crime of
						bigamy, and may be sent to the penitentiary. Since the war, he has been
						cohabiting with one woman, who has given birth to a child-he recently
						married another in due form, whereupon the first woman had him arrested,
						charged with the crime of bigamy, and he is now in prison awaiting trial. We
						would advise other colored persons, who are now liable to the same penalties
						as white people, to take warning by the fate of Samuel Hall, and to bear in
						mind that their condition is now but little, if any better than that of
						white people. The time of their special privileges and immunities has
						passed, and they are now burdened with the responsibilities as well as
						blessed with the fancied boon of freedom. </p>

					<p>In speaking of the plan of reconstruction proposed by several Southern

						expresses the following views which are worthy of consideration: </p>
					<p>"The Southern States are not in a situation to offer terms, and the dominant
						party are not, at present, open to propositions. If they can force upon the
						South terms that she would not assent to of choice, they will not be content
						with less. If they cannot enforce such terms, there would seem to be no
						reason for our offering any. We may offer better terms for that party than
						they could carry without our help. Of this one thing we may feel assured:
						from that party we can expect nothing of favor, of humanity, of ordinary
						kindness. They will do the worst they can, whether we help them or not. What
						we commit ourselves to we will have to stand by. It is best not to commit
						ourselves to anything to submit patiently to whatever settlement Congress
						shall decide upon, and to await the ultimate reversal of it either by the
						Supreme Court or a future Congress."</p>

				<head>Southern Plan of Reconstruction</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Gov. Orr, Gov. Parsons, Gov. Marvin, Judge Sharkey, and other
						self-constituted representatives of the South, who have been in Washington,
						have agreed, with the concurrence, it is said, of the President, upon
						recommending the adoption by the Southern States of the following plan of
						adjustment. Though it contains, in our view, serious objectionable
						principles, it would commit the South to concessions it should not make, yet
						we have no idea that the Radicals will assent to it as a basis of
						settlement-they will insist on more unfavorable terms still. The South
						should avoid committals of concessions, and rely upon a firm and "masterly
						inactivity." The following is the proposed plan:</p>
					<p>Article 14-Section 1.-The Union under the Constitution is and shall be
						perpetual. No state shall pass any law or ordinance to secede or withdraw
						from the Union, and any such law or ordinance shall be null and void.</p>
					<p>Section 2.-The public debt of the United States, authorized by law, shall
						ever be held sacred and inviolate. But neither the United States nor any
						State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of
						insurrection or rebellion against the Government or authority of the United
						States.</p>
					<p>Section 3.-All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
						to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
						States in which they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which
						shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;
						nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without
						due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
						protection of the laws.</p>
					<p>Section 4.-Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States
						according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons
						in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when any State shall, on
						account of race or color, or previous condition of servitude, exclude from
						voting at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice
						President of the United States, representatives in Congress, members of the
						Legislature or other officers elective by the people, any of the male
						inhabitants of such State, being 21 years of age and citizens of the United
						States, then the entire class of persons so excluded from the elective
						franchise, shall not be counted in the basis of representation. No State
						shall require as a property qualification for voters more than two hundred
						and fifty dollars worth of taxable property, nor as an educational
						qualification more education than enough to enable the voter to read the
						Constitution of the United States in the English language and write his own
						name.</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Proposed Amendment to the State Constitution</emph>. </p>
					<p>Article.-Every male citizen who has resided in this State for one year and in
						the county in which he offers to vote six months, immediately preceding the
						day of election, and who can read the Constitution of the United States in
						the English language, and can write legibly his own name, or who may be the
						owner of $250 worth of taxable property, shall be entitled to vote at all
						elections for Governor of the State, members of the legislature, and all
						other officers elected by the people of the State:</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Provided</emph>, That no person by reason of this
						article, shall be excluded from voting who has heretofore exercised the
						elective franchise under the Constitution and laws of this State, or who at
						the time of the adoption of this amendment may be entitled to vote under
						said Constitution and laws. </p>
