                    <p>Meeting on Monday Next.</p>
                    <p>We again remind the Democracy of the county, that a meeting will be held on
                        Monday next to appoint delegates to a Congressional Convention to assemble
                        in Harrisonburg on the 25th of April. This day is fixed upon, because it
                        will not interfere with the Courts of any county in the District that we
                        know of. We trust there will be a full meeting, for we deem it of the
                        highest importance that prompt and determined steps be taken to organize the
                        party and prepare for the triumph of the Democracy in May next. The contest
                        is emphatically to be between State Rights and Federalism, and the quicker
                        we draw the lines, the better. It is a time when every man should take his
                        position, and maintain a fixed stand in support of the principles of the
                        Constitution and the government as understood and explained by their
                        founders, or subscribe to a latitudinous idea that will in the end lead to a
                        surrender of our rights and the subordination of our section to Black
                        Republican and abolition aggression and outrage. The issue is before us, and
                        we cannot escape from its consideration. We <emph rend="italic">must</emph>
                        either identify ourselves with the North or the South. The question of Union
                        or Disunion is dead and buried. Dissolution has already taken place, and
                        whether the people of Virginia can realize it or not, it is most certainly
                        so. The only question is, where will Virginia go--with her sister States of
                        the South on terms of perfect equality, where the Constitution, the laws and
                        legislation, the feelings and affections, harmonize with her interests and
                        institutions, or with the North, where every act discriminates against her,
                        proscribes her as inferior, and where the sentiment of the people is hostile
                        to her rights and the rights of her citizens? We beg the Democracy and all
                        State Rights men, to remember these things, and come forward on Monday next
                        to take a firm stand for the organization of the State Rights party in this
                        District.</p>

                    "above every consideration of party interest." Harris has adopted a policy that
                    "cannot fail to demoralize and hopelessly break up our organization, and
                    eventuate in turning the District over to the Opposition."</summary>

                    <p>Staunton Station.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Veitch, in the Conference, on Tuesday last, rose to a privilege
                        question, for the purpose of denouncing as a falsehood the following
                        statement from the Staunton Correspondent of the Baltimore American:</p>
                    <p>"The Methodists have the sympathy of other denominations here, but so great
                        has the prejudice become against their supposed abolition tendency that the
                        preacher in charge is supported almost entirely by the contributions of the
                        colored people."</p>
                    <p>The preacher in charge of Staunton Station, Rev. J.R. Wheeler, is not only
                        liberally supported by his congregation, but is universally beloved, both in
                        and out of his Church, for his high character as a minister and gentleman.
                        He preaches every Sabbath to a crowded church, composed of persons of nearly
                        all religious persuasions, no one of whom has ever heard fall from his lips
                        anything that could raise a suspicion of his loyalty to the institutions of
                        the South. Indeed, there has never been a minister of any denomination who
                        enjoyed a more unrestricted and implicit confidence from an intelligent
                        public, than does the Rev. Mr. Wheeler from the people of Staunton. The only
                        regret with his congregation is that they cannot have him stationed here for
                        life. The writer of the above paragraph, from the American, is most
                        egregiously ignorant, to say the least.</p>

                    act. They first supported separate state action, then a Peace Conference, and
                    then a Border State Conference. The Vindicator argues that these are all dodges,
                    and the paper hopes that the people will "discard from their councils such
                    miserable tricksters."</summary>

                    Virginia written by Hon. W.L. Goggin, the former Opposition candidate for
                    governor. The paper supports the "tangible points in the proposition" and
                    wonders if the Spectator will say the same.</summary>

                    with the tariff policies adopted by the Confederacy. The former raises the
                    prices of "every article of consumption used by the farming and laboring classes
                    of Virginia" and protects the interests of Northern manufacturers. The latter
                    reduces the taxes on goods by about one-fourth.</summary>
