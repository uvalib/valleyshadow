                        Convention addressed the people of Staunton on last Wednesday night. The

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Speaking at Mt. Sidney</p>
                    <p>Returning from Rockingham Court on last Monday evening, we stopped at Mt.
                        Sidney to hear the candidates for the Convention address the people of that
                        vicinity, as advertised. One of the most thoughtful, respectful and
                        intelligent audiences, consisting of about three hundred, had assembled that
                        we have ever seen. Thornton Berry, Esq., was called to the chair. Gen.
                        Harman opened the discussion; Col. Baylor followed, and he was succeeded
                        respectively by Col. Baldwin, Capt. Imboden, and Mr. Sheffey. Gen. Harman
                        and Capt. Imboden took decided and almost similar positions, and declared
                        their purpose, if elected, to use every effort to have our national
                        difficulties promptly and finally settled, at least so far as Virginia's
                        action could inaugurate a line of policy that would result in adjustment.
                        They declared that resistance to coercion was a duty, and indicated their
                        endorsement of the Crittenden-Douglas Compromise as a basis of settlement.</p>
                    <p>The other speakers, except when questioned, confined themselves mostly to
                        appeals in behalf of the preservation of the Union, without defining any
                        particular policy, except to wait for future
                        developments. They seemed to lose sight of the fact that the Union was already dissolved, and that hence the question
                        for the consideration and judgment of the people was not the preservation of the Union, for that was impossible,
                        but its re-construction. They did not advert to
                        the fact that there is no hope for the old Union--for the seceding States to
                        come back and resume their original relations, unless the causes which led
                        to their separation are removed. They evaded the practical points, which must be
                        settled to prevent civil war, and confined themselves to exciting the
                        feelings and fears of their hearers. We honestly believe this to be wrong.
                        As much as we respect and admire the high order of talent and pure character
                        of Cols. Baldwin and Baylor, and Mr. Sheffey, yet we are candid when we say
                        that the speeches on Monday night last were calculated to mislead the
                        people. We ask them what possible good can result from exciting the
                        passions? Would it not be far more becoming in this important canvass, to
                        tell the people plainly that we are in a revolution--lay bare the fact that
                        five States have seceded and that to that extent this Union is dissolved to
                        all intents and purposes? We want the plain, blunt truth presented to the
                        voters of the county that some policy of reconstructing our shattered Union
                            must be adopted--some terms upon which the
                        seceding States will reunite must be adopted. We
                        call upon the people to demand the positions of
                        the candidates in this regard. It will not do to sing paeans to the Union
                        and the stars and stripes when the waves of revolution and disunion are
                        surging all around us.</p>
                    <p>We confess that we were disappointed in the speeches of these gentlemen. In
                        our opinion, they did not meet the issues presented in the condition of the
                        country. They consumed their time with "glittering generalities," instead of
                        marching boldly forward and grappling with the mighty events which are upon
                        us. We will not here particularize what we conceive to be positions fatal to
                        the peace of the country, assumed by some of these gentlemen. We simply
                        record our dissent from the general tone and tendency of their remarks. We
                        can never consent to an endorsement of a temporizing, indecisive curse, when
                        the fate of the nation depends upon a different policy.</p>

<b>Position of Virginia</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

                    Legislature has taken recently, as evidenced by the proceedings printed on page
                    one. The paper supports the recent appointments of men such as ex-President
                    Taylor and Judge Brockenbrough to a commission designed to settle the present
                    difficulties.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>An Unfortunate Move</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A.H.H. Stuart introduced an "exceedingly unfortunate" resolution in the
                    State Senate that stated that it was treason on the part of the people of
                    Virginia to attempt to take the forts and arsenals within the state limits. The
                    Vindicator believes that Stuart gave "the dignity and importance of Legislative
                    sanction to an idle and unfounded rumor." If he has any evidence that such a
                    movement is planned, Stuart should come forward. By publicizing this rumor,
                    Stuart has greatly inflamed Northern opinion.<br>

                        was too familiar with slaves. The daguerreotypist alluded to, is Mr. Berry
                        of this county, who is just as sound on the negro question as the
                        correspondent of the Dispatch or any citizens of Amelia. He was in our
                        office a few days since. He has now a certificate of his residence and
                        antecedents, with the seal of Augusta county attached, which we presume the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Sad Picture</p>
                    <p>It is a true saying that one half the world does not know how the other half
                        subsists. We were passing, the other day, along one of our principal
                        thoroughfares, when our attention was called to a most distressing
                        scene--one that made our hearts ache. Beneath a stairway that led down an
                        embankment were two poorly clad women, the youngest with an infant in her
                        arms. Around them were several pieces of old carpet and blankets, and near
                        by a coffee pot. They had remained there all the night previous, exposed to
                        the chilling winds of the season--no shelter, no home, no hope. The girl,
                        who a few months ago, was light-hearted and innocent, but had fallen,
                        fallen, was the very picture of despair. Hair disheveled, dress torn and
                        uncomely, she was crouched upon the floor of the porch, with her child
                        closely clasped to her bosom, rocking to and fro, evidencing in every
                        expression the deepest agony of spirit and soul. We felt keenly and sadly
                        for that outcast girl--houseless and homeless in the midst of winter's
                        storms, with scarcely a ray of hope to beam upon her broken heart. And who
                        was the other female? Her mother!--following her
                        child in shame and want, and clinging to her in the deep misery that
                        surrounded her, as only a mother can cling.</p>
                    <p>Fallen though they be, they are not yet lost. A friendly word, a kind act,
                        might stay the march of crime, and touch a chord of the heart that would
                        awaken other feelings and aspirations, and lift them out of the mire and
                        clay, and place their feet upon a rock. "Inasmuch as yet did it unto one of
                        these, ye did it unto me."</p>

                    the Cotton States. However, if no peaceful solution can be found, he will defend
                    Virginia's honor and rights.<br>
