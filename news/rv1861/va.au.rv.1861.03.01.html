<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln and His Friends.</p>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the New York Express writes: "The
                        mortification of the Republicans at Mr. Lincoln's recent speeches increases
                        with every fresh emanation from the Presidential tripod. They begin when it
                        is too late to [line illegible] allegations of the Union men of Illinois to
                        the incompetency of Lincoln for the Presidency. During the canvass, his
                        supporters appealed triumphantly to his published speeches as proof of his
                        ability. It now appears, as suspected at the time, that these speeches were
                        carefully prepared by Mr. Judd and other friends of Mr. Lincoln, revised and
                        re-revised, polished and re-written, to such a degree that they who heard
                        them on the stump could not recognize them in print. This was a part of the
                        game of deception played by the Republicans upon the people, to foist a man
                        upon the country for its chief magistrate who was never regarded by his most
                        intimate acquaintances, as anything more than a jocose, cunning, country
                        politician. I am assured by those who knew him well that a more illiterate
                        man it would be difficult to find, even among the self-made lawyers of
                        Illinois. His chief characteristic is an immense 'gift of gab,' and a
                        wonderful command of language, unaccompanied by a corresponding copiousness
                        of ideas. The election of such a man at such a crisis is undoubtedly the
                        greatest evil that has ever befallen this country. But the mischief is done,
                        and the only relief for the American people is to shorten sail, caulk the
                        hatches, put in the dead-lights, send down the topmasts, and prepare for a
                        hurricane."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Convention.</p>
                    <p>The sluggish progress of the State Convention in reaching the object for
                        which it was called, is bringing down upon the devoted heads of the members
                        of that body curses both loud and deep from a deceived and outraged
                        constituency. In session now two weeks, and yet not one step taken towards
                        the end contemplated by the originators of the movement, that of placing
                        Virginia in a decided position in the present crisis. They are now spending
                        daily between $1,500 and $2,000 of the people's money doing nothing. It was
                        not expected that the Convention would sit longer than ten days at farthest,
                        before it would either lay down an ultimatum and fix a time for compliance
                        without, or adjourn at once without doing anything. We are satisfied from
                        the material of which the body is composed that they will do nothing, and
                        therefore, as honorable men, it is their duty to adjourn at once, and
                        relieve the people of the burden of the expenses which daily accumulate
                        during its sessions. A majority of resurrected political hacks, whom the
                        people have time and again consigned to the shades of private life, have
                        control of the Convention. Unused to such distinction and bewildered by the
                        giddy height to which they have been elevated, they are totally at a loss
                        what [line missing] . . . [sym]pathy with the incoming administration--a
                        traditional, inbred and embittered hatred of Democracy--we cannot expect
                        anything more from them than to pass by in silence the stupendous events
                        that are crowding upon us and shaking the nation to pieces, and their labors
                        and energies to be directed to the consolidation of a party, whose paramount
                        object will be to defeat the Democracy and inaugurate the ascendancy of
                        Federalism and semi-republicanism in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Look at the leading spirits of the Convention. Janney, Scott, Goggin,
                        Flournoy, Summers, Stuart, Southall, Moore, and others upon whom the people
                        heretofore, when free from excitement and the influence of panic, have set
                        their seal of condemnation, are directing its deliberations. What care they
                        for the character and policy of the federal administration, so they can be
                        placed in control of the political fortunes of Virginia! In this connection,
                        we call attention to a letter written in Richmond for the New York Tribune,
                        and which we re-publish today. It will there be seen what is the impression
                        created in the republican ranks by the result in Virginia and the action of
                        the Convention thus far. We boldly proclaim it, that the policy of that
                        body, if persisted in, will bring on civil war, and drench this land in
                        brothers' blood.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>22nd of February.</p>
                    <p>This national holiday was appropriately celebrated by the military of
                        Staunton. Early in the morning the two volunteer companies--West Augusta
                        Guard, Capt. Baylor, the Staunton Artillery, Capt. Imboden, and the Cadets
                        of Henderson's High School, under their tutor, Mr. Henderson--formed into
                        line near the American Hotel, and proceeding through our principal streets,
                        accompanied by Turner's Cornet Band, marched to the parade ground, in the
                        northern limit of the town, whence, after going through various evolutions,
                        they returned to the place of starting. An encampment was then formed in
                        Stuart's meadow--tents pitched, guards appointed, and all the other minutia
                        of camp life strictly observed. The scene reminded us of other days, when
                        afar off, we experienced the romantic excitement and deprivation of actual
                        campaigning-- when all eyes were on the qui vive
                        for the stealthy approach of the red skins, or the evidence of their
                        whereabouts as given in the lazily curling smoke raising from the camp fires
                        in the distance. Forgetting that, although a peaceful sky arched above us
                        and smiling friends greeted us at every step, we were nevertheless under the
                        control of military discipline and regulations, we attempted to leave the
                        encampment and pass the guard line. No sooner were hailed, "who comes" [from
                        the] post than we [line missing] . . . knowing the countersign, we of
                        course, said nothing; whereupon the aforesaid sentinel bellowed out,
                        "Corporal of the Guard, post number seven." Four soldiers and the Corporal
                        came marching up as if to storm a fort. We instantly arrested them, and
                        proceeding with them to the officer of the day, Lt. Waters, we arrested the
                        commander of the company, Capt. Baylor, all of whom we released on the
                        conditions that they would treat to the refreshments necessary on the
                        occasion, and permit us thereafter to go whithersoever we listeth. These
                        conditions being complied with, and having partaken of the contents of the
                        mess chests of Capts. Imboden and Baylor, we vamosed the encampment, and
                        sought a retreat less exposed to the rigors of military discipline. We were
                        surprised at the promptness with which the tents were pitched and the
                        familiarity displayed with all the regulations of camp life. Considering
                        that but very few of the members of these companies have ever seen actual
                        service in arms, they exhibited a remarkable facility in the arrangement and
                        execution of all their plans. It evidences application of no ordinary degree
                        on the part both of officers and men.</p>
                    <p>At night a grand fair and entertainment was given at the new depot for the
                        benefit of the "West Augusta Guard." We have never seen so large an
                        attendance on any similar occasion, for the reason, we suppose, that
                        heretofore fairs have been gotten up for the benefit of some particular
                        religious denomination. But here Catholic, Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist,
                        Lutheran and Presbyterian made common cause, and contributed to swell the
                        crowd as well as the income of the entertainment. The nett [sic] amount
                        realized was over $600.</p>
                    <p>Altogether, the celebration of the 22d passed off very agreeably, and to the
                        gratification of our citizens. No unpleasant incident marred the proceedings
                        of the day, save an occasional boisterous demonstration from a disciple of
                        John Barleycorn.</p>

                    <p>The Main Question.</p>
                    <p>The gist and marrow of the question that now threatens to plunge our country
                        into civil war, will be settled in a very short time. It is whether the
                        doctrine of coercion or secession is to be recognized by Lincoln's administration. Of
                        necessity this point will have to be adjusted by Lincoln and his Cabinet
                        immediately after they are installed in office. If Mr. Mr. [sic] Lincoln
                        attempts to collect the revenue or to re-inforce the forts in the seceded
                        States, that will be a tangible evidence of a purpose to coerce. If not,
                        then the doctrine of secession will have to be recognized, whether as an
                        abstract question or as a matter of policy, is of little moment. Theories in
                        regard to this question effect only the past. At present it is a practical issue which must be decided promptly and
                        at once. We can scarcely believe that Mr. Lincoln will be so reckless of the
                        happiness of thirty millions of people as to attempt to carry out the
                        intimations he has shadowed forth of his views on this subject. We will see,
                        however, in a very few days.</p>
