<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Solemn Duty.</p>
                    <p>The remarkable course of the last Spectator in endeavoring at this time to
                        interweave party with the terrible civil war that is now convulsing the
                        country, and attempting to establish that it proves the correctness of the
                        policy of the "Union" party cannot fail to attract the attention of the
                        public. At a time when the people should be warned to prepare to defend
                        their households from the aggressive steps of a perfidious foe, the majesty
                        and sacredness of the occasion is insulted by covertly directing its efforts
                        to the resurrection of its old party. The brief, yet significant allusion to
                        "taxes" etc., shows that the wiry genius who wrote that remarkable letter on
                        the subject of "taxes," during the Convention canvass, is still cherishing
                        the hope of rescuing himself from the consuming wrath of a deceived people
                        and being restored to their forfeited confidence.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, throughout the columns of the last Spectator, there pervades a
                        persistent purpose to give vitality to party irrespective of the momentous
                        events that are startling the hearts of the people. While the leaders and
                        file of the Democracy are daring the canon's mouth, or giving efficiency to
                        the energies of the State in her grand and glorious efforts to defend her
                        honor, it would seem that some of the Union men have no higher sins than to
                        grovel in the ignoble work of county politics. Instead of casting bullets
                        for the defense of their firesides, they are more intensely engaged in
                        ascertaining for whom the votes of the people may be cast. We will not give
                        expression to our feelings at such conduct. We pray that the people will
                        turn away from such considerations to the solemn and terrible thought that
                        their homes may be invaded by a ruthless enemy, and to prepare for any
                        emergency. Be true to thyself, and then it will follow as the night the day,
                        thou canst not be untrue to another.</p>

<b>Augusta Riflemen</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    in the state, but also for having their uniforms made from cloth woven at the

                    <p>Augusta Riflemen.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Asher W. Harman has now nearly equipped his fine company of Mounted
                        Riflemen, numbering about 100 men. This will be one of the finest in the
                        State, and if opportunity presents, laurels will be won, for the dashing,
                        intrepid, fearless character of the captain will always lead to where the
                        conflict is fiercest.</p>
                    <p>Since the above was written, Capt. Harman's company has appeared in full
                        dress parade, presenting an attractive and truly soldierly appearance. The
                        soldiers themselves are not only Augusta men, but the cloth from which their
                        uniforms were made was manufactured at the Wollen Factory of Messrs.
                        Crawford &amp; Co. at this place. The County Court made an appropriation
                        of $3,000 to equip the company, but the actual cost will not amount to more
                        than from $300 to $500. Such an example of economy is worthy of imitation.
                        Augusta can well trust such with her credit and her honor.</p>

                    <p>We attended the drill of the Home Guard, Capt. W.P. Tate, on Tuesday night
                        last. We were impressed with the character of the men of which it is
                        composed. Numbering two hundred, who constitute the substantial manhood of
                        the community, some of them the oldest, we could not but think that if such
                        men were ready to shoulder the musket in the cause of the State, that we, as
                        a people, were truly invincible. Could Old Abe, in his mind's eye, have
                        taken a glance into Armory Hall last Tuesday night, he might have learned a
                        lesson, and that if somebody was not yet hurt, somebody might be in a very

                    <p>Interesting Letters.</p>
                    <p>We have received from Capt. A. Koiner and W.S.H. Baylor, the following
                        interesting letters, one dated at Winchester and the other from Harper's
                        Ferry. From both it will be seen that our gallant boys are in fine spirits
                        and ready for the work to which they have been assigned. Their pluck we know
                        and feel assured that when the tug of war comes the expectations of their
                        friends will not be disappointed. Courage boys, you have the sympathies,
                        prayers and confidence of those you left behind.</p>
                    <p>Winchester, Va., 20th, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--The "Augusta Rifles" marched for
                        Harper's Ferry at 6 o'clock A.M. on the 19th instant, under my command,
                        arrived in Winchester at 3 o'clock, A.M. this morning in safety, but very
                        much wearied, and are quartered for the present at the Taylor Hotel. We have
                        been very hospitably received and entertained. I have never seen such an
                        outpouring of popular feelings in behalf of the South. The ladies every
                        where appear as enthusiastic as the men. I heard one encouraging the men to
                        "stand up for our rights! If she (I) were a man, she (I) would go too!"</p>
                    <p>At this writing I do not know whether I will go to Harper's Ferry or not, or
                        stay here for further orders. I have telegraphed to Harper's Ferry, and will
                        hear soon. Our men are in fine spirits, and are very much complimented as
                        fine looking men. It is hard to tell where we will move next. We are in the
                        midst of a great revolution; our people are united as one man, and are
                        determined to maintain their rights at every sacrifice. "United we stand."
                        The Virginia spirit is as high, as gallant, and as patriotic as at any
                        former period.</p>
                    <p>Tell our militia to be prepared for any thing, and take a high and manly
                        position, with a determination to maintain it. We received several recruits
                        on the way hither, who could not wait for an order of the corps to which
                        they belong. A young lawyer of Albemarle, Mr. Montero, is one of the number.
                        He has made several flaming speeches in behalf of our rights, on the way
                        hither, and here, which were received with much enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>You shall hear from me occasionally, as I may have opportunity to write. We
                        have now, after much anxiety and labor, got our company so organized as to
                        be able to live at least. In great haste,</p>
                    <p>Yours, A. KOINER.</p>

                    <p>Head Quarters, 5th Reg't Va. Vol's.</p>
                    <p>Camp Hill, Harper's Ferry,</p>
                    <p>April 22d, 1861</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--My duty to the relatives of the men
                        composing my command makes me impose upon your columns a few lines. I am
                        glad to say that all of my men, with but one or two exceptions, are and have
                        been well, and in the finest spirits. A portion of my regiment, the West
                        Augusta Guard, and a battery of two pieces of the Staunton Artillery is now
                        encamped on the most romantic and commanding spots about Harper's Ferry. It
                        is the most important post here, and I have been assigned the command, with
                        old Augusta's boys, to hold it against any force. It is the post of danger,
                        and therefore the post of honour, and we will maintain it against every
                        enemy. You and your readers must pardon seeming vanity, Mr. Editor, for the
                        pride which I have for the gallant fellows under me, may make me exceed
                        propriety. Their conduct reminds me of the glorious deeds of our
                        forefathers, and their name and memory shall never be disgraced by their
                        sons. All of my men are contented, and have adapted themselves to the strict
                        rule of military life, and the arduous duties of the camp. Thanks to the
                        ladies, and our liberal citizens, we are the best equipt command, and if
                        they could only see us on duty, I know they would be satisfied that their
                        generous liberality was not improperly bestowed.</p>
                    <p>We have all been working hard, and Gen. Harman's command has been by far the
                        most active here, and I would not believe that any one could do the work and
                        lose the rest that all of us have done. I have not had off my clothes since
                        I left Staunton; I am sure I have not slept ten hours all put together. The
                        men work willingly, eat heartily, and sleep as soundly on the ground, as a
                        prince in a palace.--They are ready for a fight, and I believe are eager to
                        show their courage in driving back any invading foe. Great enthusiasm
                        animates all, and should the vicegerent of the arch-fiend dare send his
                        minions to Old Virginia, we will repel them, or leave the memory of brave
                        men for our friends to revere.</p>
                    <p>I wish Mr. Editor, you would draw a comparison between the soldiers here. I
                        am sure old Augusta would not suffer by it. The Staunton companies exceed
                        any here in number by at least twenty, whilst the county companies (Captain
                        Koiner's and Captain Crawford's) are larger than the majority of others
                        here. The 5th Regiment will be the flower.</p>
                    <p>I promised the friends of my soldiers that I would be a brother to them. I
                        intend to redeem the promise. I will spare no pains to make them
                        comfortable. None of them shall suffer. I trust their friends will give
                        themselves no trouble or concern about them. God is on our side. He will
                        defend the right.</p>
                    <p>We ask the prayers of our friends for our success. We will do our duties as
                        men--as men of Augusta. I write in greta haste, with a thousand things
                        pressing upon me. When more leisure comes, I will write fully to you.</p>
                    <p>Wm. S.H. Baylor</p>
                    <p>P.S.--If a fight occurs, we will be the first in it, and the last out of it.
                        We have Minnie muskets, which by our vigilance we captured, so we will be
                        paid for our trouble, even if we don't have a fight.</p>

                    <p>"The ladies of Staunton . . ."</p>
                    <p>The ladies of Staunton, and especially the pupils of the different Female
                        Institutes here, have entwined their brows with glorywreaths of evergreen,
                        which beautifully reflect the fresh and buoyant courage of their hearts. For
                        days they have been busily engaged in making the uniforms of the new
                        volunteer companies, scarcely permitting twenty-four hours to pass after the
                        order had been placed in their hands, ere the full uniform, neatly made, was
                        presented to the young soldier. What a touching evidence of the affection of
                        these fair daughters of Virginia and the South for the sunny clime of their
                        nativity. The sweet-heart caparison her lover, and with a smile and a tear
                        bids him go and dare and do, and then return for
                        his reward in the gift of the hand that fashioned the badge of his
                        calling--God bless the sweet girls, and God speed and protect the brave
                        boys.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter insists that a "false impression is abroad in the community as to
                    the action of the Mt. Sidney Union Greys." Only a few of the Mt. Sidney men
                    responded to a call that they meet in Staunton on April 17 because their leader,
                    Captain Crawford, was sick in bed. When the men were given official notice to
                    gather in Staunton on the 19th, however, they all were present. The letter
                    states that this should be a "complete vindication of the Mt. Sidney company
                    from any imputation upon their spirit and promptness in responding to the call
                    of the State."<br>
