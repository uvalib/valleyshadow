<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"A Crazy Legislature"</p>
                    <p>The Spectator has a very silly and indelicate
                        article under the above caption, in which it charges the Legislature, "by
                        nearly a unanimous vote," with having "pledged Virginia to fight the battles
                        of South Carolina." This is all twaddle, and an abortive attempt at
                        raw-head-and- bloody-bones to frighten the people. The call of a Convention
                        is to prevent war and bloodshed; rather than precipitate them. If any body
                        of men in the universe could be placed in a position to save this country
                        from carnage and civil war, it will be a Convention of delegates fresh from
                        the sovereign people of Virginia. It is admitted on all sides, that
                        Virginia's relations to the Union are such as to be more potential for
                        restoring peace and harmony than any other State. How would it be possible
                        to make known her wishes and position, save through a body authorized by the
                        people to represent their sentiments. Any action Virginia may take through
                        her Convention will be for the conservation of peace, if that is possible.
                        If War is inevitable, which we by no means believe, then what body so proper
                        as the Convention to define the purpose of the Old Dominion? Be the result
                        of our present difficulties peace or war, a Convention is the safest and
                        most legitimate body to act for the State.</p>
                    <p>The idea of pledging Virginia to fight the battles of any State is simply
                        ridiculous. If the madness of Black Republican fanaticism and treachery
                        should ever attempt to coerce any seceding State, the question would become
                        one embracing the constitutional rights of every Southern State that
                        repudiates the right of coercion, and the conflict would become one of the
                        South, defending the Constitution, against the North, violating it. In that
                        event, Virginia would have as many battles of her own to fight as she could
                        desire, without sending her armies to the cotton and rice fields of the
                        extreme South.</p>
                    <p>It is a conflict we desire to prevent. If we send the proper men to the
                        Convention, that conflict may be prevented. It is the solemn and sacred duty
                        of the people therefore, to come to the polls on the 4th day of February and
                        cast their votes for such men as they can trust, irrespective of Court-house
                        recommendations or partizan [sic] influences. There will be no infamy too
                        intense or degradation too deep, for the man whose craven soul would allow
                        party considerations or associations to decide these momentous questions for
                        him. A weightier responsibility never rested upon any people than the voters
                        of Virginia will be called to assume on the 4th of February. Let each man
                        meet it like a freeman, who in the sight of God and his loyalty to his State
                        and country, feels like proving his patriotism and asserting his adherence
                        to the Federal Constitution as framed by our fathers.</p>

<b>The People Against the Politicians</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Neither the President nor Congress appears able to confront the current
                    political crisis. Gen. Scott seems to be the only functionary of the government
                    who is taking any action, but he has adopted a policy of coercion. Nor can
                    Southerners look to the incoming administration with any hope. Mr. Lincoln has
                    been silent thus far, and it appears that Seward will be the dominant voice in
                    the new administration. Instead, the South needs look inward and must present a
                    unified front.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Court House Nominations</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator disagrees with the Spectator's suggestion that a Court House
                    meeting be held on January 28th to nominate candidates for the State Convention.
                    A meeting at such a late date would give the voters only six days to find out
                    about the candidates. To avoid the domination of a "Court House clique or packed
                    caucus," the candidates should announce themselves immediately through the
                    press.<br>

<b>Candidates for the Convention</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The men listed above have all announced themselves as candidates for the

                    <p>Candidates for Convention</p>
                    <p>It will be seen by their cards, that Gen. W.H. Harman and Capt. J.D. Imboden
                        have announced themselves as candidates for the State Convention, which
                        meets on the 13th of February, in Richmond. The names of two other gentlemen
                        are suggested, viz: Col. J.B. Baldwin and Hugh W. Sheffey, Esq. These
                        gentlemen all possess a high order of talent--either one of whom has ability
                        to represent the county in this important emergency. As it is our purpose to
                        ignore everything like party in this contest, and to lend our support to
                        those men who the most nearly represent what we believe the true interests
                        and honor of Virginia, we shall await the announcement of other gentlemen,
                        and the publication of their views, before we declare in favor of any. In
                        the meanwhile, we call attention to the cards of Messrs. Harman and Imboden
                        as containing sound and conservative views, well worthy the consideration of
                        the people.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the Vindicator</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor: The Ladies of Staunton propose holding a Fair for the purpose of
                        providing Tents for the "West Augusta Guard," on the 22nd of February--in
                        which they invite the ladies in the neighborhood to join them.</p>
                    <p>In view of the probable call soon to be made, on this, as well as all the
                        volunteer Companies of our State, to defend us against Northern aggression;
                        it seems needless to appeal to the patriotism of any of Virginia's daughters
                        to lend their aid, with willing hands and hearts
                        in this work of necessity, for the comfort of those, who have shown by their
                        prompt and efficient service at Harper's Ferry, that the spirit of "76"
                        still burns in the hearts of Virginia's Sons. Let then the daughters of Old
                        Augusta show that the same spirit actuates them, to cheer the brave Soldier
                        on, and by providing the necessary covering from the night dews and the
                        pitiless blast, the thought that the fair hands of mothers, wives, sisters
                        and those dearer than all have wrought this for them, will lighten the
                        vigors of the Soldier's life and inspire them with fresh valor.</p>
