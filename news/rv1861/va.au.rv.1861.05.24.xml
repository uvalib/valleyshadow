                    gradually and certainly involve England and France in our troubles. It requires
                    no prophet to foretell with what side they will act. All their interest, which
                    is the lever that moves the world, are identified with the South."</excerpt>

                <summary>In a letter from a New York broker to a friend of his in the South, the man
                    stated that he had lost twenty thousand dollars in the last few months. He fears
                    that the South cannot be subjugated, and he is "convinced of the foolishness of
                    continuing the state of affairs now existing." The Gazette calls this letter
                    "the first and only instance of returning reason among the deluded people of the
                    North" that it has seen in a long time.</summary>

                        therefore we do not give a table. It is ascertained, however, that about
                        twenty-three hundred votes were cast, and not more than <emph rend="italic"
                            >ten</emph> against the Ordinance of Secession. Taking into
                        consideration that about 1200 of the voters of the county are absent in the
                        service of the State, this is the usual vote of the county. There will not
                        be over <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> votes out of thirty-five hundred,
                        cast against "Ratification." Christian is elected to the Senate, and Sheffey
                        and Walker, and probably W.M. Tate, to the House. The contest is between
                        Tate and J.A. Harman, and is very close. Broun leads Holliday for the Board
                        of Public Works from 1200 to 1500.</p>
                    <p>We will publish the full returns hereafter.</p>

                        Ordinance. Hopkins, Woodson and Grattan are elected to the Legislature.
                        Broun beats Holladay for Board of Public Works.</p>
                    <p>In Shenandoah, a very large vote was cast, and unanimous for ratification.</p>

                <summary>Augusta county overwhelmingly supported the Ordinance of Secession in the
                    recent election--only ten of the twenty-three hundred votes were cast against
                    ratification. Twelve hundred voters were absent because they are in the army.
                    The normal vote of the county is roughly thirty-five hundred.</summary>
