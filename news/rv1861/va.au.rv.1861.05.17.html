                    <p>The Ordinance of Freedom.</p>
                    <p>The Ordinance which has been passed by the Virginia Convention, and which the
                        People will be called upon to ratify on the fourth Thursday in this month,
                        is commonly designated as "the Ordinance of Secession." Let no man be
                        induced to vote against it because of party prejudices against the name. It is in fact an ordinance of separation. It simply provides that we shall no
                        longer live in Union with them. Those Northern
                        States have refused to keep the faith which their fathers plighted to our
                        fathers; they first endeavored to rob us of our rights by electing men who
                        were pledged to administer the government to our ruin. Virginia implored
                        them to desist from their purposes. Virginia urged them to concede terms
                        under which she might continue to live in union with them., but they turned
                        a deaf ear to her entreaties, and are now in arms to reduce us to subjects.
                        Seeing this, the Convention of Virginia have ordained that Virginia shall be
                            free from the tyranny sought to be imposed
                        upon her by the Northern States. Is there a freeman in Augusta who will vote
                        against that ordinance and declare himself willing to be enslaved by the
                        North? An answer will be given on the day of the election.</p>

<b>Voters! To the Polls!</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Once again urges voters to adopt the ordinance of secession and warns that

</blockquote>
<b>Beware</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    is an "enemy of Virginia."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Beware.</p>
                    <p>While many of our young men and middle-aged are at Harper's Ferry to resist
                        invasion of Virginia soil by the minions of Lincoln, we hear that there are
                        a few men in the Valley who are still talking about the "Union." We look
                        upon such conduct as treason, and deserving the halter. Any man who now
                        votes against the separation of Virginia from the Northern States, records
                        himself an enemy of Virginia, and virtually invest the myrmidons of Black
                        Republican power to march upon and murder our brave soldiers now facing
                        death in defense of our rights. There can be no other interpretation given
                        to action of that character. Every such vote is a declaration of hostility
                        to Virginia and the South; and should be so dealt with. Mark the prediction:
                        the man who casts his suffrage against the Ordinance of Separation, will
                        regret it as long as he lives, and posterity will curse his children.
                        Beware, people of Virginia, how you vote on Thursday next.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that voters should not delude themselves into thinking that a vote

                    <p>Staunton, May 13, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:--I have had the honor to receive your note of this morning, asking
                        me to express "my opinion in writing," as to the course which the people of
                        Augusta ought to pursue in regard to the ratification or rejection of the
                        Ordinance of Secession with a view to its publication. I hasten to reply to
                        it, and as the editor informs me his columns are very much occupied, my
                        answer must necessarily be brief.</p>
                    <p>You all know I was a devoted friend of the Union. I was educated in the
                        belief that it was the palladium of our liberties, and the best security for
                        our rights at home and abroad. As such I cherished for it a cordial,
                        habitual, and almost immovable attachment. I thought it unwise for Virginia
                        to secede when she did. I believed that the proposed Border State Conference
                        would probably lead to a peaceful and satisfactory settlement of our
                        difficulties. But my counsels did not prevail, and the rash and ill-advised
                        proclamation of President Lincoln has induced Virginia, through her
                        Convention, to adopt an Ordinance of Secession.</p>
                    <p>The question now presents itself, what course our people should adopt in
                        regard to the Ordinance. In my judgment, it is the duty of all good citizens
                        to stand by the action of the State. It is no time for crimination or
                        recrimination. We cannot stop now to enquire who brought the troubles upon
                        us, or why. It is enough to know that they are upon us, and we must meet
                        them like men. We must stand shoulder to shoulder. Our State is threatened
                        with invasion, and we must repel them as best we can.</p>
                    <p>The only way to preserve peace is to present a united front. If we show
                        divisions among ourselves, the enemy will be encouraged by them, and make
                        them the pretext for sending armies into our borders for the purpose of
                        sustaining the bands of the disaffected. Our true policy, then, is to stand
                        together as one man in the hour of danger, and leave our family feuds to be
                        adjusted after the contest is over.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your ob't servant,</p>
                    <p>Alex. H. H. Stuart.</p>
