                    <p>Half Sheet.</p>
                    <p>We are able only to give our readers a half sheet this week. It will be seen
                        however, that we furnish almost as much reading matter as usual, as we have
                        thrown out all the Yankee advertisements except one or two that have paid in
                        advance. We devote our space almost entirely to the publication of news
                        relating to the present crisis.</p>

                        resolution of invitation, published elsewhere by the Virginia Convention,
                        will go far to bring about a result so desirable. Everything combines to
                        make Richmond the very place for the Southern Capital.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>No Pressing.</p>
                    <p>The impression has become almost general with our country friends that their
                        horses, cattle, sheep, cows, &amp;c., would be "pressed" into the service, and for the use of the army of the
                        State. We are glad to have it in our power to relieve them. The Governor has
                        issued an order expressly forbidding any and every thing of the kind.--We
                        hope therefore that our farmers and other who may have been apprehensive on
                        this point, will be contented with the assurance that there will be no
                        "pressing." Our most excellent, wise and able Governor has taken every
                        precaution to protect the people from unnecessary and unjust annoyance.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Object of the War.</p>
                    <p>To prevent any misapprehension on the part of our readers relative to an
                        expression in our paper last week, "that the war would be carried into
                        Africa," we make this explanation. Gen. Scott has extended the Military
                        Department of Washington as to include Pennsylvania and Delaware.--Should a
                        battle occur and we take Washington, then it will in all probability be the
                        policy of President Davis to drive the enemy from his position on Southern
                        soil. The base line of the operations of General Scott will have to be
                        broken up. This accomplished, the South will not advance one foot further.
                        We simply want our own soil relieved from the oppression of the North. We
                        want and mean to have our rights and our liberty, or else honourable graves.
                        We are acting on the defensive exclusively. We are repelling aggression. We
                        are defending our firesides and homes. "Lives there a man with soul so
                        dead," that he is not willing to spring eagerly to the trigger for such a
                        purpose?</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the editor of the Winchester Republican for implying that the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"The pretentious editor . . ."</p>
                    <p>The pretentious editor of the Winchester Republican, in noticing the Tenth
                        Legion troops, says that they used the "chaste and dignified language, 'hoggled' sure," when alluding to the result of
                        their contest with "old Abe." Now, we do not believe any such expression
                        fell from a single member of either company that went from any county in the
                        District. Those who compose the "Tenth Legion" companies are equally as
                        chaste and dignified as the editor of the Republican, and would certainly
                        not be guilty of a contemptible attempt to make sport when there was no
                        occasion for it. The idea having gotten out that the people of Rockingham
                        and Shenandoah were crude and uncultivated--nothing more false--it seems to
                        be the pride of pedantic and superficial scribblers to make them the text
                        for disguising and abortive witticisms.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Phillips desires to correct a statement in the last issue of the
                        Vindicator, calculated to detract from the merits of the many noble citizens
                        in Staunton, who are daily working to equip our solders for field service.
                        B. Crawford, Esq., at the head, was followed by all the merchants in town,
                        in selling their goods at cost, besides donating a part for tents, camp
                        jackets, &amp;c. The ladies, all over town, offered their services to
                        sew, and prepare bandages, &amp;c. and the difficulty has been to get
                        the work ready for them. The pupils and teachers at the Virginia Female,
                        Wesleyan, and Augusta Institutes have done nobly. The large band of ladies
                        at work in the basement of the Lutheran Church, and ladies at the Italian
                        Villa on Gospel Hill, the teachers and pupils at the Deaf and Dumb
                        Institute, in short, all the ladies of the town are ready to go on with
                        their efforts to equip the gallant old State to defend her rights. When all
                        have done so nobly, and are willing to do any thing in their power,
                        distinctions are improper, and, of course, were innocently made. A letter
                        from the Governor of the State promises us a plenty of work, and it is hoped
                        the ladies will organize themselves and be ready for action when the
                        materials are received. There is work enough for all to do, and every one
                        can assist in thus achieving our Independence.</p>

                    <p>About fifty free negroes in Amelia county have offered themselves to the
                        Government for any service.</p>
                    <p>In our neighboring city of Petersburg, two hundred free negroes offered for
                        any work that might be assigned to them, either to fight under white
                        officers, dig ditches, or any thing that could show their desire to serve
                        Old Virginia. In the same city, a negro hackman came to his master, and with
                        tears in his eyes, insisted that he should accept all his savings, $100, to
                        help equip the volunteers. The free negroes of Chesterfield have made a
                        similar proposition. Such is the spirit among bond and free, throughout the
                        whole of the State. Those who calculate on a different state of things, will
                        soon discover their mistake.</p>
