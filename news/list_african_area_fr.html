  Reports Douglass' visit to Chambersburg, but does not mention his meeting with John Brown. Compliments him on his oratory, but not his message.</p>

  Frederick Douglass "delivered a flaming address to his friends and admirers" in the Chambersburg Public Hall the previous Saturday night. The principal editor of the Valley Spirit, John M. Cooper, sat in the front row -- "evidently as the 'right supporter' of the sable speaker." This compels the Franklin Repository editor to ask, "What expedients will not that party resort to in order to rescue their sinking political ship? . . . Are they now about to don the garb of abolitionism?"</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/fr1859/pa.fr.fr.1859.08.24.xml#05">Franklin Repository and Transcript, August 24, 1859, p. 5, c. 3: "The Other Douglas. [sic]"</a><br>

  Black musicians from Maryland visited Chambersburg recently, and the Spirit's editors claim that they returned to Maryland more satisfied with their condition than that of their free black brethren in Pennsylvania. After the concert, they visited with their "free brethren" in Chambersburg.</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/fr1860/pa.fr.fr.1860.08.01.xml#04">Repository and Transcript, August 1, 1860, p. 4, c. 3: "Negro Voters."</a><br>
  Criticizes the Spirit's discussions on "negro voting." The Repository reminds the Spirit that free blacks in Pennsylvania did have the right a few years ago, and they voted for the Democratic party. The Whigs took away their right to vote, so as to take away some support of locofocoism in Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1860/pa.fr.vs.1860.08.08.xml#04">Valley Spirit, August 8, 1860, p. 4, c. 3: "First of August."</a><br>
  The Spirit mockingly describes the celebration of the First of August, which commemorates the emancipation of the slaves in the British West Indies. The article jabs at the Transcript for supporting "this grand 'bobolition selbration' by hoisting a flag, or rather a rag, tied on a rail, from one of its port-holes, on which is the picture of a Crow with the name of Abe Lincoln underneath."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.06.05.xml#02">Valley Spirit, June 5, 1861, p. 2, c. 2: "Horrible Occurrence."</a><br>
  Report on the lynching in Chambersburg of a free black man by white soldiers.

Article draws extensive details from the coroner's report.</p>
