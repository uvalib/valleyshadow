                <summary>Article takes great pleasure in recalling Democrats' 1856 claims to have
                    fielded the nation's only national party. Now they are the sectional party
                    themselves, it insists. It especially takes Northern Democrats to task for their
                    cowering subservience to the "lords-of-the-lash."</summary>

                <excerpt>"Connecticut, in wheeling into the line of Republican States, covered
                    herself with glory; and we say all honor to her gallant sons who have come out
                    of the contest with 'brows bound with victorious wreaths.' The march of Freedom
                    is steadily onward, and no earthly power can arrest its progress."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>"Freedom's battle once began,</p>
                    <p>Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son,</p>
                    <p>Though battled oft, is ever won."</p>
                    <p>Four years ago when the pro-slavery party of the South, aided by the
                        weak-kneed Democrats of the North, entered upon the business of making a
                        slave State out of territory covered by the Missouri Compromise, they little
                        dreamed of inaugurating a movement that would make wreck of the Democratic
                        party in the Free States, and build up a great Republican organization, such
                        as now bids defiance to the Slave power and is able successfully to resist
                        its further encroachments. And yet such is the result. In the language of a
                        cotemporary, "the effort to enslave Kansas has demoralized two
                        Administrations. It has driven three Democratic Governors into the
                        Republican Party. <emph rend="italic">It has given the seats of fifteen
                            Democratic United States Senators to as many Republicans.</emph> It has
                        spread the Republican banner in triumph over nearly every Free State." And
                        the signs of the times indicate that if wise counsels prevail in the
                        Opposition ranks, it will give us a Republican President in 1860.</p>
                    <p>The latest and one of the most brilliant triumphs of the friends of Freedom,
                        was achieved in Connecticut on the 4th inst. We predicted that the "land of
                        steady habits" would utterly repudiate the slave-led powers at Washington,
                        and the result shows that our estimate of the integrity and patriotism of
                        the people of that good old State was correct. -- The Republicans swept the
                        State like a purifying whirlwind, and the banner of Freedom now waves
                        triumphant throughout all her borders. The Slavery battalions, marshalled by
                        officers of the Federal Government, were met by the hosts of Freedom, and
                        driven back to their secret hiding places covered with confusion and
                        disgrace. That victory equals in brilliancy any that has yet been achieved
                        over the corrupt and imbecile Usurper at Washington, and the minions who
                        shout in his train that "thrift may follow fawning." Connecticut, in
                        wheeling into the line of Republican States, covered herself with glory; and
                        we say all honor to her gallant sons who have come out of the contest with
                        "brows bound with victorious wreaths." The march of Freedom is steadily
                        onward, and no earthly power can arrest its progress.--<emph rend="italic"

                    <p>--Hon. Owen Lovejoy, of Illinois, in a recent speech in the House of
                        Representatives, thus describes a party which is not so strong in the
                        country as it once was:</p>
                    <p>"The Slavery Democracy prates and chaters about 'negro equality, 'Black
                        Republicans,' and 'nigger stealing,' to use its classic phrase and improved
                        orthography. It has or affects to have, a great horror of 'niggers.' And any
                        one who advocates the principles of human Freedom, as they were enunciated
                        and laid down in enduring forms by the Fathers of the Republic, is a 'woolly
                        head,' and these same Democrats have learned to speak of them with a
                        peculiar nasal twist. You would suppose that these gentlemen, whose
                        olfactories are so sensitive and acute, never saw a nigger except in a
                        menagerie. And yet, would you believe it! the very first service rendered to
                        him on earth is performed by a nigger; as an infant, he draws the milk,
                        which makes his flesh and blood and bones, from the breast of a nigger;
                        looks up in her face and smiles, and calls her by the endearing name of
                        'mammy,' and begs, perhaps, in piteous tones, for the privilege of carrying
                        'mammy' to the Territories; he is undressed and put to bed by a nigger, and
                        nestles during the slumbers of infancy in the bosom of a nigger; he is
                        washed, dressed and taken to the table by a nigger, to eat food prepared by
                        a nigger; he is led to school by a nigger; every service that childhood
                        demands is performed by a nigger, except that of chastisement, which, from
                        the absence of good manners in many cases, it is to be feared is not
                        performed at all. When down appears on his lip, the tonsorial service is
                        performed by a nigger; and when he reaches manhood, he invades the nigger
                        quarters, to place himself in the endearing relation of paternity to half
                        niggers. Finally, if he should be ambitious, it may occur that he will come
                        to congress to represent a constituency, three-fifths of whom are niggers,
                        and talk about 'Black Republicans,' 'amalgamation,' 'nigger equality,'
                        'nigger stealing,' and the offensive odor of niggerism."</p>
