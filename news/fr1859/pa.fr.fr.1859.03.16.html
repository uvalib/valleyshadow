<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--From the Baltimore American, of the 8th inst.,
                        we are put in possession of the following facts, in which several of the
                        citizens of this county are involved. The American says:</p>
                    <p>"A few days since a man named David Dysart, who is well know in the town of
                        Waynesboro' Pa., went to the General Wayne Inn, corner of Baltimore and Pace
                        streets, and asking for the proprietor, Mr. Henry Fairbanks, proposed to
                        sell him a likely young colored man, stating at the same time that he had no
                        further use for his services, or he would not wish to sell him. After
                        several interviews, during which the colored man, whose name is James Henry
                        Lockwood, presented himself and declared that he was a slave, and had been
                        living with Dysart for more than six years. He also at the same time
                        expressed a desire to live in Baltimore, and said he would try and prove
                        useful about the establishment. A purchase was then made, and Mr. Fairbanks
                        paid the sum demanded, $1,300. A day had scarcely elapsed ere Mr. Fairbanks
                        received such information as assured him that he had been deceived, and that
                        the man was not a slave.</p>
                    <p>He communicated with policeman Hardy of the western district, and it was not
                        long before the parties learned that Dysart had been at the Golden Horse
                        tavern, kept by Mr. McGee. Both the officer and Mr. F. met at that
                        establishment, when Mr. McGee told them that Dysart had been at his
                        establishment, but had started for the three Mile House on the Hookstown
                        road, and thence the parties proceeded, but learned that he had not been
                        there. They continued the pursuit, and had scarcely passed a hundred yards
                        beyond the house before they came across the absconding party, He was
                        walking along the road in company with two strangers to him. Dysart was
                        taken in custody, and after undergoing a brief imprisonment at the western
                        police station, promptly acknowledged his action, and after refunding Mr.
                        Fairbank's $820 of the money which he had received, stated that he would
                        send for a friend and get the balance.--He accordingly sent for a man named
                        Joshua McCumsky, who soon raised the balance--$480. The money being paid,
                        Dysart was about to leave, but he was quickly informed that he would not be
                        permitted to do so, but must remain in durnace vile [?] until he was
                        regularly tried by court. He plead hard to be discharged, but of course it
                        was of no avail.--The key was turned upon him, and he was left to his
                        reflections in a dark and lonely cell. In the meantime the negro, who is
                        doubtless an accomplice, was also locked up. Justice Ensor appeared shortly
                        afterwards and committed Dysart to jail in default of security to answer the
                        charge of obtaining money under false pretenses, by selling a free negro,
                        and the latter also committed to answer at court the charge of conspiring to
                        defraud Mr. Fairbanks.</p>
                    <p>It is worthy of remark, that shortly before Dysart left the Golden Horse
                        tavern he gave McCumsky an order upon Mr. Miller, of Miller's Hotel (where
                        he had been stopping a few days,) for his horse and buggy wagon, telling
                        McC. at the same time that he would meet him at such a place with the same.
                        Dysart stated that he was of Winchester, Va., but it is well known that he
                        is a resident of Waynesboro'. The negro stated that he was but 23 years of
                        age, but it is evident that he is over 30.</p>
