                    <p>The Spirit, of last week, attempts to show that we
                        are inconsistent in advocating a protective Tariff, while we admit, by
                        publishing a week or two ago, an article from the Philadelphia N. American, that the business of the country is
                        reviving, although, as our neighbor says, the Tariff has not been touched.</p>
                    <p>We can answer the Spirit, on this subject, in a
                        very few words. The beggary of the National Treasury is evidence that there
                        is but little importation of foreign merchandise or other manufacturers. Our
                        merchants have been so much crippled by former importations, that foreign
                        purchases are now out of the question, and our manufacturers are putting
                        forth efforts to supply whatever demand may spring up in our markets. A
                        non-importation of foreign fabrics, whether produced by the operations of a
                        Tariff or the inability of our merchants to buy, must prove advantageous to
                        the business interests of our country; and if importations would cease, at
                        least to such an extent as not to injuriously interfere with the industry of
                        our own people, we would not care for a revision of the present Tariff. It
                        has been against the vast importations induced by the present low Tariff,
                        that we complain; and if those importations cease, from whatever cause, we
                        are satisfied. Is the Spirit answered?</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We announced, several weeks ago, that an effort was making to raise means
                        to purchase the necessary apparatus and to organize a Hook and Ladder
                        Company. A sufficient amount was subscribed by our citizens to warrant the
                        organization of such a Company, which was done by the election of Mr. James
                        King, President; Dr. James Hamilton, Vice President; Mr. J. S. Nixon,
                        Treasurer, and Dr. W. H. Boyle, Secretary. The Company, thus organized,
                        appointed a Committee, consisting of Messrs, Jas. King, P. B. Housum and J.
                        P. Culbertson, to purchase the necessary apparatus, with instructions to
                        visit Harrisburg and Philadelphia for that purpose. They succeeded in
                        purchasing the necessary apparatus, with instructions to visit Harrisburg
                        and Philadelphia for that purpose. They succeeded in purchasing the
                        apparatus used by the "Protection" Company of
                        Philadelphia, a very complete affair, at a cost of not quite $500.</p>
                    <p>This apparatus arrived on the Cumberland Valley Burthen Train of Cars on
                        Saturday afternoon last, and according to previous arrangements, the Protection Hook and Ladder Company were very
                        politely escorted to the Depot by the Friendship
                        and Hope Fire Companies, in full uniform, to
                        receive their apparatus, who took it in charge, and, preceded [sic] by the
                        Mechanics' Brass Band, who also kindly tendered their services for the
                        occasion, formed in procession and marched through the various streets of
                        our borough, presenting quite an attractive appearance, and were at last
                        drawn up in front of the Court House.--Here Mr. James King, through Capt. F.
                        S. Stumbaugh, who, in some appropriate remarks, presented the Protection Hook and Ladder Company with a very fine
                        silver-mounted Brass Speaking Trumpet, which had been presented to him by
                        the Protection Hook and Ladder Company of
                        Philadelphia--from whom this apparatus was purchased--and it was
                        received, on behalf of the Company, by Dr. W. H. Boyle, in a short but
                        suitable address of thanks. The several Companies then re-formed, and
                        marched to the House prepared for the reception of this new apparatus, where
                        it was deposited, and the several Companies then, in order, returned to
                        their respective Halls.</p>
                    <p>Altogether, this was a pleasant union of the Fire Department of our town, and
                        was as agreeable as it was pleasant. While we like to see an active, zealous
                        and earnest competition, with a desire to excel in usefulness, we know no
                        reason why a spirited rivalry cannot exist without exciting bad blood
                        between the several companies. With this new addition to our Fire
                        Department, and a hearty and friendly co-operation on the part of the
                        several Companies, our town is tolerably well prepared to subdue a
                        conflagration.</p>
                    <p>While we are upon this subject, we cannot refrain from saying, that inasmuch
                        as the Hope Company is provided with a most
                        excellent and powerful Suction, we think that the Friendship should be furnished with an equally good one. The one
                        now used by the latter, is not very servicible [sic], and although active
                        and prompt, a great deal of their precious time is lossed before their
                        Suction can be made to operate in forcing water through their hose. A number
                        of City Companies are now supplying themselves with Steam Fire Engines, and
                        are throwing their former Apparatus aside. Could our Town Council not
                        purchase a very good Suction Engine, thus thrown out of use, at a greatly
                        reduced price? We throw out this suggestion, and hope it will be acted upon.
                        Better or more active Companies no other town in the interior can boast than
                        those we have, but it is discouraging and disheartening for a Company to be
                        compelled to operate with an inefficient Apparatus, and to see all their
                        exertion and activity amount to be but little, owing to such a cause. We,
                        therefore say, let the Friendship be speedily supplied with another Suction,
                        or what would be better, with a Suction Engine.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--On Sabbath night last, between 8 and 9 o'clock, our town was again alarmed
                        by the cry of fire. A terrific volume of flame suddenly burst from a Brick
                        Stable, on the alley immediately West of Main street, on the lot occupied by
                        Judge J. L. Black, which, with its contents, were soon destroyed. The
                        several Fire Companies, together with the Protection Hook and Ladder
                        Company, were soon on the ground, and prevented the flames from extending
                        further. This fire showed conclusively the great utility of a Hook and
                        Ladder Company. A large portion of the valuable part of our town was in
                        imminent peril from this conflagration, and several houses on Main street
                        were on fire communicated by the flying embers. This was the property of
                        Judge Eyster, and we learn there was no insurance. The fire was the work of
                        an incendiary.</p>
