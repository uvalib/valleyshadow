<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The old complaint--a want of dwellings--is again heard in our town, emanating
                        from persons who are unable to procure suitable ones for the accommodation
                        of their families. Notwithstanding the large number of houses that were
                        built during the last season, there is still a scarcity of dwellings. Why is
                        it that monied men, who can now realize from 8 to 10 per cent. on their
                        outlays in building in streets somewhat remote from the business part of our
                        borough, and near double that per cent. on investments in more favored
                        position, do not build houses to accommodate those who wish to locate in our
                        midst? Why is it, that every spring, for several years past, we hear so much
                        about the scarcity of dwelling houses, and with all this increasing demand,
                        persons who could, do not erect buildings? It has been said that</p>
                    <p>"Distance lends enchantment to the view."</p>
                    <p>but the advantages our town possesses look quite as well on a close
                        inspection as at a distance, and we maintain that Chambersburg has
                        advantages for the business man and mechanic that can be found in but few
                        other inland towns in the State. Persons residing in other localities, on
                        visiting our town, finding this to be true, are crowding in upon us, while
                        others who have been raised here either do not see it or are indifferent to
                        the prosperity of the place, and do not heed the call for houses. Many
                        persons are prevented from locating in our midst, owing to the difficulty of
                        procuring suitable dwellings in which to move, and thus the increased
                        population of our town is retarded, and it business interests dwarfed.</p>
                    <p>We ask our monied men, in all seriousness, to take a walk of observation
                        through our town and suberbs [sic], and note the number of buildings that
                        were erected during the last few months, and then ask themselves the
                        question--Can it be possible that houses are still in demand, after so many
                        having been recently built? Then inquire of our brick-makers what stock they
                        have on hand for spring building, and they will find that it is very
                        limited, and should the spring be a backward one, building will be much
                        delayed in consequence.</p>
                    <p>We have heard of about twenty buildings that different persons have
                        determined to erect next season; but how far will that number go to supply
                        the great demand? As far as it goes, it speaks well; but the number should
                        be fifty instead of twenty.</p>

                    <p>On Thursday evening last, as we are informed, a ceremony of an unusual and
                        highly interesting character took place in the Hall of Columbus Lodge No.
                        75, of Odd Fellow's of our town. In accordance with a previous invitation,
                        proceeding from Columbus Lodge, the officers and members of Chambersburg
                        Lodge, No. 175, of our place, made a fraternal visit to their brethern [sic]
                        of Columbus Lodge on the evening named, in full regalia. The visiting
                        brethren were received according to the forms of the Order--an appropriate
                        Ode was sung, and a cordial welcome extended by William Adams, Esq., the
                        Noble Grand of Columbus Lodge.</p>
                    <p>The object of the visitation was to encourage fraternal feelings among the
                        brotherhood--excite renewed zeal in carrying out the objects of the
                        Association, and to interchange opinions upon matters pertaining to the good
                        of the Order. During the course of the evening addresses were make [sic] by
                        N. G. David A. Wertz; District Deputy Grand Master, Peter B. Housum, and
                        Bro. George Ripper, of Chambersburg Lodge, which were responded to by Past

                        Columbus Lodge, and David B. Russell, of Waynesboro' Lodge.</p>
                    <p>The meeting resolved itself into a Convention of the
                            Order, (there being members present from every Lodge in the
                        County save one) and it was resolved to hold a grand Assemblage of the
                        Lodges of the County, at this place, on the 26th day of April next--the 40th
                        Anniversary of Odd Fellowship in the United States, to be observed by all
                        the Lodges of the Order under its jurisdiction, as a day of Thanksgiving and
                        Praise to Almighty God for the many mercies and blessings vouchsafed to the
                        Order since its organization.</p>
                    <p>It is contemplated, we are informed to have a Public Procession--and several
                        addresses at the time indicated--the 26th of April next.</p>
                    <p>The visitation of which we have spoken, passed off very pleasantly, the very
                        best of feeling existed amongst all present, and there was but one
                        sentiment, and that was that it might prove to be only the first of many
                        such fraternal re-unions.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The very full report in this paper of the trial of Daniel Funk, for the
                        murder of John Osborn, occupies so much of our room that, for want of space,
                        we forego giving our opinion, at any length, of the scenes, incidents and
                        parties connected with the trial. The following must suffice:--</p>
                    <p>We were forcibly impressed with the noble dignity of his Honor Judge Kimmel.
                        His courteous demeanor toward the Bar and Jury; his forbearance extended to
                        the vast throng who crowded the Court Hall almost to suffocation, during the
                        entire progress of the trial; his firm determination that the trial should
                        be conducted strictly in accordance with the established rules of Law, won
                        the admiration of all who were in constant attendance upon the Court during
                        the trial. He manifested sufficient kindness to make all present feel
                        perfectly comfortable; yet he was altogether too firm to be moved, even by
                        the heart-stirring eloquence of a wife's tears. Nor was he the least biased
                        by the inginuity [sic] and weeping appeals of counsel. His charge, which
                        occupied just one hour, gave universal and complete satisfaction. No man
                        could have better performed the arduous duties devolving upon the President
                        Judge of the Court, at a time so truly solemn, as during this very important
                        trial, or held the scales of justice with a firmer and steadier hand than
                        did he.--The universal sentiment is: that no better type of the just Judge
                        ever sat upon our Bench.</p>
                    <p>The trial commenced Thursday morning and lasted till Sunday evening. The case
                        opened by an able and eloquent discussion upon the motion for a severance of
                        the trial, in which all the eloquent counsel took part. J. McDowell Sharpe,
                        Esq., particularly, distinguished himself by one of the most brilliant
                        efforts of his life, in behalf of the motion. After this question was
                        deposed of--which was done by granting the prayer of the petitioner--a most
                        righteous decision--the trial commenced by empaneling the Jury. The case, on
                        behalf of the Commonwealth, was then opened, (by a speech of 51 minutes in
                        length) in an able, eloquent, and attractive statement of the cause the
                        Commonwealth had for complaining of the conduct of the prisoner at the Bar;
                        a lucid explanation of the law of Homicide, and a beautiful and touching
                        allusion to the unfortunate parties present; as well the prisoner as the
                        chief witnesses for the State--the wife and children of the deceased, by I.
                        H. McCauley, Esq., one of the Associate counsel for the Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>When the testimony was all heard for the Commonwealth, the case was opened
                        (by a 45 minutes' speech) in a powerful presentation of the
                        aggravations--more than mortal could bear--to which the prisoner and his
                        wife were subjected from the Osborns; the many and important contradictions
                        of the main witnesses for the Commonwealth--making it altogether unsafe for
                        a Jury to rely upon their evidence, closing with a most pathetic appeal to
                        the humanity of the Jury, by T. B. Kennedy, Esq., one of the prisoner's
                        counsel. Mr. Kennedy is a ripe scholar, and bids fair to take a high
                        position at our Bar.</p>
                    <p>The evidence being all heard and the case marked closed, on both sides, the
                        arguments to the Jury were commenced by the District Attorney, L. S. Clarke,
                        Esq., who, by his magnificent method of summing up the evidence, his clear
                        and convincing style of presenting the truth of the case, won for himself a
                        high place among forensic orators of the day. Mr. Clarke felt the weight of
                        the responsibility resting upon him, and whilst he thirsted not for the
                        blood of the prisoner, yet his oath of office required him to do all in his
                        power to vindicate the outraged laws of the State; and all who heard him are
                        satisfied that the dignity of the Commonwealth is in safe keeping in his
                        hands. Mr. C. can take his seat among the ablest of our advocates.</p>
                    <p>Col. A. K. McClure then addressed the jury (in a speech of 2 hours and 25
                        minutes) on behalf of the prisoner. This eloquent gentleman held the vast
                        audience in almost breathless silence, for the great length of time which he
                        consumed, although hundreds of them had been standing for six hours before
                        he commenced. --No description of his great effort can be given by us. This
                        mastery display of genius, and skillful handling of the subject under
                        discussion, could only be appreciated by the hearer. His logical elucidation
                        of the testimony, and the lawbearing upon the case, we have no doubt, went
                        very far with the Jury in assisting them to arrive at the conclusion which
                        they embodied in their verdict. No person, who listened to that speech, will
                        ever forget its magical effect. It would have been very difficult to make a
                        stranger believe (which is strictly true) that the Colonel has been at the
                        Bar less than 3 years.</p>
                    <p>Col. McClure closed his speech, about 8 o'clock, on Saturday evening,
                        whereupon the Court adjourned till Sunday morning, January 23, 8 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday morning, at the proper hour, the Court called and as soon as
                        regularly opened. Hon. Wilson Reilly made the next and last speech, (of two
                        hours and a half in length) in behalf of the prisoner. This eloquent
                        champion brought into the arena all the skill, learning and ability, which
                        an extensive practice of 25 years has endowed him with. The task was great;
                        but he proved himself equal to it. He fully sustained the proud position he
                        has long occupied; and we cheerfully place him among the very first Criminal
                        law Lawyers in the State. His sympathy in fusing appeals to the jury caused
                        tears to flow most freely from eyes unused to weeping.</p>
                    <p>The whole Argument was concluded, (in a speech of 1 hour and 55 minutes in
                        length) by the other gifted and talented associate counsel for the
                        Commonwealth, Hon. G. W. Brewer. This was one of Mr. Brewer's most able
                        efforts. Feeling the importance of his position, and the formidable array of
                        talent opposed to him- he rose in might as the case required his gigantic
                        powers, and seemed all the more at home and at ease, in the midst of the
                        battle. Although our sympathies were enlisted in behalf of the unfortunate
                        prisoner, yet we could not but admire his superior elegence [sic] of style
                        and astute presentation of the strong points in the case. We have for a
                        great while entertained the belief, which has been very much strengthened by
                        his efforts in connection with this case, that a brilliant future awaits Mr.
                        Brewer.</p>
