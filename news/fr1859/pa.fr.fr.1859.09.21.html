<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>Springfield, O., Sep. 9, 1859.</p>
     <p>Messrs. Editors:--After an absence of a couple years duration, I determined to return to
      your vicinity, for the purpose of rusticating two months amid my old familiar friends, and the
      attractive haunts of other days. While on my way hither my mind was highly delighted with the
      majestic mountain scenery, which met our vision everywhere along the Pennsylvania Railway,
      me-thought that I had never realized their grand sublimity with a due degree of appreciation
      before. After arriving in Chambersburg, my attention was arrested by the evidences of
      improvement that met my vision on every hand. Splendid temples of trade, and excellent private
      residences, were taking the places of antiquated structures in rapid succession. After
      remaining a short time in your substantial borough, we started on our way to the hospitable
      village of Marion which had nourished and cherished us in our earlier years. With what joy we
      return to the places in which we whiled away the tedious hours of restless boyhood. How our
      bosoms throb with emotion, as we approach the hallowed influences that threw their shielding
      wings around us, to guard and guide us on our important journey over the sea of life. The
      first sound of our own Village Blacksmith's anvil is sweeter to us than all the music of
      harmonious instruments. After meeting with my dear friends and relatives at home, I went to
      visit an esteemed and venerable Uncle, and assisted him to gather in his harvest of golden
      grain. From his orchard we procured the golden apples and pears with much less bodily exposure
      than did Hercules obtain the same, from the garden of the Hesperides; and this luxury we have
      enjoyed many more times already than we shall in all probability enjoy again. We also passed
      by the "old Cedar School House."--Here, in former times, we underwent a domiciliation, and in
      all candor, we believe that then, the pupils gave many more practical examples of "Barter,"
      than arithmetical computations of the same. The chief commodities used in these shrewd
      business transactions were apples, nuts, rulers, balls, pencils, and pen-knives; and wo betide
      the unlucky urchin, who failed to get his goods concealed before the master approached too
      nearly; for if so fortunate as to aviod [sic] the confiscation of their property, there was
      imminent danger of their contracts being made void, and a proclamation in the "imperitive
      [sic] mood," requiring the restoration of exchanged articles, and these although apparently
      complied with were never actually obeyed, and the traffic though perilous was profitable.</p>
     <p>After wandering in delightful rumination through parts of your county, for the space of nine
      weeks, our time had arrived for leaving. This was the most regretful part of the visit. To
      turn my back on that time-honored village, with only one Federal officer, and the population
      of which is numerically diminished one per cent, by every emigrant from its precincts. But
      wonderful to tell; sometimes the quality is made much better by the exit of its inmates.
      Farewell, Dear Marion! mayest thou ever be worthy of the most devout reverence of thy departed
      sons. MARION PHILO.</p>

     <p>We protest against the late Locofoco County Convention reading its leading men out of the

      rebuke from the party for it; and afterwards the Convention passed a resolution which condemns

      elections; and it is well know that Messrs. Reilly and Nill used more money last fall in this
      County to carry their elections than all the People's candidates put together! If the  Spirit and the Convention kick leading men out of the Locofoco party,
      the party will soon be conveniently small and beautifully less.--If it was right for Nill and
      Reilly to use money freely a year ago to carry their elections, why should they be denounced
      for it now?--Was it done to cover the retreat of Douglas?--or was it done to wipe out a few
      small bills still standing against the party in this place?</p>

<b>"Old Buck" Subdued</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An humorous article that discusses how the Valley Spirit's editor, Johnny Cooper, and
     its owner, Judge Jerry Black, desire to win the Charleston nomination for President.<br>(Names in announcement:  Johnny Cooper, Judge Jerry Black,   ,   )</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>Soon after his inauguration "old Buck" became seized with the belief that he could
      accomplish more than has ever fallen to the lot of a Northern chief executive--secure a second
      term. He, therefore, the withered old celibate, the tenant at will of the people, assumed the
      most arbitrary course toward his life-long friends in order to drive them a little space from
      him to make room for those who had denounced him, in unmeasured terms for many long years. He
      did not design to quarrel with those who materially assisted in elevating so unworthy a man to
      the highest position in the world--the chosen ruler of a free people---he only intended
      pushing them a little beyond arm's length, within hailing distance however, so that he could
      call them to his aid when the proper time would arrive for their assistance; but they did not
      understand the harsh treatment and, taking him at his word, stepped outside of the circle of
      his immediate influence, and are now, for the first time since they commenced serving him,
      free men.--He made nothing by the movement. He only produced half-way friendship in the bosoms
      of his old foes by gathering them around him, and filling up his best offices with them and
      their friends; while he raised up an army of relentless enemies in those for whom his cold
      heart should have beaten with undying gratitude. Nor will he, thereby, succeed in having
      himself re-elected; for there are "giants" fighting against him.</p>
     <p> Other longing eyes are also turned in the direction of the "White House." Other covetous
      hearts, even among his principal advisers, desire to succeed the old man feeble. One of the
      most painful thorns in the old man's flesh is the "little giant"--the "lion" of the west. The
       "Unicorn of official power" has had, and is now engaged in, a
      fierce and bitter conflict, with the "lion of popular sovereignty."
      They, the "lion" and the "Unicorn," are
      fighting for the crown, when up jumps the little dog--the editor of the Valley Spirit--and threatens to knock them both down.</p>
     <p>Johnny Cooper, the editor of the powerful organ, (?) the Chambersburg Valley Spirit, and his employer, Jerry-go-nimble, have determined, in the wise
      counsel-chamber of the nation's Attorney, that one of them shall carry off the palm of
      victory, at the Charleston Convention. The matter is all settled. It is scarcely worth while
      for that mighty body to assemble. All the plans were fully agreed upon before the matter was
      considered sufficiently prepared for the eye of the party. For many long months they have been
      cogitating this very important step. Even for this same purpose--having himself puffed into
      notice by a powerful, (?) influential, (?) able (?) newspaper--did the astute Judge promote
      the editor of the Spirit from a third class clerkship, at
      Harrisburg, to being the private, confidential clerk of himself, at Washington. In view of the
      President's mania upon this subject, it was a bold step for the valiant pair to take.--The two
      great men of this mighty nation--Johnny Cooper and Jerry Black--knew that they were about
      playing a desparate [sic] game; were about to risk the fat places they now so lazily fill for
      the shadowy prospect of a doubtful honor--the nomination of one of them for President, in
      1860, with the almost certain prospect of defeat staring him boldly in the face.</p>
     <p> They had fully determined to risk the throw of the political dice box; but resolved, at the
      same time to subdue "old Buck." Accordingly, something like the following scene occurred at
      the rooms of the Attorney General, preparatory to its being reacted [sic] in the August
      presence. We push the door ajar, and, peeping into the private office of the Judge behold
      Johnny Cooper, mounted upon stilts, painted in full Indian war fashion, brandishing an adz for
      a tomahawk, grasping the chief of the Black-hawk tribe by the top-knot, apparently in the act
      of adding his reeking scalp to the many trophies of victory already attached to his belt. The
      chief, however, in acting his part of the farce, draws back, apparently terror-stricken, when
      the valiant Johnny finds himself master of the scalp without shedding blood--his hand holds
      the sham-work covering of the sham filled cranium. The Judge, seeing how well the thing was
      done, and observing how brave the little hero looked, declared it
      the height of perfection of the tragi-comedy [sic]. This being the rehearsal, and proving
      entirely satisfactory, the next step was to prepare the mind of the man before whom the scene
      was to be re-acted, so that it would produce upon him the desired effect--subdue him. Johnny
      not being a real Indian; only being a make-believe, it was
      necessary, before the performance at the white house, that he should acquire some kind of
      reputation as a desperate character. Accordingly, in order to
      appear courageous, and even terrible, the Spirit of the 7th inst., just one week before the appearance of the heavy leader,
      "Judge Black for President," through the pen of the redoubtable Johnny, gave utterance to the
      following ominous, threatening sentence:</p>
     <p>"Walnut and cherry are indigenous to our soil, and our cabinet-makers furnish coffins on the
      most reasonable terms."</p>
     <p> Thus the bruiser of the Spirit,
      "Jackey the giant killer," proclaims to the astonished world that it is altogether too
      dangerous a game for timid men to engage in--crossing his path, or thwarting his schemes. The
      fighting editor, the raw-head and bloody-bones, of the Spirit, must certainly have a private
      grave yard of his own, in which he has interred the victims of his bloody rage; for he speaks
      quite familiarly of our cabinet-makers. One could not, it seems, make enough coffins to bury Johnny's dead; it takes a number
      of them. If we can learn who Johnny's cabinet-makers are, we will enquire how much money they
      have made by making coffins for the thousands whom he has slain.</p>
     <p> We can readily imagine the subduing effect of the grand scene
      upon the feeble occupant of the chair of State, after reading this bloody prelude. The old man
      trembled in his boots--affrighted out of measure--as troops of ghosts from Johnny's grave yard
      passed in almost endless procession before his terror-stricken vision. No wonder then, that he
      was fully prepared to be subdued by the tragic feat of the histrionic pair. Having put up his
       chum for President, Johnny confidently calculates upon being
      Secretary of State; or piggy to lick up the dish water of the kitchen cabinet. No matter
      which, only so it pays.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The Spirit of last week devotes seven columns to Col. McClure. It
      evidently is afflicted with convulsions resembling hydrophobia, whenever it sees or hears the
      name of McClure. To follow it through its tortuous windings and slimy filth would be as
      distasteful as it is needless, and we shall leave it to enjoy its systematic blackguardism
      alone.--To vindicate Col. McClure from its impotent ravings, would be to attach degree of
      importance to its madness that no one either in or out of its own party concedes to it. That
      Col. McClure has ever libeled Dr. Boyle, no one for a moment believes. He has never named Dr.
      Boyle on the stump or elsewhere in his political efforts, and we presume he will be scarce of
      employment when he amuses himself in that way. That Col. McClure has been a faithless man
      betraying his friends and defeating his ticket, was left for the blind ravings of the Spirit to discover. The peculiar zeal of his friends throughout the
      County, abundantly shows his fidelity to his principles and to his friends; and the Spirit might save its falsehoods on that point. The last speech made by
      the lamented Crooks was made in Greencastle in 1857 to contradict and denounce the slanders of
      the Spirit clique. He declared there that no man supported him with
      more zeal and fidelity than Col. McClure. We bid the Spirit speed
      in its work of defamation and falsehood. Let it give seven columns of such vituperation
      against Col. McClure each week from now until the election and he will receive one thousand
      majority over Douglas in October next!</p>
