<b>The Spirit And The Campaign</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A complaint of the negative campaigning that has been done for this
                    election--especially The Spirit's attacks on A. K. McClure's characer and
                    private life. The Repository claims that a number of Democrats intend to vote
                    McClure and Eyster.<br>(Names in announcement:  A. K. McClure,   Eyster)</blockquote>
<b>Cincinnati Platform</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository notes that all the Democratic candidates stand by the
                    Democratic Platform, which is for Free Trade, and that the successful election
                    of any of these candidates is an endorsement of that policy. The Repository also
                    reports of complaints of lack of money--a drain on the Bank--due to money going
                    Europe to pay for imports.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Buchanan And Filibusterism</b><br> (Column a)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository points out the Buchanan is attempting to prevent
                    Free-booters--pirates?--from escaping the U. S. shore to Nicaragua. The
                    Repository thinks this effort should include a William Walker that the
                    administration gave much personal attention and then let go. It seems to be a
                    ploy to make the party look good just before elections.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Preference For Negro Labor</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository complains that not only are the Democrats and the present
                    Administration trying to prevent free whites from working and living in the
                    territories, but now also preventing them from working in Washington--instead
                    they are hiring slave to work as messengers, door keepers, etc. in the offices
                    of the government.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The locofocos profess to be very indignant when we call them the "Nigger
                        Democracy;" or charge them with preferring the labor of negroes to that of
                        white men. That they do we have never doubted. Every charge to that effect
                        which we have made was based upon observation of facts which all could
                        become familiar with, who would take the trouble to investigate the matter.
                        The President, his Cabinet, the Supreme Court, and every convention of that
                        party, use all the means in their peculiar situations, to exclude free,
                        white, working men and their families from every one of our territories,
                        upon which the haughty slaveholders may see fit to fasten their covetous
                        gaze. This fact is so patent that no sensible man will dare to deny it.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, another kind of preference for negro labor has developed
                        itself. They are hired to fill offices, in Washington City, which white men
                        would be glad to occupy; thereby excluding Free, White men from Offices
                        which belong as much to them, as to the purse-proud nabobs who fill any of
                        the offices under the Government. They, as the property of wealthy planters,
                        are hired, by the administration of old Mr. Buchanan, to serve as
                        messengers, door keepers, &amp;c., &amp;c., from their aristocratic
                        owners, and the wages for this negro office holding is
                            drawn by the Master. Truly, the love of the administration party
                        for the darkey is amazing. How do the hard-working white men of the North
                        like this preference? When will working men get their eyes open to the true
                        position of the labor-crushing party which professes to be the poor man's
                        friend? All they care about working men is to get their votes. Are they not
                        truly, and emphatically the Nigger Democracy? Are they not the lovers of
                        darkey labor? rather than the true friends of
                        white men. Who ever heard of the like? negroes holding office under a
                        democratic (?) administration, and hundreds of poor white men out of
                        employment.</p>
                <br>
</blockquote>
<b>Adopted Citizens</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository points out to naturalized citizens the mistreatment they
                    receive from the Democratic party, including verbal abuse from a Senatorial
                    candidate who calls any adopted citizen unworthy if he does not vote Democratic.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>McClure's Vote</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository responds to the Spirit's claim that A. K. McClure has split
                    his ticket in the past; The Repository has Jacob Henninger, known to be an
                    honest man, swear that he examined McClure's ticket, just before he handed it
                    in, and the ticket was straight Republican. The Repository is confident that
                    James Crawford will not be insulted that McClure did not vote for him (as the
                    Spirit had claimed).<br>(Names in announcement: Col. A. K. McClure,  James Crawford,  Jacob Henninger)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since we informed the Spirit of the manner in
                        which their candidate for State Senator has been voting, every time McClure
                        has been in the field, they have conceived [sic] the idea of retaliating, by
                        making a similar charge against our candidate--Col. A. K. McClure. But,
                        fortunately for the Col., if any body in our party has any doubt about his
                        having voted the clean People's ticket, he can prove by that high minded,
                        honorable man, that first-class citizen Mr. Jacob Henninger--one of God's
                        noblest works, and honest man--all about how he voted. Mr. Henninger will
                        swear, when called upon so to do, that he examined the Col's ticket, just before he handed it into the window, and, was him
                            giving the same ticket to the Inspector, it was the Opposition
                        ticket from top to bottom--the clean wheat--not a locofoco name on it. Try
                        some thing else, neighbor. That card will not win. McClure's political
                        record, and his private character--the Spirit's
                        statements to the contrary notwithstanding--are altogether too correct to
                        suit the depraved nature of the Spirit's
                        editor--in all the Sprit's [sic] charges against
                        him, the wish is father to the thought. The petty insinuation that he
                        scratched honest James Crawford is too trifling to require refutation. Nor
                        will it cause Mr. Crawford to feel unkindly toward Col. McClure. He knows
                        him too well to allow anything the Spirit can say
                        to effect [sic] his feelings toward him.</p>

<b>One Of The Dodges</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>J. Wyeth Douglas tries to save face for having voted for A. K. McClure in
                    past elections, by getting Mr. McGuaghy to claim that Douglas successfully

<b>Too Sly To Be Caught. Pete On Guard Again!</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository meets the challenge of the Spirit to get a copy of the
                    Valley Spirit's saturday issue before the election. The article lists the the
                    caption of each article in the Spirit, and notes the complaint that some
                    Democratic tickets have McClure's, Eyster's, and Mcgrath's names printed on
                    them.<br>(Names in announcement:   McClure,   Eyster,   McGrath)</blockquote>
<b>Lager Beer Dutch</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>

                    Beer Dutch," and astonishment that they could ever expect the Germans' support
