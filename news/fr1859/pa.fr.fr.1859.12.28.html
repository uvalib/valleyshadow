                    <p>--Again have the good people of Chambersburg been entertained with an
                        exhibition of the histrionic powers of the young gentlemen of Mr. John K.
                        Shryock's class of pupils.</p>
                    <p>The performance at Franklin Hall on Monday evening last could not be excelled
                        by anything short of star actors of great
                        ability, and large experience.</p>
                    <p>The play is entitled "Used Up;" a Comedy in two acts, by Charles Matthews.

                    <p>The best evidence of the appreciation, by our people, of these successful
                        effort of Shryock to please, is the fact that on this occasion, as on all
                        former ones, the house was crowded.</p>
                    <p>Another entertainment, with an entirely new programme, will be given on next

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--Our polite, obliging ex-Sheriff, Jacob S. Brown, Esq., has furnished us
                        with the following record of inmates who were received by him, into our
                        County jail, during his term of office which expired last month.</p>
                    <p>From the 11th day of November, 1856, till the 22nd day of November, 1859, the
                        whole number of whites admitted into jail was 256--of these 8 were females.
                        The whole number of colored persons taken in during the same period was
                        157--of which 24 were females. These were all incarcerated for some one or
                        other of the various crimes know to our criminal code.</p>
                    <p>There were during his term, also 200 persons committed to prison, for a short
                        period each, for intemperance--being too drunk to take care of themselves.
                        They were common drunkards; poor men, without
                        rich, influential friends--all others can get drunk with impunity.</p>
                    <p>Of the number of prisoners placed under Sheriff Brown's custody, 6 broke
                        jail. The frequent recurrence of this amusing
                        feat on the part of our "jail birds" taught our County Commissioners that
                        there was no security in the jail. They, therefore, repaired the whole
                        inside of that establishment, for security, and made it impossible for any more such performances--not set down in the
                        jail bills. They also repaired the outside of the building, for beauty and
                        made it one of the prettiest buildings in town.</p>
