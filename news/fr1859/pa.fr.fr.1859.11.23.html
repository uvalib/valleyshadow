<b>General Houston and the Ladies.</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a recent speech, Gen Houston talks of the woman's behind-the-scenes influence on her
     husband--militarily or politically--and that the attendance of women at his speech indicates
     their husbands and male relatives must be intelligent.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>Gen. Sam Houston lately delivered a capital speech at the South, and his peroration is so
      beautiful a panegyric of the ladies--a panegyric of whom, irrespective of politics, we must
      all agree to--that we publish it entire, hoping the sex will appreciate it:</p>
     <p>"Ladies, I know that politics are always uninteresting to you, yet I believe you have in the
      general result an abiding interest. It is always a gratification to me to behold my fair
      countrywomen in assemblages like these. It is a guarantee that their husbands and fathers and
      brothers are men of intelligence and refinement, who appreciate their mental capacities, and
      desire their countenance in their undertakings. Your presence exercises a calming influence
      upon those antagonisms which are too often engendered in the heat of political contests. All
      parties desire your approving smile, and therefore are encouraged by our presence. I know that
      in the direct administration of political affairs you have no share; but yet, reigning as you
      do, supreme in the realm of love, your influence often controls the destiny of nations.
      Woman's love is the great lever which arouses man to action. The general, as he plans the
      strategic combinations which are to insure victory, look [sic] forward to a recompense dearer
      than the laurels upon his brow; the soldier as he trudges along on his weary march, or mingles
      in the scenes of the battle field, even with death around him, forgets awhile the carnage, and
      turns his thoughts to the fond girl he left behind him; the mariner, tempest tossed, driven by
      the rude waves, sings merrily aloft as he thinks of the little cottage by the shore, where his
      wife and dear ones await him; the statesman, as he devises amid deep and painful thought,
      plans of government, which are to tell upon his own and his country's fame, never loses sight
      of the joys which await him when cabinet councils are over, and he enters the portals of home;
      the sentinel, as he paces his weary watch, loves the moonlight tramp, that he may look beneath
      its rays at the dear moments of a beloved mother's or a fond sister's love. Over man in all
      his relationships, the influence of woman hangs like a charm. Deprived of her influence, which
      dignifies and stimulates us to noble deeds we become worse than barbarians. Let it be our's,
      and we can brave the cannon's mouth or face danger in ten thousand forms. You stimulate all
      that is good. You check in us ignoble purposes. You have also an important influence upon
      posterity. The early impressions which the child receives from you, outlive all the wisdom of
      latter days. Sages may reason, and philosophers may teach, but the voice which we heard in
      infancy will ever come to our ears, bearing a mother's words and a mother's counsel. Continue
      to instil [sic] into your children virtues and patriotism. Imbue them with proper veneration
      for the fathers of liberty. Learn them to love their country, and to labor for its good, as
      the great end of their ambition. Bid them proudly to maintain our institutions. Point them to
      the deeds of their ancestors. Make these their escutcheon. and bid them hand it down to their
      children as free from stain as it came to them. Do this, ladies, and your influence will not
      be lost in the future. In the language of the poet, it will still be said:</p>
     <p> "Woman is lovely to the sight, <br> gentle as the dew of even, <br> As bright as
      morning's earliest light, <br> And spotless as the snows of Heaven."</p>
    <br>

<b>Federalism Intensified.</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An argument that Jefferson's Democratic party is very different than Buchanan's modern
     version; that Jefferson created the party to prevent the strengthening of the central
     government; Buchanan's administration is doing just the opposite.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Money Market</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article, which begins with a reprint form the Philadelphia Ledger, discusses the
     evils of spending beyond ones means, and the Repository continues the argument by applying it

</blockquote>
<b>The Irrepressible Conflict</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article argues that the locofoco papers are the South's worst enemies, because of
     their inaccurate accusations that the Harper's Ferry incident is a result of Republican
     doctrine. The Repository wants to remind Democrats that Thomas Jefferson spoke out against the
     evils of slavery, and of the retribution God will take on a people upholding such a system.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Dissolution Of The Union Postponed</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to Southern secession threats if the Nothern states carried Republican
     candidates in the recent election--Republicans did carry many Northern states, and yet the
     South has not seceded; perhaps the election of a Republican President will provoke it.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Confederation Of Free States.</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reminds readers (and Democrats) that the concept of a Confederation of
     Free States--free of slavery-- was espoused by George Washington. The Repository proposes that
     the Valley Spirit would probably call Washington an abolitionist and a "freedom shrieker."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Buchanan On The Supreme Court</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reprints a speech (given in 1841) of Pres. Buchanan, in which he claimed
     that he would never want the Court to be the final arbiter on between the Government and the
     people on the question of constitutional liberty--a direct opposition to what occurred with
     Judge Taney and the Dred Scott decision.<br>

</blockquote>
<b>The Next Presidency</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Telegraph argues that the most important duty at the February convention will be a

     Cameron or someone else.<br>
