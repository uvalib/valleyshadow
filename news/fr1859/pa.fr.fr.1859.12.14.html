<b>Was It Treason Then?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article lists quotes of famous American leaders (mostly from the
                    American Revolution period) who spoke against the institution of slavery, and
                    the editors argue that these men were not accused of treason whereas anyone who
                    speaks the same thought now are considered traitors.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Congress</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A mention of the House of Representatives not being organized yet, due to
                    locofocos protracting the vote for Speaker of the House, by causing agitation
                    with the slavery issue.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Lottery Advertisements.</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors complain of Lottery advertisements sent to the Repository; they
                    refuse to print such advertisements that encourage gambling.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Backing Down</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Stevens, one of John Brown's men, was handed over to the Federal Courts, in
                    order to accuse prominent Republicans without ever actually bringing them to
                    court--it was thought Stevens would die from his wounds, but now he is actually
                    recovering, and the Fed. Court will have to back down from their unfounded
                    accusations.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Capture Of John Brown's Cabin</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A humorous look at the company of soldiers that 'attacked' John Brown's
                    empty cabin hideaway in Harper's Ferry.<br>

<b>Important Case</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reprints an article from the Baltimore Sun that covers a
                    trial in which a man retrieved two women from Pennsylania back to Maryland on
                    the premise that they were slaves (although they had been freed 3 years prior).
                    The Repository feels that there is a 'covert desire' to have the case reviewed
                    by the Supreme Court in order to test the constitutionality of the Act of
                    Assembly of 1847, punishing Kidnapping.<br>

<b>Hang The Traitor</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article discusses Southern outrage at a book, written by Hinton Rowan
                    Helper, that talks of the evils of slavery and the impending doom for a culture
                    that supports slavery. The writer proposes a plan of ostracizing slave-holders(
                    just as the slave-holders are doing to the poor white laborers).<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Incendiarism</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article points out that sometimes the Northern Democrats journals
                    sometimes reveal their true, but usually secret, dislike of cowtowing to the
                    Southerners. An example is given with the Carlisle Volunteer which describes the
                    evil barbaric people of Morocco who have slavery for sport.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>For Governor !</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository suggests that Henry S. Evans, of Chester County and editor
                    of the Village Record who has served in Congress (both houses), would make an
                    excellent candidate for Governor.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Brave Man</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository praises E. Etheridge, a U. S. representative of Tennessee,
                    who pronounced in favor of the Republicans and against the corrupt Democratic
                    Administration.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Two Cases Contrasted</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Tribune compares two cases on slavery issues: in Charleston, a group of
                    slave traders are declared "Not Guilty" although the evidence (including a cargo
                    of chained Africans) was overwhelming; the other case, in Ohio, involved the
                    conviction of one man (the trials of the other 19 are pending) for aiding in the
                    escape of a slave. The Tribune notes that Democrats praised the upholding of the
                    Fugitive slave law, but said nothing as to the violation of the Slave Trade law.<br>

                    force Slavery into the territories which has resulted in battles and John
                    Brown's raid. The Republicans simply want to get the Federal Government back to
                    its earlier position on slavery settled in 1820.<br>
