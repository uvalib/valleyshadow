<b>First Duty Of Congress</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository argues that the first duty of Congress, when it meets in a
                    few days, will be to relieve the country from its financial condition. The
                    Government spends much more than the revenue it receives from the Free Trade
                    Tariff of 1857, and due to the large import of foreign-made goods, millions of
                    Americans are unemployed. An economic crash is inevitable, unless thwarted by
                    Congress (with a Protective Tariff?).<br>

<b>The Electoral College of 1860.</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article compares the sums of the electoral college in the North (183)
                    to that of the South (120), and suggests that even if a few states should vote
                    with slavery (Illinois, Indiana, California and Oregon), the North would still
                    have a majority--and so it is crucial that the North unite behind the Republican
                    Presidential Candidate.<br>

<b>The Pennsylvania State Journal very . . .</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article accuses the Democrats of blind partizanship in supporting Gov.
                    Wise, and points out that the Republicans are not guilty of the same--they have
                    not supported John Brown.<br>
