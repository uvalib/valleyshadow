<b>The Next President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the Harrisburg Telegraph, most of the Opposition papers in Pennsylvania
     favor Gen. Simon Cameron as the anti-Democratic candidate for next President. The editors
     believe this native of Franklin county capable of appealing to the various Opposition parties,
     comprised of "Old-Line Whigs, Old-Line Democrats, Republicans and Americans" and that a united
     Opposition is necessary to defeat the "offensive pro-slavery platform" the Democrats will
     undoubtedly unveil at the forthcoming Convention in Charleston, S.C.<br>(Names in announcement: Gen. Simon Cameron)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The Opposition papers of Pennsylvania[,] says the Harrisburg Telegraph with but few exceptions, have spoken out in favor of Gen. Simon Cameron as
      the anti-Democratic candidate for next President; and in a number of counties the people, in
      mass meeting assembled, have declared him to be the man of their choice. A correspondent of a
      prominent journal in the western part of the State, assuming that, the so-called Democratic
      National Convention which is to assemble at Charleston in 1860, will, under the whip of its
      Southern masters and the miserable subserviency of their Northern allies, promulgate an
      offensive pro-slavery platform, argues that it "becomes imperative upon the Opposition to seek
      some candidate who can unite the various parties and associations that will be arrayed against
      the so-called Democratic nominee.</p>
     <p>We can safely anticipate that every element now opposed to the general Administration will
      next year occupy an antagonistic position to that of the Charleston Convention; and these are
      chiefly comprised under the name of Old-Line Whigs, Old-Line Democrats, Republicans and
      Americans, forming a large majority of our legal voters, and capable, with a thorough union,
      of defeating with ease both the popular vote and the votes of the Electoral Colleges, the
      great slavery party of the country. Still, the writer thinks that, "separately and
      single-handed, neither the old-line Whigs, the old-line Democrats, the Republicans or the
      Americans can be pitted against the Charleston nominees with any hope of success; yet the very
      weakness of those parties, individually, warms within them a desire to make common cause
      against the common enemy, and they only await the presentation of a suitable Presidential
      candidate, with an affinity for each, to unite in one grand and successful effort their
      various integuments of strength. Such a candidate is presented in the person of Gen. Simon
      Cameron.</p>
     <p>The old-line Whig, longing for the protection of American industry, will find it in Gen.
      Cameron, the able, bold and tenacious champion of his cause. Nor is this a new impromptu idea
      with him, gotten up for the purpose of trolling men of this political caste into his support.
      In years gone by, and in defiance of the discipline of his party, too, in the Senate and out
      of it, he has been the zealous an[d] efficient advocate of protection, and these principles he
      still maintains. The old-line Democrat, glorying in the balmy recollections of Jacksonism
      which firmly knit our beloved Union by meting out "equal and exact justice" between the States
      and to all sections; "protecting the States severally from the encroachments of the General
      Government," and sternly resisting all "special privileges which make the rich richer and poor
      still more poor," will find a brother of his political faith in Gen. Cameron, who wore his
      spurs under the Old Roman. The American, opposed to emptying the alms-houses and prisons of
      Europe of their felons and paupers, and transporting them to this country by the shipload will
      find in Gen. Cameron one who ever has and ever will stand shoulder to shoulder with him in
      this work of reform. And last, though not least, the Republicans will find a companion in arms
      in Gen. Cameron who was one of the god-fathers of the party when it was baptized in the fire
      of the Fremont campaign, and who has sustained its measures most determinedly ever since.
      These affinities and combinations forming a basis of easy and harmonius [sic] union on Gen.
      Cameron, should be enough of themselves to make him the Presidential candidate of the
      Opposition in 1860, but they by no means display all his strong points for that position.</p>
     <p>"Gen. Cameron's history is one of romantic interest, which cannot fail to arrest popular
      attention and arouse popular enthusiasm. -- There is much in the varied incidents making up
      the life of the poor Printer boy, who clambers the ladder of moral and intellectual excellence
      from his humble calling to so giddy a height in the galaxy of Senators and statesmen that the
      Presidency itself is probably within his reach, which goes directly to every emotional heart,
      exciting a generous and growing interest in the progress of the lonely and hardy adventurer.
      There has been nothing in Gen. Cameron's success to remove him from the people. When seated
      with Senators he is as emphatically a man of the people as he was when he entered on man's
      estate. Himself a laborer, he early learned [t]o appreciate the dignity of free labor, and
      there is no man living who champions for it with more sympathetic feeling and more devotion.
      Both in the Senate and in the walks of private life he has defended it with a beautiful
      consistency, sustaining a protective tariff on the one hand to rescue our industry and arts
      from the competition of the pauper labor of Europe, and on the other resisting all
      encroachments of the South upon free Territories which were calculated to degrade and diminish
      the profits of free labor by the introduction of slave labor. During our war with Mexico, too,
      most of the leading measures of the Senate, intended to imbue our common soldiers with true
      soldierly principles, and to elevate their condition, originated with Gen. Cameron. And here
      let us say that Gen. Cameron possesses in an eminent degree that high courage which we all
      love to see displayed, when there is a necessity for it, either in the defence [sic] of one's
      honor or person. On more than one occasion he has shown that dauntless disregard of personal
      danger that has illustrated every page of our country's history with the names of heroes in
      good old Pennsylvania born. Let us all join, then in hearty, determined, preserving efforts
      for the poor Printer boy, the brave, good man of the people, the soldier's friend, the
      enlightened and patriotic statesman, Gen. Simon Cameron."</p>
     <p>To which we add, that Franklin County is deeply interested in elevating Gen. SIMON CAMERON
      to the Presidency. He is a native of this County -- having been born near Waynesboro' in
      Washington township. The present incumbent is also a native of our County; but he has
      disgraced us so badly that it is every way important that we should send another of our sons
      to the white House, to redeem our character from the infamy which Buchanan has cast upon
     it.</p>

<b>Wisdom of the Acts</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article praises the acts of the Pennsylvania assembly that provided for the sale
     of the state-owned Public Works. Selling the money-draining canal and railroad system is
     allowing the state debt to be reduced at the rate of one million dollars a year, and taxes will
     supposedly be reduced as well. The author then shamelessly plugs Col. A. K. McClure as one of
     the men responsible for the passage of the bills and deserving of the People's vote.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. A. K. McClure)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>As time rolls on, and the excitement incident to their passage dies away, the wisdom of the
      acts of Assembly which provided for the sale of the Public Works, becomes more and more
      apparent. Before long all candid men, of whatever party, will admit, that the State at large,
      and all her citizens who have to bear upon their Houses, Lands, Trades and Occupations, the
      heavy burthens incurred by the Commonwealth in erecting the Canals and Railroads, which have
      borne us down for thirty years, and from which we are at last relieved, have been greatly
      benefited [sic] by the legislation that cast from our weary shoulders the oppressive load.</p>
     <p>Those honest tax payers who still remain in the ranks of the sham
      Democracy, because their fathers, many long years since, belonged to a genuine Democracy, and who were actuated by their party leaders to oppose the sale of
      the State Works, will soon be able to see for themselves, by the difference in the amount of
      their taxation -- which, after all, is the surest way of teaching the hard-working thonsands
      [sic] the wisdom of those laws -- who are their true friends; the canting, hypocritical
      locofocos who pretended that our dear old State would suffer loss by parting with her great
      thoroughfares, but whose policy was adding steadily to their already almost unbearable weight
      of taxes; or the honest advocates of measures for disposing of these pecuniary sinks of
      corruption and profligacy, whose accomplishment has produced such glorious results, already.</p>
     <p>We defy the whining enemies of the sale of the public improvements to show one bad result as
      the cousequence [sic] of partiug [sic] with those plague-spots upon our body corporate. We
      challenge any one of these partisans to show any good the people enjoyed as a result of the
      State owning the Public Works, which is in any wise comparable to the reduction of the State
      debt, and the consequent lightening of the people's taxes. Why cannot the advocates of the old
      system of managing the Railroads, and Canals, of the State, the methed [sic] fraught with such
      high-handed villainy, show some period in the history of Pennsylvania, during the last score
      and a half of years, under locofoce [sic] Administrations, while enforcing locofoco laws, when
      the mountain debt of the State was reduced, in the least, without, creating other or floating
      debts by, making new loans to effect the purpose -- borrowing from Peter to pay Paul? We would
      like to be informed, if such is the fact, when an effort was make
      [sic] to pull down the pyramid of debt, which, like an incubus, has been restricting the
      healthful respirations of our body politic, by any locofoco State Administration acting under
      laws, of their own making, having that end in view[.] Some attempts have been made, it is
      true, to reduce the huge pile of public debt, by the sincere friends of correct governmental
      economy, under the healthful operation of the Act establishing the sinking fund; but the
      recklessness and mismanagement of the locofoco Board of Canal Commissioners, and the various
      appropriations annually made to enable those inefficient public servants to make the two ends
      of the year meet, added more each year to the bulk of the debt than the sinking fund removed,
      so that under locofoco misrule our large indebtedness has been steadily augmenting.</p>
     <p>A change, however, has taken place, and the gradual, sure and constant extinguishment of the
      public debt, of the old Keystone, is being accomplished, through the agency of the beneficent
      laws which the friends of low taxes -- the old line Whigs, Americans, and Republicans --
      placed upon our statute Books. The wisdom of these Acts of Assembly will be universally
      acknowledged by all tax-ridden citizens, no matter what may be their political creed, before
      another decennary passes over our heads. The People have great reason to feel thankful on
      account of the pleasing prospect which looms up in the near future of becoming able to wipe
      out every dollar of debt the State now owes. How else, than [sic] by disposing of the cause of
      constant leakage -- the Public Works -- could this pleasing anticipation be presented to the
      view of our industrious Farmers and Mechanics?</p>
     <p>The State debt is now, since all the Public Works have been sold, being reduced at the rate
      of ONE MILLION OF [sic] DOLLARS PER YEAR. Our excellent State Treasurer has given notice, that
      he will take up claims against the State, in the shape of stocks, amounting to the snug little
      sum of one fourth of a million of dollars. This is quite pleasant
      news to those whose taxes will soon begin to lighten as million upon million of our funded
      debt is cancelled [sic]. One reduction as a consequence of the wisdom of the laws providing
      for the sale of the Public Works, would already have taken place, but for the wicked trickery
      of the locofoco Senate, last winter. A bill, which was intended to relieve tax payers, was
      passed, unanimously, in the lower House, during the last session; but it failed to become a
      law in consequence of the locofocos having a majority in the Senate, where it never was
      permitted to appear. Those slaves to party knew very well that if they voted down a law
      providing for giving the People relief, their powor [sic] with our tax-burthened citizens
      would depart forever, and they were just as well aware of losing caste with the thinking
      portion of [the] community if they passed the law -- thereby admitting that all their prating
      against the sale of the Public Works was but childish nonsense.</p>
     <p>The People will cherish in their heart of hearts the names of those noble spirits, those
      generous, untiring, persevering men, who battled so manfully, during the last two sessions of
      the Legislature, for the passage of the bills providing for the sale of the balance of our
      Public Works and the abolition of the Canal Board. -- Conspicuous among these is, we are much
      pleased to find, our own gallant chieftain, Col. A. K. McCLURE. The People of this district,
      reposing full credit in his integrity, and honesty of political purpose, clothed him with the
      robes of office, and bid him go forth to represent them in the councils of the State; well and
      faithfully did he discharge the duties devolving upon him; and now, as a mark of their
      continued confidence in his every act as a legislator, and respect for his many excellent
      traits of character, which could be largely imitated, with profit to society, by many men in
      every community, they intend conferring on him the honor of occupying a seat in the State
      Senate -- another evidence of the appreciation by the People of the wisdom of the laws enacted
      with special reference to the sale of the Public Works.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The Locofoco leaders have resolved upon another change of programme with new scenery, an
      entire new cast of star actors, new scene shifters, new prompters and new baggage-masters.
      Some two months ago the programme had been decided upon definitely as all supposed, by a few
      wire-pullers in town. J. Wyethe Douglas was to have the honor of a defeat for Senator. So
      fully had the Senatorial part of the ticket been determined, that the Spirit, of June 15th, issued the edict with a grand flourish of trumpets as follows:</p>
     <p>"Now we have no objection whatever that Adams should have the nomination (for Senator) and
      if she insists upon it, she will get it; but we have Mr. Douglas in the field for that position, and all the manoeuering [sic] of
      the combination clique of the People's party will not succed [sic] in making him a candidate
      for the Legislature."</p>
     <p>So matters stood two months ago -- Mr. Douglas was in the field as the candidate of the
       Spirit, and would probably have remained the only candidate in the
      party; but the friendship of the Spirit proved too heavy a load for
      him, and within ten days, behold the scene shifts suddenly -- the wire-pullers have found it
      an easy task to overthrow any man who has incurred the praise of the Spirit, and when the curtain is about to rise, the leading actor in the popular farce
      about to be played by the Locofocos in this Senatorial District, turns out to be James Nill!</p>
     <p>True, the managers find all manner of obsticles [sic] in the way. Douglas is easily disposed
      of, as the Spirit had spoken well of him; but the popular feat of
      Mr. Nill -- the only one indeed for which he is eminent on the political stage -- is that of
      springing into a nomination at the eleventh hour over everybody else, seems to have lost much
      of its novelty and more of its charms for the party. It did tolerably well two years ago, when
      he made a clean bound over Douglas a few days before the Convention met, and jostled him aside
      for a Legislative nomination; and it worked passably a year ago as he repeated the feat -- all
      the time insisting that he couldn't and wouldn't perform it; but when it comes to be practised
      [sic] again, the "old war horse" is found a little stiff and rusty from over-exertion and
      hair-breadth escapes, experienced in the gales of last October. But it is resolved by the
      wire-pullers that he must do it again, and while he is still insisting that he can't and
      won't, he is being groomed and lubricated daily, and on Convention day, he will, as usual,
      attempt to leap over all competitors and barriers to the head of the ticket, and turn up a
      full blown aspirant for Senatorial honors.</p>
     <p>We congratulate Douglas--we commend Nill to the friendly consideration of his brethren in
      Adams. It is true that they have presented Mr. Myers; and it is true also that Franklin has
      already had two successive nominations for Senator and three for Congress; but Mr. Myers
      should not have the presumption to allow himself to come in competition with so dexterous and
      resplendent a luminary as Mr. Nill. There are other stars in the party whose effulgence has
      shone out in bygone days; but little by little these lights have paled before him, until they
      have faded beyond the power of political vision. Occasionally, one and another will display a
      modest twinkle; but the dazzling brilliancy of the bright, particular star is soon flung upon
      the political horizon, and the humble satilites [sic] must revolve around it in obscurity. Mr.
      Myers must therefore take his rank with the host of obliterate lights of the party. He is a
      clever man, but he can't run for Senator this time. If he has relied upon the declaration of
      the Spirit relative to the nomination -- that if Adams "insists
      upon it she will get it," he was not probably aware that when that paper predicts one thing
      the people are sure to do just the contrary. What evil he has done that the Spirit should thus fasten its deadly friendship upon him, we are not
      advised.</p>
     <p>Upon a careful survey of the field we are for the new programme -- including actors,
      scenery, decapitations, &amp;c. We are for Nill; for him decidedly, and we regard it as
      settled that the Convention will be for him, also. He has the party in leading-strings, and
      will wield his power; and we bid him speed in his efforts. He has with him the fossils, the
      dead weights, the incumbrances of the party, while its heart beats time to the living, active,
      earnest elements of the organization. -- We want the issue, and welcome its coming. We are for
      him, too, because his is the nomination at this time most fit to be made -- he being the true
      type of his party on the living issues to be decided. When the whole State is rejoicing at the
      fact that our State Debt is being gradually reduced, while our interest is being promptly paid
      and no new debts created, he will go before the people as a cloud upon the cheering life that
      has at last broken in the midnight of financial darkness that has been resting upon us.</p>
     <p>He will go forth as a fossil of the plundering Canal Board; as the fogy opponent of the sale
      of the Public Works; as the trembling, hesitating apologist of the Locompton infamy; as the
      dreamy theorist who opposes Protection to American Industry when desolation rules around him
      for want of it; as the deadly foe of a Democratic State administration because it has dared to
      fulfil [sic] its promises; and as the defender of the National Administration, that has
      quadrupled our debt, plundered the treasury by its profligacy, and struck at the very
      foundation of our liberties by its policy. He is the true embodiment of the scattered remnants
      of the once powerful Democracy, and as other voices have been hushed, and other luminaries
      have faded from the view, by the portentous clouds which promise only disaster to Democratic
      nominees, we unhesitatingly pronounce him the man for the times.</p>
     <p>The new programme throws Seacrist overboard for Sheriff, without ceremony. It is decreed by
      the same tribunal that has built up Nill that Seacrist must go down. Quincy takes queer freaks
      sometimes -- her people have an old-fashioned way of doing and voting as they please, and they
      might do it again. They must be kept out of temptation, lest they should forget a dead
      Senatorial candidate to make a live Sheriff of one of there [sic] own citizens, hence Seacrist
      must be slaughtered. -- The die is cast, and Nill and Sellers will be the men. They will work
      together safely and die in the ditch together, but Quincy must be put on the stool of
      repentance.</p>
     <p>Such is the last programme, but Presto, change! may be the order given before the Convention
      meets. So now you see it -- now you don't see it. Can any one tell where the little joker
     is?</p>

     <p>The People of Franklin County, without distinction of Party, who are in favor of Protection
      to the great Industrial interests of Pennsylvania; who are in favor of Free Labor in Free
      Territories; who are in favor of arresting the Profligacy of the National Administration and
      the alarming Increase of our National Debt, and who are in favor [of] the Sale of the Public
      Works, the abolition of the Canal Board; the gradual but certain Payment of our State Debt,
      and the Reduction of our crushing Taxes, are invited to meet in MASS MEETINGS at the following

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The Nigger Democracy, in rage at their loss of influence and power in the South, are
      beginning to turn their backs upon their former friends and allies. -- Last Saturday night,
      their leader, FRED. DOUGLASS, the notorious Negro Orator from the State of New York, delivered
      a flaming address to his friends and
      admirers, in the Public Hall of this place. We noticed one of the editors of the Valley Spirit sitting in a front seat -- evidently as the "right
      supporter" of the sable speaker. What is Democracy coming to? What expedients will not that
      party resort to in order to rescue their sinking political ship? They have brought this man
      here for political effect. They became in 1844, the most ardent friends of the Tariff of '42,
      and succeeded in carrying the election, under that banner. Are they now about to don the garb
      of abolitionism? Do they foolishly think this will enable them to
      carry the North? If they are after this game, why not pursue it openly? All underhanded work
      is despicable. How did it happen that the principal editor of the
       Spirit -- that is when there is any editorial in that barren sheet
      -- JOHN M. COOPER, a clerk in Attorney General Black's Office, at Washington, and this woolly
      headed son of Africa, Fred. Douglas, [sic] both dropped so suddenly and unexpectedly into our
      midst, about the same time?</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Chambersburg is experiencing a brick building boom. John Reasoner, who just sold his
     business to Mr. Wanamaker of Philadelphia, made and sold almost one million bricks in the past
     year and a half. John Senseny, Benjamin Uglow, John Hunesecker and Mr. Root also have

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The destiny of Chambersburg, is something beyond the ordinary lot of inland towns, if we are
      to judge by the piles of brick, lumber &amp;c., with which our streets have been blocked
      up, since early in the spring, materials for new brick buildings in course of erection. Nor
      does it appear likely to cease, from the indications we have, until cold weather shall put a
      stop to the busy hum of the mason hammer and carpenter saw. The following persons have either
      begun to build or will have Brick houses erected this fall and winter, ready for occupation
      next April.</p>
     <p>Frederick Henninger, one; George Bressler, one-double; F. Elliott, Clothier, one; T. J.
      Early, one-double; Mathew Gillan, two-3-storied; John Snider, one; Jacob Oyster, one-double;
      John Reasner, one; Wm. Wallace, three-3-storied; James Boreland, one; Rev. James Kennedy, one;
      Joseph Dick, one; Wm. Haslett, two; John Bickley, one; making room for 21 families. In
      addition to these J. A. EYSTER, Esq., is now ready for roofing his seventh brick building for
      this season. This last named gentleman is also about putting up a substantial brick stable on
      the lot in the rear of the one on which their store is erected.</p>
     <p>These houses, with those already built, since last spring, will accommodate from 40 to 50
      families. Our own people, hereafter, will not be so likely to be turned out of their houses by
      wealthy persons from other counties, who desire a home with us and can only get it, by
      purchasing, and thus putting our own citizens to shift for a dwelling as best they can.</p>
     <p>These signs of the prosperity of Chambersburg, are highly gratifying and are a sure presage
      of future greatness. One of our brickmakers, Mr. JOHN REASONER, has informed us, that last
      year and from early this Spring, to July, he made near one million of brick and they are all
      disposed of. He will have to buy for his own house from his successor, Mr. WANAMAKER, late of
      Philadelphia, who has bought out his Brick Yard and located himself in our goodly Borough to
      carry on the brick making just as extensively as the demand may, or can
       require. He intends to show us Philadelphia style -- by always having a large stock on
      hand. This yard in connection with JOHN SENSENY'S BENJAMIN UGLOW'S, JOHN HUNESECKER'S, Mr.
      ROOT'S, and others, will be able to supply the town demand, as well as the surrounding
      country, hereafter.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>On Saturday evening last the 17th, the Town Hall was very well filled to listen to DOUGLAS,
      not Hon. STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS, nor yet our townsman, J. WYTHE DOUGLAS, Esq., but a no less
      distinguished man than either of them, the notorious FREDERICK DOUGLAS, [sic] of New York
      State, the Negro Orator, and, Editor of an abolition News Paper, in the western part of the
      Empire State.</p>
     <p>His theme was, the wrongs of his race. -- He handled his subject in a style which would have
      been creditable to many, very many of our white orators. He is, without doubt, an
      extraordinary man. He is highly eloquent, has unlimited command of his voice -- which breathes
      forth betimes the sweetest accents, and again swells to Stentorian volume -- and his gestures
      are graceful; on the whole we do not hesitate about pronouncing him a first class speaker. We
      can easily excuse him -- a black man -- for advocating the doctrine of immediate and
      unconditional emancipation; but if such a thing were practicable it would be altogether
      inexpedient. If slavery was to become rooted out, and the blacks remain among the whites, we
      honestly believe a war of extermination would soon be the result. The history of the "Red Man"
      is sufficient to prove, beyond cavil, that two distinct races cannot dwell, as equals, in
      harmony, upon the same soil. If slavery is to be abolished, we must, at the same time, provide
      for the colonization of the negroes.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Anecdote about a wealthy, illiterate Irishman who thinks that wearing glasses will make
     it easy for him to read, and thinks the salesman is trying to cheat him when they don't help.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>A true story is told by a dealer who had advertised eye-glasses, by the aid of which a
      person could read easily the finest print. A well-dressed Irishman called at his counter one
      day to be fitted to a pair of spectacles. As he remarked that he had never worn any, some were
      handed to him that magnified very little. He looked hard through them upon the book set before
      him, but declared he could make out nothing. Another pair of stronger power then saddled upon
      his nose, but unsuccessfully as before. Further trials were made, until at length the almost
      discouraged dealer passed to him a pair which magnified more than all the rest in his stock.
      The customer, quite as impatient as the merchant at having to try so many, put on the last
      pair and glowered through them at the printed page with all his might, "Can you read that
      printing now?" inquired the dealer, pretty certain that he had hit it right this time at any
      rate. "Divil a bit," was the reply. -- "Can you read at all?" said the merchant, unable to
      conceal his vexation any longer. -- "Read at all?" cried the customer. "There's not a single
      word among them that I can identify his fatures." "I say, do you know how to read?" exclaimed
      the dealer, impatiently. "Out wid you!" shouted the Irishman, throwing down the spectacles in
      a huff. "If I could read, what would I be afther buying a pair of spectacles for?" You chate
      the paple wid the iday that your glasses wud help'em to read print aisy; but it's a big lie,
      it is! Ah, you blackguard, you thought I'd buy'em widout
