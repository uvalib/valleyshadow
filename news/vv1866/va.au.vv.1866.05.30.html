<b>The Future of Virginia</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an editorial which argues that the Virginia Canal and
                    Covington and Ohio Railroad will allow Virginia to compete with the Northeast
                    and New Orleans for the trade of the West. The editors envision a prosperous
                    future, in which capital, industry, and population are attracted to Virginia.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Referring to the projects now afoot for completing the great Virginia canal
                        and for constructing the Covington and Ohio railroad, the Philadelphia
                        Inquirer says:</p>
                    <p>If those enterprises are carried out in the extent which is designed they
                        will make Virginia a rival in the transportation of freight and travel with
                        Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. The Virginia Canal will be able to
                        compete with the Pennsylvania and New York and Erie Canals. The railroad
                        will contest with the Baltimore and Ohio, Pennsylvania Central and New York
                        and Erie for the trade of the West. It is claimed that by these means a
                        shorter route will be furnished from the Ohio river to the mouth of the
                        James than can be had by any other route north of it; that it will be
                        shorter from St. Louis to Newport News, by railroad, than from St. Louis to
                        New Orleans. If these plans are carried out, the consequences will be of
                        advantage to Virginia in more ways than one. Her sources of industry will be
                        opened; a vast emigration of laborers and business men will fill up the
                        desert places, and under the stimulus of commerce and manufactures, the
                        State will assert her claims to greatness which nature gave her, and which,
                        by the supineness of her people were long since overshadowed and almost
                        forgotten, by the advance in prosperity of more energetic and enterprising
                        communities.</p>
                    <p>Writing upon the same topic, the Petersburg Express says:</p>
                    <p>In our present depressed and mutilated condition, there is at least some
                        satisfaction in contemplating the prospective greatness of the State, in
                        this ANCIENT DOMINION we should say, for it is now reduced to its original
                        limits, since the violent segregation of one third of our rightful
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The geographical position and mineral riches of Virginia have long attracted
                        the notice of intelligent men, even from the time of Washington; and
                        efforts, feeble and almost futile, indeed, have from time to time been made
                        by the State government to develop her resources. But the want of capital
                        has hitherto interposed an insurmountable barrier.</p>
                    <p>At last, however, our great lines of improvement have been placed in the
                        hands of companies who can command any amount of resources; and the James
                        River Canal, and Covington and Ohio Railroad, are to be pressed forward to
                        speedy completion.</p>
                    <p>It is confidently believed that by the opening of these lines, a greater
                        amount of trade will be secured to the eastern cities of Virginia than ever
                        was borne on the bosom of the Erie Canal. The great west will be brought
                        nearer to Richmond and Norfolk than it is to New York, with the advantage
                        that trade will not be interrupted during the winter months as in the case
                        of the northern lines. And wherever trade centres, there will capital
                        centre, and population congregate.</p>
                    <p>The companies which have undertaken the completion of these works have
                        contracted to finish them in a few years. A new era will then dawn upon our
                        beloved State and a career of unexampled prosperity will be opened to her;
                        and we confidently believe she will yet vindicate her title to be in
                        material as she is in intellectual wealth the first State of the Union.</p>

<b>The Jailors and their Brutal Work</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial alleges that Jefferson Davis is ill due to mistreatment in
                    prison. It denounces his captivity as groundless and demands his release or
                    immediate trial.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The report of Dr. Geo. E. Cooper, Surgeon U. S. Army, the physician who was
                        appointed by the President to examine into the state of the health of Mr.
                        Davis, officially confirms the worst reports, which have reached the
                        country, of the dangerous condition of the illustrious prisoner. It
                        discloses a deliberate system of vindictive cruelty, made up of petty and
                        irritating annoyances, which have at last culminated in the complete
                        prostration of the feeble frame of the victim.</p>
                    <p>Christendom has been called upon frequently in past ages, and sometimes in
                        more modern times, to visit with its scorn and reprobation, such national
                        outrages--but never one so brutal, so mean as this; no, not even among the
                        perfidious Greek, or the stern, vindictive Roman. Not even in the dark
                        annals of the reign of terror can a parallel be found to the treatment of
                        Mr. Davis; combining all its elements of fraud, cruelty, cowardly and
                        ineffable meanness. Great Britain still labors and sinks under the odium of
                        the confinement of Napoleon to the rock of St. Helena, tho' the fearful
                        effects of his presence in France were fresh in the minds of all men, and
                        the pressing necessity of excluding him from participation in the politics
                        of Europe, was apparent to the least observant. Charles the First is to this
                        day revered as a martyr by two thirds of the English people, and his
                        execution has left a stain, never to be effaced, upon the fair fame of the
                        Government of Cromwell. Yet Charles is conceded, on all hands, to have been
                        one of the most tyrannical and perfidious of Princes, and the stern old
                        Puritan scorned to work his destruction, by petty annoyances and prison
                        assassination, but brought him to trial and execution in the broad light of
                        day before the face of the world. Neither of these are parallel cases, the
                        United States Government or the creatures who have brought this foul
                        disgrace upon the country, have neither the justification of extreme
                        necessity of the one, or the palliation of boldness and hardihood in crime
                        of the other.</p>
                    <p>Arrested originally upon the suspicion of complicity in assassination, which
                        its authors know to be a foul and baseless
                        slander, when they preferred the accusation, he has been continued in
                        lingering confinement upon the charge of treason in the cause of
                        rebellion--a cause for which Washington struggled, and which has made him
                        ever "first in the hearts of his countrymen." The sickening details of this
                        cruel imprisonment are given in the official report of an United States
                        Surgeon, appointed for the purpose; the ceaseless trampings of the numerous
                        guards; the agony of the feeble and illustrious victim in his living grave,
                        are pictured in concise and truthful language, and must inevitably hand
                        down, through endless ages, the names of the authors of this horrible and
                        atrocious national crime, to the scorn and hissing of outraged humanity. The
                        English language utterly fails to describe the disgust and loathing, which
                        the sickening recital of the outrage and barbarity which have been
                        perpetuated upon this distinguished and unfortunate gentleman, by his brutal
                        jailors, excites in the breast of every humane man. It becomes President
                        Johnson, if he wishes to wash his hands of this great crime and escape the
                        boundless contempt of future ages, to have this dark and atrocious
                        transaction sifted to the bottom; let the blood-hounds who have cast this
                        ineffaceable blot upon the fair fame of the country, be disclosed and
                        visited with the punishment due their infamous conduct. At least, in
                        difference to outraged humanity, let the brutal Miles be brought before the
                        appropriate tribunal, to answer for the murder of which he stands guilty in
                        the eyes of God and man.</p>

<b>Official Report of the Health of ex-President Davis</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints the report of U. S. army surgeon George E.Cooper
                    concerning the health of the imprisoned Jefferson Davis. Cooper reports that
                    Davis is sick, emaciated, and suffering from want of sleep due to the noise of
                    sentinels and guards. The editors denounce the Radicals for keeping him
                    incarcerated, declaring their crimes worse than those allegedly committed by

                    former masters. The article argues that any rights "forced" on the white South
                    cannot be enjoyed peacefully by blacks, and that northerners will eventually
                    abandon African Americans. The greatest hope for equal rights lies in patience
                    and gradual compromise with Southern whites.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A journal in the South, established in the interests of the freedmen and
                        sustained by their subscriptions, gives them in a recent issue these words
                        of wholesome advice:</p>
                    <p>Cultivate by every means in your power the good opinion of your former
                        masters. Remember that they have suffered much and been severely tried the
                        last five years. Bear in mind, too, that they have their prejudices and the
                        traditions of their fathers to contend against; and that, besides, they
                        cannot, from their very circumstances, be expected to regard innovations in
                        their midst in the same light that Northern Utopians do. But be patient.
                        Recollect, when the time does come, that whatever claims or privileges are
                        granted to you by them will, in their practical bearing, be worth to you far
                        more than all the recognitions of the North.</p>
                    <p>But anything suddenly forced upon the whites by
                        any party hostile to the South, that you can
                        never enjoy? In the North itself the black man's steps have been but of
                        gradual measurement. We have heard some of your so-called friends say that
                        nothing short of another revolution could save the cause; and you may be
                        told by interested parties, vampires who feed on the "cause," that, in the
                        event of a collision between ourselves and the whites, the North would stand
                        by you. They would insinuate that, now that you know how to use the
                        cartridge-box, you should insist immediately on the ballot-box.</p>
                    <p>Yes, the red man dared to assert his claim to the fair country the Great
                        Spirit had given him, and these men's fathers speedily "improved him off the
                        face of the earth;" and their descendants to this day ignore the claims of
                        the colored man, as in Connecticut and other States! Out on the canting
                        hypocrites! Be not deceived by these men. If a collision ever occurs, the
                        government would, of course, be compelled to see order preserved; but should
                        a war of races ever ensue, the whites would join the whites, and the blacks
                        join the blacks. Your most implacable enemies are to be found among the
                        white soldiers. Their hatred toward your race seems to have grown in
                        intensity from the very moment they entered the service.</p>

                        published statements in the last Vindicator denying signing "that petition"
                        or saying they signed it under a misapprehension of its true meaning. "That
                        petition" has been returned, and W. J. Dews says that all who say they have
                        not signed it can prove it by coming forward and seeing if their signatures
                        are attached. He sends us a letter signed Wm. Herndon, Secretary of the
                        Commonwealth, which says "appended to the (Dew's) application (for
                        appointment as Notary Public) is the following, signed by A. T. Maupin, P.

                        seen at his house by all. One J. H. Stover Jr., states, in the American
                        Union, at Harrisonburg, that he deserted the Confederate service and after
                        he came back signed "that petition" and has nothing to regret. It is
                        believed that Stover, being an ignorant man, never wrote this statement, but
                        was used by others. We understand that Todd swears he will prosecute all who
                        say they never signed the petition, and it remains with them to settle the
                        question. It will be interesting to see where the "lie" is.</p>

                        their valuable aid at a Fair recently held by them.</p>
                    <p>We would take occasion to inform the citizens of Staunton, that we have in
                        our midst, one Emila Rodney, of Pennsylvania, of the Bethel Church,
                        soliciting subscriptions under a false misrepresentation of facts, and would
                        say, that if the white citizens feel disposed to further aid us in paying
                        for our Church, they will please be careful who they pay money to, as we
                        have been informed several gentlemen have contributed, thinking it was for
                        the benefit of the M. E. Church, Colored, when it was intended for the
                        Bethel Church.</p>
                    <p>They regret to learn that an impression seems to exist among the citizens,
                        that the colored people wish to "draw out from among the whites," and in
                        church and business matters, become independent of them; thus acknowledging
                        little obligation to them. We are sorry to hear that this doctrine is taught
                        by some of our color from the North, who are endeavoring to form a sect, new
                        to us, here, but so far as that is concerned we
                        have no sympathy with them. We do not desire this foolish independence, but
                        are very thankful for sympathy and aid from the whites, and respectfully
                        acknowledge our obligations.</p>
