                    <p>It fell--but stainless as it rose,<lb/> Martyred, like Stephen, in the

                <transcript>
                    <p>In the Richmond Examiner, of Wednesday last, we find the following. We have
                        received a voluminous communication from General Imboden, in reference to
                        the National Express Company and his connection therewith which he requests
                        us to publish in full. While we are very ready to do all justice to General
                        Imboden, whom we highly regard, the crowded state of our columns forbids
                        that we should give his letter in its whole extent. We cheerfully insert
                        such of his remarks as set him right before the public, especially as he
                        seems to think that a recent article of ours created a wrong impression in
                        regard to him. General Imboden writes:</p>
                    <p>When the Company was formed in November last, the courts had not been
                        organized in this State, and I was wholly out of employment. The Board of
                        Directors tendered me the Superintendency of the Company. I accepted the
                        position with the distinct understanding that either party might terminate
                        our relations at any time, it being my desire to return to the bar as soon
                        as practicable. In January I resigned, for reasons not necessary to be
                        mentioned here, but wholly different from that you assign. At the respect of
                        the Board, I continued to act until my successor entered upon his duties, on
                        the 3d of February.</p>
                    <p>Though no longer an officer of the company--our relations being simply those
                        of an attorney and client--I am pretty well informed of its condition and
                        prospects, and do not hesitate to express the opinion with entire confidence
                        that at no time has the company ever been on a sounder footing than it is
                        today.</p>
                    <p>So much we feel due to General Imboden, and we publish it notwithstanding the
                        press of matter upon us. The rest of his letter has no bearing upon the
                        personal question which he desires to place in a proper light, and we are
                        compelled to omit it.</p>

                <head>A Card from Hon. A. H. H. Stuart</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The National Intelligencer, of the 2nd, contains a card from our
                        representative elect, in reply to the statements, heretofore published, made
                        by Mr. Trumbull, in regard to "that petition." Mr. Stuart thinks that Mr.
                        Trumbull has been imposed upon by some designing knave, and emphatically
                        denies the statements made. After stating that he had applied to Mr. Howard
                        for a copy of the petition, believing it to be a fraud practiced on the
                        Senate, and Mr. Howard's writing to him that the Military Committee declined
                        furnishing it, Mr. Stuart concludes:</p>
                    <p>"The sequel would seem to show that my original suspicions were well-founded.
                        A copy of the petition and of the names of the alleged signers have been
                        procured and published, but not through any agency of mine. Thereupon a
                        large number of the supposed petitioners have published cards, some denying
                        that they had ever signed, or authorized any one else to sign, their names
                        to any such paper. Others declare that the nature and object of the petition
                        were misrepresented to them. It further appears from the cards, that while
                        Dews, who seems to have been the active agent in getting up the petition, as
                        well as the acting notary public, swears that all the petitioners are
                        citizens of Augusta, in fact, many of them reside in Rockbridge, and others
                        in Pendleton, West Virginia.</p>
                    <p>One of the petitioners, a baker by trade, has had the candor to acknowledge
                        that he signed it, and that he did so because he had found the United States
                        troops profitable customers when they were here before, and he thought if
                        they were sent back they would endanger his market for bread. Probably
                        others were influenced by motives equally patriotic and disinterested.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the community which has been aspersed, I challenge
                        investigation. I confidently affirm that no credible testimony can be
                        produced to prove that, in any case, justice has been denied, or any one put
                        in peril, in consequence of his Union principles. On the contrary, Augusta
                        was the first county, in all the Southern States, which held a public
                        meeting in favor of reconstruction, and from that hour to the present her
                        people have yielded ready obedience to the authority of the United States. A
                        sitting investigation of the facts connected with this petition would lead
                        to some useful disclosures.</p>
                    <p>I have no wish or purpose to impugn the motives of Mr. Trumbull in
                        withdrawing the paper which is alleged to have been forged from the custody
                        of the Senate and restoring it to the custody of the man who wrote it, but
                        it requires no great sagacity to perceive that the effect must be to stifle
                        inquiry into the authenticity of the signatures, and to enable the author,
                        if guilty, to shield himself from punishment.</p>
                    <p>Alex. H. H. Stuart<lb/> Staunton, Va., May 29, 1866.</p>

                <summary>The paper prints portions of a letter from Alexander H. H. Stuart in which
                    he discusses the results of preliminary investigation into the authenticity of
                    the petition asking that Federal troops be returned to Staunton. Stuart
                    maintains that many of those who signed the paper were mislead, and that others
                    came from different counties, including some in West Virginia. Stuart reports
                    that one man, a baker, admitted to signing the petition only because the
                    soldiers were good for business.</summary>

                    <p>The most forcible argument that can be presented to the consideration of the
                        capitalists of the eastern cities to induce investments in the stocks of the
                        Railroad schemes now chartered through the great Valley, from one extremity
                        to the other, is to lay before them the rich harvest of staple production
                        annually gathered in the counties through which the road will pass and those
                        adjacent. Taking it as a matter of fact, for the convenience of our purpose,
                        that Bill Arp is right in the opinion that the people of the South had no
                        existence, as such during the past five years, and consequently know nothing
                        of the publication of the census of 1860, we will have to gather our figures
                        from the returns of 1850. We give below the annual products of the staple
                        articles in the counties named. There are a number of other counties from
                        which more or less transportation would be received, viz: Hardy, Pendleton,
                        Highland, Pocahontas, Bath and Craig. Much if not all the trade of Pendleton
                        and Hardy would seek the Manassas Road as an outlet.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>It will be seen from this table that at least four millions of dollars worth
                        of Wheat, Rye, Oats and Corn are annually produced in ten counties in the
                        Valley interested in the construction of the Manassas Gap and Valley Roads.
                        Add to this amount about two million pounds Butter and Cheese, worth at
                        least six hundred thousand dollars. Include the counties of Pendleton,
                        Highland and Hardy, and we find these thirteen counties have 119,949
                        [unclear] cattle, 129,376 sheep, and 162,269 hogs--which, at a moderate
                        estimate, would be worth about $14,000,000--presenting an aggregate of
                        $24,600,000 of produce. This is exclusive of many articles, such as wool,
                        tobacco, potatoes, &amp;c. which we have not deemed important to
                        enumerate.</p>
                    <p>The value of the lands in the counties of Augusta, Botetourt, Clarke,
                        Frederick, Roanoke, Rockbridge, Rockingham, Shenandoah, Page and Warren is
                        put down in the census of 1850, at $34,395,580. The increase in the price of
                        lands in the Valley since 1850 cannot be less than 25 per cent which would
                        give us about $42,993,973 as the value of the lands.</p>
                    <p>The impetus given to agricultural pursuits by Railroad facilities of
                        transportation cannot fail to greatly increase the returns of the farmers,
                        and induce the cultivation of many acres of land now lying idle. New
                        enterprises will spring up, and sources of wealth and profit will be opened
                        heretofore unthought of. The vast beds of minerals which exist throughout
                        the entire Valley, will be opened, and in less than five years, if these
                        railroad schemes are prosecuted, with ordinary energy, the Valley of
                        Virginia will furnish a commerce worth $100,000,000 annually! The completion
                        of the Covington and Ohio Road will command an immense transportation from
                        the middle West. The Valley Road will tap the main connecting stem at
                        Staunton, and running South, will connect with the Virginia and Tennessee
                        Road at Salem, where it will compete for the overflowing trade of the
                        productive Southwest. There is not a Railroad scheme either in contemplation
                        or completed, within the limits of the United States, that presents such
                        immense advantages. The business men of the Eastern cities can see at a
                        glance the importance of these Railroad lines, in concentrating the trade of
                        the Valley of Virginia, and that of the great middle and Southwestern
                        States, at their own marts.--<emph rend="italic">Rockingham

                    <p>A lady of the green-spectacled and strong minded persuasion, from down East,
                        near the hub of the universe, was in conversation with a female friend, and
                        was enlarging on the dear little African pupils she had been teaching, and
                        was about to leave perhaps forever (about one hundred,) when one of them
                        came in. The kind instructress leaned to the "sable tenement of an immortal
                        soul," and said, with an angelic kindness beaming through her emerald
                        glasses, "Dear Disley, I am soon to leave you, and may never return. You
                        must be a good girl, and how I love you and all my dear colored pupils. Tell
                        all of them you meet I have had my photograph taken, and have one for each
                        of them. They must each bring a dollar and get one."</p>

                        <emph rend="italic">For the Valley Virginian</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR:--Through the columns of the Virginian, we wish to call the
                        attention of the citizens of Staunton, to the fact relative to the card,
                        from the colored people of Staunton, published in your last issue. We are
                        pained, that we are compelled, to write an article in contradiction to what
                        a christian Minister may have said with an intention to make an impression,
                        that was not, nor is not, true. We do not cherish any unkind feeling to our
                        Rev. Brother Lawson, but we must say with the best of feelings that, that
                        part of his article which has reference to Mrs. Rodney, as acting under
                        false representation, is a mistake. Mrs. Rodney, has not, nor never did,
                        assume any authority that was not vested in all members of the Church. She
                        has no control of the Church. As for our people wishing to draw out from
                        among the whites, in Church as well as business matters, and forming a new
                        sect, as stated in their article, we beg to ask a few questions. Have our
                        people ever declined working for the whites when called upon? Have they ever
                        exhibited any action or feeling, indicating that they wished to be
                        independent of the whites? We have never seen nothing of the kind; and would
                        beg to know the foundation upon which you arrive at such a decision. The
                        doctrine we teach, wherever we go, is that we keep as close to the whites as
                        possible. As regards the subscription, we are at a loss to know how the
                        mistake occurred, as our paper, soliciting subscription, was signed by the
                        Rev. Woodhouse, and the other, we believe, by the Rev. Mr. Lawson.</p>
                    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen we ask you to please aid us in building our Church, and
                        may God bless you all and repay you four fold for what you may give us in
                        this matter.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully yours,<lb/> A. Woodhouse, Pastor; Benj. Bragg, John
                        Jackson, George Washington and others.</p>

                <summary>The paper publishes an article from the Richmond Examiner complementing
                    Staunton's hotels and tourist attractions. The article states that the best
                    route to "Virginia's summer retreats" lies through Staunton. There, travellers
                    "will be in a central position that will allow a choice of the latest moment,
                    and as they will have to lie over there for one night, it is well for them to be
                    assured that they will be taken care of. The article highlights the Virginia
                    Hotel, complete with post office and Adams Express office, and the American
                    hotel, located near the rail line, convenient to the business portion of town,
                    and equipped with stage line offices, a telegraph office, and a livery stable.
                    Both hotels are newly refurbished and located in cool, quiet areas of town.</summary>
