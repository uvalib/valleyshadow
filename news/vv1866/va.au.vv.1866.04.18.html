<b>Another Sensible Speech from Beecher</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports upon a speech of Henry Ward Beecher denouncing Congress
                    for attempting to compel the South to change. Persuasion would work better than
                    coercion, he suggests.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Henry Ward Beecher lectured in Philadelphia on Thursday evening, and
                        contended that in regard to the treatment of the Southern States it was
                        better to assume fundamental principles, and get by moral influence what is
                        desired, instead of attempting political coercion. In the course of his
                        speech he said:</p>
                    <p>Diliatory legislation was not wise, and yet he was free to say we never sent
                        so many good men to Congress as constituted the present Congress. [Loud and
                        protracted applause.] But there never was a time when so many good and wise
                        men made so poor a bungle. You should not have applauded until I had
                        finished. [Applause].</p>
                    <p>The kind and patient Mr. Lincoln was cudgeled and whicked by Congress, and he
                        bore it with a patriotic spirit reminding him of some horses who merely act
                        when cudgeled, as though it was to brush off flies. When they commenced
                        whacking Mr. Johnson they found a pair of heels through the dash board, and
                        they left the wagon and took to trees and bushes, crying, "Beast! Brute!"
                        but since then had cudgeled more carefully.</p>
                    <p>He took both sides, and was for Mr. Johnson and Congress, also, deeming the
                        question to be how to do, and not what to do. Reconstruction was going on in
                        the South, where it must, after all, be made; yet it was wise to have proper
                        laws to fall back upon.</p>
                    <p>Let Georgia and Alabama pass laws giving rights and privileges to colored
                        men, and let South Carolina enact the slave code, and the consequence would
                        be that all would leave the latter State and go to the former. The
                        plantations must be worked by the colored men, and the people in South
                        Carolina would quickly demand the repeal of the laws that drove them from
                        their midst.</p>
                    <p>The North had but little to arrogate to herself as to the humanity toward the
                        colored race, and were more prejudiced against them than the Southern
                        people. He would not believe skulkers of the South; but if a man who fought
                        in the rebellion would tell him he accepted the issue, he would take his
                        word for it.</p>
                    <p>He respected the South more now than he formerly did, for there was so much
                        brag and gasconade he thought there could not be much fight about them. No
                        Northern man need be ashamed of their fighting qualities. The speaker said
                        the North seemed to stand back with frightened countenances at the idea of
                        the South getting the sway of government again. If the North, with its
                        population comprising two-thirds of the whole country, its industry and
                        ingenuity, let the shivering remnant take possession of the Government, they
                        deserve to lose it. He wanted to extend his hand to all the great national
                        freedmen, and extend the flag whose folds shine stars--every one a star of
                        Bethlehem--all over the country, because liberty and religion would be
                        denoted wherever it should be unfolded.</p>

<b>The Southern Dead</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper publishes a proposal from a women's group in Columbus, Georgia,
                    that one day each year be set aside for the entire South to remember its dead.
                    The paper applauds the women's efforts to decorate and preserve their graves,
                    and calls on women throughout the South to follow suit.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We take great pleasure in copying the following beautiful tribute to the
                        Southern Dead from the Columbus Sun and Times. Its suggestions are worthy of
                        our heroic women and the loved ones they propose to commemorate. It would be
                        "gilding refined gold" to add a single word to this touching appeal, and if
                        we dare say aught further, it is that the ladies of Columbus may not be
                        alone in this holy undertaking. Let the ladies of the South at large emulate
                        a grand duty so worthily inaugurated:</p>
                    <p>Columbus, Ga., March 10, 1866.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: The ladies are now, and have been
                        for several days, engaged in the sad but pleasant duty of ornamenting and
                        improving that portion of the city cemetery sacred to the memory of our
                        gallant Confederate dead, but who feel it an unfinished work unless a day be
                        set apart annually for its special attention. We cannot raise monumental
                        shafts, and inscribe thereon their many deeds of heroism, but we can keep
                        alive the memory of the debt we owe them, by at least dedicating one day in
                        each year to embellishing their humble graves with flowers. Therefore, we
                        beg the assistance of the Press and the Ladies throughout the South, to aid
                        us in our effort to set apart a certain day to be observed from the Potomac
                        to the Rio Grande, and be handed down through time as a religious custom of
                        the country to wreathe the graves of our martyred dead with flowers. (We
                        would propose the 2d Wednesday in May, as at that time our land may truly be
                        called the "land of flowers.") Let every city, town and village, join in the
                        pleasant duty; let all be alike remembered, from the heroes of Manassas to
                        those who expired among the death throes of our hallowed cause. We'll crown
                        alike the honored resting places of the immortal Jackson, in Virginia,
                        Johnson, of Shiloh, Cleburne, in Tennessee, and the host of gallant privates
                        who adorned our ranks--all did their duty, and to all we owe our gratitude.</p>
                    <p>Let the soldiers' grave, for that day at least, be the Southern Mecca, to
                        whose shrine her sorrowing women, like pilgrims, may annually bring their
                        grateful hearts and floral offerings. And when we remember the thousands who
                        were buried with "their martial cloak around them," without Christian
                        ceremony of internment for their beloved bodies, we would invoke the aid of
                        the most thrilling eloquence throughout the land, to inaugurate this custom
                        by delivering on the appointed day, this year, and eulogy on the unburied
                        dead of our glorious Southern army. They died for their country. Whether
                        their country had, or had not, the right to demand the sacrifice, is no
                        longer a question of discussion with us. That it was demanded, that they
                        nobly responded, and fell holy sacrifices upon their country's altar, and
                        are thereby entitled to their country's gratitude, none will deny.</p>
                    <p>The proud banner under which they rallied in defense of the noble cause for
                        which heroes fought, or trusting women prayed, has been fulfilled forever.
                        The country for which they suffered and died has now no name or place among
                        the nations of the earth. Legislative enactments may not now be made to do
                        honor to their memories--but the veriest Radical that ever traced his
                        genealogy back to the deck of the May Flower, could not deny us the simple
                        privilege of paying honor to those who died defending the life, honor and
                        happiness of the<br> SOUTHERN WOMEN.</p>

<b>The Great Valley Railroad--Meeting of the Stockholders of the Manassas Gap
                    Railroad--The Prospect and Our Duty</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that the stockholders of the Manassas Gap Railroad met in
                    Alexandria, and discussed with representatives of the Valley Railroad Company a
                    plan to aid the former road, and charter the latter. The editors urge
                    bondholders and citizens alike to aid the endeavor in any way they can, since
                    the prosperity of the Valley is riding on the future of the railroad.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. M. G. Harman, Col. William Allan, Captain Bolivar Christian, M. Harvey Effinger)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 11th inst., the Stockholders of the Manassas Gap Railroad Company met
                        at Alexandria. The President's report shows that the losses during the war
                        were estimated at about $89,000. This property was in use during the war on
                        the Dansville and Greensboro' roads and is now being collected at
                        Alexandria. The financial condition of the Company is stated as follows:
                        Mortgage Bonds sold, $330,000; Floating Debts, $100,000. The President,
                        Edward C. Marshall, Esq., regards with interest the chartering of the Valley
                        railroad, "running through a section of the country, justly termed the
                        granary of the State, with stores of mineral wealth, watering places and
                        points of attraction of great variety; and settled with a large and
                        enterprizing population."</p>
                    <p>The Committee for the Valley Railroad Company, appointed by its Stockholders
                        (Col. M. G. Harman, President; Colonel William Allen, Captain Bolivar
                        Christian and M. Harvey Effinger, Directors) in conference with a Committee
                        appointed by the meeting agreed upon a series of resolutions which were
                        unanimously adopted; in substance that the Manassas Company would transfer
                        its franchise and property in its roads from Harrisonburg to Winchester,
                        provided the Valley Railroad Co. would furnish the means to put in working
                        order the track from Strasburg to Manassas Junction, and would relieve the
                        Manassas Company of its Mortgage debt, at its present market value. The
                        spirit manifested in the meeting indicated a kindly feeling and cordial
                        cooperation between the two Companies, and the best feeling was manifested
                        between the people of the Valley and Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>In this brief synopsis it will be seen that the basis for success in this
                        great work has been firmly laid. It now remains for the bondholders and the
                        people of the Valley to do their part. Every assurance was given to our
                        delegation by the people of the glorious City of Baltimore, of their earnest
                        cooperation in this work. To the Mortgage bondholders, we would say, you can
                        get the present market value, in cash, for your bonds at the First National
                        Bank in Staunton, and that interest and duty alike demand that you bring
                        them forward promptly. If this enterprise is ever to be completed, it is by
                        a combination of all the roads, and by holding back the bonds you will lose
                        all, as it is evident that the Manassas Gap road can never be rebuilt,
                        except by the proposed plan. Then let every bondholder, who has an interest
                        in the material development of our State, act promptly.</p>
                    <p>To our Valley people we hope there is no need of an appeal. Argument, since
                        the Virginian first broke ground on this subject, has been exhausted, and
                        one and all agree that this work is one of vital necessity to us and ours.
                        We are all poor in money, but our lands are the richest in the world; our
                        undeveloped resources incalculable. To bring these lands into market; to
                        develop our mineral resources; to make the Valley the 'Paradise of America,'
                        only needs an extra exertion on our part. But to do this every man must give
                        his mite, and those who have lands subscribe liberally. Friends, the best
                        and truest a people ever had, the people of the City of Baltimore, are
                        standing ready to help us, as they have done ever since the war; but to
                        merit help, we must help ourselves. In five years the appreciation of the
                        value of property will pay for the road, and every point should be strained
                            now by our people to gain so glorious a
                        result. The destiny of the Valley is now, after long years of bad
                        legislation, in the hands of her people--let us see that she is worthy of
                        it.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In speaking of the Convention the Rockingham Register says: The attention of the reader will be attracted by the
                        proceedings of the Valley Railroad Convention, held in Staunton on the 4th
                        inst., and published in this issue of the Register. The attendance on the occasion was large, and the
                        liveliest spirit manifested. We had written out a synopsis of the speeches
                        delivered before the Convention, but our limited space precludes its
                        publication. The effort of each speaker was directed to the gist of the
                        enterprise--immediate action. Gen. Echols entertained the audience in one of
                        the most effective and eloquent impromptu speeches to which we have ever
                        listened on any subject. We had known him as the gallant soldier and the
                        courteous gentleman, but now regard him as one of the most captivating and
                        convincing speakers in the State. Polished in manners, graceful in
                        gesticulation, and clear and practical in argument, he combines the elements
                        of eminent success. Col. Christian struck at the core of his subject, and
                        gave evidence of his entire familiarity with the matter he was discussing.
                        Col. Baldwin, who never speaks except to the point, and does not know how to
                        make a bad speech, encouraged and stimulated his hearers to confidence in
                        the success of the Valley R. R. scheme. Mr. Yellott spoke forcibly and
                        exhibited much earnestness in the cause of this great enterprise--as did,
                        also, Maj. Dorman. Mr. Stuart indulged in a hopeful train of thought, and
                        pictured, in glowing colors, the immense advantage to the Valley and the
                        State, flowing from the construction of the Valley and Manassas Railroads.
                        Col. Harman, who is the soul of action, delved
                        right to the heart of the matter, and urged every one to work, and that in earnest.</p>
