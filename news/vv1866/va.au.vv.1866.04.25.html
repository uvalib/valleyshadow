                    <p>Judge Sharkey told the Reconstruction Committee very plainly that the reason
                        Secessionists filled all the offices in Mississippi was that, "we really had
                        no material of respectability to run against them." Exactly, and as in
                        Mississippi, so everywhere South. And yet radicalism insists upon it that we
                        shall elevate the disreputable trash that were vile before the war, viler
                        during the war, and are now at their very vilest. Put them in a post of
                        profit merely and they will take the salary and neglect the duty. Place them
                        in trust, and they will betray it; give them an office of honor and they
                        will defile and degrade it. They have neither ability nor integrity. Entrust
                        them with money and they will steal it. Put them where a little manliness is
                        required, and they will fly at the appearance of the least danger, or cringe
                        in abject terror at your feet. Knaves and pimps, they may be fit for the
                        office North--not here.</p>

<b>Restoration</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial argues that the policies of Thad Stevens and other "madmen"
                    radicals are driving the Union apart rather than binding it together. The South

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Unity. The practical difficulties in the way of this most desirable result,
                        are greater than even the most sagacious had supposed. Most of us thought
                        that the governmental machine, so soon as the obstructions to its operations
                        were removed, would work smoothly along in its usual and accustomated
                        course. Bitter experience, however, is teaching us better. It is even more
                        painful, and greatly more difficult, to restore a dislocated joint, than to
                        make the dislocation; and it is long--very long before the restored limb
                        regains its former ease and efficiency.</p>
                    <p>We must not then be too much surprised to find, that the restoration of
                        dislocated States is both a painful and difficult operation; to find that
                        the huge and comprehensive machine, so long revolving in new orbits, around
                        new centers, will not suddenly change its motions, and resume the old
                        directions, nor those portions of the machinery, whose operations were
                        entirely suspended during the war be instantly [section unclear]. This
                        result could scarcely be expected if all parties were honestly and earnestly
                        endeavoring to affect a complete and harmonious restoration. Much patience
                        and labor would still be required in readjusting and rebalancing the
                        detached fragments of the disjointed machinery.</p>
                    <p>But the parties who seem to have most control over the machinery of
                        government, to wit; Stevens and his radical crew, so far from linking
                        together its separated parts are forcing them more widely asunder.</p>
                    <p>So far from binding up the bruised and broken limb, they are even tearing the
                        muscles that hold the broken parts, regardless of the sufferings of the
                        wretched victim of their barbarous singing. So far as they hold the reins,
                        they imitate the career of Phaeton, when driving the chariot of the sun--and
                        as little heed, that the ruin of a universe is the result of their reckless
                        driving. It is of course idle to reason or remonstrate with these madmen.
                        What power they have for mischief, they will exert; and we must make up our
                        minds to endure what blows they can inflict. It is their nature, their
                        interest, to strike, where the blow cannot be returned.</p>
                    <p>It is scarcely worth the while even to remind them of the old fable of the
                        belly and the members, or hint, that whether States, Territories, or
                        conquered dependencies, the Southern States are still members of one kind or
                        other of the body politic; and therefore it is utterly impossible to hit
                        Florida, without hurting New York, or to strike any other of these now
                        insignificant and despised limbs, without doing some damage to the general
                        body politic. These people can and will continue to belabour the defenceless
                        Southern limbs, until the northern ones get tired of being hurt in that way
                        themselves, and make them stop it.</p>
                    <p>How long a vile faction, supported by a minority of the people of the U. S.,
                        will be permitted to sport with the vast material interests of the country,
                        in the indulgence of their lust for power, and their fanatical hatred of the
                        South; how long the nation, or that portion of it who have still the means
                        to resist, will submit to be driven to ruin, remains to be seen. How long a
                        party whose every public act is in defiance of justice and constitutional
                        right, in utter disregard of the national welfare, and conceived in the
                        corrupt and selfish purpose of perpetuating their own power, and that power
                        exerted only for tyranny and coveted only for oppression, likewise remains
                        to be seen.</p>
                    <p>We have ample guarantees that the President wishes every [unclear] means in
                        his power [section unclear], and we know the people of the North are holding
                        up his hands. We know too that we are, and can only be, mere spectators of
                        the great game in which we have such a terrible stake, can scarce utter a
                        cheer of encouragement to the combatants in the arena--can only wait, and
                        hope or despair.</p>

                    <p>At a meeting of the Staunton Bar on the 23d inst., Thomas J. Michie, Esq.,
                        was appointed Chairman and Nicholas K. Trout, Secretary.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, a committee consisting of the chairman of
                        the meeting and Messrs. Stuart, Echols, Trout, Henderson, Christian and
                        Baldwin were appointed to prepare resolutions.</p>

                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>1st. Resolved, That with feelings of the deepest
                        sorrow the members of the Staunton Bar have heard of the afflicting
                        dispensation of providence, which has removed from among them in the midst
                        of his usefulness their friend and fellow citizen Judge Lucas P. Thompson,
                        for many years the able and incorruptible Judge of this circuit and recently
                        elected to the branch of the Supreme Court of this State.</p>
                    <p>2d. That in the late Lucas P. Thompson we recognize a lively and illustrious
                        example of all that is noble and attractive among men. With him a fearless
                        love of justice was beautifully tempered with charity and a heart feelingly
                        alive to the finest sensibilities, while over all his manly virtues, the
                        graces of a pure christian faith shed their benignant light, and marked him
                        as one more fit for Heaven than for the strifes and turmoils of earthly
                        habitation. He must be ever remembered as a just, upright, conscientious and
                        learned Judge, and in all the relations of private life as a courteous
                        gentleman, a true, faithful and warmhearted friend, and a charming social
                        companion.</p>
                    <p>3d. That in his death the State has to deplore the loss of one of its purest,
                        ablest and most faithful officers--society one of its brightest and most
                        cherished ornaments, his family circle of the kindest and most affectionate
                        husband, father and brother.</p>
                    <p>4th. That we tender our warmest sympathies and condolence to the bereaved
                        widow and family of our friend, with the assurance that we mingle our tears
                        of sorrow with them in this great affliction.</p>
                    <p>5th. That in token of our esteem and affectionate regard for the deceased, we
                        attend his remains to the grave and wear for thirty days [unclear] badges of
                        mourning.</p>
                    <p>6th. That the proceedings of this meeting be presented to the family of the
                        deceased and published in the newspapers of Staunton and Richmond, and that
                        a copy be communicated to the County Court of Augusta which meets to-day and
                        also to the Circuit Court at its next session.</p>

                    <p>Chorus.</p>
                    <p>White folks say dey give freedom,<br> What dey gib us is all my eye,<br>
                        Free to suffer, free to languish,<br> Free to starve and free to die.<br>
                        No potatoes, corn cake, bacon,<br> We must to starvation bow<br> If dis
                        freedum I's mistaken,<br> But who cares for niggers now.</p>
                    <p>Chorus.</p>
