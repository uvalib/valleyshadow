<b>A Returned Confederate</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article recounts the story of the journey home of an Augusta County
                    soldier who had been held as a prisoner of war. After his release from Johnson's
                    Island, he was without money or means to get back to his home nine miles from
                    Staunton. After reaching Indiana on foot, he got into a scrape with a Federal
                    officer at a bar. The officer had sworn to kill any of Ashby's men he came
                    across, and since the returning Confederate fought with that unit, the two got
                    into a fight. The Confederate, who was wounded, was later arrested.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints an excerpt from a Petersburg paper which outlines Thad
                    Stevens' plans for the reconstruction of the South. According to the article,
                    the State governments will be destroyed and treated as conquered provinces,
                    southern property will be confiscated and given to African American soldiers,

<b>The Future and Our Duties</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial comes out in opposition to the 14th Amendment and offers
                    suggestions for how to deal with the situation if it passes. The article asserts
                    that if African Americans get right of suffrage, the white South can "control

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last week we re-published the proposed Constitutional Amendment. At a glance
                        our readers can see that it practically disfranchises our best citizens, and
                        the proviso about representation means that if we make the concession asked,
                        it will be followed by a demand for further humiliation. On general
                        principles, we are opposed to amending the Constitution in any form until
                        all the States are fully represented, but more especially are we opposed to
                        this amendment. It would be unbecoming in a brave and honest people to
                        ratify a provision they believe fraught with mischief to the whole country,
                        and the bribe offered, of increased representation, is too essentially
                        Yankee to meet with anything but reprobation and scorn in the South.</p>
                    <p>In this connection we find our views so fully expressed by that brave and
                        honest paper, the New York Freeman's Journal, that we adopt them. It says:
                        "Either the people who constitute each political
                            State in the South have a right to be represented in the United States Congress, or they
                        have not! We hold they have the right. But, if so, they have a right to
                        choose their representatives, freely--be the ones chosen black or white--be
                        they native or foreign born--and no matter what their antecedents--so being
                        that they fulfil the conditions laid down in the fundamental law--called the Constitution of the United States."</p>
                    <p>The provisions of this "bill of abominations" may be practically forced upon
                        us by the mad folly of the Radicals, if they continue in power; negro
                        suffrage may be enforced at the point of the bayonet on a disarmed and
                        helpless people, whose only crime is a gallant defence of what they honestly
                        believed to be right. The infernal and ineradicable hatred of the New
                        England Yankee Radicals to the Southern people may glut itself by forcing
                        this obnoxious policy upon us, but let it never be said that the manhood and
                        principle of the South have sunk so low as to consent to it as right, or endorse it by making it even in form law.</p>
                    <p>Some will ask, "What are we to do?" Suppose the negroes are, by force,
                        endowed with all the privileges of freeborn white men; suppose the Radicals
                        carry the day, and Andrew Johnson and his party back down? Suppose
                        everything that is diabolical and mean; suppose this people, the gallant and
                        glorious people of the South, are to be overrun with swarms of Radical
                        vermin, or worse still, ruled by the dirty scoundrels called "Southern
                        Loyalists"--what then? Better this than the self-imposed degradation of
                        voting for this amendment. If forced to meet the issue of practical negro
                        suffrage, we can meet it and control it, as we have always controlled the
                        negro element among us. And, while utterly and forever refusing to accept
                        the principles, or endorse in any way, shape, or form, the proposed
                        amendment, let us prepare for the worst and look the future steadily and
                        calmly in the face. Let each and every man so do his duty towards this
                        unfortunate class that is a thing they do not desire is forced upon them by
                        their enemies and ours the blow aimed at us by the Radical devils may be
                        turned against them. It can be done if good sense and sound practiced
                        judgement is used by the whites, and it behooves ever man, white and black,
                        now to use his influence, that, come what may, the damnable schemes of the
                        Radical Abolitionists for the destruction of the black race, and the ruin of
                        the country, shall be defeated, even by the very weapons they propose to use
                        against us.</p>
                    <p>The past, with its hopes; its suffering; its horrors and its glories, is
                        behind us. It is useless to dwell upon it in discussing the stern, practical
                        present. Mighty issues are upon us. A run mad mob, flushed with victory and
                        hate, and conscious of power, pay no respect to our feelings, or our views,
                        but seek in every way to insult and degrade us. It becomes us then, as a
                        people, the guardians of the fame and name of a glorious race, to look well
                        to it, that nothing is done by our constituted State authorities to disgrace
                        us or tarnish the glory of the loved and lost. But, at the same time, it is
                        our duty to look facts sternly in the face, and be prepared for all that may
                        be forced upon us. Every man should think over this question, seriously, and
                        taking counsel with his God, do his duty, without fear, favor, or affection.</p>
                    <p>We are among those who believe that our destiny, as a people, is in our own
                        hands, and we believe that nothing is to be gained by concessions to the
                        vile spirit of Radicalism at home, or in the North. We have done enough to
                        satisfy their most outrageous demands, and our duty now is so plain that "he
                        who runs may read" it. We repeat it is to think, to work, to encourage every
                        mechanical enterprise, to cultivate the most friendly relations with the
                        freedmen, to hold to our honor--all that is left--and in a few years we can
                        laugh to scorn the efforts of the scum of the earth to degrade us. Always
                        remember the true maxim "that no one but himself can disgrace a man."</p>
                    <p>We repeat it again, think, work, act. Teach the
                        rising generation to be practical, to be Yankees in energy and perseverance,
                        and in that alone, encourage every mechanical and manufacturing enterprise;
                        develope every resource of this grand country; work with an eye single to
                        the great object of achieving material independence, and political strength
                        necessarily follows. Out of this country, by hard knocks, our future is to
                        be made prosperous and happy; and if we are worthy of our past, we can make
                        it all, and more than the most sanguine ever dreamed.</p>

                    <p>The Dispatch has an interesting correspondence
                        from Long Branch in this County. He represents the crops as fine, especially
                        on the Staunton River, particularly the Tobacco crop. He says the negroes
                        are more contented than in any other portion of the State, and are working
                        well. The writer informs the public of a fact we were fully aware of long
                        ago, and that is the remarkable beauty and attractiveness of the ladies of
                        old Halifax, and of that region. Speaking of Long Branch he says: "This
                        place was not on the map of Virginia when your correspondent was a boy,
                        learning geography; but since that time it has grown to be a place of vast
                        importance, and perhaps it can now be found by reference to some late
                        editions of the map of Virginia. It is handsomely situated on the banks of
                        the Staunton, and is widely celebrated for its great beauty and hospitality.
                        There has been some diminution of the population here owing to the result of
                        the war; still it continues in a most prosperous condition, and promises to
                        be as attractive as ever." We wonder if "owing to the result of peace,"
                            somebody hasn't hopes of making it still
