                <summary>This article argues that the Southern Press is experiencing a renaissance
                    in advocating the "material development of the country." The downfall of the
                    pre-war press was its preoccupation with politics at the expense of concerning
                    itself with the well-being of its citizens.</summary>

                    <p>We utter but a trite sentiment when we say that the future of the South is in
                        the hands of its young men. How many of them are qualifying themselves to
                        manage its factories, control its railroads, mine its ores, work its machine
                        shops, and cultivate its plantations? Professional men it has in
                        abundance--able lawyers, accomplished physicians, eloquent speakers. These
                        have their uses, but the growth of a State depends less on them than on the
                        character of the men who manage its industrial enterprises. What is most
                        needed in the South to-day is that the young blood which fought for us so
                        gallantly should work for it as determinedly. On the plantation, in the
                        shop, in the factory, there the South is to effect its true restoration. The
                        young men who dug trenches and fed on hominy and pork, who went clad in
                        homespun grey and who slept in cold or rain or shine under the canopy of the
                        heavens to further the fortunes, as they believed, of their native land, can
                        now do noble service by laying hold of its plough handles, turning its
                        lathes, guiding its spindles, handling its locomotives. But there is want of
                        capital! No matter--They have youth, health, hope, ambition and good
                        abilities. They have every incentive for which to work. Begin with a will,
                        and success will crown their efforts. <emph rend="italic">National

                    precedent. It implies that there are no limits to changes to the constitution.
                    It is the "very body of the Constitution which is now in danger," the article
                    declares. Furthermore, it could increase, rather than decrease sectionalism,
                    although the next split would combine the West and the South against the
                    Northeast.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>It was a favorite sneer of our enemies for many years preceding the late war,
                        says the Petersburg Index, that the radical defect of the Southern people
                        was the lack of industry and enterprise. Because we were an agricultural
                        community with labor so cheap and land so abundant that there was little
                        stimulus to strict economy or cunning invention, we were regarded as
                        inferior beings to the owners of less fertile and less abundant acres, who
                        were compelled to live by their wits rather than by plodding industry.</p>
                    <p>This folly, with many others, was dissipated in our revolution. Who in
                        history have borne hardships? Ours have been greater. Who have created
                        resources? We more. Who showed patience? We a greater measure. Who labored
                        zealously? We with greater diligence. Who endured privations? We more, and
                        more cheerfully. Who defied cold and hunger and nakedness? We, with more
                        tranquil courage. And who in all time, have endured with more sublime
                        fortitude the extinguishment of their hopes and self-government.</p>
                    <p>We make these claims without a blush, for they comprise all that is left to
                        us worth cherishing.</p>
                    <p>But if the youth of the South shall turn into the channel of labor, art,
                        invention, and enterprise, the patience, endurance, skill, fertility, energy
                        and resolve which they lavished in the vain effort to achieve their freedom,
                        ten years will establish us in a condition of power, wealth and influence
                        which was undreamed of by our fathers.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, let us keep out of politics, but keep a thorough and perfect
                        social unity. No one can suggest one benefit from mixing in the political
                        squabbles of this rotten republic, while the evils are potent and numerous.
                        Not the least of these is the division of our own people into parties, and
                        the consequent severance of a strength which should be consolidated.</p>
                    <p>The time is certain to arrive as the Spring surely follows the Winter, when
                        Southern unity will settle the politics of this sentiment. Disfranchisement,
                        confiscation, registry laws, exclusion from the Union--showing that the
                        malice of man can invent, will be able to drive five millions of men from
                        their inheritance. Nothing but their own folly can destroy their [section
                        unclear].</p>

                    country. In the meantime, southerners should stay out of politics to prevent
                    breaking the region's unity.</summary>

                    <p>Our full report of the Radical Programme, and extracts from reliable
                        journals, leave us but little to say on this ever present subject. We can
                        only refer our readers to our columns, and ask to be excused from "boring"
                        them with a long article this week.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature of Virginia has met and is hammering away at express and
                        other bills. The "usury laws" will be repealed, and money will be more
                        plentiful, and at a lower rate of interest. The constitutional amendment
                        will be defeated and the Legislature will, we hope, attend to its duties to
                        the State and adjourn.</p>
                    <p>Congress, "so called," is still "on the rampage," and is very belligerent
                        against the unarmed and defenseless Southern people. It pushes all questions
                        through without debate, and unless Andrew Johnson is the man we take him
                        for, all our manhood will be needed to meet the troubles coming. The
                        difficulties anticipated with France and England are over for the present,
                        but what the crazy men in Washington will do; what trouble they will bring
                        us into, Providence alone can foresee.</p>
                    <p>The labor market of the North is overcrowded and the papers caution those in
                        want of work not to come North or West. The South wants labor and <emph
                            rend="italic">work</emph>, and we see in this a good sign for our
                        future.</p>
                    <p>European advices, telegraphed at great expense to our valued city
                        contemporaries, state that all the French troops will certainly leave Mexico
                        in March--and who cares if they do?</p>
                    <p>On the whole, we regard the situation as no better and no worse than it was
                        before Congress met. Some people will continue to be fools; the rascals now
                        in Congress will attempt many terrible things <emph rend="italic">on

                    <p><emph rend="italic">Dear Virginian:</emph> I have read with much serious and
                        pleasing attention the article, "Mechanics in Society," in a late issue, and
                        while I fully and heartily endorse your views, allow me, in conformity with
                        your invitation, to give you a few thoughts of mine on this useful and most
                        interesting subject. After all the spoliation and plunder, blood and tears
                        of those past terrible years of war; I cannot consider the South a ruined
                        country. I will take our own dear Virginia as an illustration of her sister
                        States, and what in my remarks may apply to her, will, I think, accurately
                        apply to all. We are at present in a state of social and political
                        transition, and it behooves every individual to be watchful, to understand
                        his position and his duty, and knowing both "vacillate not, whatsoever
                        ensue."</p>
                    <p>Before the war commenced, many of our young men were leaving this fair land
                        for the far west. They made them a home in the forest, reclaimed a little
                        "patch" for life's poor sustenance, and careless and heedless of "dismal
                        swamps" and disadvantages, they determined to abide there free and
                        independent. This was commencing life with a vengeance. Need our young men
                        do this to-day? What do they want? Our climate is unequaled, our valley
                        fair, our mountains rich, iron, coal, water--all in abundance. No crushing
                        power now to warp their manly aspirations, or keep their glowing hopes in
                        "durance vile." We need their patient, heroic, dauntless spirits in this day
                        of our adversity, to bring forth the smiling flowers of peaceful and
                        triumphant industry, from the brow of our kind old mother, and the graves of
                        the glorious dead. Nine hundred thousand Parisians gathered around the
                        silent sleepers in the cities of the dead. Shall we fly from the consecrated
                        dust of ours, because, for a moment, tyranny shakes out over the abode of
                            <emph rend="italic">our</emph> dead the black flag of revenge? No,
                        never.</p>
                    <p>To be sure we are now treated as a conquered people by a foreign government,
                        for we cannot regard as other than foreign a power that treats us with harsh
                        severity and open injustices. In this letter I intend to eschew politics and
                        take things here as they are in their cold reality.</p>
                    <p>All the evils of war can be corrected in peace, and the buggaboo of taxes,
                        &amp;c., will cease to frighten when we give ourselves no time to
                        consider them, and apply all our energies and hours to the cultivation of
                        our land and the economical arrangement of our business. Agriculture must be
                        first considered in relation to our progress as a free and powerful people.
                        We are still free--still powerful, and in the plenitude of nature's good
                        gifts, we only require the active agency of our own sleeping energies.</p>
                    <p>Let us then impress on the minds of our young men the truth, that as
                        agriculture is the most useful branch of human industry, it is also the most
                        honorable, and that though others may feel pleasure in the investigations
                        and experiments of the higher sciences, none yield more happiness. The
                        farmer beautifies the country, spreads out the bounties of nature for our
                        support, and looks on domestic comfort as the truest criterion of a nation's
                        glory and prosperity. His is no life of drudgery, education beautifies his
                        labor, and nature is ever speaking to his heart those lessons of wisdom that
                        render life a pleasure instead of a burden.</p>
                    <p>The great object now before us is to show how necessary to the general good
                        are all kinds of labor, and that labor alone, honestly and intellectually
                        applied, creates true nobility. I would wish that instead of "Mechanics in
                        Society," you had "Working men in Society." Every man has a duty to perform.
                        Labor is the first duty; the act of living establishes the necessity of
                        labor, and as all communities depend on this necessity, they must
                        acknowledge its rights and prerogatives. Labor is not always [unclear], nor
                        it is not always progressive; but when employed in developing the resources
                        of a country, giving life, and health, and energy, to all its members, then
                        it is industry. And this is the mission that labor has to fulfill here--to
                        call forth from the depths of earth its hidden treasures, and spread around
                        the blossoms and buds of perennial harvests. We degraded labor by silly
                        classification heretofore, and the melting, tender heart of the toiler was
                        spurned, because his hand was rough and horney from toil, for the support
                        and aggrandizement of our silken lords. The working man must learn to what
                        extent society depends on him, under this and every other form of
                        government--under present and all other circumstances. The two great
                        principles of self reliance and self denial cannot be too vigorously
                        promulgated, for they are the basis of true greatness in individuals as well
                        as in communities.</p>
                    <p>We must learn to deny ourselves those superficialities of life when strongly
                        tended to enervate our people morally, physically, and intellectually. We
                        must go back to primitive habits, and thus strengthening our mind and
                        renewing our hearts, at the pure fountain of virtue and temperance, we will
                        be able to rely on ourselves for the accomplishment of the great destiny
                        before us.</p>
                    <p>We must restore confidence; to do so, we must inculcate as prime essentials,
                        mutual esteem and mutual reliance, and learning to what extent we are
                        indebted to individual exertion, let us insist on the diffusion of our
                        knowledge and general education. Thus we may, in the not very distant
                        future, point out as triumphs of a brave people's hope, patience and
                        perseverance, flourishing cities and towns, commerce and manufactures, free,
                        healthy and active, benevolent institutions, nurseries of learning, and a
                        contented nation, enjoying life's blessing in free and happy homes.</p>
                    <p>Let us magnanimously drop the mendicant's whine and hide our wounds:</p>
                    <p>Never under wrongs despair,<lb/> Labor long and everywhere,<lb/> Link your
                        countrymen, prepare,<lb/> And strike home,<lb/> Thus was greatness

                <summary>This letter to the editor qualifies the Virginian's long-standing call for
                    the South to take up industrial pursuits. The writer agrees that labor is
                    important to the prosperity of the post-war South, but argues that agricultural
                    labor is more beneficial than other forms.</summary>

                    <p>The English papers record, with expressions of surprise at its novelty, the
                        fact that several large ship loads of emigrants have recently left their
                        shores for the Southern States. The bulk of these emigrants seem to have
                        gone to Texas, because a belief exists amongst foreigners that not only are
                        political troubles and civil disturbances at an end in that State, but they
                        are less likely to recur there for the future, than in any other portion of
                        the South. The fact that all of these emigrants were the best and most
                        respectable class of English, Scottish and Welch agriculturalists, indicates
                        what a choice portion of foreign immigration would seek the South, if our
                        enemies would only permit the pacification and repose of our country. If we
                        had only a fair showing, it would soon be seen that while the North and West
                        got all the undesirable Teuton element, that we would get the pick of the
                        Anglo-Saxon and Latin races. The foreign element which has settled in the
                        South, though not large, has always been eminently respectable. We have
                        never had those hordes of European paupers and convicts which have rushed to
                        the North and West as the places just suited to them. None of this class of
                        emigrants fancy the South; they find nothing congenial here; they flock
                        where there are birds of a like feather, and we make no protest against
                    it.</p>

                    12 inches by 6, and covered with two inch plank, was burned through. The Fire
                    Company deserves great credit for their promptness."</summary>

                <summary>The Circuit Court met, Judge H. W. Sheffey presiding. The cases involving
                    contracts made during Confederate times were decided as follows: "All money
                    values must be ascertained in the current coin of the United States, at the
                    times when the values are required to be ascertained; and for the amounts so
                    found judgement must be given, and not for the equivalent of such gold amounts
                    in greenback currency." The case Booten vs Schaffer, to recover possession of
                    half of the Virginia Hotel, was decided in favor of Schaffer. "This suit
                    involved the question of a contract between Booten and Schaffer made in November
                    19th, 1863, in which Booten alleges that he sold Schaffer one-half of said
                    property, giving him the election of taking the other half in one year. Which
                    election Booten declared Schaffer did not make, Schaffer claiming that he had
                    done so. The Court decreed that one of the Commissioners of the Court take state
                    and settlement of the account of the purchase money due the plaintiff from the
                    defendant, according to the value of the contract price, and, also an account of
                    any outstanding liens on said property, which ought to be relieved before the
                    plaintiff can claim his purchase money or the defendant be required to take the
                    plaintiff's conveyance of title."</summary>

                    with the Legislature. Crawford, Balthis and Hope were also absent. Mr. A. B.
                    Irick who owns the Methodist parsonage was granted tax exemption because the
                    property is used by the Church. Mr. P. N. Powell, a merchant, was exempted from
                    payment of erroneously assessed income taxes. John Christian, "colored,"
                    presented a petition asking that the Council "so modify the tax on bowling
                    saloons as to enable him to erect one and pay the tax." The Council asked the
                    Recorder to settle the question regarding salt and bags due the town. On motion
                    of R. G. Bickle, the Council directed the Attorney for the Corporation to
                    institute legal proceedings for settlement on the official bond of R. W.
                    Stevenson, late Chief of Police. A report was received regarding construction of
                    a Poor house, which showed 28 paupers living in town. The report was accepted,
                    and arrangements were made to appoint a Poor House Overseer. The Clerk was
                    ordered to settle the accounts of R. H. Fisher, Overseer of the Poor. A motion
                    to construct an additional lamp post at Gospel Hill was presented. The Market
                    Law was given to Evans, Peck and Bickle for revision.</summary>

                    <p>Since the annual report was written, the Board of Visitors, Officers and
                        Pupils of the Institution, have been called upon to mourn the loss which has
                        been sustained in the Blind Department, in the death of its Teacher of
                        Music. He had been for many months a sufferer from Inflammatory
                        Rheumatism--but died of Dropsy of the Chest. His death took place on the
                        21st of October. In the evening of the next day, impressive funeral services
                        were performed in the Chapel of the Institution, before the members of the
                        Board, the Officers and Pupils of the Institution and a number of friends,
                        after which his remains were conveyed to Thornrose Cemetery, and deposited
                        in the lot belonging to the Institution.</p>
                    <p>As a tribute of respect, the Board of Visitors of "The Institution for the
                        Deaf and Dumb and the Blind," in view of the fact of his long connection
                        with the Institution, and his faithful services therein--have</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the untimely death of Prof. W. C.
                        Graham of the Blind Department of the Virginia Institution for the Deaf and
                        Dumb and the Blind, is deeply deplored.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That it affords us melancholy pleasure
                        to testify our high sense of his ability as a public officer.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That in view of the relations which have
                        so long subsisted between the Institution and the lamented dead, we claim it
                        as a privilege to testify our regard by defraying his funeral expenses.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we tender his afflicted sister and
                        other relations, our heartfelt sympathy and condolence.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That these resolutions be published in
                        the Staunton papers, and that a copy of them be sent to the sister of the
                        deceased.</p>
                    <p>At a meeting of the Board held at the Institution on the 3d of November,
                        1866, for the purpose of filling the vacancy occasioned by the death of
                        Prof. W. C. Graham, an election was gone into which resulted the appointment
                        of Prof. A. J. Turner, and Mrs. Mary Ann Gifford, to be instructors of music
                        in the blind department of the Institution. The Board congratulate
                        themselves and the pupils of the Institution, thus to have secured the
                        services of two instructors, so well known for their accomplishments in
                        their profession.</p>
