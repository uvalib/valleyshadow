                    <p>The committee, after an absence of an hour, reported the following
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>REPORT.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, 1st, That it gives strong hope of the
                        success of the great enterprise in which we are engaged to find at this busy
                        period of the year, and in the present straitened circumstances of our
                        people, delegates from so many counties of the State, convened to devise the
                        best means for ensuring the construction of the Valley Railroad.</p>
                    <p>2d, That we deem the construction of a Railroad from the Potomac to the
                        Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, essential to the full development and
                        prosperity of the great Valley of Virginia, a result which can never be
                        accomplished by means of roads passing from mountain to mountain, across the
                        Valley and at right angles to the line of its production and wealth.</p>
                    <p>3d, That we regret that an improvement as essential to the welfare and growth
                        of one third of the State should, by any, be termed antagonistic to the
                        interest of any other part of the Commonwealth, to the commercial prosperity
                        of our cities, or as affecting injuriously the security of her investments
                        in internal improvements, and we think it can be demonstrated by argument,
                        and are sure it will be shown by experience, that such wealth cannot flow
                        from a course so fruitful of blessings to one of the great divisions of the
                        Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>4th That the first steps to be taken by the friends of the proposed road, is
                        to cause to be opened, at suitable places, books of subscription to the
                        stock of the Valley Railroad Company, and that so soon as one thousand
                        shares of such Stock shall have been subscribed, a meeting of Stockholders
                        should be convened, and the Company organized in accordance with the
                        provisions of its Charter.</p>
                    <p>5th. That books of subscription be opened at such times and places as the
                        Commissioners named in the Charter deem most expedient.</p>
                    <p>6th, That as soon as the Company shall have been organized, its true policy
                        will be to form such connections with the Virginia Railroads between
                        Harrisonburg and the Potomac, as will afford such guarantees, founded on
                        unity of interest and concert of action as will tend to induce capitalists
                        from abroad to invest in this Stock of the Company, in accordance with the
                        regulations to be presented by the Board of Directors, and also to ensure
                        the cooperation of the cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and other
                        commercial cities, in the speedy completion of the work.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Christian, offered the following amendment, which was adopted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart explained and enforced the report of the committee, in an able
                        speech of half an hour.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Christian read the provision of the Charter of the Valley Railroad, and
                        offered the following amendment to the report of the committee:</p>
                    <p>Amendment--That the Books for subscription of
                        Stock are to be opened now and here; and in the opinion of the Convention, the
                        amount necessary to secure the Charter should be taken, and an organization
                        effected without delay.</p>
                    <p>That we hail with joy the prospect, held out by the acts of the Legislatures
                        of Virginia and West Virginia, of the speedy completion of the Covington and
                        Ohio Railroad; a work destined to pour into Virginia a full tide of
                        wealth--giving trade from the Valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi, to
                        receive and distribute the outgoing and incoming currents of which will tax
                        the capacities of all the improvements of Virginia, including those of the
                        Valley Railroad, which we foresee will be one of the most valuable arteries
                        of the Great Central trunk line of commerce, attracting from districts and
                        cities lying North east as well as Southwest, of the point of intersection
                        of the two improvements, trade and travel which would not otherwise reach
                        the central improvement; and at that point receiving for distribution,
                        freight and passengers, which otherwise would now pass over the central
                        line.</p>
                    <p>7th, That we cannot close these expressions of our views, without declaring
                        the pleasure with which we have read the Proclamation of the President of
                        the United States, restoring Virginia, to the full enjoyment of her rights
                        as a State in the Union, and to her people the unobstructed privilege of
                        pursuing the arts of peace and of reviving the prosperity of the
                        Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>General Echols, of Augusta, supported the resolution of Mr. Christian, in a
                        forcible, practical and eloquent speech.</p>
                    <p>Colonel M. G. Harman concurred in the able and eloquent remarks of Gen.
                        Echols, and appealed to every farmer and business man in the Valley, to
                        subscribe to the capital Stock to the extent of his ability.</p>
                    <p>The vote was then taken on the report of the committee, and the amendment,
                        and both were unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>Col. A. S. Grey, in the Chair. On motion of Mr. Word, of Botetourt, a
                        committee of two was appointed by the Chairman, consisting of Messrs. Word
                        and Christian, to wait upon Col. J. B. Baldwin, with a request from the
                        Convention that he appear to address them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart again addressed the Convention in a spirited and well conceived
                        Speech.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Baldwin made his appearance, and delivered a brief address, replete
                        with sound, practical sense, and earnest appeal.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. J. B. Dorman and Coleman Yellott, of Rockbridge, having been called
                        upon respectively by the Convention, delivered brief and appropriate
                        Speeches, which were received with evidences of gratification by the
                        audience.</p>
                    <p>At this point, Col. Harman announced to the Chair, that more than enough of
                        stock had been subscribed, to comply with the requirements of the Charter,
                        before the organization of a Company could be effected; and on his motion,
                        the Convention adjourned with a request from the President, that the
                        Stockholders meet in the Court House at 5 o'clock, P. M., to elect a
                        President and Directors.</p>
                    <p>John T. Anderson, President.</p>
                    <p>S. M. Yost, A. M. Garber, Jr., S. H. Letcher, Secretaries.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Washington Chronicle of the 5th report that a
                        current report says Ex-President Davis has made application for a writ of
                            Habeus Corpus; his ground for so doing being
                        the President's peace proclamation. And why not? If the war is at an end and
                        a whole people declared restored to their rights, why should their
                        representative head be kept in prison? Jefferson Davis was but the agent of
                        eight millions of people and there is no true man among them who does not
                        feel that his imprisonment is wrong, while they whom he represented go free.
                        In this connection we quote a few sensible remarks on this subject from a
                        late member of the N. Y. Herald. May we soon be
                        able to chronicle the glad tidings of Mr. Davis' release and return to his
                        home, friends, family and usefulness in the great work before us, The Herald says:</p>
                    <p>Jefferson Davis is not a criminal in the ordinary sense. His acts are lifted
                        out of the category of crimes by their national character. They are to be
                        judged in a different light from that in which we examine the common
                        offences against society for which we prepare the prison and the halter. In
                        the celebrated debate in Parliament on the American colonies Edmund Burke
                        recognized the difficulty of framing a bill of indictment against a whole
                        people. This same difficulty embarrasses the case of Davis. Where we can
                        allege any act against the United States that was his personally, and that
                        was not done by him as a representative of a people, who, according to the
                        dogmas on which our government is founded, had a full right to the exercise
                        of sovereign powers? Did Jefferson Davis wage war against us at Gettysburg,
                        on July 2, 1863? Then who was it waged war at Vicksburg, on the same day? If
                        we set about accusing of treason the whole people, whose will this man
                        carried out, from what stand-point shall we frame our accusation? Shall it
                        be from the standpoint of those in the government who maintain that the
                        Southern States are conquered territory, and, therefore, that the
                        confederacy was a foreign nation? Doubtless we should frame it from this
                        latter, as this is the view of those who clamor for the trial of Davis. But
                        if he was the ruler of a foreign nation, how shall we punish him for treason
                        against our government?</p>
                    <p>We must take in this case higher ground than any people or government has
                        hitherto had the moral courage to take. We must throw aside the ancient
                        fictions, and deal with facts as facts. We must recognize that men like
                        Davis have had their grand uses in the life of a nation; that they make
                        those stands and cause those wars that purify government and render it
                        impossible for it to become partial and tyrannical. Davis represented some
                        millions of men who believed that they were oppressed, and who rose with the
                        spirit of freemen. Shall we stultify our history--our immortal
                        declaration--by saying that the representative of all those men deserves
                        death for having been their representative? Where does government originate?
                        With the people--we declare by every fact of our history. And with how many
                        people if not with eight millions? We agree with the radical members that
                        Congress should take up the case of Davis, but we believe it should take it
                        up only to set him at large on these high grounds recognizing openly and
                        bravely as the sense of the American people that acts such as his do not
                        deserve death. We shudder as we read of the terrible acts of British
                        officials in Jamaica, who out barbarize barbarism; we shudder to contemplate
                        British judges sending men to twenty years penal servitude for the crime of
                        desiring a better government for their country. Let us be consistent with
                        these feelings, and set an example of national magnanimity that may put that
                        Power to the blush. Our cause does not call for any man's blood, and we must
                        not let partisan hatred put its bloody stains on our national history.</p>

                        "Miscegenation in Staunton," in our last issue, sends us a communication in

                        benefit of his explanation. He can't see how any one could possibly "deny so
                        plain a fact." He says:--</p>
                    <p>"Under the above title appeared an article in the "Virginian," in which, from
                        a want of knowledge of facts, probably, the writer was extremely severe in his denouncement of the conduct, of one whom
                        he called a "Disciple of Miscegenation," &amp;c. The facts were these;
                        which we give, hoping to correct a false impression.</p>
                    <p>At the close of Sabbath School, a pupil, wishing to obtain a hymn book, was
                        told, that those for sale were at our house. Being determined to obtain one,
                        she watched us start and came down the walk at the same time. We thought of
                        asking her to walk behind, lest we might be misrepresented. But the thought
                        that she was, as we supposed, known to be a pupil, and that we were going
                        nowhere else than from School home, and that it was known that our business
                        brings us necessarily into contact with these
                        people, more than it does citizens, would, we thought, save us from being
                        misunderstood in our motives. As to "Miscegenation in Staunton" we will not
                        deny so plain a fact; but do
                            most emphatically deny being a "Disciple" ourselves, as no man
                        can be more opposed to the doctrine than we are, and have ever been."</p>

                    <p>The proceedings of this Convention will be found on our first page. It was
                        largely attended and after some skirmishing, went to work the right way. The
                        well known energy of the officers elected and the enthusiasm of the people
                        on this subject, give every guarantee that the road will soon be put under
                        contract. One great point is to unite it and the Manassas Gap Railroad, and,
                        we have every reason to hope that object will soon be accomplished. A
                        noticeable feature in the Convention, was, the enthusiasm that the mere
                        mention of the name of the glorious City of Baltimore, gave rise to. In a
                        few days, we feel confident, we can send good news to our people about the
                        Valley Railroad.</p>
