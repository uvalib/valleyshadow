<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that "a lot of negroes got up a small sized row in

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper disparages Congress's decision not to receive a letter from the

<b>Early and Sheridan: Letter From General Early</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Confederate General Jubal Early responds to a letter written by Union
                    General Philip Sheridan, in which Sheridan gave an account of his 1864
                    Shenandoah Valley campaign. Early argues that Sheridan used his letter to
                    sustain a "fictitious reputation." He disputes each of Sheridan's estimates of
                    troop strengths and prisoners taken, arguing that the Confederate forces were
                    smaller, and Union forces larger, than Sheridan depicted.<br>

<b>Amendments to the Constitution</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper ridicules Congress's desire to pass more constitutional
                    amendments by publishing a list of items suggested for amendment by a Brooklyn
                    salesman.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The rage for amending the Constitution has been extended to a back street in
                        the city of Brooklyn, and a practical statesman there, thus announces the
                        amendments which he favors:</p>
                    <p>1. To provide that no landlord shall raise rent of any house to be let for
                        the ensuing year.</p>
                    <p>2. To regulate the price of butter.</p>
                    <p>3. To limit the price of surloin steak to twenty cents a pound.</p>
                    <p>4. To prohibit the city railroad companies from carrying more than sixty
                        passengers in a car; also, prohibiting the companies from employing as
                        conductors agents for the circulation of counterfeit currency.</p>
                    <p>5. Authorizing ladies to occupy seats in the railroad cars and ferry-boats,
                        whenever they can get them.</p>
                    <p>6. To suspend the collection of all taxes.</p>
                    <p>7. Providing everybody with a house and lot or farm on Long Island.</p>
                    <p>8. To regulate the price of coal.</p>
                    <p>9. To raise everybody's wages.</p>
                    <p>10. Abolishing gas bills.</p>
                    <p>11. Abolishing railroad accidents.</p>
                    <p>12. To provide husbands for all marriageable young ladies over thirty-five.</p>
                    <p>13. To compel every subscriber to pay in advance for his paper.</p>
                    <p>I have two or three dozen more amendments, but those will do to start with.</p>
                    <p>What is the use of having a Constitution, if it won't regulate things to suit
                        everybody?</p>
                    <p>Next to the claims of the superior race, the alleviation of the condition of
                        married men with small incomes and large families ought to attract the
                        attention of Congress.</p>
                    <p>They have been at the mercy of landlords, coal dealers and corner groceries
                        long enough.</p>
                    <p>There are several other measures which I propose to lay before Congress.</p>
                    <p>One to establish a bureau to take care of everybody who don't feel like
                        working for a living, with authority to draw on the government for rations
                        of roast turkey, charlotte russe, overcoats, whiskey and chewing tobacco.</p>
                    <p>To pay off the national debt by a tax on public speaking.</p>
                    <p>I am not in favor of universal suffrage.</p>
                    <p>I don't think children in arms should be allowed to vote.</p>
                    <p>Or emigrants before they come to this country.</p>
                    <p>But the franchise ought to be extended to women.</p>
                    <p>Men have had exclusive control of the voting, and a pretty condition of
                        affairs they have brought the country to.</p>
                    <p>Lovely women may stoop to folly, but she can't do worse than the men who
                        elected the present Congress.</p>
                    <p>I think I will run for Congress next fall on this platform.</p>

<b>The Valley Railroad--Labor in Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an editorial in favor of a bill incorporating the Valley
                    Railroad. The editors argue that the road would attract capital to the Valley
                    and establish Richmond as a key center of Atlantic trade, bringing both goods
                    and immigrants to Virginia. The article also comments on usury laws, and the
                    need for labor in the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We agree with the Enquirer when it says: The Legislature succeeded in not
                        doing some good things, and for that reason has been reproached with having
                        done nothing at all. But of one act there is a division of opinion, which on
                        the one side produces perfect satisfaction, and on the other most unanimous
                        dismay. We allude to the act of incorporation for the Valley Railroad.
                        Already an immense volume of words has been published on that subject. But
                        we have not seen a view of the question presented from an entirely
                        disinterested source--disinterested either in point of emolument or pride of
                        citizenship--until our attention was directed to a letter in last Friday's
                        issue of the New York World, from the pen of their experienced and well
                        informed correspondent who is sojourning in this city. He speaks truly when
                        he says that "the Shenandoah road will, even before its commencement, infuse
                        new life and energy through the whole Valley, rouse the farmers to activity,
                        and bring capital like a fertilizing summer rain after a long drouth, to
                        make the harvests wave again over those desolate battle-fields." The recent
                        and daily occurring purchases of real estate all along the Valley between
                        Staunton and Winchester by Northern capitalists, while they divest the
                        language of the correspondent of its prophetic sense, they corroborate its
                        correctness.</p>
                    <p>"This," he adds, "necessarily creates a back country to enrich the tempting
                        city of Richmond, which, seizing the golden moment, will at once turn its
                        wonderful water-power to account, and become--as it would and should long
                        since have been--one of the, if not the most flourishing manufacturing
                        cities of the United States. In the meantime the capitalists of the far-off
                        State of Ohio and Missouri, quite as interested as even those of Virginia in
                        finding the nearest and most direct outlet to the Atlantic ocean across her
                        surface, will doubtless come eagerly forward to aid in building the
                        Covington and Ohio Railroad. Norfolk, with its fine climate and magnificent
                        harbor, capable of holding the navies of the world, will necessarily bestir
                        itself to meet the coming change and lines of ocean steamers will be
                        speedily established, brining foreign immigrants direct to the shore of
                        Virginia, and returning to Europe with the rich produce of the great West,
                        which must ultimately take that route to the Atlantic, which is hundred of
                        miles nearer than via New York, and open at all seasons of the year."</p>
                    <p>The refusal of the Legislature to repeal or amend the Usury Laws, leaves the
                        people under the most serious disabilities in obtaining money. The
                        correspondent advises all farmers who find themselves so situated, to place
                        parts of their farm upon the market. It will thus enable them to cultivate
                        the rest, "to employ abundance of labor, while every blow struck into the
                        earth around his reserved lands will increase the latter in value, for the
                        people who will have bought of him will be Northern husbandmen who mean
                             work, or they would not come." In
                        conclusion, he says that "a large infusion of white northern laborers would
                        doubtless do much good; but I am quite sure, from present indications, that
                        the South could get along admirably with her old laborers, under their new
                        condition, if philanthropic marplots would only let them alone."</p>

<b>Mr. Seward on Reconstruction</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that Secretary of State Seward replied to a disgruntled
                    Pennsylvania radical Republican that the administration's policy was that which
                    "Mr. Lincoln had adopted, and was carrying it out when he died, and that Mr.
                    Johnson was merely continuing it; that the people of all parties would sustain
                    it, and there was not a Rebel to-day in the whole country, and he should not use
                    that word." The paper asserts that "Mr. Seward is in favor of the admission of
                    the entire body of Southern members, just as they are, and the repeal of the
