<b>"The Situation."</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial discusses the political "situation" facing the South. The
                    article argues that the Radical Republicans are determined to "cheat the South
                    out of what little she has left." The South ended the war with the understanding
                    that all their rights would be restored, save slavery, and they cannot now
                    accept disfranchisement or black suffrage. Only the policies of Andrew Johnson
                    hold out hope that the country can reunite. In the meantime, the South must
                    concentrate on rebuilding its material resources, since it has no political
                    voice.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are frequently asked about the interesting condition of affairs expressed
                        in the above heading, as if mortal man could tell what it was. "The
                        situation" is decidedly mixed at present, and the men in Congress who have
                        mixed it, cant tell you what it is. The recent appearance of the Tax
                        collector, convinces us that the 'd--l is to pay, and he won't take
                        Confederate money,' as Bill Arp truly says. All will admit that there is no
                        difficulty in making up an opinion on the "situation" as far as that
                        interesting gentleman is concerned, but there are other things connected
                        with the "situation" that we find it hard to comprehend.</p>
                    <p>Now there is the United States Congress, under the lead of Thadeus Stevens,
                        Sumner &amp; Co., hammering away at Constitutional Amendments,
                        ingeniously fixed up to cheat the South out of what little she has left,
                        and, with the impudence of the devil, they expect us to vote for them. The
                        Radicals seem to look upon us as a parcel of cowards and fools, and seem to
                        imagine that we will vote for amendments to the Constitution, that will
                        disfranchise two-thirds of our white population and enfranchise the negroes.
                        In their eagerness to retain their power, they seem to have forgotten that
                        the Southern people fought four years to keep them out of the Union, and
                        that when they surrendered and agreed to admit the facts of the present, it
                        was with the distinct understanding that we came back with all our rights
                        unimpaired, under the Constitution as it was; we giving up slavery,
                        &amp;c. That they are bent on our further humiliation, and are afraid to
                        admit the talent and statesmanship of the South into Congress, no one can
                        doubt, and it only remains for us to prove we are not the cowards and fools
                        they take us to be, for "time at length brings all things even."</p>
                    <p>At the close of the war the Southern people, deluded by false promises, and
                        anxious for rest, made great efforts to be represented in Congress. A
                        feeling of gratitude to Andrew Johnson caused many to desire our
                        representation in Congress, but now all that is changed. A perfect feeling
                        of indifference, as regards federal politics, has come over our people. The
                        same spite, the same vilification, the same lying statements are expected,
                        as a matter of course, in each day's proceeding of Congress; and, after all,
                        it has had a good effect. It has turned our thoughts into the proper
                        channel, and the disgust everything emanating from Congress produces in the
                        minds of all honest men, has made us cease to look to Washington for relief,
                        and turn our thoughts seriously to the great work of developing our material
                        resources; the only true road to political strength.</p>
                    <p>Calmly surveying the whole field, we must say "the situation" does not look
                        cheering to the view of a Southern man. The Northern masses seem to be
                        entirely under the control of the Radicals and as for the Union ever being
                        restored, there seems no hope, except in the unflinching firmness and
                        resolution of Andrew Johnson. The impending war in Europe may change the
                        aspect of affairs, but at present we have only one thing to do and that is
                        to devote our minds, hearts and souls to building up our desolated country,
                        and, if we can, to sustain the President in his efforts to make the peace
                        permanent. As for the Radical party, North and South, there can never be any
                        friendship between our people and them. They have scorned all our efforts at
                        reconciliation; they have taken up the sword after brave men laid it down;
                        they would make us the most abject and degraded people on the earth, and
                        rejoice to see us exterminated. With them we shake no hand of fellowship and
                        bidding them to do their worst, we can preserve our manhood by not endorsing
                        it as law.</p>
                    <p>And if the situation is gloomy, what of it? It is no time to cry over spilt
                        milk. A people that went through four years of such a war as we did, have
                        little to fear in this world. There is much to look forward hopefully to;
                        the same just God that watched over us in our hours of trial, rules supreme,
                        and in His own good time will lead us out of all our troubles. The spirit
                        now shown by the Southern people can never be kept down; it points to a
                        glorious future. Let us be hopeful; let us do our duty, and, as far as the
                        Radicals are concerned, always remember the Proverb that says: "Make no
                        friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go; lest
                        thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul."</p>

<b>The Work Last Saturday--"A Labor of Love."</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that over one hundred graves were dug and leveled off in
                    the Soldiers' Cemetery on Saturday. Veterans, farmers, and various Staunton
                    clubs helped the Ladies' Cemetery Committee in the work. Notable also was the
                    presence of the African American Rev. Mr. Lawson and some of his congregation.
                    "Such conduct on the part of the colored people does more to bring everything
                    right, than all that has been done in Washington in the last six months."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>According to a previous notice a number of our citizens, principally
                        soldiers, repaired to the Soldiers' Cemetery last Saturday, with pick and
                        shovel, to assist the Ladies' Cemetery Committee in their noble work of
                        re-interring our dead. Though the day was very warm, all present went to
                        work with a will, and by night 47 graves had been raised up and leveled off,
                        and 127 new graves dug to receive the remains of those now buried in
                        Thornrose Cemetery. Owing to the shortness of the notice there was not a
                        general turn out of the people--but the day's work was no failure.</p>
                    <p>The Ladies' Cemetery Committee desire us to return their thanks to all who
                        were present; to the "Excelsior Club," which was out in a body; to the
                        Proprietors of the American and Virginia Hotels for their liberality in
                        sending teams and provisions, and to the farmers who contributed. A most
                        gratifying incident in the day's labor, was the appearance of Rev. Mr.
                        Lawson, the colored preacher, and several of his congregation, and right
                        well did they do their work. Such conduct on the part of the colored people
                        does more to bring everything right, than all that has been done in
                        Washington in the last six months. To those who sent "substitutes" the
                        ladies also return their thanks.</p>
                    <p>The work done on Saturday only shows what can be done by concert of action,
                        and a general turn out of the people of the County. Much yet remains to be
                        done and the ladies propose to devote Thursday week to this holy work. Some
                        300 graves are to be dug, and it is hoped all who loved those, who died for
                        us, will respond to this call. Farmers who can't come are requested to send
                        a hand or a wagon and team. Rich earth is needed also. Provisions should be
                        brought in on Thursday week, and the ladies, from all parts of the County,
                        are requested to come with flowers.</p>

                        For the Valley Virginian
                    </p>
                    <p>Woodstock, VA.,<br> June 9, 1866</p>
                    <p>On the 6th inst., as was previously announced, the ladies and citizens of
                        this place, celebrated the anniversary of the death of General Turner Ashby,
                        by a grand Floral Procession. The ceremonies were conducted by Lieut. J. H.
                        Williams, Marshall; assisted by Moses Walton, Mark Bird, Dr. G. W. Magruder,
                        P. H. Fravel, J. C. McKay and Capt. J. H. Grabill.</p>
                    <p>At 2 o'clock, P. M., the ladies and citizens assembled at the M. E. Church,
                        when Lieut. James H. Williams stated that the ceremonies would be opened by
                        prayer by the Rev. J. P. Hyde, of the M. E. Church, South, after which he
                        made a few very appropriate remarks in regard to the object for which they
                        met, and then introduced Capt. H. C. Allen, who entertained them with a
                        short speech, paying a high compliment to the ladies of the South, saying if
                        the soldiers had performed their duty as nobly as they did, that instead of
                        decorating their graves with flowers, to-day, we would now enjoy our
                        Independence, and a monument would be erected in honor of our martyred dead,
                        and Richmond would now be the capitol of a nation. At the conclusion of the
                        address the procession was formed in the following order:</p>
                    <p>1st, Ladies with wreaths and flowers for the Methodist grave yard.</p>
                    <p>2nd, Ladies with wreaths and flowers for the Episcopal grave yard.</p>
                    <p>3rd, Same for the German Reform grave yard.</p>
                    <p>4th, Same for the Lutheran grave yard, and the decorating of the Cenotaph in
                        honor of General Ashby.</p>
                    <p>5th, Clergy and Orators.</p>
                    <p>6th, Muhlenburg Riflemen, under command of Capt. N. Fountain.</p>
                    <p>7th Ladies and citizens generally.</p>
                    <p>After the graves had been strewn with beautiful flowers, culled by the fair
                        ladies of the town and county, as many as could gain an entrance repaired to
                        the Lutheran Church, where the ceremonies were concluded by an address from
                        Captain A. P. Piper, who, after paying a high tribute to the memory of him
                        whose death they were then commemorating, referred to some of the noble
                        soldiers of this place, who sacrificed their lives upon the altar of
                        Freedom, and whose mortal remains lie entombed in this sacred ground. So
                        touchingly tender were his remarks in regard to the Welsh's, Bushong's,
                        Dinges' and others, that each heart was thrilled with emotion, and the
                        unbidden tear was seen to start and moisten every eye.</p>
                    <p>The ceremonies of the day were then concluded by the Rev. H. Wetzel.</p>
                    <p>Every one seemed to be impressed with due solemnity of the occasion, and the
                        most perfect order and harmony prevailed. After all the duties had been
                        performed and the people were about to disperse to their homes, a gentle and
                        copious shower fell which enlivened and refreshed the flowers that were
                        strewn upon the graves. Long will this day be remembered in Woodstock, and
                        as time rolls on, and the 6th of June comes round, fresh flowers will bedeck
                        the graves of our noble and lamented dead.</p>
                    <p>The recent refreshing rains have greatly improved the wheat and oat crop.
                        Although there will not be a large yield of wheat, much more will be raised
                        than was anticipated. If the season continues favorable there will be a
                        larger yield of corn and oats than there has been for many years.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c.<br> M. D. S.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Died in Staunton Va., on May the 31st, Mrs. Sallie Tobbs Garber, consort of
                        William H. Garber, of this place.</p>
                    <p>In the death of Mrs. Garber society and the Episcopal Church, of which she
                        was a most consistent and devoted member, have sustained a very severe loss.
                        She possessed a fine mind and was an accomplished scholar--having graduated
                        at the Virginia Female Institute with honors and afterwards occupied in that
                        Institution the position of Instructress, with great success.</p>
                    <p>She possessed rare qualities for the exercise of influence in the gentlest
                        and most unobtrusive manner, yet with almost irresistible effect, and no
                        youthful mind could long resist the force of her consistent and cheerful
                        piety, convincing by the logic of example that Religion's "ways are ways of
                        pleasantness and all her paths are peace." With her Religion was a
                        principle, deeply seated in her heart, controlling and regulating her life.
                        She loved the "sweet communion and heavenly ways" of the Church and tho' for
                        a long time in feeble health she was rarely absent from the services of the
                        Sanctuary. Her attachments were strong, and the position she occupied in her
                        family show how well she had established herself in the hearts of her
                        adopted children, who loved and mourned for her as a mother indeed. Her loss
                        to them and to her disconsolate husband is irreparable and is keenly felt by
                        the circle of devoted friends who appreciated her noble qualities as an
                        earnest, candid Christian friend, always gentle and always faithful and
                        true. She has gone to the abode of happy Spirits and after the sufferings of
                        a feeble constitution it is sweet to think of her enjoying in her celestial
                        home "the rest that remains for the people of God."</p>
