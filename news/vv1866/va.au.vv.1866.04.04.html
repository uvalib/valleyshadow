                    "faithfully performed" all "obligations," they can only "stand idly by" while
                    "cherished rights" are threatened. In the meantime all should help speed the

                        has been so sadly felt. The resolutions and speeches in the Grand Lodge
                        fully express the sentiments of admiration and affection felt for Wm. H.
                        Harman, by all who knew him. A martyr in a noble cause, his memory will be

                    <p>The Special Committee [section unclear]</p>
                    <p>We are called upon to mourn the death of a beloved Brother. A bright luminary
                        of our Mystic Temple has been extinguished; another link of the chain that
                        binds us, man to man, has been broken.</p>
                    <p>For the second time in the history of the Grand Lodge of Virginia death has
                        removed its head. Wm. H. Harman, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of
                        Virginia, is no more. He fell in battle, at Waynesboro, on the 2nd of March,
                        1865. With him we were wont to meet in this Hall, and take sweet counsel
                        together. But he is gone; his voice is hushed in death.</p>
                    <p>During his Masonic life, he was personally identified with every thing which
                        concerned the prosperity of Masonry in general; sparing neither time, labor
                        nor expense, in extending its influence and usefulness.</p>
                    <p>In varied walks of life, few men at his age were identified with so much that
                        calls forth the action of a warm and generous heart. In him all classes of
                        society--but more especially the poor--found a true and trusty friend. And
                        who is he among us that, by his death, has not lost a brother and a friend?</p>
                    <p>As a man, he was highly esteemed by all who knew him; popular as a citizen; a
                        genial and warm-hearted companion; he enjoyed, in an eminent degree, the
                        confidence of the community in which he was born and reared.</p>
                    <p>In his domestic relations, he was an affectionate husband, an indulgent
                        father, and a kind master; and we fondly hoped that in his character of
                        Mason, we would have long enjoyed his counsel; that he would glide gently
                        down the declivity of life, majestic as some mighty river, and [would?] very
                        late, at a good old age, sink into the [unclear] of Eternity! But alas! our
                        hopes are disappointed; he was stricken down at a time which we regarded as
                        the [unclear] of his [unclear], and the height of his [unclear].</p>
                    <p>Thus has [unclear] Staunton Lodge, No. 13, the lodge of his affection, and
                        his lodge of affiliation. Thus speak the [unclear] friends and neighbors of
                        our illustrious brother, and [unclear] Grand Master. [section

                        conversation between Charles H. Lewis and a respectable colored Barber of
                        Richmond. It says:</p>
                    <p>Thursday afternoon last, at about the hour of 5, there occurred, in presence
                        of a most respectable gentleman of this city, the following conversation
                        between a dirty white man named Charles H. Lewis, ex-Secretary of the
                        Commonwealth of Virginia, and a decent colored barber in the "Shaving

                    <p>Respectable Negro-- "I've nothing to do with it, sir; but I believe the
                        colored folks think of something of the sort. I see no use in it; it can't
                        do any good."</p>
                    <p>Despicable White-- "No use! It will show these infernal rebels that they are
                        down, and that you know it, and that you intend to keep them down. Gen.
                        Grant has rejoiced over them--why shouldn't you?"</p>
                    <p>Respectable Negro-- "I wish to do nothing of the kind. I have no such
                        feelings."</p>
                    <p>Despicable White-- "Ah, but you should have. You and every other colored
                        person in the city should join in the proceedings, and use every effort to
                        make them as humiliating as possible to these insolent traitors."</p>
                    <p>Respectable Negro-- "I don't think so, sir, and I mean to keep away."</p>
                    <p>Despicable White-- "That is cowardly. These damn secessionists have been
                        whipped, but not half enough. By--, half of them need to have their cursed
                        necks broken. I want to see them crushed into the dust and the negroes
                        triumphing over them. You have got them now where you can manage them if you
                        choose, and I want to see you do it.</p>
                    <p>Thus spoke, substantially, that miserable scoundrel, Charles H. Lewis,
                        ex-Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, as we are prepared to prove by

                        When the negroes are thinking only of attending to their daily business in

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Sunday morning our citizens were shocked and disgusted by an exhibition one
                        John Scott, from Waterbury, Conn., a teacher in the Freedmen's School, made
                        of himself, by escorting a negro girl down New Street. On coming down the
                        street white persons "hissed" this creature, Scott; soon afterwards, the
                        girl came back by herself, and the coloured people, collected on Crawford's
                        corner, "hissed" her. She had evidently disgraced herself in their eyes, by
                        associating with this fellow, and we agree with them. We saw a notice, the
                        other day, of the arrest of an officer for the same offence, in Petersburg,
                        and we call the attention of those in authority to the disgraceful conduct
                        of this man Scott. The Superintendent of the Freedman's Bureau owes it to
                        himself; to the ladies who teach in the School, as well as to this
                        community, to discharge this disciple of Miscegenation at once. If he wants
                        to marry the negro, let him do so, if he is willing; and speedily emigrate
                        to Liberia or some congenial clime, where, to his heart's content, he can
                        dwell in the sweet embrace of the "negro de l'
                        Afrique." He don't suit this country.</p>

<b>Asylum For the Deaf, Dumb and Blind, At Staunton</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
