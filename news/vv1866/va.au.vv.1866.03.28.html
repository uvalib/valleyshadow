<b>The Difference</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an article presenting a fictional conversation between two
                    Freedmen. One expresses a preference for southern whites, since northerners

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an editorial discussing fiscal policy, especially in
                    regards to greenbacks vs gold currency. "Let it be distinctly understood that
                    the source of our continuing woes is our false measure of value; there is no
                    cure for it but a specie currency, and the only way to get that is an immediate

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some time ago we alluded to a model in plaster of a bust of Stonewall Jackson
                        by our young friend, William Donovan, a private in the celebrated Staunton
                        Artillery and a worthy member of that company. He has finished the model and
                        it is pronounced a good likeness of General Jackson by members of his staff.
                        It is the intention of Mr. Donovan to carve it in the finest marble and
                        place it on exhibition in Baltimore. Taking into consideration the fact that
                        Mr. Donovan has had no opportunity to improve himself for the last five
                        years, this great work shows remarkable genius, and it should be cultivated.
                        Soldiers who served under Jackson are invited to call at Marquis and
                        Kelley's and see the likeness of their beloved leader.</p>

<b>"Universle Amnesty"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints the Charlottesville Chronicle's objections to a
                    Congressional compromise proposal granting universal amnesty for Confederates in
                    exchange for suffrage for African Americans.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Charlottesville Chronicle says: "The most impertinent thing of the
                        session is the late resolution of the Conservative Senator Stewart, of
                        Nevada, for universal suffrage and universal amnesty as a compromise. We may
                        save our necks and get into Congress by universal negro suffrage; this from
                        a Conservative Republican. We suppose the Radical ground is, suffrage to the
                        negroes in the South, and to nobody else. Senator Stewart offers this as an
                        olive-branch to the South, for the consideration of each State.</p>
                    <p>This reminds us of two negroes who got into a fight, and the big one beat the
                        little one almost to death, who hallooed "nuff." They got upon their feet,
                        when Caesar seized Pompey (the little nigger) firmly by the collar, and
                        addressed him thus: "Now, Pomp, I don't want any bad feelings atwixt us, and
                        I pose to comp'mise--just take off you shirt, old fellar, and I'll hit you.
                        Pomp. 150 lashes--and then you can put on your shirt again and go about your
                        business--and no questions axed--I offer you, Pomp, a
                            universle amnesty.</p>

<b>The Virginia Insurance Company</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

                    for money now offered, and the ample capital upon which its business is based,
                    and the known character of its officers and managers for business capacity and
