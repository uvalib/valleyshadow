<b>"What's the Times?"</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial denounces Congress's decision to prevent the seating of
                    Southern representatives. The radicals, the article asserts, are intent on
                    starting a race war. The South, the editors argue, have kept their half of the
                    bargain by accepting the results of the war, including the end of slavery, but
                    now the North is going back on its promises of speedy reunion. If only Johnson's
                    policy had been adhered to, the South would have been able to quickly regain
                    peace and prosperity. Proud Confederate veterans, the paper asserts, have a duty
                    to resist radical policy.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This question is often asked now by our people and it is a serious one, so
                        serious to us that it is painful to attempt an answer to it. If President
                        Johnson's policy had been carried out by Congress, our Country, the South,
                        would have now been on the high road to prosperity and some hope of
                        repairing the devastation of war could be entertained. It has not been
                        carried out, but, has been opposed by the Radicals with consummate ability
                        and spite. When the armies of the Confederacy surrendered and our people
                        accepted the pledges of Andrew Johnson and Gen. Grant, they expected to be
                        restored to all rights and privileges of citizens of the United States, to
                        which they renewed their allegiance. They accepted, in good faith, the
                        results of the war; gave up slavery and were prepared to work out the
                        problem of free negro labor, as best they could.</p>
                    <p>And now after doing all that was asked of us by the President of the United
                        States and Gen. Grant, and more than was ever claimed by the "so-called"
                        Union party North, "what's the times?" We elect representatives to the
                        Congress of the U. S. and they are refused admittance, and we are told that
                        our oaths to support the Constitution are false and we are not to be
                        trusted. A new interpretation of the Constitution, for them, is given by the
                        Radicals in Congress, and they practically assume the position held by the
                        States rights men during the war, i. e. that we
                        had a right to secede. They declare us out of the United States and demand
                        new guarantees before the "Territories of the South" can be admitted to full
                        representation, as States of the United States. At first we hoped that the
                        Conservative element in the North was strong enough to check the Radicals in
                        Congress in their mad career, but since they have been home and come back to
                        Washington, more bitter than ever we can see no hope for the South, except
                        in the nerve and firmly expressed purpose of Andrew Johnson to oppose their
                        ruinous measures.</p>
                    <p>It is a very simple question with our people. They were promised certain
                        things, by the only power of the U. S. Government authorized to grant them.
                        The Congress of the U. S. refuse to approve the contract and, in fact,
                        repudiate it. We have honestly done our part, and it remains for the people
                            in the United States to force their
                        representatives to aid Andrew Johnson in doing theirs. If they do not we can
                        see very little in the future of this continent to look forward to
                        hopefully--but a people who have gone through four years of such a war as
                        ours can certainly look the future bravely in the face.</p>
                    <p>The Jacobin Radicals, in Congress, are doing their utmost to make a war of
                        races; their speeches and their votes show it. Negro suffrage is to be
                        enforced and the negro placed not only on an equality, but made superior to
                        the white man. When the contest opens, as we hope it never may, the "times"
                        in the South will indicate the extermination of the negro race. All this and
                        the confiscation laws make the times look very black, and we can see but one
                        hopeful sign that is in the old saying, that "the man who killed a dog for
                        spite never saw him buried."</p>
                    <p>But still there is something to live for in this desolated land of ours. It
                        is something to feel that you did your duty in the past four years; that
                        your people made a name that can never perish; that the glory and the heroes
                        of war are acknowledged to be yours by the world. It is something to feel
                        proud of, when you can say you were with Stonewall Jackson at Kernstown and
                        Lee at Appomattox. Hecatombs of martyred dead tell you you did no wrong, and
                        a world forever applauds your glorious deeds. The wives, the mothers and the
                        orphans of our dead, demand of us that we make a brave effort to secure
                        "better times," such an effort as they made on the battle field to secure
                        independence. They lost all. We still have life and a duty to perform to
                        those they left a "sacred heritage" to us. So let the Radicals in Congress
                        do their worst, if we but do our duty, no more harm can come to us than has
                        already. To develope our resources; to raise this country from poverty and
                        weakness to wealth and strength; to feed the widows and the orphans of our
                        dead is the only duty, of "the times," for us to attend to. And if President
                        Johnson's nerve, and his kindness to the people of the South, and General
                        Grant's pledges avail us nothing, then, we can say we have done our duty, in
                        war and peace, and looking the world honestly in the face be prepared for
                        all that comes.</p>

                    <p>The President on the 28th stated to a distinguished Senator that the
                        agitation of the negro franchise question in the District of Columbia at
                        this time, was a mere entering wedge to the agitation of the question
                        throughout the States; that it was ill-timed, uncalled for and calculated to
                        do great harm. He believed it would engender enmity and strife between the
                        two races which would result in great injury to both, and the certain
                        extermination of the negro population. Precedence, he thought, should be
                        given to more important and urgent matters of legislation, which were
                        essential for the restoration of the Union, the peace of the country and the

                        dream,<br> Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.</p>
                    <p>Too poor to possess the precious ore,<br> And too much a stranger to
                        borrow,<br> We issue to-day, our "Promise to Pay,<br> And hope to redeem
                        on the morrow."<br> Days rolled by, and weeks became years,<br> But our
                        coffers were empty still;<br> Coin was so rare that the Treasury'd
                        quake<br> If a dollar should drop in the till.</p>
                    <p>But the faith that was in us was strong indeed,<br> And our poverty well
                        discerned,<br> And these little checks represented the pay<br> That our
                        suffering veterans earned.<br> We know it had hardly a value in gold;<br>
                        Yet as gold the soldiers received it;<br> It gazed in our eyes with a
                        promise to Pay,<br> And each patriot soldier believed it.</p>
                    <p>But our boys thought little of price or pay,<br> Or of bills that were over
                        due;<br> We knew if it bought our bread today,<br> 'Twas the best our poor
                        country could do.<br> Keep it! it tolls all our history over,<br> From the
                        birth of the dream to its last;<br> Modest, and born of Angel, Hope,<br>
                        Like our hope of success it passed.</p>
