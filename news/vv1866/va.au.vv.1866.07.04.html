<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The determination of the present Radical Congress of the United States, to
                        exclude the Southern States from representation; while the people of these
                        States are oppressed and burdened with Federal taxation, has given rise to
                        just and universal complaint upon the part of the people thus outraged--and
                        we trust has aroused the indignation of all good men living North.</p>
                    <p>Our complaints are reasonable and must be so regarded by all men who respect
                        the history of American independence, and reverence the sanctity of the
                        Constitution, for the supposed preservation of which the United States
                        Covenant has just emerged from four years of bloody war. Now that the
                        Constitution and laws are said to have been fully violated when the
                        government, if left alone, would be more firmly established than ever
                        before, we find its rulers, and pretended friends, deliberately setting
                        themselves to work, to undermine and destroy it. The enemies whom the
                        government has just [unclear]; who declared themselves as grieved, and
                        defied her in the field. Now [section unclear]. [Unclear] the legislative
                        branch of the government has been for the time entrusted, have defiantly,
                        and treasonably, combined themselves together, to subject the liberties of
                        the people and do treat that Constitution which each of them has solemnly
                        sworn to uphold and defend. If the grievances of the South were imaginary
                        [section unclear], there can be no question that they are real now, and no
                        government conducted upon the principles proposed by these bad men can long
                        succeed or sustain itself. Look to the Declaration of Independence, the
                        grievances there enumerated, are then literally a catalogue of our wrongs;
                        except the forms are infinitely greater in degree. Let us refer to a few of
                        the principal charges against that [unclear] King George III.</p>
                    <p>[section unclear]. "He has suffered to render the military independent of,
                        and superior to civil power."</p>
                    <p>"For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us."</p>
                    <p>"For imposing taxes on us without our consent."</p>
                    <p>How true a picture this presents of the wrongs of the Southern people; and
                        yet who can fail to recognize in them ample justification for the course
                        taken by our forefathers--who declared at the same time that among the
                        unalienable rights of men, "are life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness;
                        that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving
                        their just power from the consent of the governed." These same revolutionary
                        fathers, as soon as the present government was established, engrafted into
                        the Constitution as one of the cardinal features of that instrument, that
                        representation and taxation should go hand in hand together, according to
                        population. And yet in spite of all these plain facts, this Radical Congress
                        are deliberately at work to remodel the government upon principles which
                        were exploded a century ago; and which are opposed to the fundamental idea
                        upon which this government was originally constructed.</p>
                    <p>They may succeed by these desperate means, in retaining for a time power in
                        their own hands; which is doubtless all they look to, and care for; but can
                        anything but evil come from this infamous work? These are not new
                        questions--tyrants and bad men have attempted the same schemes frequently
                        before. In this Country and England however, these are ideas which have been
                        so fully ventilated, and rendered so odious, that for nearly a century no
                        man had been found so wicked and reckless as to avow them, until the meeting
                        of the present Congress. But we will conclude by giving a few sentences from
                        a speech made 100 years ago, by the celebrated Lord Camden, one of England's
                        profoundest jurists and ablest statesmen, delivered in the House of Lords,
                        upon the bill to tax America.</p>
                    <p>"Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new; it is as old as the constitution; it
                        grew up with it; indeed, it is its support; taxation and representation are
                        inseparably united. God hath joined them, no British Parliament can put them
                        asunder; to endeavor to do so, is to stab our very vitals. My position is
                        this--I repeat it--I will maintain it to my last hour--taxation and
                        representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of
                        nature; it is itself a law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is
                        absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his
                        consent, either expressed by himself, or representative; whosoever attempts
                        to do it attempts an injury; whosoever does it commits a robbery; he throws
                        down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and
                        representation are coeval with, and essential to, the constitution. I wish
                        the maxim of Machiavel were followed--that of examining a constitution, at
                        certain periods, according to its first principles; this would correct
                        abuses and supply defects. * * * There is not a blade of grass growing in
                        the most obscure corner of this kingdom which is not--which was not
                        ever--represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of
                        grass which, when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the
                    proprietors."</p>

                    <p>Furl it, for the hands that grasped it.<br> And the hearts that fondly
                        clasped it,<br> Cold and dead, are lying low;<br> And that banner, it is
                        trailing,<br> While around it sounds the wailing<br> Of its people in
                        their woe.<br> For though conquered, they adore it--<br> Love the cold
                        dead hands that bore it;<br> Weep for those who fell before it,<br> Pardon
                        those who trailed and tore it;<br> Oh, how wildly they deplore it,<br> Now
                        to furl and fold it so.</p>
                    <p>Furl that banner, true, 'tis gory,<br> But 'tis wreathed around with
                        glory,<br> And 'twill live in song and story,<br> Though its folds are in
                        the dust;<br> For its fame on bright pages,<br> Sang by poets, penned by
                        sages,<br> Shall go sounding down the ages--<br> Furl its folds, though
                        now we must.</p>
                    <p>Furl that banner, softly, slowly--<br> Furl it gently, it is holy,<br> For
                        it droops above the dead;<br> Touch it not, unfurl it never,<br> Let it
                        droop there, furled forever,<br> For its people's hopes are fled.</p>

                        Keep that glorious flag that slumbers,<br> One day to avenge your
                        dead.<br> Keep it, widowed, sonless mothers,<br> Keep it, sisters,
                        mourning brothers;<br> Furl it with an iron will,<br> Furl it now, but
                        keep it still.<br> Think not that its work is done.<br> Keep it till your
                        children take it,<br> Once again to hail and make it<br> All your sons
                        have bled and fought for<br> All their noble hearts have sought for,<br>
                        Bled and fought for all alone.<br> All alone! aye, shame the story,<br>
                        Millions here deplore the stain,<br> Shame alas! for England's glory<br>
                        Freedom called and called in vain.<br> Furl that banner sadly, slowly,<br>
                        Furl it gently for 'tis holy,<br> Till that day, yes, furl it sadly,<br>
                        Then once more unfold it gladly--<br> Conquered Banner! keep it still.</p>
