<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We make the following extracts from the address of Gen. Wise, delivered on
                        the 25th of October:</p>
                    <p>Fellow-Citizens:</p>
                    <p>I meet a mourning people on the holy ground of graves, the dust of which is
                        more sacred than that of kindred. You come to do homage to the virtues and
                        commemorate the glorious deeds of heroes who died defending the stricken
                        land they lived in and they loved; and I come to condole with and comfort
                        the living by invoking the spirits of the mighty Confederate dead! I come to
                        search among their ashes for the examples and lessons to teach us how to survive their deaths; how to live after them;
                            how to nourish their seeds of indestructible truths resown in
                        this sacred soil, now already germinating again in these graves, and which
                        shall yet again overshadow and save the land these heroes died for, as sure
                        as that the moral power of the Universe will forever over come all evil and
                        malignant forces.</p>
                    <p>Alas! who are the dead? The buried? or rather the bruised and broken
                        survivors, who daily die living deaths amid the ruins and ashes of a wronged
                        and wrecked country, scathed by a wrathful war of conquest, ending in
                        disasters worse than death, in shackles, and in shame worse than
                        shackles!--Ah! the blessed buried<br> 'Are past the fear<br> Of future
                        tempests or a wreck on shore,<br> Those who [unclear] are still exposed to
                        [unclear]."</p>
                    <p>The buried have overcome death and are now immortal, whilst we survive to
                        suffer, and need the succor their lives and deaths can give, to those who
                        would not live in shame or die in vain. Their names and deeds need no
                        monuments or mausoleums of earth. Nor stone nor board may mark the clay
                        where they "sleep so well." Though "every turf beneath our feet be" their
                        sepulchers, and the dust of centuries may mingle man with man's remains in
                        undistinguishable comradeship; yet they are individually known at
                        headquarters above and their names are separately inscribed on the
                        everlasting rolls, and Heaven's adjutants will forever keep them in the book
                        of martyrdom! Martyrdom for imperishable principles of faith, of truth, of
                        honor, of religion, of law, of liberty, and of right! No hostile hand can
                        strike them now, and all the malignity of good men's enemies cannot alter or
                        pervert the facts or the moral forces of their past lives and present being.
                        Eternity has sealed their testimony to the truth and time's testimony will
                        not permit human history to be perjured for their shame. We need not fear
                        for them. With them all is well. They are now shielded by an impenetrable
                        buckler, the bosses of which is the integrity, as well as the courage, with
                        which they battled for their faith and fatherland. They now wear an armor
                        more than bullet-proof; and the missiles and messengers of death were there
                        better angels and proved that they were preferred of Heaven when they fell!
                        Ye mourning survivors I bring you the full assurance that the buried are
                            not dead! I have communed with them, and they
                        yet live, never to die! We, "the dead," come not to bury the dead--we have
                        but to touch their turfs--they have no tombs--and be ourselves "alive
                        again." We come not to raise a funeral pyre, but to be ourselves so
                        reanimated and reinvigorated by the living spirits of the departed Faithful
                        and True, as to be able to prove ourselves worthy of their sacrifice, made
                        for us, and of still asserting, if not maintaining, the Faith for which they
                        fought so good a fight, and which they consecrated by their precious
                        blood!--Aye; their foes shall build their shrines, their friends are too
                        despoiled to more than mark the place where they lie. All around them their
                        invaders are gathering the bleaching bones and ashes of those they repulsed
                        and slew, to raise mounds and monuments to deeds made memorable, and to
                        memories made worthy of mention by their heroism; and every stone they pile
                        on stone--the higher the more expressive--shall tell the story of the war to
                        every passerby, of the battles by whom lost and won and of who were the real
                        Heroes! This play of monuments is one in which Hamlets of Heroism cannot be
                        left out.</p>
                    <p>The General said that we need their example more now than ever. We needed
                        more than a Moses now to bear us up under defeat. There was more on trial
                        now than when we were in the camp and the trench. He continued:</p>
                    <p>I invoke the mighty Confederate Dead and lo! instantly the valiant clay of
                        the consecrated Valley of Virginia becomes instinct with motion in every
                        atom, and a grave in Lexington, trembling quickly, gives up a life breathing
                        spirit in a great example! It stands palpably before and above us, the moral
                        personation of the whole Confederate cause--the now Sanctified Stonewall
                        Jackson, a very Michael of Deliverance. The whole Host of Heroes,
                        disembodied, point to him; and awed, I reverently ask:--"What in this hour
                        would he have us do?" His example speaks to us!</p>
                    <p>I pronounce not his eulogy. His fame and deeds are above my praise. His
                        enemies praise him. His shade austerely reprehends all personal panegyric. I
                        speak not of the military chieftain, nor of his glorious battles or
                        victories. I speak not of the man, how trained, or what his traits; courtly
                        or curt, eccentric or like common men; awkward or graceful; genial, or
                        silent and serene; all his characteristics, whatever they were, are now
                        sacred. I speak not of his achievements, front, flank, or rear, however
                        lighted up in lustre; but I speak of the intrinsic, sterling stamina of his
                        moral greatness; of his Christian heroism. Thousands in the Confederate
                        armies were like him, "without fear and without reproach" but the eternal adamant of his character and nature which
                        won for him the Stonewall of his name, was his
                        Supreme Faith; Faith in God; Faith in immutable Moral Laws and Principles,
                        and in the right to prevail in the end against all opposing powers. His
                        faith knew of no expediency opposed to faith and
                        justice; of no Policy opposed to Truth and
                        Rights; of no Peace opposed to Honor. Governed by
                        an unwavering Christian sense of duty, he did his part according to the very
                        right and simplicity, without reserve, trusted in God so to shape
                        consequences as to make the very right prevail. He cared not, inquired not,
                        whether it would prevail, in his time, or for his personal advantage; but he
                        loved "Virtue for virtue's sake," and placed its power to prevail on the
                        Omnipotence and Omniscience of the Father and Finisher of his Faith! He knew
                        that the very test of the virtue of Faith is not only to be constant, firm
                        and abiding, when the enemies of moral law and right seem to have gained
                        their most decisive and crushing triumphs. He never mistook the benign will
                        of Divine Pity upon the mortal weakness of Denial when the master was
                        betrayed. He knew that then it was, when the Almighty Sufferer seemed to be
                            crushed and forsaken, that Faith was required to be most abiding. The Faith made
                        him what he was, instant and irresistible in action; direct and immovable in
                        purpose; with a moral instinct above intellect, above all dangers or
                        disaster, and death itself; unconquerable.</p>
                    <p>Communing all the time with the infinite source of Moral Law and Light, he
                        looked at the pith of Duty only as far as finite vision could see, and took
                        it at once, marching "double quick" directly, straight on, not daring to
                        question when or where to halt or turn aside, or what enemy or obstacle was
                        in the way, or what its force, or what would become of him--on he went under
                        orders he dared not disobey, only knowing that this was always the right,
                        however long or short, and that it was perfectly known to his Divine
                        Commander whose Omnipotence could make his final struggle sure of victory if
                        his Faith and Fortitude stood firm. This made him Stonewall firm, and this example rises up before us. With this
                        immortal Faith I reverently commune. I question it here amidst the
                        Confederate graves:</p>
                    <p>Can Faith be submitted or subjected to the "arbitrament" of Brute Force? Did Stonewall Jackson ever submit
                            his Faith to what is called by the Expediency and Policy of
                        these times, the arbitrament of arms?"</p>
                    <p>The stern, rebuking answer is, that he was no
                        Michiavel!--He oftimes in the field subjected his material and
                        physical forces to the shock of the "arbitrament of arms"! But his Faith, his moral trust and conviction he never submitted to any arbitrament but that of his conscience and his God!</p>
                    <p>The speaker continued to eulogize the character of Jackson in an eloquent
                        manner, and drew many illustrations of what we should do at present, from
                        Jackson's actions while living.</p>
                    <p>The Orator discouraged desertion of Virginia in this time of her great need,
                        and asked her youths whither would they wander? Where on earth could they
                        find a people so free? Without capital, and "a stranger in a strange land,"
                        their condition would be worse than at home.</p>
                    <p>We must renounce the luxurious idleness, and not be ashamed to work at home and among our friends. Stonewall Jackson
                        was not ashamed to work, and by the earnest labor of his own head and hands
                        earned immortality, and hallowed his native land with reflected glory. Out
                        of the asked nothing of poverty and nature's materials he wrought out by
                        patient toil, little by little, the levers of his life, and then Archimedes
                        like he founded them on a fulcrum which moved a world. His ambition vaulted
                        not; his genius had no vanity--his power was the moral power of a will and
                        purpose and looking onward and upward for God's guidance. He worked here in
                        Virginia and his work now speaks for her and to her, words more precious
                        than pearls. That is pay! That pays!</p>
                    <p>And oh! what land so lovely and beloved to work in, and for as this holy
                        mother of us all. I feel as fresh as ever, and would make you feel:</p>
                    <p>"With what delight we breathe our native air,<br> And tread the genial soil
                        that bore us first!<br> They said the world is every wise man's
                        country,<br> Yet after having received its various notions,<br> I am weak
                        enough still to prefer my own<br> To all I've seen beside."</p>
                    <p>I speak not of any mongrel Virginia--of no illegitimate offspring of
                        political rapine. I speak of that honored "Old Dominion" embracing full
                        64,000 square miles, from the Ocean to the Ohio--from the line of
                        Pennsylvania and Maryland to the lines of North Carolina and Tennessee! I
                        speak of the land which gave birth to the first of men, and gave to mankind
                        a race of heroes, and sages, orators and state men, scarcely less than the
                        first which formed the nation and gave its marked character and Constitution
                        and Laws, which led its armies and councils for three-fourths of a century,
                        which asserted its sovereign rights, and maintained the rights of all a
                        longer period of time; and which finally maintained its honor, if no more in
                        contending for the rights it had asserted and failed to establish after a
                        disastrous and glorious struggle! I speak of Virginia--Lowland, Piedmont,
                        Valley and Trans-Allegheny! I speak of Virginia entire as she was, and still
                        is, and will be, undivided and still unspent. True, her bosom has been torn,
                        and rent, and soiled, and stamped upon by the iron heel of the raiders and
                        invaders, but she is old Virginia still, sacred to Liberty, sacred to Laws,
                        full of life, and full of ground for hope, and the future grander than even
                        her glorious past. Her Chesapeake Bay is yet unquenched by the fires of war;
                        her cataracts still profoundly fall to move heaven and earth for her
                        resuscitation; her Piedmont plains are yet verdant with grasses for the
                        flocks and herds of a thousand hills; her Ridge is yet blue in Heaven's
                        azure to nurse a race of mountaineers indomitable and yet strong; her Valley
                        is yet the very marrow of her spinal column and the staff of her life; her
                        Alleghenies are yet backbones of strength; her Western hills are yet beef
                        stalls of fatness and plenty; her mighty rivers still roll on to the old
                        ocean, and to aqueducts no less than the mighty Mississippi; and the change
                        that has come over her is but the harbinger of the higher and holier hope of
                        Empire and Progress! Her mines are full of coal and iron, richer than gold
                        and diamonds. She is still Virginia, stripped, oppressed, overwhelmed,
                        overcome for a moment but unconquered and unconquerable. She is not without
                        means, resources and power, and her pride and pre-eminence over all States,
                        and States of States, shall keep her head higher, and finally far above her
                        invaders and enemies. God bless her!--God guard her!--God guide her! No land
                        upon earth opens such a field or industry, skill and enterprise, profit and
                        profusion, as she now spreads out with a wide welcome to the youth of master
                        minds like that of Stonewall Jackson. Her very poverty is now a capital for
                        noble sons to count upon for a wealth beyond the Baronies that once made
                        lords of her gentlemen. Her weaknesses are over and past; her development is
                        now just about to begin. Her woe is wooing her to her brightest days; her
                        privation is about to be her wealth, and Providence to guard and guide her
                        in a higher and holier destiny than that of the "Old Dominion." If her sons
                        will indeed serve her and save her, she shall be indeed all over one and
                        indivisible and new Virginia, greater, stronger, grander than ever was old
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the General referred to the foreign embassy of the
                        lamented Ballard Preston to the commercial men of France, and the letters of
                        credence which he as Governor gave him, in which he traced the causes which
                        made Virginia both unmanufacturing and uncommercial. Foreigners and
                        strangers could not understand the slow progress of Virginia in material
                        resources as compared with other States of less natural resources.</p>
                    <p>Virginia was not more populous, commercial, mining and manufacturing--her
                        public works lagged, and the mechanic arts were not encouraged--because her
                            first settlers were all planters, and the earliest interest of our people was a plantation interest as contradistinguished from a
                            farming interest proper.</p>
                    <p>The General then spoke at some length of the change in the labor system of
                        the State, and the new duties it imposes upon the people. He then addressed
                        the young men as follows:</p>
                    <p>You need not fear that there will be too many of you in the field. Mining,
                        Manufacturing, Commerce, Mechanic Arts, will now be open avenues for the
                        skill and enterprise, and improvements in all these will soon pay
                        professional avocations higher fees and wages than ever compensated them
                        before. Have your fathers thousands of acres of lands, which now yield no
                        income and cannot afford to pay labor for their cultivation? Lay off the
                        garden spots, compost your wasted manures for the little you can till, or
                        sell or rent out or let lie out every impoverished acre. Aye, do
                        better:--advertise to select immigrants that you will gladly give to them
                        one-half your superfluous lands and help them build and fence them, if they
                        will come and settle. Their settlement will make the other half far more
                        valuable than was or is the whole. They will give you neighborhood and life,
                        bring to you new lights, and be your source of most affective labor and
                        richest returns. Abandon "one ideas"--here it is
                        wheat, there it is tobacco yonder corn and potatoes--and somewhere else it
                        is Brandy and Goober Peas! Go to the fields and be taught by your own
                        experience, learn of other crops, and prepare your own fertilizers from the
                        forest leaves and pine logs and straw and cattle and pig-pens, don't stand
                        on the river's bank like the fool of Horace and wait for the waters to pass
                        by before you cross this Rubicon. Don't wait to manure until you can get
                        capital to buy guano! Borrow not at all, but work and you will soon have
                        wherewith to lend. The faith of Jackson saw this, that the war would put our
                        young men to work! No more fox-hounds! No more large morning horns! No more
                        cigars and juleps! No more cared parties and club-idleness! No more syren
                        retreats in summer and city hells in winter. The hard necessity which
                        presses down upon our people may change the character in some lamentable
                        respects, but it will also most happily strengthen us in other important
                        points. It will dispel some weaknesses which though grand and noble, impeded
                        the power and progress of the State. Of the old Virginian it may well be
                        said:</p>
                    <p>High-minded he was ever improvident,<br> "But pitiful and perverse to a
                        fault<br> Pleasure he would but honor was his idol."</p>
                    <p>To young Virginians I would say:--High-minded, pitiful and generous ever be
                        as were your fathers: honor must ever be your idol; but, be just before you are generous; and let a life of mere pleasure
                        and all improvidence now cease! Now it is to be a
                        life of work! work! work until you are weary, and still weary, and still
                        work on!--And, blessed be God, work on work ever until the waste places are
                        all repaired, until our honor is redeemed, until debts old and new are paid,
                        until the "old folks at home" shall sing all and happy again--until the
                        slogan of "old Virginia never tire" can be raised again with a shout that
                        the heavens shall hear and the Confederate saints above shall approve as
                        justifying the ways of Providence to us! If I comprehend aright and fully
                        the meaning of Paradise itself, and our first parents' expulsion, it is in
                        part to make us know that a pleasure ground of perfect innocence even was
                        not best for man. Disobedience was punished by
                        expulsion, but the punishment was so tempered by the Mercy not the curse that we should earn our daily bread
                        by the sweat of our brow. Blessed be God!--that our task, if well done, will
                        make us happier and happier the harder they are. Work, oh! young men, or you
                        are not men! You are not Stonewall men! You are not Virginians worthy of
                        these graves! Work or you can't be happy!</p>
                    <p>We catch the inspiration of this Faith, this Hope, this Life and Strength,
                        from the halo of these Heroes. The great good that they whose remains are
                        tenants of these graves did, lives after them--blessed be their sacred
                        memories! I would not call them, if I could, back to me, save in their
                        examples. I divine not why I, of any, were spared when they were taken, but
                        to bear testimony to their truth and Excellence, their innocence and
                        Invincibility, and to try to live worthy of their deaths, and be more ready
                        when the Creator calls to meet them in Heaven!</p>

<b>A few words about "the Situation."</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial discusses the late elections in the North which resulted in
                    Radical Republican triumph. The editors urge the South to oppose all Republican
                    initiatives while focusing on work at home.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The full reports, of the result of the late elections, given in our columns
                        to-day, will not astonish or frighten, the readers of the Valley Virginian.
                        To sum it up, in a few words, the radicals have carried every Northern and
                        Western State, but, in spite of all their rascality, they have lost Maryland
                        and Delaware. "Blood will tell!" These States elect Conservative white men to represent them; Massachusetts elects
                        negroes, Beast Butler and "Commissary Banks!" While we are sorry for the
                        respectable colored men who were elected to the Massachusetts Legislature,
                        and regret their getting into such bad company, we feel confident that they
                        will improve the manners and character of that body, and, if not
                        demoralized, be the means of elevating the tone of Massachusetts' society.</p>
                    <p>It is now certain the Radicals will have control of Congress, and that they
                        will exclude the South, from representation, is a fixed fact. But what of
                        that? It amounts to nothing, in the long run, and if we are only true to
                        ourselves, and work, we can soon have them
                        begging us to come in. This is no time for whining, or begging for favors.
                        We have performed our part of the contract, made at the surrender, but to
                        hold on to power the Radicals will grossly and shamefully repudiate the
                        sacred pledges of the United States Government. Overpowered, as we are;
                        robbed and stripped of everything,except honor,
                        we can not enforce compliance with true Constitutional principles; but we
                        can maintain our own honor and dignity, by refusing, utterly and forever, to
                        agree, in whole or in part, to any proposition they may make--call it
                        "Constitutional Amendment," or what you will. Our safety is in an emphatic
                            No to each and every proposition until we are
                        fully and fairly represented; not by sneaks and cowards, "test oath" men or
                        the vile crew of ragamuffins, called "Southern loyalists," but by the
                        honest, the brave, the true Southern men, who will represent us, in fact and
                        in truth.</p>
                    <p>This question of representation is only one of time--it is certain to come,
                        and come right, if we are only firm and
                        consistent. There has not been an act performed by the dominant party, or
                        any other party, North, since the surrender, that has not justified every
                        movement of the Southern States since 1861, and even the strongest Union men
                        among us now admit it. The brutal course of the radicals has made the South
                        a unit in the belief--that we were right, and
                        that is a great point gained. The foolish hopes of representation,
                        encouraged by the over sanguine, have faded away--and a united and
                        harmonious people have gone bravely to work, with
                        a settled determination to build up their shattered fortunes, and in spite
                        of everything, be the people a just God intended them to be. National
                        politics, especially the result of the late elections, do not agitate or
                        excite our people. Their daily necessities; the constant labor and thought
                        required to provide for them; the study about how to build the Valley
                        Railroad, and develope our material resources, occupy all their thoughts;
                        and, but for the natural curiosity, as to what the Radicals North are
                        doing--as to what new piece of devilment they are concocting--we would not
                        publish news from the North at all.</p>
                    <p>And the brave and true Conservatives North, who have made such a gallant and
                        glorious fight for the right, should not take this indifference on our part,
                        as an evidence of a want of interest in their struggle. It is only a settled
                        conviction, on the part of our people, that we can best aid them, in their
                        political struggle for Constitutional rights, by attending exclusively to
                        our material recuperation and advancement. We wish them "God speed," in
                        every blow they strike the "mob" that now rules the Country and, if
                        necessary, will prove our words by acts. But the sad, the inexorable present is upon us, with all its privations; with
                        all its holy duties to the living, and its sacred ones to the dead. Do your
                        duty for the rights of the States, under the Constitution, and remember, the
                        Southern people are doing, have, and will ever
                        do, theirs.</p>
                    <p>And we must congratulate our people on the dignified and manly manner, in
                        which they have conducted themselves under all their troubles, present and
                        prospective. The situation has been bad, and may be worse, but the same
                        courage; the same endurance; the same patience under affliction; and the
                        same devotion to justice; to truth; to honor and to right that carried us
                        through four years of relentless war, and two years of oppression, will, in
                        the end, bring us to a state of prosperity, of happiness and liberty, such as we never dreamed. In the words of
                        the Enquirer, eminently applicable to our case is the universal truth, "that
                        sufficient to the day as the evil thereof," as is also the maxim that "the
                        duty of life consists in doing the duty that lies next to us." We need not
                        now look beyond the present day and the present duty,--or as Stonewall
                        Jackson once told us, "Do your duty; God will attend to the rest."</p>

<b>The Elections</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial comments on the election results. The editors hope that the
                    few conservative triumphs will be enough to defeat the Radical platform, but
                    council quiet acceptance of the overall Republican victory.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The results of the elections held on the 6th instant, says the Richmond
                        Examiner, are beginning to pour in. In New York the opinion we expressed
                        some days ago, that the Radicals would triumph by a small majority, would
                        seem to approach very nearly the actual result. New York city and Brooklyn
                        have done nobly, but the ignorance, hatred and passion of the interior
                        districts have triumphed over the superior intelligence of the cities. We
                        must remember that at the North nearly all the people of wealth,
                        intelligence and liberality of view hasten to the cities, to escape the
                        dullness and bigotry of their country life. In those benighted regions the
                            Tribune is taken for gospel and BENJAMIN F.
                        BUTLER considered a statesman of pure and lofty virtues. It is in the
                        cities, therefore, that we look first for a Conservative reaction.</p>
                    <p>It must be noted, too, that where the vote of a State reaches, as in New
                        York, some 700,000, a majority of ten or twelve thousand is really very
                        small. This result is achieved solely by the alliance of the Times, Heraldand Evening
                        Post, and without their aid could not have been accomplished. Now
                        these papers will protest against the more ultra doctrines of the Radicals;
                        they have no real love for that faction, and at the first false step will
                        aid to hurl them from power.</p>
                    <p>In Missouri we fear the Radicals have, by excluding the great mass of the
                        voters, managed to retain their ill gotten power.</p>
                    <p>Maryland has been nobly and gloriously redeemed. Delaware gives an increased
                        Conservative majority. These two States may now be relied on to unite with
                        the eleven Southern States, and with Kentucky, in rejecting the
                        Constitutional Amendment. This makes fourteen States certain in the
                        negative. Ten are sufficient to defeat the proposition.</p>
                    <p>In the other Northern States the Radicals hold their own. We interpret this
                        as showing that a majority of the Northern people at this time are unwilling
                        that the Southern should participate in the Government, without consenting
                        to the most injurious and degrading terms. This fact has been for some time
                        perfectly well understood at the South. Its confirmation by these elections
                        will not produce a scintilla of excitement among our people. We have, in
                        many districts, sent to Washington individuals who could "take the oath," as
                        they said. The continued exclusion of these persons from their seats is not
                        a wrong that excites our special resentment. As to those who could not take
                        the oath, we consider them much better engaged at home in attending to their
                        business pursuits than in such a Congress as at the present or the future.
                        In a word, we bow to the results, and wish our Northern brethren much joy in
                        the sole and undisturbed possession of the Government, in managing which
                        they have shown so much wisdom, moderation and public virtue.</p>

                    <p>Victory, says the Richmond Times, frequently demoralizes almost as much as
                        defeat. Many a complete and overwhelming triumph was lost to the Confederate
                        arms during the war by the rich plunder of the Federal camps by the "ragged
                        and half-starved soldiers of the South," who thus neglected the opportunity
                        so make defeat an utter rout. If the Radicals shall be thus intoxicated by
                        their successes at the late election in the North; if between the plunder of
                        the Government and the appropriation of the offices, they shall weaken their
                        organization and divide their forces, then will
                        be the time for the Conservatives to prepare for that future blow which will
                        hurl the destructionists from power. If the Conservative will use their
                        defeat as the Federals did theirs at the first battle of Manassas; if they
                        will at once remove the causes of disaster, and begin now to lay the foundations for future victory in such a manner
                        as to make it sure, their present misfortunes will not prove irreparable. It
                        is too common with defeated parties to subside quietly after a defeat, and
                        to put forth no more efforts until the next political struggle excites them.
                        When the fight has commenced it is too late to take those precautions which
                        the Conservative should be making now. The race
                        between the friends and foes of the country is a long one and the party with
                        best bottom will ultimately come out ahead. Courage persistence and
                        indomitable pluck will prevail yet. Nil
                        disperandum.</p>

                    <p>
                        Editors Valley Virginian:
                    </p>
                    <p>I was concerned to notice, in your last paper, in your account of the
                        proceedings of our worthy Common Council, that an ordinance was passed,
                        forbidding any member of said Council from holding any office "to which pay
                        is attached." This in general would be a good law, and will bear comparison
                        with many of the excellent provisions of this wise, prudent and energetic
                        little legislature, but this law seems to me to be a censure upon our
                        indefatigable Street Commissioner--the De Wit Clinton of Staunton--who has
                        faithfully fussed about our Streets for so many years. Even this season he
                        has, with unsurpassed energy, removed all the pavements on our Main
                        Street--built a new fence in front of the Market-house, and has, with wise
                        providence, had all the old brick piled up on Augusta Street, in that part
                        of the town, known as "Gallow's town," ready to be laid so soon as the
                        Spring opens. I could mention many more improvements, of vital importance to
                        the town, which we have no doubt our great Commissioner, under the direction
                        of our wise Council, will have properly executed in the next ten years--and,
                        the town would suffer materially, if this late law should have the effect of
                        causing the present Commissioner, who is highly sensitive, to resign his
                        office.<br> Yours,<br> A CITIZEN.</p>
