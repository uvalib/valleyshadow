<b>In Memoriam! The Work Last Thursday! What Remains to be Done!</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports on last week's day of work in the Soldier's Cemetery.
                    Stores were closed and much of the town spent the day digging graves and making
                    improvements to the Cemetery. The paper cites cooperation between black and
                    white Staunton residents as proof that the Radicals are in error. The editors
                    also propose establishment of a fund raising organization to help continue the
                    work.<br>(Names in announcement:  Charles T. O'Ferrall)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last Thursday broke upon the citizens of Staunton and its visitors, like a
                        Sabbath morn; every store was closed and the great majority of the people
                        could be seen hurrying to the Soldiers' Cemetery, armed with picks and
                        shovels, to devote the day to the holy work of preparing graves for the
                        repose of those who are now scattered over the Country. Right all the work
                        was done, and night closed upon 174 graves dug; 294 places, 6 feet square,
                        for trees, and the large square (16x16 and three feet deep) in the center
                        for the "unknown dead," completed. Everyone worked with a will, and now the
                        rough work at the Cemetery is completed. All honor to those who
                        participated; if their bones ache, they have the satisfaction of knowing a
                        sacred duty has been nobly performed.</p>
                    <p>The ladies were out in numbers, and encouraged the working parties with
                        smiles of approval, and a generous contribution of provisions. The colored
                        people did their share and worked most faithfully. In the evening, after
                        having Ice Cream served to all present, by the ladies, Colonel Charles T.
                        O'Ferrall delivered a brief, but eloquent and appropriate speech, at the
                        conclusion of which he formed a procession, headed by the Stonewall Band and
                        marched through the principal streets of the town, and dismissed it at the
                        Court House. Prominent in the procession were the colored workmen, and if a
                        "radical" could have seen them, he would have changed his ideas about how
                        the people get along together here. Altogether the day passed off splendidly
                        and the best order prevailed. All seemed to appreciate the noble work they
                        were engaged in, and the Ladies' Cemetery Committee desire to return thanks
                        to all.</p>
                    <p>And now that the rough work is over, what remains to be done? Much, and it
                        behooves us to go about it in a manner that will ensure success. We suggest
                        that a "League of Honor" be formed; each member to pay ten cents a week, to
                        be appropriated specially to this glorious work. In Georgia, Alabama,
                        Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Missouri and
                        Maryland let similar Leagues be formed, and by this means, without
                        oppressing any one, the Soldiers' Cemetery, of Staunton, can be made all it
                        should be, in honor of the 'fallen brave.' We will develope this idea more
                        fully in our next issue, and in the mean time ask our Southern exchanges, to
                        call on the Governors of their States, to ask their people to aid us in this
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Ten cents a week! It is a small amount to look at but it will, if all that
                        are able contribute, enable the Ladies Soldiers' Cemetery Committee to
                        complete their noble work; and we feel confident it will be cordially
                        responded to. A good day's work has been done. Let us not "weary of well
                        doing," but with one heart and one mind continue the glorious work.</p>

<b>Public Meeting in Augusta. Important Resolutions.</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints the proceedings of a public meeting held to protest the
                    amendments proposed to the Constitution by Republicans in Congress. The citizens
                    of Staunton assert that Congress is currently an unconstitutional body, since
                    the southern states are barred from representation. The meeting also passed
                    resolutions of support for Andrew Johnson.<br>(Names in announcement:  J. Marshall McCue,  William Withrow,  A. H. H. Stuart,  John Merritt,  J. G. Fulton,  Thomas J. Michie,  William M. Tate)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting of the people of Augusta, held at the Court House of the County,
                        on June 26th (Court Day)--on motion of Hon. Alex H. H. Stuart, J. Marshall
                        McCue, Esq., was called to the Chair and Wm. Withrow, Jr., appointed
                        Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, in a speech of great ability, explained the object
                        of the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart moved the appointment of a Committee, and submitted some remarks
                        which were substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>It having been made known to the public, through official channels, that the
                        body of men now assembled in Washington, and which claims to be the Congress
                        of the United States, has adopted an article, proposing several important
                        amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which they have caused
                        to be communicated to the authorities of the several States, for
                        ratification and adoption, as a part of the organic law. The people of
                        Augusta county, Virginia, feel that it is alike our right and our duty, to
                        assemble, at out Court House, in public meeting, and express our earnest and
                        deliberate protest against this action of the so-called Congress.</p>
                    <p>We maintain that the body to which we refer is not organized in conformity to
                        the letter or spirit of the Constitution, but in derogation of both, and is,
                        in no just sense, a Congress of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1st, provides, that "All legislative powers
                        herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
                        shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."</p>
                    <p>The Constitution then prescribes the mode in which these two bodies shall be
                        organized.</p>
                    <p>"The House of Representatives, shall be composed of members chosen, every
                        second year, by the people of the several States"--Art. I, Sec. 2, Clause 1.</p>
                    <p>The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each
                        State, chosen by the Legislatures thereof--Art. I, Sec. 3, Clause 1.</p>
                    <p>The 5th article of the Constitution, which prescribes the mode of altering
                        and amending the Constitution, provides that it shall not be competent, even
                        by an amendment to the Constitution, to deprive a State of its equal
                        representation in the Senate. The clause is in these words, "no State,
                        without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."</p>
                    <p>In view of these plain requirements of the Constitution, we have no
                        hesitation in expressing our conviction that the body now assembled in
                        Washington, and from which the representatives of eleven States of the Union
                        are excluded, and by which those eleven States are deprived, not only of
                        equal, but of all suffrage in the Senate has no
                        just claim to be recognized as the Congress of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We maintain, further, that the unworthy device to which that body has
                        resorted, under the name of a "concurrent resolution" is a mere subterfuge,
                        to evade a plain provision of the Constitution which requires, (Art. I, Sec.
                        7, Clause 3,) that every order, resolution or vote, to which the concurrence
                        of the Senate and House of Representatives, may be necessary (except on a
                        question of adjournment,) shall be presented to the President of the United
                        States, and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or
                        being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and
                        House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed
                        in the case of a bill.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding this imperative mandate of the Constitution, the President in
                        his recent message, has informed the Country that the resolution of
                        Congress, above referred to, was not submitted to him for his approval.</p>
                    <p>If an evasion like this be tolerated, an important provision of the
                        Constitution will become a dead letter--the Executive will be stripped of
                        one of his most important prerogatives, and the people deprived of an
                        indispensable safeguard of liberty.</p>
                    <p>The amendments which are proposed to be incorporated into the Constitution,
                        are worthy of the source from which they emanated. Stripped of the flimsy
                        disguise by which their deformity is sought to be concealed, they are,
                        substantially:</p>
                    <p>1st, Negro equality in all respects.</p>
                    <p>2nd, The disfranchisement of every Southern man, who obeyed the authority of
                        his State and proved loyal to the instincts of humanity.</p>
                    <p>3rd, The repudiation of all Confederate obligations.</p>
                    <p>To the 3rd amendment we can have no objection, except that it is unnecessary
                        and tends to mislead the public mind; because it was well known to the
                        authors of this amendment, that the several States had anticipated their
                        action, by adopting efficient measures to prevent the assumption or payment
                        of any debt contracted in aid of the war.</p>
                    <p>To the other two amendments we are inflexibly opposed. They involve flagrant
                        violations of the reserved rights of the States; tend to inflame sectional
                        animosity and to retard the restoration of union and harmony in the Country,
                        and were manifestly intended to degrade and humiliate the people of the
                        South.</p>
                    <p>We therefore indignantly protest against their adoption, as leading
                        inevitably to new troubles, and to the disturbance of the just relations
                        between the States and the Federal government, and ultimately to the
                        consolidation of all power in the government of the United States; and we
                        earnestly invite the people of our sister Counties, and of all the Southern
                        States, to assemble promptly, at their respective Court Houses, and
                        pronounce a similar judgement of condemnation on this mischievous attempt to
                        undermine the foundation of Constitutional liberty.</p>
                    <p>As for ourselves, we could not sanction any such amendment without personal
                        dishonor, and the basest ingratitude and injustice to those of our fellow
                        citizens who merit the largest share of our esteem and confidence.</p>
                    <p>We prefer not to be represented at all, in the national councils, rather than
                        to be represented only by those whose past history gives no assurance that
                        they will be true to their trusts.</p>
                    <p>We are determined, at all hazards, to maintain our self-respect unimpaired,
                        and therefore we must withhold our sanction from measures which necessarily
                        involve a sacrifice of high moral principle.</p>
                    <p>We have been overwhelmed, but we have not yet been degraded. That can be done
                        only with our own consent, and that consent never will be given.</p>
                    <p>Our rights may be ravished from us by [unclear], but we will never agree that
                        Virginia shall be placed in the position of a political prostitute, by
                        giving consent to her own degradation and dishonor.</p>
                    <p>Whereupon, on motion, a committee of five persons were appointed to report
                        resolutions for the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The following were appointed, A. H. H. Stuart, John Merritt, J. G. Fulton,
                        Thomas J. Michie and William M. Tate.</p>
                    <p>On motion the meeting adjourned to half past 3 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>At half past 3 o'clock the meeting resumed business, and the following
                        preamble and resolutions were reported, and on motion, as the sense of the
                        meeting, unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>Whereas, on the 8th day of May, 1865, the people of Augusta, in general
                        meeting, assembled "to take measures looking to re-organization of the
                        Government of Virginia in conformity to the Constitution and laws of the
                        United States," with just appreciation of the duties inforced on them by the
                        results of war, and of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of
                        the of the United States, pledge themselves in good faith, to co-operate
                        with others for the restoration of the union; and announced principles and
                        opinions which have since been sanctioned and illustrated by the acts and
                        declarations of Andrew Johnson, the President of the United States, and have
                        been and are discharging, with scrupulous fidelity, the duties of citizens,
                        obeying the laws, paying taxes, and bearing other burdens of government;
                        and, whereas, notwithstanding, that the right of taxation has heretofore
                        been deemed inseparable from the right of representation, the Congress of
                        the United States, in the absence of Senators and Representatives from
                        eleven States of the Union, propose deliberately to continue to the
                        imposition of taxes on the people of the South, without their consent or
                        voice in the enactment of laws for the purpose: and not only so, but against
                        the protestation of the President and the judgement of all just men, to
                        propose, for ratification by the States, amendments of the Constitution of
                        the United States, which never could have been matured and passed if all the
                        States had been in Congress by their representatives; and not this only,
                        but, as is alleged, looking upon the Union as dissolved in fact, as to the
                        eleven Southern States, and upon these as States still out of the Union, the
                        said Congress propose, that the ratification of the amendment recently
                        propounded, through the Secretary of State, not by an "act of Congress," to
                        which the approval of the President would have been necessary, but by "a
                        concurrent resolution" to avoid the effects on the country of a veto of the
                        act--that the ratification of this amendment, so devised and propounded, by
                        each of the eleven Southern States shall be a condition precedent to the
                        restoration of the Union--and, whereas, apart from the fact that said
                        amendment was passed by the two houses of Congress in violation of the
                        Constitution itself; and, apart from all else, in the article propounded,
                        unjust and oppressive to the people of the South, Virginians can never
                        ratify, without self imposed dishonor or degradation, an amendment of the
                        Constitution which, notwithstanding professions of sincere loyalty, and acts
                        of patriotism, the President's pardon, and the rights of persons elsewhere
                        guaranteed in the Constitution, seeks to degrade and disfranchise the ablest
                        and purest men of the State for the discharge of the duties imposed on them
                        by the free suffrage of the people, or for sympathy and cooperation, during
                        the recent struggle, with an overwhelming majority of the people of
                        Virginia; and, whereas, whilst it is the unalterable purpose of the people
                        of Augusta County, to obey the laws, to bear patiently the burdens of
                        Government, even though denied the right of representation, and cordially to
                        sustain the wise and patriotic policy of the President of the United States,
                        it is equally their fixed determination, to take part in no act which will
                        deprive them of a proud sense of self-respect or bring shame upon them and
                        their posterity.</p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore be it resolved:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. That the people of Augusta County cannot too warmly express their
                        gratitude that God has placed in power, as President of the United States, a
                        citizen who having the wisdom to discern, has the moral courage to act upon
                        principles, which a people who love liberty and appreciate the Constitution,
                        must sooner or later sanction and adopt.</p>
                    <p>2. That whilst we recognized our duty as good citizens to obey the laws, and
                        to bear the burdens of the Government--as freemen we enter our earnest
                        protest against the violation, through us, of the fundamental principles of
                        free Government evinced by the refusal of the two houses of Congress to
                        admit our Senators and Representatives to vote for or against the taxes we
                        are to pay, the burdens we are to bear and the Constitutional amendments to
                        be propounded to the States for their ratification!</p>
                    <p>3. That the people of Augusta can never authorize their Senator and delegates
                        in the General Assembly to vote for the article of amendment to the
                        Constitution of the United States propounded, as before stated, by the two
                        houses of Congress; and that, in their opinion, it is far better for
                        Virginia to maintain her position, as a State out of the
                            Union, and at the same time discharge the duties of a State in the
                        Union, than to enter the Halls of Congress with the brand of
                        self-imposed degradation upon her brow, and the object of the just scorn of
                        mankind; and that therefore it is the fixed purpose of the people, without
                        passion or excitement, and with no view to disturb the order or harmony of
                        the country, to decline even to consider any proposed amendments of the
                        Constitution until, to use the words of President Johnson in his recent
                        message to Congress "after the admission of such
                        loyal Senators and Representatives of the now unrepresented States as have
                        been or may hereafter be chosen in conformity with the Constitution and laws
                        of the United States."</p>
                    <p>4. That the people of Augusta are prepared patiently to await the results of
                        the contest, now to be waged between the friends and the enemies of the
                        conservative principles of free government in the North, and for the time
                        when those who hold the power now shall be removed from the public trusts
                        they have abused; and in the meantime by such means as are left them, by
                        their cordial approval and their prayers, they will endeavor to uphold the
                        hands of Andrew Johnson, the great leader of their deliverance, as from his
                        high eminence, he looks upon and directs the struggle which must result
                        either in a revolution not only in the forms of Government, but in the
                        principles of the Constitution itself, or in the vindication of its ancient
                        doctrines and the consequent prosperity and Union of the States.</p>
                    <p>6. That the people of the other counties of Virginia, and of our sister
                        States, be requested to hold public meetings and unite with us in
                        endeavoring to defeat the proposed amendment.</p>
                    <p>7. That the newspapers of Staunton and Richmond, and other towns of the
                        State, be requested to publish the proceedings of this meeting and that a
                        copy of the same be sent to the National Intelligencer.</p>
                    <p>On motion the meeting adjourned.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Staunton, June 21, 1866.</p>
                    <p>I have been spending a week in this pleasant mountain town. The days have
                        been pleasant and the nights cool enough for fire. The cool weather has been
                        favorable for the wheat, which promises to be of excellent quality, and much
                        more abundant than was thought sometime since. Staunton has its base-ball
                        club, its fishing club, and its glee club, and is, I should think, rather a
                        pleasant place for young people. To-day is observed as a holiday. The
                        citizens are turning out en masse to adorn the
                        Soldiers' Cemetery. Carriages are passed hither by scores. All places of
                        business are closed. The colored people to-day lay the corner-stone of a new
                        Methodist meeting-house, and hold a fair for the benefit of that object.</p>
                    <p>I have been proving the merits of the Virginia Hotel, which a recent
                        correspondent complimented. He said not a word too much. I have been
                        travelling for months, and have not found, for comfort, good cheer, and all
                        that makes up a good public house, "the old Virginia" surpassed, if indeed
                        equalled.</p>
                    <p>I have met here one of the firm who is engaged in preparing the famous
                        Renold's pill, advertised in you columns. It has a wonderful reputation
                        among the people of this community. I knew Dr. Renolds. He was an eminent
                        practitioner, and this pill, which he had spent years in preparing, was his
                        usual prescription for the maladies for which it is now offered.</p>
                    <p>Staunton, last to give up the Union, one of the first in war, was also one of
                        the first to realize the situation at its close, and go to building up on a
                        new basis. Great energy and progress are visible, and when the new railroads
                        are completed the people here hope to see this a city. E. T. A.</p>

                    <p>We have heretofore undertaken to present in our own way, the political
                        difficulty threatening to grow out of the persistent refusal of a majority
                        in Congress to receive members of the Southern States. The following clear
                        and pointed view of the case is from the New York times:</p>
                    <p>Suppose matters stand in 1866 substantially as they stand to-day--none of the
                        Southern States represented in Congress. Is it not reasonably certain that
                        they will all be represented in the Democratic nominees? Now suppose their
                        votes, together with those of the Northern States that may vote the
                        Democratic ticket, constitute a majority of the electoral college--what will
                        be the result? It may be said their votes will not be counted. Congress
                        containing only Northern members--the South not being represented in
                        it--will reject them. Will that rejection be accepted by the country? Will
                        the mass of the Southern people, or the mass of the
                            Democratic party in the North, acquiesce in it? And would not
                        such resistance be most menacing to the peace of the country? That would not
                        be an attempt at secession; it would be in no sense a sectional conflict; it
                        would present to the country and the world the aspect of a majority of the
                        people insisting upon their right to control the Government, as against the
                        unconstitutional usurpation of the minority.</p>
                    <p>The case stated as possible by the Times will prove to be a certainty, but we
                        do not think the radicals will dare to resist the will of the majority for a
                        moment. If they should the leaders would have a wonderfully short shift.
                        There would be no general war. The whole affair would be settled in the most
                        summary manner.--Cincinnati Enquirer.</p>

                        keeping midnight vigils long<br> With silent grief alone.</p>
                    <p>There may be hands now clasp'd in prayer<br> This soldier's hand has
                        pressed,<br> And cheeks washed pale by sorrow's tears,<br> His own cold
                        cheek caressed.</p>
                    <p>Tread lightly--for a man bequeathed,<br> Ere laid beneath this sod,<br> His
                        ashes to his native land,<br> His gallant soul to God!</p>
                <br>
