<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial admits that the prospects of a Radical victory look good.
                    The editors urge southern whites to prepare for the consequences, and to be
                    willing to resist.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is useless to disguise the fact, and we would be criminal if we did, the
                        situation is bad, and every sign of the times indicates that it may become
                        worse. We are not an alarmist, but we can't help agreeing with the Examiner that "the Conservative prospects are not
                        brilliant. In fact, they are gloomy. That the President and his policy may
                        yet have a peaceful triumph at the ballot-box is, indeed, possible, but we
                        cannot look upon it as probable. The manner in which the President has been
                        treated, the rampant attitude of Radicalism, in all quarters, and the
                        results of recent elections, do not augur very hopefully of Conservative
                        success. It is very true that Vermont and Maine are not States where much
                        growth of proper sentiment was reasonably to be expected, but still we had
                        been assured that even in Yankeeland Radicalism was on the decline. We have
                        been disappointed. Madness still rules the hour, and the future is darkened
                        by clouds that we cannot penetrate with our keenest vision.</p>
                    <p>We do not desire our readers to wrap themselves in a false security. It is
                        pleasant to hug the delusive phantoms of hope; but it is safer and better to
                        be prepared for the worst. The lamentable dominance of Radicalism is likely
                        to continue until its violence begets a superior violence that shall subdue
                        it. It is possible that elections outside of New England may result more
                        favorably to Conservatism; but we are forced to say that appearances do not
                        justify any very sanguine expectations of that kind. Radicalism is to be
                        allowed to run its course, and to plunge the country into untold woes. The
                        measure of its iniquity is to be filled, and it will not take it long. Till
                        then we must possess our souls in patience.</p>
                    <p>"When the moment arrives for action, let us be ready with heart and hand.
                        Nothing in our late defeat and our renewed allegiance to the Government
                        binds us to perpetual sufferance. We are men, as other men are. We have
                        rights and duties, both as citizens and as persons, that can neither be
                        renounced nor taken from us. We are not bondmen. We are Americans. We cannot
                        tamely see all the blessings that make life tolerable taken or withheld from
                        us. We have borne much, and we have borne long. There is a point, however,
                        where patience ceases to be a virtue, and Radicalism is driving us towards
                        it with fearful speed."</p>
                    <p>"And what are we to do about it?" is the question that occurs to every man.
                        Wait, be patient, work, and, in the language of
                        Alexander Stevens, believe that "God, in his mercy and wisdom, only knows
                        what is to be the future of this country. The destiny of States, as well as
                        of individuals, is in His hands. All that we poor mortals can do, is to
                        discharge our duty as well as we can, from the lights before us, and then
                        bow submissively to His will." But "keep your powder dry!"</p>

<b>Fred. Douglas</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper asserts that of all the radicals, Frederick Douglass has never
                    been criticized in print.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>So far as we have seen by our Southern exchanges, says the Baltimore Transcript, Fred. Douglas seems to be considered
                        the most distinguished gentleman of the late Radical Convention. Whatever
                        the natural bitterness manifested towards the white agitators, there is
                        nothing harsh said of Douglas, but, on the contrary, he is rather spoken of
                        as the most sensible person who figured in the revolutionary proceedings at
                        Philadelphia. We learn that in social intercourse the Southerners express
                        the same preference of Fred. "You see sir," said an old Virginia gentleman
                        to us, not long ago, "he was raised among gentlemen, and conducts himself
                        accordingly." We have yet to see the first Southern journal in which Douglas
                        is not spoken of as the most prominent man, in point of mind and manners, of
                        the Philadelphia conclave.</p>

<b>Emigration</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors argue that the completion of the Valley Railroad will attract
                    emigrants to the area who will add to the wealth and prosperity of the Valley.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our people have made great calculations on a large emigration into the
                        Valley, and we are glad to see so many good men from the North, South, and
                        Eastern Virginia, enquiring for lands among us. Now we have talked to many
                        of these gentlemen, and we find that the great inducement to come here and
                        settle is the prospect of the Valley Railroad being built. Every vote given
                        for the subscription adds to the inducement for people to emigrate
                        here--every good emigrant brings money, and that is the great object. We are
                        happy to state that our most intelligent citizens think the vote for the
                        subscription will be overwhelming. We begin to see daylight.</p>

<b>A Remarkable Article from a Semi-Official Paper--The Trouble in
                    Prospect--General Grant may be made Dictator.</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints speculation from the New York Times that Congress may
                    split into two bodies, one containing Democrats and representatives from the
                    South, the other containing Radical Republicans. Then Johnson would have to
                    decide which body represented the legitimate national authority. There is also
                    speculation that Grant may be given complete control of the government.<br>

<b>Mr. Seward's Speech at Indianapolis</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an excerpt from Secretary of State Seward's speech to the
                    people of Indiana in which he urges them to help mediate between the extreme
                    views of Radicals and Conservatives, and help the government in an effort to
                    make the Union what it was before the Civil War, with the abolition of slavery
                    the only change. Though Indiana was a Union state during the war, Seward calls
                    it a border state during Reconstruction.<br>

                    <p>A visit to Staunton last week afforded an opportunity of making inquiry as to
                        the state of affairs in that section, with a result truly gratifying.
                        Business there is brisk, and the bustle and confusion indicates a thriving,
                        prosperous condition. Storehouses, dwellings, as building sites, are in
                        great demand, whilst on every hand evidences of improvement are met with.
                        The hotels, probably the best in the State, are crowded with guests, and the
                        various lines of communication with the place are liberally patronized.
                        Centrally located, and situated in one of the wealthiest sections of the
