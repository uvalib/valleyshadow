<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial asserts that the South is ignoring politics and making rapid

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The general appearance of affairs, of interest to our people has not changed
                        materially in the last week, for better or for worse. The Southern people
                        are still hammering away on the pressing question "of how to make a living,"
                        and they are doing it earnestly and effectively. A portion of the Northern
                        people are, or seem to be, very mad at the conduct of our Southern brethren,
                        of the Confederacy, in not endorsing their proposed Constitutional
                        Amendment. They call us all sorts of names and even surpass their ingenuity
                        during the war in telling lies about "Southern Rebels," their "barbarities,"
                        &amp;c. The body, called a Congress of the United States, meets on
                        December 3rd, and will soon decide, as far as they can, what is to be our
                        fate. Till then we can only watch, wait, and work--with the same patience and stern endurance that has
                        characterized our course since the surrender.</p>
                    <p>No people ever exhibited so grand a spectacle of moral courage; so devoted an
                        attachment to their country, and so thorough and practical a devotion to the
                        "Land we love," as the Southern people are now showing. It is all very well
                        for some people to brag about the energy and enterprise of the Yankees, but
                        suppose even that untiring race, of devils on earth, of energy incarnate,
                        overpowered, overrun, stripped, plundered, taxed--and what would they do?
                        Can we imagine them going bravely to work; can we imagine them exhibiting
                        the courage that gives up all for a cause,
                        regretting only an inability to do more and then, with but a feeling of pity
                        and sympathy for the negro, striving as men never did before, to reconstruct
                        and revive a country? Never! The flight of imagination that can conceive the
                        idea of a Yankee doing any thing for the sake of a principle would surpass
                        even that of a Herald newspaper correspondent. And let us be understood by
                        the term "Yankee," we mean the character that has cursed this country, and
                        has made the word signify what no other word can--a mean, a low, a scheming,
                        and an unscrupulous man. He has no particular place to be born, though the
                        breed originally came from "Plymouth rock," or thereabouts, and the nearest
                        are the so called "loyalists" of the South.</p>
                    <p>Important changes in the habits and thoughts of our people have, and are
                        taking place. Old fogy notions are giving way to new ideas, and the
                        prejudices of ages are being ground to powder in the mill of necessity. The
                        Farmers and planters of Virginia recently assembled in Convention have
                        discussed, with the ability that was always a proud characteristic of the
                        Virginia agriculturalist, the grave questions now pressing upon us for
                        solution. In the main, the views taken by this body are encouraging, and the
                        facts elicited by the debates, reports, &amp;c., will do much towards
                        giving proper direction to the mind and hands of our people. The people
                        themselves are at work and, having thrown politics "to the dogs," are doing
                        wonders. Times are hard, but the steady, persevering efforts now being made
                        will, in a few years, bring us to the topmost round of the ladder of
                        material prosperity. The prospect for good crops was never so promising
                        before, and it seems at last that Providence, which has satisfied as to be
                        so sorely oppressed, is about to smile upon us once more.</p>
                    <p>European News, like American, is still dull and uninteresting. There are all
                        sorts of rumors sent over the cable, headed "important," only to be
                        corrected by others equally nonsensical the next day. Even Mexico has to be
                        tried by those indefatigable sensations, the Yankee papers, to get up an
                        item, and poor Maximilian is daily run, telegraphically, between the Halls
                        of the Montezumas and a mysterious Austrian man of war, said to be laying
                        somewhere on the Mexican coast. The Emperor Napoleon the 3rd is daily and
                        hourly reported dead or dying, and the next day news gives full accounts of
                        the improved health of himself and family. Some rebel Tycoon or other is
                        weekly reported as having rebelled and cut off some body's head in Japan,
                        and the chronic "rebellion" in China and South America furnishes a never
                        failing theme for learned and erudite leaders, on the "destiny of man," for
                        the daily papers. Austria has subsided since the late war, but that
                        mysterious and wonderful Prussian, Bismark, is always ready to hand, when a
                        poor devil reporter in Europe is out of "copy" for the steamer. The Pope is
                        daily expected to be forced to leave Rome and give up his temporal power, by
                        the enthusiastic devotees to "Italian unity," and is nightly prayed for and
                        sworn by, temporally and spiritually, by millions, as one who rests upon the
                        "Rock of Ages." Spain is continually in a hubbub and the telegraph sometimes
                        almost makes one believe he cares a -- about Spain or what becomes of her.
                        And even "down trodden Africa"--the house of God's chosen people, according
                        to our Northern philosophers, comes in for a share of this infernal
                        telegraph news, and some body is conjuring up a gigantic scheme to bore the
                        poor devils there with Associated Press dispatches. Heaven help the poor
                        African!--we can't.</p>
                    <p>"But what does all this, about the whole world, amount to?" we hear some
                        bored "sensationist" exclaim. To about the same all articles on the
                        situation must account to now--absolutely
                        nothing!--The Northern people have got an "elephant" to handle and
                        don't know what his "trunk" contains. They fear a financial crash; and we,
                        with the rest of the world, have the same animal to attend to. There is "the
                        situation." Is there brains enough on this continent to direct a solution of
                        the problem? We can only patiently await an answer.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Staunton, November 18, 1866</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Editor of the Examiner:
                    </p>
                    <p>I ask a small space in your widely circulated and popular journal to say a
                        few words of Staunton, its improvements, its hotels, and the public spirit
                        and energy of its inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>Upon taking a walk this pleasant Sabbath morning around this beautiful town,
                        I was truly amazed at the amount and extent of the improvements made since
                        the close of the war. The spirit of improvement has seized everybody, and
                        extended even to the corporation authorities. The Mayor, N. K. Trout, is one
                        of the most pleasant, agreeable, intelligent and popular men I ever met
                        with; and the street commissioner--Mr. Kayser--is indomitable in the
                        discharge of the duties of his office. Under his administration the
                        sidewalks are being put in splendid order, and the streets are kept clean to
                        a surprising degree.</p>
                    <p>Besides, this city of hills is every night brilliantly illuminated with gas.
                        But I think it is the absence of "gas" in its rulers that accounts for its
                        present cleanly and healthy condition. On every street, and in every ally
                        you can see workmen renovating old and beautiful new homes. At least forty
                        houses have been erected here since the close of the war, and it is hard to
                        say how many old and unsightly structures have been converted into
                        comfortable and beautiful residences and places of business.</p>
                    <p>Among the places of business that have recently been put in thorough order,
                        we may mention Piper &amp; Lunkhouser's, P. H. Trout's, S. H. Hilb's,
                        Isaac Witz's, M. E. Fagan's, C. E. Wood's, H. H. Peck's and others. General
                        John Echols has made a new place out of the old Valley Bank property, and A.
                        T. Maupin has converted the old National Hotel property from a harbor for
                        negroes and the lowest of the degraded whites, into a fine dwelling and
                        boarding house and two elegant stores with open fronts, now occupied by
                        Messrs. W. M. Poole and Summerson and Turner. The Postoffice is also in the
                        same property. Mr. Maupin has done as much, if not more, to improve the
                        town, than any man in it. Two new foundries are also in full blast and doing
                        well. Staunton is not idle. She does not stand idly holding her hands and
                        lamenting her sad misfortunes, but like true and brave people, her citizens
                        have discarded politics and have gone to work to rebuild their fortunes, and
                        they will do it.</p>
                    <p>Becoming somewhat tired by our long walk, we halted at the Presbyterian
                        Church, one of the first Churches in the State, and heard a most excellent
                        sermon from that most able man, Rev. William E. Baker. He made no attempt at
                        display, but preached a sound practical sermon from the text, to be found in
                        the tenth chapters of Romans, from the sixth to the eighth verse inclusive.</p>
                    <p>There are seven other churches in Staunton with regular ordained
                        ministers--two of them colored. This place has three large and well
                        patronized female Institutes, besides several private and select schools for
                        ladies. It is very deficient, however, in male schools--although that
                        thorough gentleman and scholar, Pike Powers, has a very fair school. It
                        should be ten times as large.</p>
                    <p>Returning from the Presbyterian Church, much impressed with the excellent
                        sermon we had heard, we repaired to the Virginia House and partook of a most
                        elegant dinner, as cheering to the material man as the discourse we had just
                        heard was to the spiritual. In fact, the Virginia is one of the very best
                        hotels in the State. There every want of the guest is anticipated by those
                        prince of landlords, Messrs. Peyton and O'Ferrall. Long life and success to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>There is another fact that is no doubt very gratifying to you, Mr. Editor,
                        and that is, that there are more Examiners taken here than any other three
                        Richmond (secular) papers put together. That enterprising newsboy, John A.
                        Noon, sells about one hundred Examiners daily. Long may it flourish.</p>

<b>The Fireman's Fair</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper declares the recent Fireman's Fair "the greatest success in the
                    way of a Fair and Supper ever known in Staunton." The town hall was decorated
                    with banners and evergreen wreaths. "Benjamin Fifer organized a gang of negroes,
                    about a span long, and had them dancing, 'Kicking up behind and before,' for the
                    amusement of the crowd." A ball and dinner at the American Hotel concluded the
                    evening. $580 was raised for the Firemen. The following won door prizes

<b>Circuit Court--November Term</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The session of the Circuit Court continues. The case of Brown, Lanigan and
                    Co., vs. Forrer, is still underway. General Echols, Col. John B. Baldwin, Mr. J.
                    Y. Menifee, and A. H. H. Stuart argued for the defendants. The case of John W.
                    Trayer and wife vs. Dr. H. S. Eichelberger for "assault and battery upon the

                    against the defendant and the plaintiff was awarded $300 in damages. The case
                    aroused much local interest because "it was all about a 'stray' pidgeon." Many
                    cases are in progress involving debts due in Confederate money contracted during
                    the war. In the case of Michael O'Brien vs John Hair, "action of defendant in

                    case of Matthew Tisdale vs. J. S. Timberlake for assault and battery was decided
                    in favor of the defendants. In another matter, it was decided that local
                    newspapers would bid for the right to print legal notices from the Clerk, lowest
                    bidder taking all. In the case of Mary Seely vs Rachel Phelps, (white); A.
                    Shovler and others (black), an injunction was granted by Judge Harris preventing
