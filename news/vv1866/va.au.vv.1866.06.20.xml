                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--Through the columns of your valuable paper, I wish to present to
                        the citizens of Staunton, and to the public, some facts which the Rev. A.
                        Woodhouse, of the Bethel connection, denies. He has taken upon himself the
                        arduous duty, no doubt for the want of proper discretion, to contradict
                        certain facts relative to Mrs. Emily Rodney's procedure, prior to his advent
                        in our midst.</p>
                    <p>He has had the daring impudence to charge me, as a minister in Christ, of
                        telling an untruth. Now, let us see who it is that tells the untruth. The
                        Reverend gentleman, in vindication of Mrs. Rodney, asserted that the
                        "feminine Divine has not, nor never did assume any authority that was not
                        vested in all members of the Church." Mrs. Rodney came here last October,
                        1865, and preached without being licensed; she also stated that the members
                        of the M. E. Church, in the presence of a large concourse of persons, both
                        white and colored, that it was the duty of the colored people to cut lose
                        from the white people, and join the connection where they would be presided
                        over by a colored Bishop, and be independent of the superintendency of the
                        whites, or an affiliation with them in Church or business.</p>
                    <p>She then proceeded to organize, by taking the names of those whom she had
                        proselyted to her favorite connection. Now, I would like to know from Mr.
                        Woodhouse, whether the Bethel, or in other words, the A. M. E. Church allows
                        all its members, both male and female, to preach and to organize into
                        bodies, without being duly authorized or licensed by their Church? If that
                        be a fact, then I am in an error; but if my presumption in the premises be
                        correct, then, Sir, you not only err but, most indubitably procure to
                        yourself discredit in your futile attempt to refute the statements made by
                        those who always sustained a reputation for veracity. I am sorry to say,
                        Sir, from my short acquaintance with you, in my estimation you have
                        manifested more zeal than sound knowledge. You also denied the fact of Mrs.
                        Rodney promulgating the doctrine to the colored people, to sever their
                        connection from the white people, and become an independent people. I have
                        been told by white gentlemen that she advanced that doctrine last fall, when
                        she preached in the Grove. You ought to know, that such doctrine as that
                        will never suit this community, where it has been the wishes of all good
                        people to cultivate a feeling of friendship, between those who have always
                        lived together and known each other. It may do very well for you, or her, to
                        go to Africa or some other heathen land, and preach such doctrine, and I am
                        inclined to think, even there, it would tend to lead the blind into the
                        ditch.</p>
                    <p>As it regards the subscription, you said that "we are at a loss to know how
                        the mistake occurred as our paper, soliciting subscription, was signed by
                        the Rev. Mr. Woodhouse, and the other, we believe, by the Rev. M. Lawson."
                        Sir, it can be very easily accounted for; since it is the testimony of
                        trustworthy gentlemen who contributed to the subscription list, or the
                        petitioner, who disclaim the real name that distinguished it from the M. E.
                        Church, claiming to be the M. E. Church, when in fact it was the A. M. E.
                        Church, known as the Bethel Church. Sir, if this is not soliciting
                        subscription under a false representation of facts, then I do not know what
                        it is.</p>
                    <p>I hope, that in the future, there will be no further need for any more
                        discussion on the subject, as I am decidedly opposed to such a controversy,
                        and I should not have written this but for your request.</p>
                    <p>I remain very respectfully your most obedient servant.</p>

                <summary>Reverend Ephraim Lawson, pastor of the African American congregation of the
                    M. E. Church, Staunton, answers a letter of Rev. Woodhouse of the Bethel Church.
                    Lawson details the problems with the preaching of Emily Rodney, who Woodhouse
                    defended. According to Lawson, Rodney has been preaching that Augusta's blacks
                    should strive for independence from whites in "church and business," which
                    Lawson denounces.</summary>

                <head>The Senate Call Upon the Southern People to Violate Principles of Honor</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The idea of honor in the human heart seems to be a good deal ignored, not
                        only by Congressmen, but by the press. Even the honorable Senate of the
                        United States does not hesitate to apply a poisoned chalice to Southern
                        communities, that upon reflection, as gentlemen and humanists, they will in
                        another day feel little disposed to justify. On this point we quote from the
                        Springfield Republican as follows:</p>
                    <p>It is generally conceded as reasonable that the Southern States should be
                        required to assent to the utilization of representation as proposed in the
                        second section, and standing by itself would have a fair chance of adoption;
                        but it is hardly to be expected that the Southern people can be willing to
                        ostracise their leaders for the sake of procuring power for themselves. It
                        will be considered an outrage upon all their notions of honor and chivalry.
                        If this provision were put in the form of a law, as the joint committee
                        proposed, it might have been patiently submitted to, as a not unreasonable
                        penalty for rebellion imposed by the victorious government. But if the
                        Southern people themselves accept it as an amendment to the Constitution,
                        they thus become ministers of vengeance upon their own leaders. This is an
                        act of humiliation and expiation so difficult and mortifying that it is
                        hardly conceivable that it will be performed under any stress of motive.</p>

                    disfranchising Confederate leaders would be tantamount to a voluntary violation

                    <p>The South is about to commence a career of unexampled prosperity. Before many
                        years the sceptre will have departed from the North, and will be wielded by
                        the South and West. All the Radical efforts to injure the South will only
                        make her grow the more rapidly. From the destruction of the war will arise
                        such industrial advancement as the world has rarely seen before. The
                        abolition of slavery, done in revenge, will have the same effect. So in the
                        end, will be an export tax on cotton, not because that it is to be an
                        advantage in itself, any more than the other things referred to, but that
                        the more a people are oppressed and mistreated, within the limits of
                        endurance, the more energy and enterprise they must put forth. Every lick
                        the North strikes which is not dictated by a magnanimous spirit, will be
                        against herself. If she meets the South in a liberal reconstruction, the
                        prosperity resulting will be general; if otherwise, it will mark the history
                        of the mistreated section and desert the wilful and the selfish. Ordinary
                        laws in daily operation are certain to work out such a result under the
                        circumstances indicated. We have larger hopes for the South to day than we
                        ever entertained before.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>During the war, we often noticed the above heading in the newspapers, and we
                        took a sort of fancy to it; for if "the situation" was good, we always liked
                        to hear our side praised, and if it was bad, we were always certain "the
                        situation" article would not make it out half as bad as we knew it to be,
                        and that was a sort of a consolation; just like it is comforting to tell a
                        man you "know he is all right" when it is evident he is going to break all
                        to smash.</p>
                    <p>Since our last article, under the above heading, there has been but one
                        material change for the better in "the situation." The "d--l is still to pay
                        and he won't take Confederate money," but the tax collector has left for a
                        time, and that's a consolation, though everybody you dun tells you the
                        "infernal revenue took all they had or ever expect to get." In fact "the
                        situation" is still very much "mixed," and knowing people swear there is
                        "not a bit of sugar in it;" and some contumacious "rebels" even go so far,
                        as to say they "prefer old Apple brandy straight and short rations to the
                        infernal mixture," but this is all a matter of taste, and a discerning
                        public can judge for themselves.</p>
                    <p>The situation of the United States, so-called, is not to be envied, and for
                        "the best Government the world ever saw," it certainly occupies a peculiar
                        position. After four years of war, to re-unite the States; after the
                        Northern and European armies had overpowered the South; after losing four
                        hundred thousand men and billions of dollars, professedly to restore the
                        "glorious Union," what do we see? We see a Congress usurping all the powers
                        of the Government and repudiating the pledges of the President and the
                        Commander in Chief. We see a majority of the same Congress asserting the
                        very doctrine (that the Confederate States were out of the Union) which the
                        whole power of the North fought four years to deny--and further, we see the
                        course of the Southern States justified by every act of the same majority;
                        and we see a country on the verge of ruin in the hands of madmen.</p>
                    <p>In the whole history of Nations no "situation," so foolish and so utterly
                        without cause, was ever witnessed. Here were the Southern States ready to do
                        everything they could do with honor. Tired of war; overpowered and
                        impoverished, the generous action of Grant and Johnson, had won the hearts
                        of this people; but they have been received with scorn and contempt; their
                        honorable submission to circumstances, construed into abject cowardice, and
                        after six months wrangling, the Congress of the United States deigns to
                        offer us, a people who fought four years to keep out of the Union, the
                        conditions published in another column. Come into the glorious Union they
                        say; come ye rebels and rest under the shadow of the "old flag"--but before
                        you come disfranchise all who fought for you; all whom you loved and trusted
                        in your hours of trial, and give your representation to those noble souls
                        who saw you suffer and cared not; who hoarded up their provisions and let
                        your soldiers starve, but who now can take the "test oath" and vote for
                        "negro suffrage." Such is the situation; such the feast the Radical mob in
                        Congress invite us to partake of, and but for Andrew Johnson would attempt
                        to force down our throats. From that dose, good Lord deliver us!</p>
                    <p>Turning from our own troubles and trials, we see the situation in other parts
                        of the world is not so good, and that's another consolation, for "misery
                        loves company," and for a long time, four bloody years, we had none, and no
                        sympathy from the Nations who are about to cut each others throats. As
                        everybody on this Continent, except a few Fenians, is tired of fighting, we
                        can calmly look on, for</p>
                    <p>"By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see<lb/> For one who hath no friend, no
                        brother there."</p>
                    <p>And as for our situation, if it is bad it might be worse, and it is cheering
                        to think that every change must be for the better. Time will bring things
                        right and as for the Radical schemes, for our degradation, recollect that
                        "whom the Gods would destroy they first make mad." Let us accept the
                        situation manfully and stick together; let us gather together the remains of
                        our martyred dead, and work to support the helpless living. Always looking
                        "the situation" squarely in the face, let us act as men worthy of those who
                        died for us. If we do our duty at home, "the situation" must improve and a
                        glorious future awaits us; but if we prove unworthy of our past, the English
                        language will fail to portray the depth of our ignominy and disgrace.</p>

                <head>An Honest Man in Congress! Remarkable Speech in the House of Representatives.
                    Mr. Harris of Maryland Defends the Right of Secession and Justifies the South.</head>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In the House of Representatives on Thursday last, while the bill for
                        restoring the Southern States to their political rights was under
                        consideration, Mr. Harris, of Maryland, electrified that body by the
                        following bold, truthful and manly speech. Amidst the ranting and raving of
                        fools and fanatics and the cowardly cringing of some Southern men, it is
                        gratifying to notice that there is one man in Congress who can appreciate
                        the "Situation" and has the courage to express his views. Mr. Harris, said:</p>
                    <p>That having been up to this period of the secession a silent member from
                        choice, he deemed it his duty to declare his views upon some of the
                        political questions. He should consider it a most ignoble act to win the
                        support or endorsement of any man by the least concealment or deception. He
                        declared that in principle he stood now as he stood before the war; as he
                        stood after war was declared; as he stood in the last Congress, when he
                        received its crown of censure: as he stood in prison, and before that
                        infernal instrument of tyranny, a court-martial; as he stood in principle,
                        so he would stand in practice whenever occasion required.</p>
                    <p>When he indicated that there has been no change in his principles, this
                        country and the House could infer what his position now was. He was an
                        old-line democrat, and believed in the doctrine of secession. He believed
                        that the several States of this Union had the right to separate from it,
                        each acting for itself. He believed that abuses and usurpations had been
                        practiced and threatened to so great an extent by their associates and
                        partners in this governmental compact, that the Southern States were
                        justified in going out and he further declared that by their ordinances of
                        secession they did go out, and thereby become foreign States. These
                        convictions he could not change, nor did he think they would be removed. He
                        would stand by them and proclaim them as long as a citizen of the
                        Confederate States was in chains, or subject to penalty for asserting those
                        convictions. There was no political or personal consideration which would
                        prompt him to such a desertion. The right of secession is the only thing
                        that preserves them from the charge of treason. His voice would ever accord
                        with his convictions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris proceeded to state that there were some things in the speech of
                        the President on the 23d of February which he approved. The sentiment that
                        there should be no taxation without representation came to him like the
                        voice of John the Baptist. It was the true doctrine. But it would be seen
                        that he was adverse to the President's reconstruction policy, though Andrew
                        Johnson had been consistent in his policy in following Lincoln and the party
                        that elected him. In his (Mr. Harris's) view, the Southern seceded States
                        had no right to representatives on this floor or in the Senate, and, in his
                        votes heretofore, he had invariably voted against every application which
                        has been made by any person claiming any such right. He thought these States
                        had no right to furnish a President or Vice-President. Andrew Johnson, being
                        a citizen of a seceded State, is in his (Mr. H.'s) opinion, only President
                        de facto forced upon the country by their votes, attended by that very
                        effective implement--the bayonet.</p>
                    <p>He contended that Tennessee would have to be admitted into the Union by act
                        of Congress, and he elaborated this view. Looking to the laws which the
                        republican party might enact. Mr. Harris said there is something in the
                        spirit of the Southern people that will thwart your designs. If they have
                        lowered the standard of their confederacy, they have not lowered the
                        standard of their pride--a becoming pride in the estimation of their enemy.
                        The Southern has around him, without speaking of the merits of the late
                        contest tokens of the endurance, courage, and prowess of his people. Sad
                        spectacle though it be, it will not diminish his tone that he can, on his
                        own soil, walk over the graves of nearly three hundred thousand of his
                        courageous enemies, and</p>
                    <p>"Standing on the Yankee's grave<lb/> He will not deem himself a slave."</p>
                    <p>[Sensation. At this point the entire House gathered around Mr. Harris, and
                        listened attentively. The aisles and spaces were all filled.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris continued.--There were, he said, thank God, Southern States enough
                        to make the constitutional amendment passed yesterday ineffectual. He then
                        referred to all of the isms which originated in what he called the Christian
                        North, and said that the contrast could be carried further. Booth the
                        assassin, was not caught but <emph rend="italic">bravely</emph> shot by
                        soldiers. He was brought to this city dead; in order that the reward for his
                        arrest might be secured by proving his identity. After that his entrails
                        were torn out and thrown to the hogs; his head adorns some phrenological
                        museum; his heart is preserved in spirits; his spinal column can be seen, by
                        which the learned will see how he must have suffered by the near approach of
                        the bullet to the marrow of the spinal. The rest of his remains were
                        deposited, God and our Northern Secretary of War only know where. We know
                        they were not handed over to his poor, broken hearted mother, that she might
                        exclaim: "Would to God I had died for thee Absalom, my son, my son."</p>
                    <p>Mary Surratt was convicted, of course. She was tried by a court-martial! Her
                        immediate execution was ordered! She entreated for days to enable her to
                        overcome the shock and be better prepared to meet her God. "Not an hour,"
                        thundered forth the voice from the War Department!" On with the gallows, the
                        coffin and the grave! The angels of Heaven shall not rejoice over one
                        repentant sinner! Angels of mercy sought the higher authority and probably a
                        more merciful heart; but Preston King was janitor that day, and they were
                        excluded! Where is Preston King? Echo answers, where! She was then executed
                        speedily, and notwithstanding her heart-broken daughter has made application
                        for her remains, so that she might pour forth her sorrows, they are still in
                        the keeping of the War Department! Pontius Pilate delivered the body of
                        Jesus to Joseph, but a worse than Pontius Pilate is here.</p>
                    <p>Is this the specimen of northern civilization and christianity? These things
                        were done by northern men, without any denunciation from the great northern,
                        enlightened, civilized republican party! Not one word have I heard from your
                        Greeleys, your Beechers, your Cheevers and your strong-minded Massachusetts
                        women in rebuke of these demoralizing acts.</p>
                    <p>Let us now look at a Southern picture. John Brown was arrested for a crime
                        kindred to that of Booth. He was in the most formal manner tried, being
                        allowed every facility for defence, no special test oath being urged to
                        prevent the services of any advocate. He was legally and justly convicted to
                        be hung. Between his conviction and execution ample time was given him for
                        the settlement of his worldly affairs and for the preparation of his soul
                        for eternity. After execution his remains were placed in a decent coffin and
                        then handed over to his friends that they might observe such obsequies as
                        they might think becoming. This took place among that "rude, illiterate,
                        semi-civilized" people called Virginians, who had for their Governor at the
                        time even Henry A. Wise. Look upon this picture and then on that. The North
                        is very learned, but I do not think she has any Christianity or civilization
                        to spare. What she has she had better retain for home consumption, and, as I
                        hope, for improvement. She is more learned than the South, but which is the
                        best educated? But, sir denunciation and revenge must, as was expected, have
                        their flings against an honorable reunion. The resentment of the civilized
                        and Christian North it is attempted to rouse against the unfortunate men of
                        the South by epithets unbecoming the learned man or the patriot. They are
                        denominated "murderers," "red-handed rebels," "conscious traitors." Those
                        who use these epithets must see, if they will reflect, that they are not
                        true. They must know that Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson,
                        and the thousand others who engaged in the late contest, never could be
                        answerable for the charge of murder and conscious treason. Stonewall Jackson
                        rests in his grave, and your own eloquent Beecher has illustrated his
                        character and rescued it from such an imputation. Time will defend the
                        character of Davis and Lee. That their acts imposed upon them no
                        consciousness of crime I have no doubt. The parting words of Jefferson
                        Davis, in the presence of the Senate, breathe the strongest conviction of
                        rectitude and a desire for peace and to avoid bloodshed.</p>
                    <p>Away, then, with these charges that these people are murderers, red-handed
                        rebels, and conscious traitors. They spring only from unreflecting
                        excitement or from a depraved spirit of revenge, and with wise and
                        considerate statemen and patriots should never be allowed to interpose
                        obstacles to the reunion which all such must now desire. Away, too, with the
                        expectation that the Southern people will ever degrade themselves by freely
                        accepting conditions from the benefit of which you exclude their own chosen
                        leaders. This shall and will never be. Let the people sweep these obstacles
                        aside, and as we were enemies in war in peace let us be friends.</p>

                    <p>An interesting correspondent of the Lewisburg <emph rend="italic"
                        >Times</emph>, gets off the following on Staunton.</p>
                    <p>At 1 1/2 P. M. I was off for Staunton, which place I reached at 7 P. M.--As
                        soon as the train stopped, my ears were assailed by a horrible din and
                        clamor, which at first startled me, but I soon discovered that it was
                        occasioned by some thirty freedmen, who having escaped from their Bureau,
                        were trying to ingratiate themselves into the favor of the proprietors of
                        the different hotels, by vociferously and with frantic gesticulations,
                        proclaiming the special virtues of their favorites. Had the Bureau man only
                        come up at the time, he could have captured the last one of them without
                        difficulty. I wish he had. I hope he will be there this evening, for I
                        consider it an intolerable nuisance, bellowing out "American Hotel! American
                        Hotel!" as if I didn't know it was right at the depot, and kept by Col.
                        O'Farrell, who did his duty gallantly in the late "unholy and unjustifiable
                        rebellion," "so-called," and that it has been refitted and refurnished, and
                        the servants were attentive, and the bedding nice, and the table A No. 1. Of
                        course I knew all this, for I had read his bill and believed it, for a true
                        reb will be true wherever you put him, and is the very man to "keep
                    tavern."</p>
