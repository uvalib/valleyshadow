                <transcript>
                    <p>Since the late strikes in the West, by the workingmen of all classes, it
                        seems there is, for once, some inquiry made as to the probable cause which
                        brought about the high price of every article that is consumed in their
                        household. It is true, and we have predicted the result months ago, that so
                        long as the workingmen persist in advocating the claims of self-styled
                        "protectionists," the old stereotyped phrase which comes from the lips of
                        the Radical politicians before an election, so long will there be heavy
                        taxes to pay and a constant derangement in the labor system. The question
                        that now seem to be the great subject of consideration is simply this: "Why
                        are the rich growing every year rapidly richer, and the people who work for
                        wages poorer?"-This is a question that can be easily answered. If the
                        workingmen saw other classes equally pinched, they would undoubtedly endure
                        their lot with patience, looking upon it as a necessary consequence of
                        derangements in which rich and poor were common sufferers. But when they
                        walk the street, visit a church or some public place where they may happen
                        to congregate, and observe more costly apparel and expensive frippery than
                        were ever worn before; when they compute the profits of the landlords, of
                        whom they rent their houses; when they read in the newspapers the income
                        returns of the wealthier classes which are increasing heavier while they
                        find it more and more difficult to meet their weekly bills, is it at all
                        strange to ask the above question. This is not what they were led to believe
                        when persuaded to vote the Radical ticket. The blame is now rightfully with
                        that party, and in the language of the poet, which we append below, it is:</p>
                    <p>Work! Work! Work!</p>
                    <p>With pick, and shove, and axe,</p>
                    <p>To pay New England's protection;</p>
                    <p>Your own and the bondholder's tax. <lb/></p>
                    <p>Work! Work! Work!</p>
                    <p>There are millions of niggers to feed,</p>
                    <p>And the cost is hitched on with the bondholders claim,</p>
                    <p>And the sum of New England's greed. <lb/></p>
                    <p>Tug! Toll! Sweat!</p>
                    <p>Still harder than each day before,</p>
                    <p>It will go to keep niggers and bondholders up</p>
                    <p>And the wolf away from your door. <lb/></p>
                    <p>Work! Work! Work!</p>
                    <p>From the dawn of the dusk of day,</p>
                    <p>For your hopes are crushed with a weight of debt,</p>
                    <p>That toil of your life won't pay. <lb/></p>
                    <p>You gave your son to the war,</p>
                    <p>The rich man loaned his gold.</p>
                    <p>And the rich man's son is happy to-day,</p>
                    <p>And yours is under the mould. <lb/></p>
                    <p>You did not think, poor man-</p>
                    <p>You scarce believe when you're told,</p>
                    <p>That sum which the rich man loaned to the war,</p>
                    <p>Was the price for which you were sold. <lb/></p>
                    <p>Your son was as good as his!</p>
                    <p>As dear, perhaps, to you,</p>
                    <p>But yours died for his, and your daughter now</p>
                    <p>For his must wash and sew. <lb/></p>
                    <p>Nay, do not pause to think,</p>
                    <p>Or sigh for your children or wife,</p>
                    <p>For your moments are mortgaged to hopeless toil,</p>
                    <p>The rest of your weary life.</p>

                <summary>In response to the frequent refrain, "Why are the rich growing every year
                    rapidly richer, and the people who work for wages poorer?," the article surmises
                    that "the blame" rests "rightfully" with the Radical party. The article includes
                    a poem suggesting that the Radical Congress has taxed the white workingman to
                    feed and clothe the freedmen and women.</summary>

                <excerpt>"The first project was but a step to the last, and we now understand the
                    motive of the 'Dead Duck' in his arduous but vain efforts to have the old

                    <p>Forney tried hard to have That. Stevens chosen United States Senator from
                        Pennsylvania. He is now trying to bring him forward as the candidate of the
                        Radical Republican party for the Presidency. The first project was but a
                        step to the last, and we now understand the motive of the "Dead Duck" in his
                        arduous but vain efforts to have the miscegenator of Lancaster transferred
                        from the lower to the upper house of the Federal Legislature.</p>
                    <p>In his paper, the <emph rend="italic">Press </emph>, of last Monday, we find
                        the following at the very head of the editorial column:-- </p>
                    <p>"The colored men of the South, say our recent advices, are indicating their
                        preference for Thaddeus Stevens as the next President of the United States."</p>
                    <p>"The Colored men of the South!!" Wonderful, Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
                        evidence of the sense and virtue of the American people in the choice of a
                        President!!! And Forney thinks that because the negroes of the South prefer
                        Thad. Stevens for the Chief Magistracy of the Republic, he should therefore,
                        be elected. Such proof of the merit of any man for such an office, is not,
                        in our judgement, very impressive, and we are quite sure that the <emph
                            rend="italic">white </emph> voters of the county will not regard it with
                        much favor. Forney, however, is so anxious to get some subservient creature
                        into the Presidential chair whom he can use to promote himself in wealth and
                        in honorable station-perhaps a Cabinet office or a first-class foreign
                        mission-that he is not only solicitous that the "colored men of the South"
                        shall be allowed to vote for a Presidential candidate of his party, but be
                        given, also, the high and mighty privilege of "indicating" the man whom that
                        party, whites and blacks together, shall nominate and support for the
                        position. It is hence clear that Forney and Stevens have entered into an
                        arrangement for their mutual advantage. Personal interest, and not any other
                        or better motive, influences them in this struggle for the Presidency. We
                        have yet to learn that any white men have named Stevens for the office. The
                        preference of the negroes may be attributed to the fact that Stevens has a
                        negro for his wife, and mulattoes for his children, and they naturally
                        conclude that his election to the Presidency would be a national endorsement
                        of miscegenation.-<emph rend="italic">Sunday Mercury</emph>. </p>

                <summary>The article denigrates the importance of the fact that blacks in the South
                    have indicated their desire to see Thad Stevens elected as the next president.
                    "Such proof of the merit of any man is not," it suggests, "very impressive."

                    cupidity of our people."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The letter of Thaddeus Stevens in favor of the confiscation of the property
                        of rebels, has been published extensively throughout the country. Not
                        knowing the person to whom the letter was addressed when it first appeared,
                        nor the circumstances under which it was written, we were inclined to regard
                        it as the mere expression of the sentiments of this "old man feeble," whose
                        heart is overflowing with malignity and diabolical hatred towards the
                        Southern people. Mr. Stevens has exhibited himself, in this new effort to
                        make a pandemonium of our already thrice unhappy country, as one who would
                        rather "reign in hell than serve in heaven." If he stood alone in his desire
                        for the accomplishment of this end, nobody would keep any account of it, for
                        he has the well-earned reputation of being the deepest-dyed Radical, and
                        most intense rebel-hater in the country.</p>
                    <p>But it seems that there are those (or at least one,) in our own Senatorial
                        District, who are in earnest sympathy with him in this movement. We confess
                        that when we saw the name of the honorable gentleman to whom the letter is
                        addressed, we quaked with fear. Our alarm exceeded all bounds. It made "each
                        particular hair upon our heads to stand on end like quills upon the fretful
                        porcupine." Another Richmond in the field! Ah, yes! The blood-stained sword
                        of our Senatorial Knight has been unsheathed, and its scabbard thrown away,
                        for this terrible crusade against vanquished rebels. Stevens has been
                        reinforced by McConaughy! Who doubts now that the war will go vigorously on?
                        The name of McConaughy is a very tower of strength.-True he was made a
                        Senator after being beaten at the polls, but it was only through the force
                        of his own irresistible logic that this was affected. The Winnebago Chief,
                        with his wonderful skill in manipulating legislative committees, was in the
                        field in his behalf, but taking the word of our editorial brother of the
                            <emph rend="italic">Repository </emph>, that "Cameron has lost all his
                        influence," we have come to the conclusion that he could not have had
                        anything to do with McConaughy's admission to his seat over the regularly
                        elected candidate. </p>
                    <p>Be this as it may, McConaughy has shown himself "so clear in his great
                        office" that the breath of scandal cannot tarnish his fair frame, but stop!</p>
                    <p>It does occur to us that he was instructed to vote for Curtin for U. S.
                        Senator, by both counties in his District, and disregarding these
                        instructions, voted for Cameron. But then how could his constituents expect
                        him to exhibit ingratitude towards the great "Injun" in return for the
                        legal-tendered sympathy which he received from him during his contest for
                        his seat?</p>
                    <p>It occurs to us also that he, and "that great and good man" from our own
                        county, did lend their aid in passing that bill to incorporate the
                        Gettysburg Monument association, which some say was "soaked" through both
                        Houses, and which the Attorney General intimates, is intended to swindle
                        people out of their money. But Gettysburg, it must be remembered, is the
                        home of McConaughy. It is natural that he should take an interest in any
                        monument calculated to contribute to its prosperity adornment or reputation,
                        and who is so base, knowing well his generous, unselfish disposition, as to
                        charge that he could have been influenced by any other consideration!</p>
                    <p>But enough of this. The public will be convinced that the hero of the
                        Buckshot war has received an ally who will not rest until victory has
                        perched on his banner.</p>
                    <p>Well, McConaughy writes a letter to his friend Stevens requesting his opinion
                        on the subject of confiscation. The "Great Commoner" replies, paying
                        particular attention to the "robbed and plundered" citizens of the border
                        counties of Pennsylvania. He seeks to impress upon the minds of our people
                        that in no other way than by the confiscation of Southern land, can they
                        hope to recover compensation or indemnity for their losses.</p>
                    <p>The whole affair is a preconcerted, barefaced scheme to catch votes for the
                        Republican ticket. It is a common saying that if you would touch a man's
                        heart, you must touch his pocket. This is the argument that is now addressed
                        to the people of the border counties in favor of confiscation.</p>
                    <p>While the piercing cry for bread comes up from the Southern States; while
                        orphan children, and famished widows are lifting up their skinny hands
                        towards Heaven imploring assistance to save them from death by famine, these
                        hard-hearted wretches, Stevens and McConaughy are plotting to catch votes,
                        by appealing to the cupidity of our people.</p>
                    <p>Justly as we are entitled to receive full compensation for our losses, better
                        that we should never receive a single dollar, than that property should be
                        taken from famishing men, women and children, to repay us by a principle
                        which is in direct violation of the constitution of our country.</p>
                    <p>We can not close our ears to the touching appeals which come up to us from
                        the South. We have no heart to add to the miseries of this who are scourged
                        with famine. Our common humanity revolts at the very thought. But even if
                        this were not the case we would be obliged to oppose this scheme of
                        confiscation for the reason it finds no warrant in the law of the land.
                        Besides, this movement cannot, and will not receive any sympathy from
                        abroad, in so far as it is intended to help the people of the border
                        counties. In other parts of our own State, we are regarded as cowards.-Hear
                        what the <emph rend="italic">Philadelphia Evening Telegraph</emph>, one of
                        the most intensely radical papers in the State, speaking of this letter,
                        says: </p>
                    <p>"He thus declares himself in favor of limited confiscation, in order that the
                        farmers of "Bedford, Fulton, Franklin, Cumberland, and York" may be
                        reimbursed for the loss inflicted by the Rebel invaders. If there is no
                        better ground for confiscation than to repay the cowardly semi-disloyal
                        farmers of the counties named, who charged our soldiers for a cup of milk
                        and fled from or tampered with the Rebels, we do not favor confiscation. We
                        have no sympathy to waste on such losers. The State has already reimbursed
                        all deserving, and many who were not deserving; so that if the Aiken and
                        Hampton estates are not reduced for any other purpose, we think they might
                        as well remain with their Rebel owners. It may be that confiscation will be
                        necessary as a punishment for continued contumacy. It may be that it will be
                        needed to yet further humble the spirit of the late Rebels. But it can never
                        be that it will be enforced to repay the Pennsylvania farmers for losses
                        suffered years ago, and already once paid by the State."</p>
                    <p>The truth is, it is all a mere sham-a deliberate Scheme planned for political
                        effect. It does not contemplate the procurement of a single cent for our
                        losses. It is an effort to obtain our votes for these men under pretence
                        that they will enforce confiscation and that we will be repaid in that way.
                        Our people are not ready for this-they are unwilling to accept compensation
                        in this way-and we imagine that whenever an opportunity offers (which we
                        fear will never present itself) they will brand Mr. McConaughy with that
                        condemnation which he so richly merits.</p>

                    <p>CHARLESTOWN, Va.: June, 1867.</p>
                    <p>Messers. Editors:--We have taken a trip up the Shenandoah Valley to see how
                        matters stood in that historic region. We observed everywhere in our route
                        evidence of recuperative energy and a cheerful go-ahead-ativeness. The
                        common complaint in the Shenandoah is, scarcity of the circulating medium;
                        and farmers and business men are compelled to dispense with its use to a
                        great extent. The farmer pays for his labor with wheat, corn, wood,
                        &amp;c.-So also for merchandise. Of course, this is a great drawback to
                        all business, but the people get along and appear as cheerful as can. The
                        good people have lost none of the hospitality for which they have heretofore
                        been distinguished.</p>
                    <p>Nothing strikes one so forcibly as the readiness with which the heroic people
                        of this valley adapt themselves to the new order of things. It might
                        naturally be supposed that, having been robbed so suddenly of their domestic
                        help they would be unwilling to undergo the additional labor of entertaining
                        company. Such, however, is not the case. On stopping at the house of an old
                        acquaintance and finding their household servants had left them, I proposed
                        to continue on to the next town.-"Not on that account," said the good lady.
                        "I can cook as well as any servant I ever had, and am not afraid to do it, I
                        sometimes feel surprised that I ever was satisfied with the trouble and
                        expense attendind the old slave labor."</p>
                    <p>Such buoyancy of spirit under circumstances so changed is certainly
                        refreshing. Among that portion of the people who are in the habit of
                        noticing political events a feeling of misgiving is apparent, and but little
                        disposition to attend to anything outside their occupations is shown. In
                        fact like all unpleasant subjects it is seldom referred to. It is not
                        strange that apathy and disgust should everywhere prevail in the out-lawed
                        States. The everlasting nigger holds sway throughout the South.</p>
                    <p>In every community, there is a class of men whose wealth, intelligence, and
                        moral worth give them a controlling influence.-If a difficulty occurs
                        between neighbors, they are appealed to for advice; if sickness or calamity
                        befall the poor their humanity is appealed to for succor; or, if a
                        responsible office is to be filled, they are selected as being most capable.
                        This was the case here once-not so now. This class is set aside entirely,
                        except that they are still looked to to pay all the taxes. The lower class
                        of northern adventurers fill the offices, and direct and control the
                        machinery of government. The way some of these gentry acquit themselves of
                        these important trusts may be judged from a case I will instance.</p>
                    <p>In the town of Martinsburg a northern man made his appearance, formed the
                        acquaintance of some of the radicals who control affairs, and was forthwith
                        elected magistrate; and in addition to the aforesaid important trust he was
                        also made clerk to the board of Supervisors. This board issued $18,000 in
                        County bonds, as county money, whilst this Mr. Aaron Burr Steinmetz, was
                        their clerk. Mr. Steinmetz thought it would not be a bad plan to issue a few
                        on his own hook; and accordingly issued, and put in circulation about
                        $15,000 more. These were, of course, forgeries.-He is now in jail awaiting
                        trial. Who can be witness to such a State of things without indignation and
                        disgust?</p>
                    <p>The horse thief, the beggar and the nigger hold the reins. Will not there be
                        a merry drive? The machine is bound, through this bad and reckless driving
                        to be run in the mire; when is it to be hoped a new set of drivers will be
                        looked for. It is for this reason discreet people avoid the coach and take
                        it afoot, (just as the people of Horse Valley shun the Jackstown stage
                        coach.)</p>
                    <p>The wheat promises a heavy yield throughout the Shenandoah Valley, the avails
                        of which will greatly relieve the pecuniary embarrassment of the farmers of
                        the Valley.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Taylor, of your place, and formerly sheriff, has purchased a farm in this
                        county, and adjoining the land of your correspondent. He paid $60 per acre
                        and has undoubtedly made a good purchase. He takes possession of the 13th
                        proximo. Jefferson and Berkeley are being rapidly settled by New Yorkers and
                        Pennsylvanians. I am happy to say the Pennsylvanians are considered the best
                        farmers. The people here cherish unbounded faith in the low heavy-set
                        Dutchmen, with broad brim, and short, square coat-tail, as cultivators of
                        the soil; and they are received with open arms in a lasting embrace. The
                        Berks county men are generally preferred as, staunch Democrats, and
                        entertain innocent ideas of lager and saur kraut.</p>
                    <p>A good joke is told of an old Dutchman from Berks county who paid the entire
                        purchase money $80,000 down. The old man carried the money with him; and
                        where do you suppose he carried it?-nicely padded in the capacious seat of
                        his breeches!</p>
