                <transcript>
                    <p>A general war with the Indians on the plains seems impending and we have the
                        Radical Congress to thank for this additional calamity to the country. The
                        War Department desired the whole management of Indian affairs placed in its
                        hands, but the Rumps flatly told Mr. Secretary Stanton to make no such
                        pretensions. Congress would manage the War Department, Executive Department,
                        and every other department of the Government with the Negroes and Indians
                        thrown in to boot, on the most approved Radical principles. This extensive
                        programme they have made the most strenuous and unscrupulous efforts to
                        carry out and a pretty fist they have made of it. Their attempt to impeach
                        the President ended in a ridiculous farce. Their Military Rule in the South
                        is making "confusion worse confounded" in that section. Their love for the
                        negro has ruined the "intelligent contraband" body and soul, and now "lo!
                        the poor Indian" must fall under the blighting curse of Radicalism. If the
                        War Department had obtained sole control of Indian affairs, who does not
                        believe war would have been avoided-the Indians continue their friendly
                        relations and trade with the whites-thousands of lives saved and millions of
                        dollars remain unexpended in the treasury. The Radicals were not content
                        with a state of quietness and prosperity for the country like this. Their
                        natural element is strife and bloodshed and out of it they cannot exist.
                        They must have a little more "blood-letting" and a few more "army contracts"
                        to make them supremely happy.</p>
                    <p>The first step in the Radical programme in the Indian War is to get the
                        regular army out of the way. This they are silly enough to expect to
                        accomplish by tirades of abuse, through the newspapers, on the Generals
                        commanding in the Indian country, and by advocating a system of guerilla
                        warfare by the settlers in which the Indians are to massacred without mercy
                        and their goods and lands confiscated to their murderers.-Congress would be
                        expected to pay the claims, and their numbers would be legion, <emph
                            rend="italic">for repelling Indian invasions</emph> for the next quarter
                        of a century. An Indian War once started is not easily arrested, as we found
                        by said experience in the Florida War, and the Radicals would manage to
                        irritate the Indians and keep up their War so long as money could be made
                        out of it. This is the way Congress would use the Indians for the benefit of
                        its Radical friends, and it is why Territorial Governors and Newspaper
                        Generals are so ready to take the field and "kill dead Indians." </p>

                <head>The Coming Crops Of This Country</head>
                <origin>Age</origin>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>There is no subject in which all classes of our citizens are more immediately
                        interested than that of the coming crops of this nation. All have felt the
                        effects of the short yield of last year, and are hoping to obtain cheaper
                        bread and other articles of food during 1867. It matters little how much the
                        toiler can earn, if the price of food increases in a larger percentage than
                        his compensation. He may keep hunger from the door while health permits by
                        constant exertions, but nothing can be stored for sickness, old age, or the
                        thousand casualties which surround the pathway of all.-It is such
                        reflections as these that make people tremblingly alive to all reports with
                        reference to the crops, and induce a feeling of gratitude at the
                        announcement that in all parts of the Union the signs of a plentiful harvest
                        are abundant and unmistakable.</p>
                    <p>The wheat crop of 1866 was stated by the Agricultural Bureau at 151,999,906
                        bushels valued at $333,773, 646. That of this year promises to be much
                        larger. In all parts of this State the number of acres planted in wheat
                        exceeds by one-third that of last season, and the heavy yield is most
                        encouraging. The straw is not too rank, the head is well developed for the
                        season, and the chances of exemption from rust and fly excellent. In the
                        limestone sections of the State the wheat have never looked better. From New
                        York the same gratifying intelligence is transmitted through the press, and
                        the farmers of that State are preparing for such a return of wheat for the
                        amount sown as they have rarely, if ever, harvested. The rich lands of that
                        State are groaning under the weight of the coming wheat harvest.-From the
                        West the reports are decidedly cheering in this particular. In Ohio the
                        wheat is out of danger, and it never looked better. The crop will be
                        immense. The weather we are now experiencing will push the grain forward
                        with great rapidity, and altogether the prospects were never more favorable
                        for a full yield from that State.-Those familiar with agricultural affairs
                        in Indiana say that fully one hundred per cent. more of wheat will be
                        garnered in that State this year than last. This is good news from Indiana.
                        The same may, with truth and accuracy, be said of Illinois. The fall and
                        spring crops of Michigan promise a bountiful yield. The Hon. Mason Crouch,
                        of Nebraska, a resident of that section for ten years, says that the wheat
                        and other cereals never looked better, and that there will certainly be a
                        large crop. In Minnesota the area of land put in wheat, this year, is nearly
                        or quite four times that of last, and the return is estimated at over
                        fifteen millions of bushels.</p>
                    <p>Our Southern exchanges announce that in those States the yield of wheat is
                        good. In South Carolina the crop will be the largest ever known. The rice
                        crop is looking well. It is somewhat grassy and weedy on account of the
                        difficulty which yet attends to the management of the freedmen, but the
                        prospects are generally good. The area of land in cotton this season is said
                        to be greater than last year, and a fair return is anticipated. From the Sea
                        Island cotton region, we have only moderate accounts as to the prospects. A
                        cold, wet spring has don some injury to the plants, but they may recover.</p>
                    <p>The hay and corn crop also promise large additions to those of last year. The
                        hay crop of 1860 in the United States was put down in the census at a little
                        over 19,000,000 tons, that of 1866, by the Agricultural Bureau, at
                        21,778,627 tons, valued at $317,561,837; but the yield for the present year
                        is estimated at 30,000,000 tons. The yield of Indian corn for last year is
                        given at 867,946,295 bushels, valued at $591,666,295.-For this year the
                        promise, it is said, exceeds 1,200,000,000. These are certainly cheering
                        indications, and if realized in the shape of active facts, will fill the
                        hearts of millions of people with joy and gladness.-With a full harvest and
                        reconstruction on the basis of the Constitution, the country would soon
                        emerge from under the cloud by which it is overshadowed, and resume its
                        march toward a pinnacle of greatness unheard of in the history of any nation
                        that ever existed.-<emph rend="italic">Age </emph></p>

                        the 11th day of June, 1867.</p>
                    <p>We, the delegates of the Democratic party of Pennsylvania in general State
                        Convention assembled, for the nomination of a candidate for Judge of the
                        Supreme Court, profoundly grateful to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for
                        the return of peace to our beloved country, but deeply anxious on account of
                        the trials and delays which impede the complete restoration and re-union of
                        all the State, and appreciating the dangers which still threaten the safety
                        of our political institutions, and the future peace, liberty and prosperity
                        of the people, resolve,</p>
                    <p>1. That we steadfastly adhere to the principles of civil government
                        established by the founders of the Union; and in the present conflict of
                        legislative usurpation with constitutional law, we esteem a wise upright and
                        fearless judiciary the great bulwark of public liberty and individual right.</p>
                    <p>2. That the Union of the States is perpetual, and the Federal Government
                        supreme within its constitutional limits.</p>
                    <p>3. That Representation in the Congress of the United States, and in the
                        electoral college, is a right fundamental and indestructible in its nature
                        and abiding in every State, being a duty as well as a right pertaining to
                        the people of every State and essential to our Republican system of
                        Government. Its denial is the destruction of the Government itself.</p>
                    <p>4. Each State having under the Constitution the exclusive right to prescribe
                        the qualifications of its own electors, we proclaim as a usurpation and
                        outrage the establishment of negro suffrage in any of the States by the
                        coercive exercise of Federal power; and we shall resist to the last resort
                        the threatened measures of the leaders of the Republican party to interfere
                        by acts of Congress with the regulation of the elective franchise in the
                        State of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>5. That we are opposed to any amendment of the Constitution of the State
                        giving to negroes the right of suffrage.</p>
                    <p>6. That the failure of the Tariff Bill in the last session of the late
                        Congress, more than three-fourths of whose members belonged to the
                        Republican party, is an illustration of their infidelity to their pledges
                        and their neglect of their professions in relation to the great industrial
                        and financial interests of the country.</p>
                    <p>7. That the Radical majority in Congress, and those who sustain them, have
                        overthrown the Constitution, dismembered the Federal Union and subverted
                        republican government by a long series of usurpations, among which are the
                        following: Their denial of the right of States of the Union to
                        representation in Congress.</p>
                    <p>Their treatment of ten States as subjugated provinces, and governing them by
                        military force in time of peace.</p>
                    <p>Their enactment of laws denying indemnity for arrests and false imprisonments
                        made without authority of law.</p>
                    <p>Their resistance of the authority of the civil tribunals, and their overthrow
                        by the substitution of military commissions for the trial of undefined
                        offenses.</p>
                    <p>Their efforts to destroy the executive and judicial departments of the
                        Government by threatened impeachment to control executive action, and a
                        projected "remodeling" of the Supreme Court of the United States to force
                        obedience to congressional mandates.</p>
                    <p>Their ejection from their seats in the Federal Senate and House, of members
                        duly and legally chosen.</p>
                    <p>That the purpose of confiscation avowed by the Republican leaders, in
                        violation of the Declaration of Rights and other guarantees of the Federal
                        and State Constitutions, tending as it does, to destroy all protection to
                        private property, advances them far on the high road to repudiation.</p>
                    <p>8. That a strict conformity, both by the Federal and State Governments, to
                        all the powers, restrictions and guarantees, as contained in the
                        Constitution of the United States, a rigid and wise economy in the
                        administration of public affairs, and the celebration of capable honest and
                        patriotic men to office, are measures absolutely necessary to restore public
                        confidence, avert national bankruptcy, and to ensure the perpetuity of our
                        free institutions.</p>
                    <p>9. That the late Republican Legislature of this State has distinguished
                        itself for the number of its unwise and unconstitutional enactments. Some of
                        these laws have already been judicially determined to be unconstitutional,
                        others are unwise, inexpedient, oppressive and fanatical, and the members
                        who sustained them should be condemned by the people at the polls.</p>
                    <p>10. That the power and success of the Democratic party greatly depends on the
                        character and efficiency of its newspaper press, and that to give full force
                        to its usefulness, this Convention earnestly requests that in every county
                        all the members of the Democratic party should make a vigorous effort to
                        increases circulation by giving it individual patronage and support.</p>
                    <p>11. That the Democracy of Pennsylvania, by their representatives now
                        assembledl, hereby tender their acknowledgements and thanks to the Hon.
                        George W. Woodward in his retirement from the position of Chief Justice of
                        this Commonwealth, for the pure, faithful and able manner in which he
                        discharged the duties of the exalted position.</p>
                    <p>12. That the candidate we this day present to the people of Pennsylvania for
                        a place on the Supreme Bench of the State, is in all respects worthy of that
                        confidence and support of all who are in favor of an enlightened, faithful
                        and impartial administration of the laws.</p>
