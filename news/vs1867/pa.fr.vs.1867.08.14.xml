				<head>Gen. Meem's Property</head>
				<origin>Harrisonburg Register</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>To show what some of our extensive landholders in the Valley are doing to
						reconstruct the country, notwithstanding the sudden and violent disruption
						of our system of labor, we would refer to the management of that splendid
						estate, known as "the Steenbergen property," owned by John G. Meem, Esq., of
						Lynchburg, Va. This estate now comprises near 5,000 acres, lying in the very
						heart of the great Valley, on both sides of the road, between the villages
						of New Market and Mt. Jackson in Shenondoah. Of this magnificent landed
						possession there are 2,500 acres cleared, 1,125 of which is river and creek
						bottom, and the balance wood and pasture land. The very large body of level
						lowland on this farm, (or farms rather, for there are two estates now
						combined under one control,) is remarkable for its productive capacity.
						Notwithstanding the property was ravaged during the war, and miles upon
						miles of its extensive fencing destroyed by the troops who passed through
						and encamped upon it, yet the hand of the reconstructive power is distinctly
						visible in every part of the estate. Not less than 120,000 rails have been
						split, hauled out, and put up, thus securing the crops from the intrusion of
						stock of all kinds.-With the scanty and uncertain labor at command since the
						war, the intelligent managers of the farms-Gen. Gilbert S. and Col. John G.
						Meems jr., brothers-have been able to put out and cut this year, 300 acres
						of wheat, producing 18 or 20 bushels to the acre; 50 acres of oats; 200
						acres of timothy meadow, making 280 or 300 tons of hay, and leaving a
						portion of seed; whilst there are 300 acres of corn which is very forward,
						much of it already in tassel, and which will average 50 or 60 bushels to the
						acre. The estate subsists, in addition, 100 head of grazing cattle, and
						1,100-head of sheep, besides a large number of hogs. Mr. Meem takes a just
						pride in having the very best breeds of animals upoo his estate, and
						therefore spares on expense in their procurement.-The labor on the farm this
						year will cost about $6,000. The Woods' and McCormick's Reapers and Mowers
						were both at work on the farm, both giving the utmost satisfaction.</p>
					<p>The foregoing facts and figures show what is being done by some of our
						intelligent and energetic Shenandoah Valley farmers, who are engaged, in the
						face of great difficulties, in re-constructing their shattered fortunes.
						This year's work is not as good as was done before the war, nor as extensive
						as the work marked out on the programme for the coming year, the Messrs.
						Meem intending to put out from 550 to 600 acres in wheat this Fall.</p>
					<p>Nor is the labor of cultivating their lands the only work being reformed on
						this estate. A new circular saw-mill is in operation, which is turning out
						lumber and shingles in great abundance for the improvement of the farms. A
						new, extensive and beautiful barn, with modern improvements, occupying the
						site of the barn which was destroyed by fire after the war was over, has
						gone up on the Mt. Airy portion of the estate, under the direction of Col.
						Meem, jr., whilst stabling and other buildings have been erected on the
						Locust Grove farm, under the supervision of Gen. G. S. Meem.-Other
						improvements are being projected and will be pushed actively forward.</p>
					<p>The prospect of the very early re-construction of the Manassas Gap railroad
						to Mt. Jackson, (no longer now, we believe, a matter of doubt or
						uncertainty,) is stimulating the spirit of improvement immensely.
						Heretofore, the ordinary means of transportation have been entirely
						inadequate to carry off the resources of this celebrated landed estate
						second to none in the South or in the United States in point of productive
						capacity. It has not been favored, either, with any sort of system of
						manuring. In fact, the present year's crops of wheat, oats, grass and corn
						have had the advantage of no manure whatever, the labor rendered necessary
						by the ravages of the war making it difficult to do more than get up the
						ordinary fencing.</p>
					<p>A part of this property was purchased by Mr. Meem in 1841, the balance at
						different periods since the last-the 'Rude's Hill' portion-in November,
						1865. Mr. M. was born in Winchester, in the lower Valley, but has resided in
						Lynchburg for the last 49 or 50 years, where he has carried on business as a
						merchant and earned a reputation for honor and integrity of which any
						gentleman might be proud.</p>
					<p>The Mt. Airy homestead, the residence of Mr. Steenbergen in the days of his
						prosperity and extensive cattle and bank operations, is the seat of a
						refined and princely hospitality which does credit to the tastes of the
						liberal-minded old Virginia gentleman and his son into whose possessions it
						has passed.-<emph rend="italic">Harrisburg Register</emph>. </p>

				<head>Truths For Wives</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>In domestic happiness, the wife's influence is much greater than her
						husband's for the one, the first cause-mutual love and confidence-being
						granted, the whole comfort of the household depends upon trifles more
						immediately under her jurisdiction. By her management of small sums, her
						husband's respectability and credit are created or destroyed. No fortune can
						stand the constant leakages of extravagance and mismanagement-and more is
						spent in trifles than women would easily believe. The one great expense,
						whatever it may be, is turned over and carefully reflected on, and the
						income is prepared to meet it; but it is pennies imperceptibly sliding away
						which do mischief; and this the wife alone can stop, for it does not come
						within man's province. There is often an unsuspected trifle to be saved in
						every household.</p>
					<p>It is not in economy alone that the wife's attention is so necessary, but in
						those niceties which make a well regulated house.-An unfurnished
						cruet-stand, a missing key, a buttonless shirt, a soiled table-cloth, a
						mustard-pot with its old, cold contents shaking down about it, are really
						nothings; but each can raise an angry word and cause discomfort. Depend upon
						it, there is a great deal of domestic happiness about a well dressed mutton
						chop, or a tidy breakfast table. Men grow sated of beauty, tired of music,
						are often too weary for conversation, however intellectual; but they can
						always appreciate a well kept hearth and smiling comfort.</p>
					<p>A woman may love her husband devotedly-may sacrifice fortune, friends,
						family, country, for him-she may have the genius of a Sappho, the enchanted
						beauties of an Armida, but-melancholy fact-if with these she fails to make
						his home comfortable, his heart will inevitably escape her-And women live so
						entirely in the affections that without love their existence is void.-Better
						submit, then, to household tasks, however repugnant they may be to your
						tastes, than doom yourself to a loveless home. Women of a higher order of
						mind will not run this risk; they know that the feminine, their domestic,
						are their first duties.</p>

				<head>Negro Suffrage In Pennsylvania</head>
				<origin>Harrisburg Telegraph</origin>
				<commentary>"The <emph rend="italic">Harrisburg Telegraph</emph>, the central organ
					of the Republican party in Pennsylvania, comes out squarely in favor of negro
					suffrage in this and all the other Northern States, but it has not the honesty
					or manliness to advocate its submission to a vote of the people of the States to
					be effected thereby. It evidently fears the people, for it says "it is a
					question which, if debated, State by State, must arouse all the old and buried
					prejudices of the vulgar and ignorant." Hence to get around the prejudices of
					the people whom it designates as "<emph rend="italic">vulgar and
					ignorant</emph>," it calls upon Congress to do it by <emph rend="italic"
						>usurpation </emph> that which it fears the people of Pennsylvania and other
					Northern States would <emph rend="italic">not </emph> do, if left <emph
						rend="italic">free </emph> to act for themselves in the matter. It wants
					Congress to <emph rend="italic">force </emph> negro suffrage upon the several
					States in open and flagrant violation of the Constitution. Hear it:"</commentary>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Congress, unquestionably, is the proper power for defining the rights of the
							<emph rend="italic">blackman to the elective franchise in the several
							States</emph>. Congress, in order to promote harmony of action in
						political contests and do away with the unjust discriminations which are
						practiced by the States on this subject, should at its next session act upon
						its unquestionable Constitutional authority by adjusting this vexed question
						throughout the nation </p>
					<p>At the session of Congress last spring, Mr. Sumner introduced a bill in the
						Senate providing for the adjustment of the franchise question in the several
						States. There is no doubt whatever that Congress, when it meets next
						November, will pass at an early day a general act, applying to the whole
						country, and establishing throughout the nation the right of all American
						citizens to vote, without any exclusion on account of <emph rend="italic"
							>complexion </emph>. </p>
					<p>There is no more clearly defined right inhering in the States than that of
						regulating the elective franchise. And yet the <emph rend="italic">Tele-
							graph</emph> has the supreme audacity to claim that "Congress is the
						proper power for defining the rights of the <emph rend="italic">black
						man</emph> to the elective franchise in the several States."-Ah! yes, it is
						the "black man" that is the all and in all with these political charlatans.
						Nobody ever dreamed that this power was in Congress until it was found
						necessary to enfranchise the negro in order to perpetuate the power of the
						Radical party. </p>
					<p>Will the <emph rend="italic">Telegraph </emph> inform us in what clause of
						the Constitution it finds the power delegated to Congress "for defining the
						rights of the <emph rend="italic">black man</emph> to the elective
						franchise?" If the power exists it can easily be pointed out. </p>
					<p>Congress has no semblance of such power, but we have no doubt that the power
						will be <emph rend="italic">assumed </emph> by a corrupt and unscrupulous
						Congress at its next meeting, as predicted and urged by the <emph
							rend="italic">Telegraph </emph>, unless the <emph rend="italic">people
						</emph> speak out in thunder tones against the usurpers, who are striving
						step by step, to overthrow our constitutional form of government. We warn
						the people of Pennsylvania that if they would not be slaves to a Radical
						Rump Congress-if they would have a remnant of liberty for themselves and
						posterity they must be up and doing. If they would not have negro suffrage
						and negro equality thrust upon them without their consent, by the illegal
						mandate of an unconstitutional Congress, they must arouse to action at once.
						Let the people rally as one man in <emph rend="italic">defence </emph> of
						the sacred guarantees of the Constitution and the reserved rights of the
						States. </p>

				<transcript>
					<p>CLEARFIELD, Pa., Aug. 7, 1867.</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">To the People of Pennsylvania</emph>: </p>
					<p>The Democratic organization, devoted to the maintenance of its immortal
						principles; conscious of its duties to them, and to the Republic; proud of
						its years, its triumphs and its heroism in disaster, and remembering that in
						the face of persecution, of official frowns, of corrupt appliances and of
						successive defeats, its numbers have steadily increased; again presents to
						you its candidate for your suffrages.</p>
					<p>The Republican party has controlled the government for six years, and we
						accuse it before you, because:</p>
					<p>In the sacred name of Union, it has perpetrated disunion;</p>
					<p>In the room of the blessings of peace, it has given us hate, discord and
						misery;</p>
					<p>It has violated the plainest principles of free government, broken the
						written Constitution, and only yielded obedience to the behests of party;</p>
					<p>The people are denied the attribute of sovereignty; the military subverts the
						civil power; generals remove governors elected by the people, and a
						despotism reigns in ten States;</p>
					<p>Congress assumes the right to say that negroes shall vote in Pennsylvania,
						and denies to us the right to regulate our own rule of suffrage;</p>
					<p>The negro is, by law, made the equal of the white man in all public places,
						and authorized to hold office and sit on juries in the Capital;</p>
					<p>The destinies of ten States, and of ten millions of people therein, are, by
						Congress and the military power, placed under the control of four millions
						of blacks;</p>
					<p>Their reckless expenditure of the public money in their conduct of the
						government in the support and organization of hundreds of thousands of idle
						negroes, in the employment of hordes of unnecessary spies and officials, and
						in maintaining military power over the submissive South, endangers and
						delays the payment of the public debt of twenty-seven hundred millions of
						dollars-to which the public faith is pledged;</p>
					<p>Their gross mismanagement causes taxation to bear heavily upon the people. In
						1866, fourteen dollars per head were paid by the people through the customs;
						in 1866, fourteen dollars per head were drawn, mainly from the consumption
						and business of the poorer classes, through the customs and internal
						revenue. In 1866, each individual owed two dollars and six cents of the
						public debt. In 1867, each owes seventy-nine dollars and fifty cents
						thereof. In 1860, the expenses of the government were sixty-two millions; in
						1867, each owes seventy-nine dollars and fifty cents thereof. In 1860, the
						expenses of the government were sixty-two millions; in 1867, the Treasury
						estimates them at two hundred and twenty-five millions, <emph rend="italic"
							>independent of interest on the debt, both being periods of
						peace</emph>. Pennsylvania's share of the public debt is two hundred and
						seventy-five millions, her own debt thirty-five millions and a half
						millions, and her city and county indebtedness will swell the total to four
						hundred millions. Twenty-five millions annually come from your earnings to
						pay the interest thereon. In 1866, your State government cost you four
						hundred and two thousand dollars; whilst in 1896, it cost you six hundred
						and sixty-nine thousand dollars. </p>
					<p>The pressure of these exhausting burthens and the suicidal policy of
						Congress, have caused uncertainty and depression to pervade all branches of
						trade and manufacture;</p>
					<p>Our commerce is suffering, the enterprise of our people is repressed and
						business interests languish:</p>
					<p>The revenues of the government are less than its interest and expenses, and
						the financial officer foreshadows an increase of the public debt;</p>
					<p>They plot the destruction of our form of government, by destroying the
						independence of the Executive, attempting to subordinate the judiciary and
						by concentrating all power in the legislative branch;</p>
					<p>Robbing the people of sovereign power, they have united it with the
						government in Congress, and dealt a fatal blow at our liberties, for tyranny
						may be as absolute in a number of persons as in an individual.</p>
					<p>Unblushing corruption stalks through every department of the Government under
						their control.</p>
					<p>For these and kindred wrongs we arraign them, and as the representative of
						antagonism to each of them, we present to you our candidate for the Supreme
						Bench;</p>
					<p>GEORGE SHEARSWOOD-a Pennsylvania, a man of pure morals, a profound thinker, a
						sound lawyer and a jurist of national reputation. It has been the rule of
						his official conduct to yield obedience to written law, and neither party
						necessity nor corrupting influence can sway him from his duty to fearlessly
						proclaim it.</p>
					<p>His opponent, Henry W. Williams, is a native of New England, and is
						comparatively unknown to our people. Prior to his nomination he was said to
						be a worthy gentleman and a able lawyer. He has accepted the nomination upon
						a platform by which he is pledged "TO PLACE THE SUPREME COURT IN HARMONY
						WITH THE POLITICAL OPINIONS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE." This destroys
						his independence and "holds the Judge accountable to a political party for
						his construction of the law, and inevitably tempts him to sacrifice his
						integrity: to become the meanest of all creatures-a sworn minister of
						justice obedient to the dictates of politicians."</p>
					<p>The independent and fearless judge protects your life, your liberty and your
						property. With which of these men will you trust them?</p>
					<p>DEMOCRATS OF PENNSYLVANIA:</p>
					<p>We call upon you to organize in every section of the State. Act for
						yourselves, promptly and vigorously. Wait no for no man. The government you
						love is in danger, its great cardinal doctrines are daily attacked, and
						"treason in peace may prove more deadly than treason in war." Individual
						exertion is the duty every man [CORRECT duty of every man]. Canvass your
						schooldistricts. Form Clubs. Circulate your local papers. Teach the people.
						Counsel with the aged. Encourage the timid. Arouse the sluggish. Stop and go
						to work. The enemy are vulnerable at every point; attack them for their
						misdeeds.</p>
					<p>YOUR PRINCIPLES ARE ETERNAL AND MUST PREVAIL.</p>
					<p>By order of the Democratic State Committee.</p>
					<p>WILLIAM A. WALLACE,</p>
					<p>Chairman.</p>
