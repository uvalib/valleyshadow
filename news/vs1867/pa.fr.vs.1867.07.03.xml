				<head>A Trip Through The Valley Of Virginia</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Last week we briefly noticed the leading points touched on our journey
						through the Valley of Virginia, and promised to make some general
						observations this week on the region of the country through which we passed.
						This we now propose hastily to do.</p>
					<p>The Shenandoah Valley, or more properly the Valley of Virginia, when speaking
						of the whole Valley, is simply an extension southward of our own beautiful
						and fertile Cumberland Valley, and like it, is bounded on the East by the
						Blue Ridge, or South Mountain, as it is called with us, and the North, or
						Blue Mountain, on the West.-Its average with is about the same, ranging say
						from fifteen to thirty miles. The valley from the Potomac to Strasbourg,
						eighteen miles South of Winchester, is something wider than our valley at
						Chambersburg, but at this point it succenly narrows. Here the Massanutten
						Mountain abruptly begins, piercing the clouds with its rocky summit and
						stretching southward a distance of fifty miles, dividing the main valley, as
						it were, into two that lying between this mountain and the Blue Ridge on the
						East being called the Luray or Page Valley, and that lying West of it being
						a continuation of the Shenandoah Valley. At Port Republic, in Rockingham
						county, this grand old mountain as abruptly disappears as it begins at
						Strasburg, and the valley again suddenly widens stretching again from the
						North, or Blue Mountains on the West, to the Blue Ridge on the East. Near
						Port Republic, the North, Middle and South Rivers form a junction, forming
						what is called the South Branch of the Shenandoah, which then runs around
						the southern end of the Massanutten Mountain into Luray or Page Valley, and
						passing northward through this valley, it unites with the West Branch of the
						Shenandoah in Warren county, near Front Royal, and both together empty into
						the Potomac at Harpers Ferry. These two streams drain the Valley from beyond
						Staunton to the Potomac. The Valley of Virginia is a finely watered country,
						particularly portions of it. We think it excels our own valley in this
						respect. It abounds in fine springs and rivulets. In travelling from
						Winchester to Harrisonburg you pass a fresh water brook every half mile or
						so, wending its way quietly to the Shenandoah. This is an incalculable
						advantage to a farming and grazing country.</p>
					<p>The land in this valley corresponds very nearly in character with the land in
						the Cumberland Valley, being mostly limestone formation interlarded with
						slate hills. As a general thing the county is more rolling than it is with
						us, corresponding in this respect more nearly with the limestone land in
						Westmoreland county, and in this State, though in parts of Berkeley,
						Frederick, Clark and Jefferson counties you find some as level land as is to
						be found in the Cumberland Valley. The farms are generally much larger than
						with us, comprising frequently from five hundred to one thousand acres, and
						in some cases still more, in consequence of which much of the land in
						Virginia is badly tilled. There is everywhere an absence of that appearance
						of neatness and thrift which you witness in Pennsylvania, and the large
						barns, neat farm houses and white-washed fences enclosing the yards with
						which our agricultural regions are studded over, are seldom to be seen in
						Virginia. Their farm houses are rarely built near a public road, as is the
						custom in Pennsylvania. Retirement seems to have been the ruling motive with
						Virginians in selecting sites for their residences which we are compelled to
						say we rather admire. We think it entirely preferable to being stuck hard by
						a dusty road to be constantly annoyed by the noise and confusion of a public
						thoroughfare. Their houses being set back from the main road usually have
						large grounds attached beautifully shaded with forest trees and ornamented
						with shrubbery and flour [CORRECT flower] gardens, making their homes most
						attractive to an admirer of the simple beauties of nature.</p>
					<p>The finest farm of the Valley of Virginia is said to be that of General Moem,
						beginning about two miles beyound Mount Jackson in Shenandoah County, lying
						on both sides of the turnpike road and stretching along the Shenandoah River
						for several miles, comprising about four thousand eight hundred acres, all
						the best quality of limestone land and river bottom. The hundreds of acres
						of golden grain waving in the sunshine on either side of the road, belonging
						this estate, stretching either way almost as far as the eye could reach,
						presented a scene to our view as we passed along truly grand and beautiful.
						This mammoth and magnificent farm seems to be in a high state of
						cultivation, or else the land is unusually fertile, for we never saw finer
						wheat grow than we saw there. The buildings are situated about half a mile
						east of the turnpike up towards the base of the Massanutten mountain, on an
						elevated point from which it is said the owner can view every foot of his
						possessions. He maintains an elegant establishment and entertains his
						friends, who visit him, in the most magnificent style.</p>
					<p>The price of land in the Valley of Virginia varies from fifteen to one
						hundred dollars per acre. Some choice of farms would bring even a higher
						figure than the latter, and some very inferior lands might be bought for
						even a less price that the former. The best improved and best cultivated
						farms, as a general rule, are not in the market. But there is a great deal
						of land for sale in the valley, and good limestone land, in a low state of
						cultivation and without improvements, can be bought for forty dollars per
						acre, and upwards, which, in the hand of Pennsylvania farmers, would soon be
						transformed into first-class farms worth one hundred dollars per acre. In
						our judgement, those of our farmers who desire to change their location
						cannot do better than to go to Virginia to invest in real estate.-The native
						Virginians express an anxious desire to see their surplus lands settled and
						improved by practical Pennsylvania farmers and this class of emigrants would
						be welcomed by them with open arms and treated in the most kindly manner.</p>
					<p>The track of desolation made by the hostile armies during the late terrible
						civil war is still plainly visible all through the Valley of Virginia. The
						blackened walls of former mills and barns, the <emph rend="italic">debris
						</emph> of what were once palatial residences meet the eye of the traveler
						on every side on the route over which we journeyed. Perhaps no portion of
						the country suffered more from the ravages of war than this famous valley.
						It being the key to the military situation between the two great contending
						armies in the east, it was made the stamping ground for both armies. It was
						here that Sheridan-"Cavalry Sheridan"-boasted of having burned <emph
							rend="italic">two thousand barns</emph> in a single night, whose charred
						walls remain standing to this day as monuments of infamy to his name and as
						a disgrace to American warfare. Great as was the vandalism of McCausland in
						burning the town of Chambersburg, for which his name has ever been execrated
						by us, it was far outstripped by the vandalism of Sheridan in the Shenandoah
						Valley. One of his aids was shot a few miles above Harrisonburg by some
						unknown person, in retaliation for which he ordered all the houses and barns
						to be burned within a radius of five miles, thus visiting the sin of one
						guilty person upon the heads of hundreds of innocent ones, including many
						helpless women and children. The testimony of the citizens of Harrisonburg
						and Staunton was concurrent that on a certain night in 1864, during
						Sheridan's administration in the valley, the whole valley between the two
						places-a distance of twenty-five miles-was illuminated from mountain to
						mountain by the blaze of burning buildings. He left but two mills standing
						in that part of the Valley lying west of the Massanutten mountain, embracing
						the whole of Shenandoah and part of Rockingham counties, and the people of
						that region were, for some time, with difficulty kept from actual
						starvation. We have admired the brilliant exploits of Sheridan upon the
						actual field of battle, but his wanton destruction of private property and
						inhuman warfare upon non-combatants in the Valley of Virginia must forever
						stand to the disgrace of his name and be condemned by all right thinking
						people. Sheridan and McCausland are two names to fit and be linked together
						in history, and they should, and doubtless will go down to posterity as the
						two greatest vandals of their day. </p>
					<p>But the most complete specimen of vandalism witnessed on our trip was at
						Winchester in the site of what once was the residence of Jas. M. Mason, a
						Senator in the U. S. Congress at the breaking out of the war. Mr. Mason had
						a handsome residence located on a small eminence immediately adjoining the
						town, with elegant and beautifully ornamented grounds attached. It will
						scarcely be believed when we tell our readers that all that is left of this
						once handsome private residence is a bleak, barren hill, an exposed common,
						without even a fence, stone or shrub upon it to mark its former grandeur.
						The Federal soldiers when they arrived at the place in the summer of 1861
						tore down the house from turret to foundation and totally destroyed all the
						surroundings. They even tore up the foundation stones and carried them away
						in order that the destruction should be complete. The Medical University
						located on an adjoining hill, in which the bodies of some of the
						confederates of John Brown were dissected ed, shared the same fate.</p>
					<p>Everywhere along our route we found the people of Virginia quietly engaged in
						their legitimate pursuits, manfully struggling to rebuild their waste places
						and regain their lost fortunes. We found the farmer in his fields, the
						merchant in his store and all toiling energetically for a lifting, and
						perchance to secure themselves and families against future privations and
						want. A more quiet, peaceable and orderly people is no where to be found. It
						was frequently remarked ironically by one or the other of our party, as we
						journeied along from day to day and witnessed the farmers plowing their corn
						and rebuilding their fences, with other evidences of peaceful and honest
						industry, that we now saw the great need of a military despotism to keep in
						subjection these rebellious people who thus persist in showing their
						hostility to the "best government the sun ever shone upon" by peaceably
						pursuing their lawful callings. To have seen these people as we saw them
						would, we think, have caused the heart of the most hardened and vindictive
						Radical in the land to relent. We saw no quarrel, no exhibition of bad
						feeling, not even a drunken man on all our journey, which is more than could
						be said, we opine, after travelling over the same extent of country in the
						North. Neither did we hear a single expression of hostility against the
						Union or the Government of the United States. They acknowledge themselves
						whipped, and the cause for which they toook up arms as lost finally and
						forever; and express an earnest desire to be speedily restored to their old
						relations in the Union as the best possible condition for them. Many even
						admit that the attempt to sever their connection with the old Union was a
						grave mistake which would have proved disastrous had it even been
						successful. Not one in a thousand, in our opinion, would renew the attempt
						if they were assured of success. What folly is it not then to argue that it
						would be unsafe to readmit these people into the Union with a full
						restoration of their constitutional rights. It is true, they are opposed to
						the Radical party, which is seeking to humiliate and degrade them by every
						means that partisan hatred or malice can invent. And why should they not be
						opposed to such a party? It is not usual or natural for people to kiss the
						hand that smites them. We should cease to respect them if they were not.-The
						Radical party of the South consists of the negroes, and here and there an
						unprincipled white man who is willing to sell his manhood for filthy lucre's
						sake. We can not imagine a more degraded and contemptible specimen of
						humanity than a Southern Radical. There maybe some excuse for a Northern man
						to be a Radical (and not much either), but for a Southern man there can be
						none. With regard to politics, in a party sense, the people of Virginia may
						be said to be quiescent. The reply of Colonel O'Ferrall, at Staunton, when
						interrogated on the subject, we think may be taken as a tolerably correct
						reflex of the sentiment of Virginia. Said he: "We staked our all upon the
						war, and we lost all. We are patiently waiting to know what is to be done
						with us. Before the war our young men did nothing but sit around on
						store-boxes and talk politics. Now we have gone to work and are putting
						forth all our energies with a view to rebuild our wasted fortunes and
						develope our material resources. In the future we intend to let you people
						of the North talk all the politics. We did more than our share in the past,
						and lost by it." This, we repeat, very nearly reflects the prevailing
						sentiment of Virginia on purely party politics.</p>
					<p>The most amusing incident of the journey occurred at Harrisonburg where Judge
						Kimmell was taken for General Schofield. Our approach was heralded by some
						stage passengers the evening previous who announced that General Schofield
						and staff were stopping over night at New Market. This put the Harrisonburg
						people on the lookout and created some stir when we drove into town the next
						day. We soon undeceived them, however. The Judge didn't seem to appreciate
						the compliment, but on the contrary seemed a little sensitive whenever an
						allusion was made to it. With this incident we bid adieu to our journey for
						the present. H.</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>The Lancaster county "temperance" people (so-called) held a very
						slimly-attended convention at Lancaster on the 26th inst., and formed a
						Union which is to act in subordination to little John Cessna's State
						concern. They declare in their preamble that their object is "to secure the
						enactment and enforcement of a Prohibitory Liquor Law," "and to make the
						continuance of the licensed traffic in intoxicating drinks a political
						issue," They also fulminated the following against the manufacture of
						Bitters, Cordials, and all other medicines which have an alcoholic base or
						vehicle:</p>
					<p>"<emph rend="italic">Resolved </emph>, that we believe it to be our duty to
						warn our friends against the use of the decoctions called bitters, or
						so-called tonics, ander whatever name they may be presented, as delusive and
						dangerous to the user; possessing little or no medicinal properties of
						value, which may not be procured in another form without liability to
						injury, and as an insidious enemy to the individual or family who may be
						seduced into their use." </p>
					<p>The also adopted the following:</p>
					<p>'<emph rend="italic">Resolved </emph>, That we do earnestly recommend all
						friends of temperance to make known their determination not to support for
						office any man who is not willing to use his political power and influence
						in favor of the utter suppression of the traffic in intoxicating drinks in
						our Commonwealth." </p>
					<p>As everyone who spoke in the meeting made it his especial task to attack the
						Democracy, it is clear that none but Radical candidates will receive their
						support, and that every candidate supported by them will be pledged to the
						enactment of a Maine liquor prohibitory law in Pennsylvania.</p>
					<p>The following extract from the harangue of a "Rev. C. I. Thompson," (a
						follower of Thad Stevens, as, in fact, are they all,) will show the <emph
							rend="italic">animus </emph> of the whole so-called prohibitory liquor
						movement in this State.-He said: </p>
					<p>"The anti-slavery party was not so strong until it succeeded in uniting
						itself with one of the great political parties of the country. When
						temperance is fairly brought into politics the power which we seek will be
						general. The men who were the chief advocates of temperance have also been
						the foremost advocates of equal rights, and the head and front of the party
						which destroyed slavery. If you show me a truly earnest temperance man I
						will answer for it, in almost every case, that he is a faithful and honest
						advocate of the political and social equality of all races and classes."</p>
					<p>This is sufficient to show the earnest, conscientious temperance men of the
						country that temperance is to be used as a mere tail to the Radical kite;
						or, rather, as a robe to conceal the infernal corruption of that party, so
						as to enable the negro equality propagandists to continue their plundering
						and arrogant domination over the people. What may thus be gained in
						temperance will be lost ten thousand times over in official corruption and
						public demoralization. The people have already had too much of Radical
						chicanery, and the tying of a live issue to a festering corpse will not win,
						because nobody can be deceived by it.</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>Theoretically it seems to some Northern people a very easy matter to govern
						the South. These are zealots in the cause of liberty. Their notion of the
						perfection of human freedom, says the <emph rend="italic">Journal of
							Commerce</emph>, is in getting the power into the hands to govern the
						race, or the favored portions of it. Then they propose to compel men to be
						free. To establish the gospel of freedom by the strong arm of the law,
						wielded always by themselves. They would meet every possible contingency
						opposed to freedom by enacting and enforcing a new statute. Law after law
						appears on their books. A perfect net-work of law is wound around their
						subjects. Failing to enforce these complications of statutory liberty, they
						fall back on the military, and believe that they can ensure and establish
						free principles, human liberty and equality, and all that sort of thing, by
						administering the law of their own wills at the point of the bayonet. This
						is no exaggerated view of the radical mind. The basis of the present radical
						system is neither more nor less than this: "Our will must be enforced as the
						law of the South for the purpose of establishing human liberty and equality.
						Now this is a heavy job. It is the heaviest work hitherto undertaken by a
						party. It cannot be accomplished. Theoretically it looks easy, but in the
						practice difficulties begin to arise. It seems that a great many negro men
						and women in the South live together in nominal bonds, which have no legal
						nor church sanction. Some of the good emissaries of radicalism shocked at
						this immorality urge on these people to go to clergymen or magistrates and
						get themselves married.-This is wise, proper and commendable. But here a
						radical difficulty arises, in the objection of the women to the advice. The
						decline marriage now, because being free they wish to remain absolutely
						free, and the State laws would give their labor and its proceeds to their
						husbands if they should become married. It bothers the radicals. A great
						many of them have more respect for the money question than the morality
						question. What shall they do? We have the answer in the proposal to make new
						"married women's laws" for the South.-So here comes in the first great
						burden of governing a people in the way radicalism is governing the South,
						Congress must make marriage laws for the Southern States.-Congress has no
						more business with this subject than has the Queen of England; but the
						present theory is that northern radicals must reconstruct the South, morally
						and politically, and therefore this must be done. A thousand social laws
						will soon be required in addition to this. The attempt to reconstruct on the
						present plan will be a failure unless the North be allowed to enforce all
						its notions on the South. </p>
					<p>The remarkable feature of this state of affairs is its resemblance to the
						early days of New England. The radical party there are correct in deriving
						their ideas of government from the Puritans, but they are in great error in
						supposing that those ideas among the Puritans, any more than in our day,
						looked toward liberty. The Puritan system was one of intolerance, and never
						pretended to be anything else. The Puritans were frank, bold defenders of
						their right to worship God as they pleased, and to compel all who fell under
						their authority to worship in the same way. This is the radical faith now,
						and in the attempt to reconstruct the South we see the difficulty of caring
						it into practice.</p>

				<head>The Bankruptcy Bill--The Bankrupt Bill</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The bankrupt bill, which is now a law, is very long, but the following will
						be found to comprise the important provisions:</p>
					<p>Section 11. Prescribes the method of availing of the act.</p>
					<p>Any debtor whose debts, provable under the act, amount to over three hundred
						dollars may petition the District judge of his District, stating his
						insolvency, his willingness to surrender his estate and schedule under oath,
						of his debtors and his creditors, with the nature of the debt in full, and
						an inventory, also under oath, of his assets. Such petition shall be an act
						of bankruptcy, and the petitioner be adjudged a bankrupt. The Judge shall
						thereupon issue a warrant, (or the Register, if there be no opposing party,)
						directed to the United States Marshall of said district, authorizing him to
						publish the necessary notices, to wit:--1. That a warrant in bankruptcy has
						been issued. 2. That all payments of debts to such debtor are forbidden. 3.
						That a meeting of the creditors to prove debts and choose assignees, will be
						held in a court of bankruptcy, not less than ten, nor more than ninety days
						after the issuing of the warrant.</p>
					<p>Section 14. Directs that the Judge (or if there is no opposing interest, the
						Register,) shall convey to the assignee or assignees the entire real and
						personal estate of the bankrupt, but from this assignment are excepted
						household and kitchen furniture, and such other articles as the assignee may
						indicate, not exceeding five hundred dollars in value, the wearing apparel
						of the bankrupt and his family his uniform and arms, and any other property
						hereafter exempted from attachment or levy by United States laws.</p>
					<p>Section 27. Prescribes that all creditors, who prove their debts, shall share
						alike, except that wages to an amount not exceeding fifty dollars, for
						service performed in the preceding six months shall be paid in full.</p>
					<p>Section 28. Prevents the priority of debts.</p>
					<p>Section 29, Allows the bankrupt, after six months from the adjudication of
						bankruptcy, or if no debts or assets within sixty days, to apply for his
						discharge, which the court, after due notice, shall grant, if the bankrupt
						has honestly exhibited his condition.</p>
					<p>Section 30. Prohibits a second bankruptcy, unless by consent of
						creditors-except where the assets amount to seventy percent, of the debts.</p>
					<p>Section 31 to 36. Concern details, pronounces against fraud and the like.</p>
					<p>Section 39. Provides for involuntary bankruptcy, declaring that an absconding
