<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Message of the President of the United States.</p>
					<p>THE DISTRICT SUFFRAGE BILL RETURNED TO THE SENATE.</p>
					<p>The Objections of the President to the Proposed Measure.</p>
					<p>To the Senate of the United States: </p>
					<p>I have received and considered a bill entitled "An act to regulate the
						elective franchise in the District of Columbia," passed by the Senate on the
						13th of December, and by the House of Representatives on the succeeding day.
						It was presented for my approval on the 25th ultimo - six days after the
						adjournment of Congress-and it is now returned with my objections to the
						Senate, in which House it originated.</p>
					<p>Measures having been introduced, at the commencement of the first session of
						the present Congress, for the extension of the elective franchise to persons
						of color in the District of Columbia, steps were taken by the corporate
						authorities of Washington and Georgetown to ascertain and make known the
						opinion of the people of the two cities upon a subject so immediately
						affecting their welfare as a community. The question was submitted to the
						people at special elections, held in the month of December, 1865, when the
						qualified voters of Washington and Georgetown, with great unanimity of
						sentiment, expressed themselves opposed to the contemplated legislation. In
						Washington, in a vote of 6,586 - the largest, with but two exceptions, ever
						polled in that city-only thirty-five ballots were cast for negro suffrage;
						while in Georgetown, in an aggregate of 813 votes a number considerably in
						excess of the average vote the four preceding annual elections-but one was
						given in favor of the proposed extension of the elective franchise. As these
						elections seem to have been conducted with entire fairness, the result must
						be accepted as a truthful expression of the opinion of the people of the
						District upon the question which evoked it. Posessing as an organized
						community, the same popular right as the inhabitants of a State or
						Territory, to make known their will upon matters which affect their social
						and political condition, they could have selected no more appropriate mode
						of memorializing Congress upon the subject of this bill than through the
						suffrage of their qualified voters.</p>
					<p>Entirely disregarding the wishes of the people of the District of Columbia,
						Congress has deemed it right and expedient to pass the measure now submitted
						for my signature. It, therefore becomes the duty of the Executive, standing
						between the legislation of the one and the will of the other, fairly
						expressed, to determine whether he should approve the bill, and thus aid in
						placing upon the statute-books of the nation a law against which the people
						to whom it is to apply have solemnly and with such unanimity protested, or
						whether he should return it with his objections, in the hope that, upon
						consideration, Congress, acting as the representatives of the inhabitants of
						the seat of government, will permit them to regulate a purely local
						question, as to them may seem best suited to their interests and condition.</p>
					<p>The District of Columbia was ceded to the United States by Maryland and
						Virginia, in order that it might become the permanent seat of government of
						the United States. Accepted by Congress, it at once became subject to the
						"exclusive legislation" for which provision is made in the federal
						Constitution. It should be borne in mind, however, that in exercising its
						functions as the law-making power of the District of Columbia, the authority
						of the National Legislature is not without limit, but that Congress is bound
						to observe the letter and spirit of the Constitution as well in the
						enactment of local laws for the seat of government as in legislation common
						to the entire Union. Were it to be admitted that the right "to exercise
						exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever," conferred upon Congress
						unlimited power within the District of Columbia, titles of nobility might be
						granted within its boundaries; laws might be made "respecting an
						establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
						abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people
						peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of
						grievances." Despotism would thus reign at the seat of government of a free
						republic, and, as a place of permanent residence, it would be avoided by all
						who prefer the blessings of liberty to the more emoluments of official
						position.</p>
					<p>It should also be remembered that in legislating for the District of
						Columbia, under the federal Constitution, the relation of Congress to its
						inhabitants is analogous to that of a Legislature to the people of a State,
						under their own local Constitution.-It does not, therefore, seem to be
						asking too much that, in matters pertaining to the District, Congress should
						have a like respect for the will and interests of its inhabitants as is
						entertained by a State Legislature for the wishes and prosperity of those
						for whom they legislate. The spirit of our Constitution and the genius of
						our government require that, in regard to any law which is to affect and
						have a permanent bearing upon a people, their will should exert at least, a
						reasonable influence upon those who are acting in the capacity of their
						legislators. Would, for instance, the Legislature of the State of New York,
						or of Pennsylvania, or of Indiana, or of any State in the Union, in
						opposition to the expressed will of a large majority of the people whom they
						were chosen to represent arbitrarily force upon them, as voters, all persons
						of the African or negro race, and make them eligible for office without any
						other qualification than a certain term of residence within the State? In
						neither of these States named would the colored population, when acting
						together, be able to produce any great social or political result. Yet, in
						New York, before he can vote, the man of color must fulfill conditions that
						are not required of the white citizen; in Pennsylvanian the elective
						franchise is restricted to white freemen; while in Indiana negroes and
						mulattos are expressly excluded from the right of suffrage. It hardly seems
						consistent with the principles of right and justice that representatives of
						States where suffrage is either denied the colored man, or granted to him on
						qualifications requiring intelligence or property, should compel the people
						of the District of Columbia to try an experiment which their own
						constituents have thus far shown an unwillingness to test for themselves.
						Nor does it accord with our republican ideas that the principle of
						self-government should lose its force when applied to the residents of the
						District merely because their legislators are not, like those of the States,
						responsible, through the ballot, to the people for whom they are the
						law-making power.</p>
					<p>The great object of placing the seat of government under the exclusive
						legislation of Congress was to secure the entire independence of the General
						Government from undue State influence, and to enable it to discharge without
						danger of interruption or to their infringement of its authority, the high
						functions for which it was created by the people. For this important purpose
						it was ceded to the United States by Maryland and Virginia, and it certainly
						never could have been contemplated, as one of the objects to be attained by
						placing it under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress, that it would
						afford to propagandists or political parties a place for an experimental
						test of their principles and theories. While, indeed, the residents of the
						seat of government are not citizens of any State, and are not therefore
						allowed a vote in the electoral college, or representation in the councils
						of the nation, they are, nevertheless, American citizens, entitled as such
						to every guarantee of the Constitution, to every benefit of the laws, and to
						every right which pertains to citizens of our common country. In all
						matters, then, affecting their domestic affairs, the spirit of our
						democratic form of government demands that their wishes should be consulted
						and respected, and they taught to feel that, although not permitted
						practically to participate in National concerns, they are nevertheless under
						a paternal government, regardful of their rights, mindful of their wants,
						and solicitous for their prosperity. It was evidently contemplated that all
						local questions would be left to their decision, at least to an extent that
						would not be incompatible with the object for which Congress was granted
						exclusive legislation over the seat of government. When the Constitution was
						yet under consideration, it was assumed, by Mr. Madison, that its
						inhabitants would be allowed "a municipal legislature for local purposes,
						derived from their own suffrages." When, for the first time, Congress, in
						the year 1800, assembled at Washington, President Adams, in his speech, at
						its opening, reminded the two Houses that it was for them to consider
						whether the local powers over the District of Columbia; vested by the
						Constitution of the United States, should be immediately exercised, and he
						asked them to "consider it as the capital of a great nation advancing with
						unexampled rapidity in arts, in commerce, in wealth, and in population, and
						possessing within itself those resources which if not thrown away or
						lamentably misdirected, would secure to it a long course of prosperity and
						self-government." Three years had not elapsed when Congress was called upon
						to consider the propriety of retroceding to Maryland and Virginia the
						jurisdiction of the territory they had respectively relinquished to the
						government of the United States. It was urged on the one hand, that the
						exclusive jurisdiction was not necessary or useful to the government; that
						it deprived the inhabitants of the District of their political rights; that
						much of the time Congress was consumed by legislation pertaining to it; that
						its government was expensive; that Congress was not competent to legislate
						for the District, because the members were strangers to its local concerns;
						and that it was an example of a government without representation - an
						experience dangerous to the liberties of the States. On the other hand it
						was had, among other reasons, and successfully, that the Constitution, the
						acts of cession of Virginia and Maryland, and the act of Congress accepting
						the grant, all contemplated the exercise of exclusive legislation by
						Congress, and that its usefulness, if not its necessity, was inferred from
						the inconvenience which was felt for want of it by the Congress of the
						Confederation; that the people themselves, who it was said had been deprived
						of their political rights, had not complained, and did not desire a
						retrocession; that the evil might be remedied by giving them a
						representation in Congress when the District should become sufficiently
						populous, and in the meantime a local legislature; that if the inhabitants
						had no political rights, they had great political influence; that the
						trouble and expense of legislating for the District would not be great, but
						would diminish, and might in a great measure be avoided by a local
						legislature; and that Congress could not retrocede the inhabitants without
						their consent. Continuing to live substantially under the laws that existed
						at the time of the cession, and such changes having only been made as were
						suggested by themselves, the people of the District have not sought, by a
						local legislature, that which has generally been willingly conceded by the
						Congress of the nation.</p>
					<p>As a general rule, sound policy requires that the Legislature should yield to
						the wishes of a people when not inconsistent with the Constitution and the
						laws. The measures suited to one community might not be well adapted to the
						condition of another; and the persons best qualified to determine such
						questions are those whose interests are to be directly affected by any by
						any propose law. In Massachusetts, for instance male persons are allowed to
						vote without regard to color, provided they possess a certain degree of
						intelligence. In a population of that State of 1,231,066, they were, by the
						census of 1860, only 9,602 persons of color; and of the males over twenty
						years of age, there were over 339,086 white to 2,602 colored. By the same
						official enumeration, there were in the District of Columbia 60, 764 whites
						to 14,316 persons of the colored race. Since then, however, the population
						of the District has largely increased, and it is estimated that at the
						present time there are nearly a hundred thousand whites to thirty thousand
						negroes. The cause of the augmented number of the latter class needs no
						explanation. Contiguous to Maryland and Virginia, the District, during the
						war, became a refuge for those who escaped from servitude, and it is yet the
						abiding place of a considerable proportion of those who sought within its
						limits a shelter from bondage. Until then held in slavery, and denied all
						opportunities for mental culture, their first knowledge of government was
						acquired when, by conferring upon them freedom, it became the benefactor of
						their race; the test for their capability for improvement began, when, for
						the first time, the career of free industry and the avenues of intelligence
						were opened to them. Possessing these advantages by a limited time-the
						greater number, perhaps having entered the District of Columbia during the
						last years of the war or since its termination-we many well pause to inquire
						whether, after so brief a probation they are as a class capable of an
						intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage, and qualified to discharge
						the duties of official position. The people are daily witnesses of their
						mode of living, and who have become familiar with their habits of thought,
						have expressed the conviction that they are not yet competent to serve as
						electors, and thus become eligible for offices in the local governments
						under which they live. Clothed with the elective franchise, their numbers,
						already largely in excess of the demand for labor, would be soon increased
						by an influx from the adjoining States. Drawn from fields where employment
						is abundant, they would in vain seek it here, and so add to the
						embarrassments already experienced from the large class of idle persons
						congregated in the District. Hardly yet capable of forming correct jungments
						upon the important questions that often make the issues of political
						contests, they could readily be made subservient to the purposes of
						designing persons. While in Massachusetts, in the census of 1860, the
						proportion of white to colored males over twenty years of age was one
						hundred and thirty to one, here the black race constitutes nearly one-third
						of the entire population, while the same class surrounds the District on all
						sides, ready to change their residence at a moments notice with all the
						facility of a nomadic people, in order to enjoy here, after a short
						residence, a privilege enjoyed nowhere else. It is within their power, in
						one year, to come into the District in such numbers as to have the supreme
						control of the white race, and to govern them by their own officers and by
						the exercise of all the municipal authority - among the rest, of the power
						of taxation over property in which they have no interest. In Massachusetts,
						where they have enjoyed the benefits of a thorough educational system, a
						qualification of intelligence is required, while here, suffrage is extended
						to all, without discrimination, as well to the most incapable, who can prove
						a residence in the District of one year, as to those persons of color, who,
						comparatively few in number, are permanent inhabitants, and having given
						evidence of merit and qualifications, are recognized as useful and
						responsible members of the community.-Imposed upon an unwilling people,
						placed, by the Constitution, under the exclusive legislation of Congress, it
						would be viewed as an arbitrary exercise of power, and as an indication by
						the country of the purpose of Congress to compel the acceptance of negro
						suffrage by the States. It would engender a feeling of opposition and hatred
						between the two races, which, becoming deeprooted and ineradicable, would
						prevent them from living together in a state of friendliness. Carefully
						avoiding every measure that might tend to produce such a result, and
						following the clear and well ascertained popular will, we should assiduously
						endeavor to promote kindly relations between them, and thus, when that
						popular will leads the way, prepare for the gradual and harmonious
						introduction of this new element into the political power of the country.</p>
					<p>It cannot be urged that the proposed extension of suffrage in the District of
						Columbia is necessary to enable persons of color to protect either their
						interests or their rights. They stand here precisely as they stand in
						Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Here, as elsewhere, in all that pertains to
						the civil rights, there is nothing to distinguish this class of persons from
						citizens of the United States; for they possess the "full and equal benefit
						of all laws and proceedings for the securite of person and property as is
						enjoyed by white citizens," and are made "subject to like punishments,
						pains, and penalties, and to none other any law, statute ordinance,
						regulation, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding." Nor, as has been
						assumed, are these suffrages necessary to aid a loyal sentiment here; for
						local governments already exist of undoubted fealty to the government, and
						are sustained by communities which were among the first to testify their
						devotion to the Union, and which during the struggle, furnished their full
						quotas of men to the military service of the country.</p>
					<p>The exercise of the elective franchise is the highest attribute of an
						American citizen, and, when guided by virtue, intelligence, patriotism, and
						a proper appreciation of our institutions, constitutes a true basis of a
						democratic form of government, in which the sovereign power is lodged in the
						body of the people. Its influence for good necessarily depends upon the
						elevated character and patriotism of the elector, for if exercised by
						persons who do not justly estimate its value and who are indifferent as to
						its results, it will only serve as a means of placing power in the hands of
						the unprincipled and ambitious, and must eventuate in the complete
						destruction of that liberty of which it should be the most powerful
						conservator. Great danger is therefore to be apprehended from an untimely
						extension of the elective franchise to any new class in our country,
						especially when the large majority of that class, in wielding the power thus
						placed in their hands, cannot be expected correctly to comprehend the duties
						and responsibilities which pertain to suffrage. Yesterday, as it were four
						millions of persons were held in a condition of slavery that had existed for
						generations; today the are freemen, and are assumed by law to be citizens.
						It cannot be presumed from their previous condition of servitude, that, as a
						class, they are as well informed as to the nature of our government as the
						intelligent foreigner who makes our land the home of his choice. In the case
						of the latter, neither a residence of five years, and the knowledge of our
						institutions which it gives, nor attachment to the principles of the
						Constitution, are the only conditions upon which he can be admitted to
						citizenship. He must prove, in addition, a good moral character, and thus
						give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to the
						obligations which he assumes as a citizen of the republic. Where a
						people-the source of all political power-speak, by their suffrage, through
						the instrumentality of the ballot-box, it must be carefully guarded against
						the control of those who are corrupt in principle and enemies of free
						institutions, for it can only become to our political and social system a
						safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when kept free from demoralizing
						influences. Controlled, through fraud and usurpation, by the designing,
						anarchy and despotism must inevitably follow. In the hands of the patriotic
						and worthy, our government will be preserved upon the principles of the
						Constitution inherited from our fathers. It follows, therefore, that in
						admitting to the ballot-box a new class of voters not qualified for the
						exercise of the elective franchise, we weaken our system of government
						instead of adding to its strength and durability.</p>
					<p>In returning this bill to the Senate, I deeply regret that there should be
						any conflict of opinion between the Legislative and Executive Departments of
						the government in regard to measures that vitaly affect the prosperity and
						peace of the country. Sincerely desiring to reconcile the States with one
						another, and the whole people to the government of the United States, it has
						been my earnest wish to co-operate with Congress in all measures having for
						their object a proper and complete adjustment of the questions resulting
						from our late civil war. Harmony between the co-ordinate branches of the
						government, always necessary for the public welfare, was never more demanded
						than at the present time, and it will therefore be my constant aim to
						promote, as far as possible, concert of action between them. The differences
						of opinion that have already occurred have rendered me only more cautious,
						lest the Executive should encroach upon any of the prerogatives of Congress,
						or, by exceeding. in any manner, the constitutional limit of his duties,
						destroy the equilibrium which should exist between the several co-ordinate
						Departments, and which is so essential to the harmonious working of the
						government. I know it has been urged that the Executive Department is more
						likely to enlarge the sphere of its action than either of the other two
						branches of the government, and especially in the exercise of the veto power
						conferred upon it by the Constitution. It should be remembered, however,
						that this power is wholly negative and conservative in its character, and
						was intended to operate as a check upon unconstitutional, hasty, and
						improvident legislation, and as a means of protection against invasions of
						the just powers of the Executive and Judicial Departments. It is remarked by
						Chancellor Kent that "to enact laws is a transcendent power; and, if the
						body that possesses it be a full and equal representation of the people,
						there is a danger of its pressing with destructive weight upon all the other
						parts of the machinery of government. It has, therefore, been thought
						necessary, by the most skillful and most experienced artists in the science
						of civil polity that strong barriers should be erected for the protection
						and security of the other necessary powers of the government. Nothing has
						been deemed more fit and expedient for the purpose than the provision that
						the head of the Executive Department should be so constituted as to secure a
						requisite share of independence, and that he should have a negative upon the
						passing laws; and that the judiciary power, resting upon a still more
						permanent basis, should have the right of determining upon the valididty of
						laws by the standard of the Constitution."</p>
					<p>The necessity of some checks in the hands of the Executive is shown by
						reference to the most eminent writers upon our system of government, who
						seem to concur in the apprehended from the department in which all
						legislative powers are vested by the Constitution. Mr. Madison, in referring
						to the difficulty of providing some practical security for each against the
						invasion of the others, remarks that "the Legislative Department is
						everywhere extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into
						its impetuous vortex." The founders of our republics * * * * seem never to
						have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations, which, by
						assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is
						threatened by Executive usurpations." "In a representative republic, where
						the Executive magistracy is carefully limited, both in the extent and the
						duration of his power and where the legislative power is exercised by an
						assembly which is inspired by a supposed influence over the people, with an
						intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is sufficiently numerous to
						feel all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to
						be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions by means of which
						reason prescribes - it is against the enterprising ambition of this
						department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust
						all their precaution." "The Legislative Department derives a superiority in
						our government from other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at
						once more extensive and less susceptible of precise limits it can with the
						greater facility mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the
						encroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments." "On the other
						side, the executive power being restrained with a narrower compass, and
						being more simple in its nature, and the judiciary being described by
						landmarks still less uncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these
						departments would immediately betray and defeat themselves.-Nor is this all.
						As the Legislative Department alone has access to the pockets of the people,
						and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all prevailing
						influence over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other department,
						a dependence is thus created in the latter which gives still greater
						facility to encroachments of the former." "We have seen that the tendency of
						republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative, at the
						expense of the other departments."</p>
					<p>Mr. Jefferson, in referring to the early constitution of Virginia, objected
						that by its provisions all the powers of government-legislative, executive ,
						and judicial-resulted to the legislative body, holding that "the
						concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of
						despotic government. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be
						exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and
						seventy three despots would surely be as oppressive as one." "As little will
						it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves An elective despotism was not
						the government we fought for, but the one which should not only be founded
						on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so
						divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy as that no one could
						transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and
						restrained by others. For this reason that convention which passed the
						ordinance of government laid its foundation on the basis, that the
						Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary Departments should be separate and
						distinct, so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of
						them at the same time. But no barrier was provided between these several
						powers. The judiciary and executive members were left dependent on the
						legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their
						continuance in it. If therefore, the Legislature assumes executive and
						judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made, nor, if made, can be
						effectual; because in that case the map out their proceedings into the form
						of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other
						branches. They have accordingly, in many instances decided rights which
						should have been left to judiciary controversy; and the direction of the
						executive during the whole time of their session, is becoming habitual and
						familiar."</p>
					<p>Mr. Justice Story, in his commentaries on the Constitution reviews the same
						subject, and says:</p>
					<p>"The truth is, that the legislative power is the great and overruling power
						in every free government." "The representatives of the people will watch
						with jealousy every encroachment of the executive magistrate, for it
						trenches upon their own authority.--But who shall watch the encroachments of
						these representatives themselves? Will they be as jealous of the exercise of
						power by themselves as by others?" "There are many reasons which may be
						assigned for engrossing influence of the legislative department. In the
						first place, its constitutional powers are more extensive, and less capable
						of being brought within precise limits than those of either of the other
						departments. The bounds of the executive authority are easily marked out and
						defined. It reaches few objects, and those are known. It cannot transcend
						them without being brought in contact with the other departments. Laws may
						check and restrain and bound its exercise. The same remarks apply with still
						greater force to the judiciary. The jurisdiction is, or may be, bounded to a
						few objects or persons; or, however general and unlimited and its operations
						are necessarily confined to the mere administration of private and public
						justice. It cannot punish without law. It cannot create controversies to act
						upon. It can decide only upon rights and cases as they are brought by others
						before it. It can do nothing for itself. It must do everything for others.
						It must obey the laws; and, if corruptly administers them, it is subjected
						to the power of impeachment. On the other hand, the legislative power,
						except in the few cases of constitutional prohibition, is unlimited. It is
						forever varying its means and its ends. It governs the institutions and
						laws, and public policy of the country. It regulates all its vast interests.
						It disposes of all its property. Look but at the exercise of two or three
						branches of its ordinary powers. It levies all taxes; it gives the rules for
						the descent, distribution, and devises of all property held by individuals.
						It controls the sources and resources of wealth. It changes at its will the
						whole fabric of the laws. It moulds at its pleasure all the institutions
						which give strength and comfort and dignity to society. In the next place,
						it is the direct, visible representative of the will of the people in all
						the changes of the times and circumstances. It has the pride, as well as the
						power of numbers. It is easily moved and steadily moved by the strong
						impulses of popular feeling and popular odium. It obeys, without reluctance,
						the wishes and the will of the majority for the time being. The path to
						public favor lies open by such obedience; and it finds not only support, but
						impunity in whatever measures the majority advises, even though they
						transcend the constitutional limits. It has no motive, therefore, to be
						jealous or scrupulous in its own use of power: and it finds its ambition
						stimulated and its arm strengthened by the countenance and the courage of
						numbers.-These views are not alone those of men who look with apprehension
						upon the fate of republics; but they are also freely admitted by some of the
						strongest advocates for popular rights and the permanency of republican
						institutions." "Each department should have a will of its own." "Each should
						have its own independence secured beyond the power of being taken away by
						either or both of the others. But at the same time the relations of each to
						the other should be so strong that there should be a mutual interest to
						sustain and protect each other. There should not only be constitutional
						means, but personal motives to resist encroachments of one or either of the
						others. Thus, ambition would be made to counteract ambition; the desire of
						power to check power; and the pressure of interest to balance an opposing
						interest." "The judiciary is naturally, and almost necessarily (as has been
						already said) the weakest department. It can have no means of interest by
						patronage. Its powers can never be wielded for itself. It has no command
						over the purse or sword of the nation. It can neither lay taxes, nor
						appropriate money, nor command armies, or appoint to office. It is never
						brought into contact with the people by constant appeals and solicitations,
						and private intercourse, which belong to all other departments of
						government.-It is seen only in controversies, or in trials and punishments.
						Its rigid justice and impartiality give it no claims to favor, however they
						may to respect. It stands solitary and unsupported, except by that portion
						of public opinion which is interested only in the strict administration of
						justice. It can rarely secure the sympathy or zealous support either of the
						Executive or the Legislature. If they are not (as is not unfrequently the
						case), jealous of its prerogatives, the constant necessity of scrutinizing
						the acts of each, upon the application of any private person, Dan the
						painful duty of pronouncing judgment that these acts are a departure from
						the law or Constitution, can have no tendency to conciliate kindness or
						nourish influence. It would seem, therefore, that some additional guards
						would, under such circumstance be necessary to protect this department from
						the absolute dominion of the others. Yet rarely have any such guards been
						applied; and every attempt to introduce them has been resisted with a
						pertinacity which demonstrates how slow popular leaders are to introduce
						checks upon their own power, and how slow the people are to believe that the
						judiciary is the real bulwark of their liberties.' "If any department of the
						government has undue influence, or absorbing power, it certainly has not
						been either the Executive or judiciary."</p>
					<p>In addition to what has been said by these distinguished writers, it may also
						be urged that the dominant war party in each House may, by the expulsion of
						a sufficient number of its members, or by the exclusion from representation
						of a requisite number of States, reduce the minority to less than one-third.
						Congress, by these means, might be enabled to pass a law, the objections of
						the President to the contrary notwithstanding, which would render impotent
						the other two departments of the government, and make inoperative the
						wholesome and restraining power which it was intended by the framers of the
						Constitution should be exerted by them. This would be a practical
						concentration of all power in the Congress of the United States-this, in the
						language of the author of the Declaration of Independence, would be
						"precisely the definition of despotic government."</p>
					<p>I have preferred to reproduce these teachings of the great statesmen and
						constitutional lawyers of the early and later days of the Republic, rather
						than to rely simply upon an expression of my own opinions. -We cannot too
						often recur to them, especially at a conjuncture like the present. Their
						application to our actual condition is so apparent that they now come to us
						as a living voice, to be listened to with more attention than at any
						previous period of our history. We have been, and are yet, in the midst of a
						popular commotion. The passions aroused by a great civil war are still
						dominant. It is not a time favorable to that calm and deliberate judgement
						which is the only guide when radical changes in our institutions are to be
						made. The measure now before me is one of those changes. It initiates an
						untold experiment, for a people who have said, with one voice, it is not for
						their good. This alone should make us pause but it is not all. The
						experiment has not been tried, or so much as demanded by the people of the
						Severed [UNCLEAR] States for themselves. In but few of those States has such
						an invitation been allowed as giving the ballot to the colored population
						without any other qualification than a residence of one year, and in most of
						them the denial of this ballot to this race is absolute, and by fundamental
						law placed beyond the ordinary domain of ordinary legislation. In most of
						those States the evil of such suffrage would be partial; but small as it
						would be, it is guarded by constitutional barriers. Here the innovation
						assumes formidable proportions, which may easily grow to such an extent as
						to make the white population a subordinate element in the body politic.</p>
					<p>fter full deliberation upon this measure, I cannot bring myself to approve
						it, even upon local considerations, nor yet as the beginning of an
						experiment on a larger scale-I yield to no one in attachment to that rule of
						general suffrage which distinguishes our policy as a nation. But there is a
						limit, wisely observed hitherto, which makes the ballot a privilege and a
						trust, and which requires of some classes a time suitable for probation and
						preparation. To give it indiscriminately to a new class, wholly unprepared,
						by previous habits and opportunity, to perform the trust which it demands,
						is to degrade it, and finally to destroy its power; for it may be safely
						assumed that no political truth is better established than that such
						indiscriminate and all-embracing extension of popular suffrage must end at
						last in its destruction.</p>

<b>The Senatorial Fight--The Wounded and the Killed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In reference to the contest for the Republican Senatorial nomination, the
					editorial explains that "[s]carcely ever in the history of our Commonwealth has
					such a bitter fight been carried on between aspirants for official position." In
					a closely watched race, Simon Cameron defeated his rival, Gov. Curtin, to take
					the Republican nomination, a result that virtually guarantees him the Senatorial
					seat.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p> The Senatorial contest is ended and the agony is over. For months public
						attention has been absorbed by the disgraceful strife between the rival
						combatants. Scarcely ever in the history of our Commonwealth has such a
						bitter fight been carried on between aspirants for official position. Never
						was such a inordinate boasting resorted to as was indulged in by the friends
						of the retiring Governor. Our neighbors of the Repository , played the game of bluff vigorously. He held "too
						little a pair," and played as though the idea never entered his mind that
						possibly the Winnebago Chief might have "four high-heeled Jacks" in his
						hand. </p>
					<p>We staked our money on Cameron because we knew he wouldn't play unless held
						the winning hand.</p>
					<p>The Curtin men entered the ring with grand flourish of trumpets. The press of
						the State was loud in its praises of the Governor, and apparently earnest in
						the advocacy of his claims to the Senatorship. We were told that nine out of
						ten of the people of the State were anxious for his success: that the public
						press, in clamoring for his election was only uttering the wishes of the
						honest citizens.</p>
					<p>The "Chief Editor of the Repository " had actually
						persuaded himself that Curtin borne on the current of popular favor would
						triumph gloriously over the strategy and corruption of Cameron. He could not
						believe that the Representatives of "the party of great moral ideas" could
						be induced to give their support to the "political adventurer who never on a
						position but by a fraud, and never left one but with dishonor." - Knowing
						well the exceeding purity and total incorruptibility of former Legislatures,
						he felt assured that the meritorious claims of his candidate would be
						recognized by the present Legislature in defiance of any stronger arguments
						that Cameron might attempt to employ. He risked Curtin's chances therefore,
						upon the purity and integrity of its members. But alas! "Simon says
						wiggle-waggle," and "the party of great moral ideas" wiggle-waggles
						accordingly, staggers, and "falls into the bewildering, seething, whipped
						[UNCLEAR] of corruption," Were it not for our extreme regard for the
						feelings of our editorial brother, and the other numerous friends of Curtin,
						we would be inclined to characterize their whole course in the Senatorial
						contest, as the most monstrous game of brag that has ever come under our
						notice. </p>
					<p>"The mountains were in labor and brought forth a mouse," The force of "the
						party of great moral ideas" rang loud and clear throughout the limits of the
						Commonwealth for Curtin, and he received-twenty-three votes. We fear that it
						will require a "prophetic mind to forecast the enthusiasm and determination
						with which the loyal people will make the rejected stone their crows
						[ILLEGIBLE] ." In our opinion "he's [ILLEGIBLE]."</p>
					<p>Meanwhile "the Great Commoner" snuffs the battle from afar. In the midst of
						his gigantic labors at Washington, he pauses to gaze upon contending forces.
						It is true that he has reached the height of his ambition. He sways
						listening [ILLEGIBLE] and [UNCLEAR] with his nod. He wields a rod of iron
						with which he lashes the refractory into obedience, and by the force of his
						strong will he has managed to keep the Union divided. He feels that in his
						person are concentrated all the energy, talent, and virtue of "the party of
						great moral ideas." The cup of his fame is full to the brim and running
						over. He has no higher aspirations.</p>
					<p>But there are seven men in Washington township, this county (see record of
						proceedings of Convention, called to instruct Hon. E. S. Stumbaugh, for
						Senator,) and several more in the Legislature of the State, (see record of
						the proceedings of Republican caucus) who desire him to "go up higher." The
						old man cannot turn a deaf ear to the wishes of those fond admirers, and he
						therefore enters the Senatorial ring also. At first he intends to allow the
						prestige of his great name to "plead trumpet-tongued" in his behalf. He will
						remain in Washington. He has full confidence in the purity of the members of
						the Legislature. Former Legislatures may have been bribed.-This one is "like
						Caesar's wife, above suspicion." He will remain, therefore, upon the scene
						of his great labors and triumphs, to receive the intelligence of another
						manifestation of the confidence and appreciation of the people of the old
						Keystone, which their Representatives are about to give him. But "facts
						which came to his knowledge" change the old man a determination, and he
						hobbles of to Harrisburg, accompanied by "the dead duck," to "throw
						himself," as our neighbor, of the Repository ,
						informs us, "into the gaping breach made by Cameron's lobby." </p>
					<p>But, "Simon says wiggle-waggle," and despite the efforts of "the Great
						Commoner," seconded by the labors of the defunct water-fowl, and backed by
						the mighty influence of "the soldier's friend" and the Herculean strength of
						the friends of "the soldier's friend," the Representatives of "the party of
						great moral ideas" wiggle-waggle accordingly, and stagger and fall "into the
						bewildering, seething whirlpool of corruption."</p>
					<p>It is true that "the loyal people" of Franklin county did instruct their
						Representative, Honorable Frederick S. Stumbauch, and that "the loyal
						people" of Franklin and Adams counties did instruct their Senator, Honorable
						David McConaughey, to vote for Curtin. These instructions were given in good
						faith, as "the honest unpurchased expression of the loyal people of these
						counties." But was the editor of the Repository 
						so ignorant as to suppose that the Honorable Senator and Representative owed
						Cameron nothing? Does he not know that there was once great danger of the
						gallant Colonel's defeat in this district? And has he forgotten that there
						was once a contest for the seat which the honorable Senator now occupies?
						How, then, could he expect his instructions to stick? However, he relied
						upon the integrity and purity of these honorable men, ("so are they all
						honorable men") as Representatives of "the party of great moral ideas," not
						dreaming that Simon might say wiggle-waggle and that they, too, might
						wiggle-waggle accordingly, and stagger and fall "into the bewildering,
						seething whirlpool of corruption." </p>
					<p>We do not regret the defeat of Stevens and Curtin. We desired to see them
						beaten, but we cannot help dropping a sympathetic tear over the utter
						remedilessness of the defeat.</p>
					<p>We were not prepared for a Waterloo, and as we now gaze upon the old
						Winnebago Chief, brandishing aloft in one hand his tomahawk, and in the
						other his scalping knife, his face turned toward the scalps of "the Great
						Commoner: and "the soldiers' friend," which hang above the door of his
						wigwam as trophies of his victory, our sympathy is awakened, and we feel
						like drawing a petition (and getting our neighbor, of the Repository , to sign it) praying Congress to turn
						their attention from the Supreme Court, reconstruction and negro-suffrage to
						this matter, and to call out men and appropriate money enough to sweep this
						"bloody Injin" from the war path altogether. </p>

<b>The Veto Message</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article applauds the President's decision to veto the suffrage bill,
					which it describes as "an infraction of the spirit of the Constitution."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>On the first page of our paper to-day will be found the message of the
						President, containing his objections to the bill conferring the right of
						suffrage on the negroes of the District of Columbia. It is an able and
						statesmanlike document, and will amply repay a careful perusal. The
						President recites the action of the citizens of the district a year ago,
						when, at a special election called by the municipal authorities, they
						declared almost unanimously against the measure. He justly considers it an
						infraction of the spirit of the Constitution and contrary to the genius of
						republican government from an obnoxious measure upon an unwilling people.
						For this and other equally cogent reasons he withholds his signature from
						the bill.</p>
					<p>The President also quotes largely from the writings of the fathers of the
						Republic to show that those wise and patriotic men foresaw the very dangers
						which are now threatening the overthrow of our institutions, namely, the
						attempt of wicked and ambitious men in Congress to absorb the powers of the
						Executive and Judiciary in that of the legislature, and thus establish a
						despotism. It will be well for the country if the people heed those timely
						warnings and interpose a check, while it is not too late, upon the bad men
						who are recklessly leading the nation on to anarchy and despotism.</p>
