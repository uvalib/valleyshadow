<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>General Sheridan, commanding in Louisiana, has, by virtue
							of his military authority, appointed a new Attorney General for
						the State, and new municipal officers and a new Judge for the city of New
						Orleans!-If some military potentate will now "establish a religion" and
						"create an order of nobility," we believe there will then be left unviolated
						no single provision of the Constitution of the United States. </p>
					<p>The removal and appointment of Judges of courts of law by a military officer,
						is one of those significant strokes at the very foundation of social order,
						which mark the stage of revolution which we have already reached. It is a
						new conception; till now, it probably never entered the brain of any one
						living in a civilized country; its effect on the minds of the American
						people, will show how much they may retain of the love of civil liberty
						which burned in the breasts of their forefathers. The Radical leaders assume
						that the whole land is ripe for servitude; their hands are raised to snatch
						the judicial power from the judges and the executive power from the
						President; all is to be engrossed and wielded by the Radical clique, through
						bureau and military agents. But, in their intoxication, we think they
						misjudge the American people; each act that displays the Radicals in their
						true colors, encourages our hope that their rule built on impudence and
						deception, is destined to no long continuance.</p>

<b>"A Timely Warning"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite the Republicans' pledge last year to refrain from forcing black
					suffrage upon the South, Radicals' actions in Congress thus far appear to
					repudiate all such claims. As evidence, the article includes a copy of a bill
					introduced by Senator Wilson that would make it illegal to deny the vote to any
					male citizen of the country on the basis of his color or race.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Age</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Nobody has yet had time to forget, says the Age ,
						that nearly every Republican organ and representative pledged themselves in
						the political campaign of last year, that their party harbored no design to
						force negro suffrage, even on the Southern States. Every imputation of that
						design, they met with the most positive and solemn denial, and they pointed,
						a proof, to the express terms of the proposed constitutional amendment,
						which, they said, left the whole question to the people of each State. The
						Congress elected on these solemn pledges has not been yet in session a
						month. They have, however, already passed a "supplemental reconstruction
						bill" fastening negro suffrage upon every Southern state, pinning it down on
						them with the point of the bayonet. The second act of the performance opened
						on Saturday last in the Senate, when Wilson brought in a bill to force negro
						suffrage on all the Northern States; and to cap the climax of impudence,
						this is based on the very "amendment" which purported to leave the whole
						matter to the States,-- Here is his bill omitting only a long lying
						"whereas" which precedes it as a preamble. Its title is "a bill to regulate
						the elective franchise in the United States:" </p>
					<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
							of the United States of American in congress assembled. That
						there shall be no denial of the elective franchise to any male citizen of
						the United States by any State on account of color or race, or previous
						condition, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary
						notwithstanding. </p>
					<p>SEC 2. And be it further enacted, That every
						person who shall violate the provisions of this act shall, on conviction in
						any court of the United States, be fined for each and every offense not less
						than one hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not less than six months, or
						both, at the discretion of the Court. </p>
					<p>Let it be remembered that Connecticut and Ohio have, by very recent acts,
						determined to uphold the governing prerogative of the white race, as it is
						established in Pennsylvania, and other States of the North. But the Radical
						leaders are now, they think, strong enough to trample down public opinion
						and to dispense with further disguises. The "negro suffrage: that was
						excused and palliated in the last Congress as a necessary "war measure"
						against States that were charged-though falsely-as being still in
						rebellion-this same "negro suffrage" that was excused and palliated in the
						last Congress as a necessary "war measure" against States that were
						charged-though-falsely-as still being in rebellion-this same "negro
						suffrage" is now to be thrust upon the people of Connecticut and
						Pennsylvania, who were never before supposed to have forfeited the right of
						self-government, in the matters that belong to the States.</p>
					<p>Now, this example may plainly show, even to the blindest, how great an
						interest the Northern people have in the struggle that is now going on in
						our country between the principles of free constitutional government and of
						despotism. It is common enough, to speak of the Southern people with some
						commiseration-to depreciate the infliction on them of the oppressions that
						shock humanity, in the case of Poland, Hungary and Ireland. But we have an
						interest deeper and nearer than this.-The freemen of the North have their
						stake, too, and a great one it is, in the reckless desperate game the
						Radicals are playing for despotic power. All our liberties are at stake. We
						see the denial of the rights of the Southern States followed up promptly and
						surely by the denial of the rights of the States of the North. The negro
						suffrage forced on the South yesterday, is to be forced on the North
						to-morrow. If Congress has power to establish negro suffrage, so has it the
						right to institute military tribunals to enforce it. They are what Wilson
						means, no doubt, by "any court of the United States." The late decision of
						the Supreme Court declaring them illegal is now openly treated with
						contempt. A military commission is still the favorite engine of Radical
						despotism; it appears in all recent plans of reconstruction, though even
						Benjamin F. Butler does not hesitate to charge it with the murder of a
						woman.-The case of Mrs. Surratt, who was dragged in chains before an illegal
						tribunal, tried in furious and unfair haste, and, according even to Butler,
						condemned "without any evidence of guilt," may serve as an instance and a
						warning of what follows when passion and party violence triumph over law. If
						we are ever again to have law and order among us, it is time their rule
						should begin. It is no longer "a time of war" in which there was a claim to
						universal license. The people of the South, with a sincerity of which now,
						at least, there can be no doubt, are earnestly seeking the restoration of
						free constitutional government. They have learned to know its value. And
						must the Northern people learn it from its loss; or shall we be wise in
						time? Let every freeman who has a vote to give in any approaching election
						ponder well this question.</p>
