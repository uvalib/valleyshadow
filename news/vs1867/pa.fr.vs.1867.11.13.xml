                    <p>Every patriot heart was thrilled with joy at the result of the October
                        elections. Men who had patiently struggled for seven years to keep our
                        rulers within the limits of the written law--who had seen with deepest
                        chagrin the old landmarks of the government removed--who had stood aghast at
                        the strange and startling innovations introduced into our republican
                        system--who had felt appalled at the dangers which threatened to sweep away
                        the liberties of the citizen and engulf the country in the evils of a
                        military despotism--welcomed the intelligence which was to them a harbinger
                        of happier and more prosperous days for their beloved land. It gave evidence
                        of the fact that the masses were beginning to reject the leadership of blind
                        fanatics and were thinking for themselves. It was a sure indication of a
                        great popular reaction which is to infuse a healthy vigor into the body
                        politic. But there is still further cause for rejoicing now. Radicalism
                        staggers under the crushing blow received at the November elections. A great
                        popular uprising is in progress.--Throughout the length and breadth of our
                        land, Conservatism is taking the place of the ultra doctrines which have had
                        full sway of late. The voice of reason is now being heard above the storm of
                        passion. The vindictive feelings which have so long raged within the breasts
                        of Northern men, are giving way to kindlier emotions. A settled conviction
                        has taken possession of the Northern mind that the Southern States are not
                        to be pinned to the Union with bayonets--that the ligaments of fraternal
                        affection are the only ties that can bind the people of several States
                        together and animate them with a common purpose to preserve the integrity of
                        the Federal Government. There is an idea prevalent too, that whilst
                        Freedmen's Bureaus too, that whilst Freedman's Bureaus may be a delightful
                        institution for the negroes, they are rather an expensive luxury for the
                        white tax-payers.--There is also an old-fashioned hatred springing up to
                        large standing armies in time of peace. The people have a notion, too, that
                        the late war, which cost so much blood as treasure, was waged on the part of
                        the North to keep the Southern States <emph rend="italic">in</emph> the
                        Union and not to shut them <emph rend="italic">out</emph>; and added to all
                        this, is a fixed determination that the white race will not hand this great,
                        free government over to the control of half-civilized blacks. <emph
                            rend="italic">White men must rule America.</emph> Our countrymen do not
                        intend to run counter to the purposes of the Almighty.--Such are some of the
                        causes which have operated to stir up the popular heart to an expression of
                        its will through the ballot-box. And what a significant utterance it is! It
                        is not the voice of one State alone. "Deep calleth into deep." State calleth
                        unto State. For years Radicalism has held the sceptre in every Northern
                        State. It seems impossible for Democracy to break its hold on power and oust
                        it from the high place of public trust. But the dawn of a new era has been
                        ushered in. Connecticut threw off the yoke, and flung the Democratic banner
                        in triumph to the winds. English was elected Governor. Vermont gave evidence
                        that Radicalism was wanting there. From the Pacific shores, California sent
                        the intelligence of the overwhelming triumph of Democracy within her limits.
                        Montana echoed the voice of the Golden State.--Maine, from our extreme
                        eastern boundary shouted back the joyful sound that she had made a gallant
                        charge and broken the Radical ranks. Ohio struck with the strength of
                        Hercules, and felled the monster, negro equality, to the earth. Our own
                        grand old Commonwealth, moving magisterially to the conflict, freed herself
                        from the rue of Radical notions. And now, from every quarter come the glad
                        tidings of the Democratic gains and Radical losses. New York, the Empire
                        State, greatest of all in population and wealth, had administered a scathing
                        rebuke to fanaticism. Gallant New Jersey has redeemed her honor and covered
                        herself all over with glory. In Maryland, the Conservative current has run
                        with such tremendous volume that it has submerged Radicalism in every
                        county. Not a single Radical county officer has been elected in that State.
                        Kansas--the scene of John Brown's infamous exploits--the State which has
                        been most ultra of all the younger States of the Union--recoils from the
                        teachings of her New England settlers and turns her back upon the poor
                        negro. Wisconsin and Minnesota tell the same story, and even
                        Massachusetts--the hot bed of Radicalism--has been visited by a chilling and
                        blighting frost which threatens to utterly destroy the poisonous plants
                        which she has been nurturing with so much care. </p>
                    <p>From all these indications, we augur the early overthrow of Radicalism in
                        this country. It bids fair to be complete also. "The will of the people is
                        the law of the land," says General Grant. "The voice of the people is the
                        supreme law" says the military contributor to the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Repository </emph>. <emph rend="italic">Now, the people have spoken;
                            let them be obeyed.</emph> Their utterance cannot be mistaken. They have
                        willed that the character of our government shall not be changed, and that
                        the ideas of a few New England fanatics shall not be engrafted into our
                        political system, but that the fundamental principles upon which this
                        government was founded and which it was intended to subserve, shall remain
                        obligatory upon the people, to bind the States to each other and all to the
                        Federal Government. </p>

                    be heading toward reconciliation, report the editors. As proof they point to the

                <summary>Because he is the leader of the Radical faction in the House of
                    Representatives, the editors avow, Thad Stevens is personally to blame for vast
                    array of problems effected by Republican rule, including the "subversion of
                    civil authority" and the establishment of "negro supremacy" in the South. It is
                    the hope of the editors, however, that Stevens will heed the "warnings from the
                    results of the November election" and abandon "his war against the interests of
                    the white race."</summary>

                <head>The Union Pacific Railroad--All Rail To The Rocky Mountain</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt>"The National importance of a railroad to the Pacific can hardly be
                    overestimated."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Not even this country of great achievements has ever before undertaken any
                        industrial enterprise so important as the building of a railway to the
                        Pacific ocean. Less than twenty years ago, Col. Benton advocated in Congress
                        a railroad, "where practicable," across the country from the Mississippi to
                        the Pacific coast; but his moderate proposal was considered to be far in
                        advance even of this progressive age. And yet to day, more than one-third of
                        the vast work has been finished. The Union Pacific Railroad Company,
                        organized in 1863, began to build in 1864, had only fairly got to work in
                        1865, and in October, 1867, have completed five hundred miles of road which
                        has been pronounced by Government Commissioners first-class in construction
                        and equipment.--This Company is constructing the eastern end of the line,
                        beginning at Omaha, Nebraska, while the Central Pacific Company is building
                        the western end, beginning at Sacramento, California.</p>
                    <p>The peculiar and impressive features of the Pacific Railroad are: 1st, Its
                        importance as a national enterprise, 2d, The especial privileges granted to
                        it by the Government; and 3d, The unusual care taken by the Government
                        enactments for the safety of investment in its securities.</p>
                    <p>The national importance of a railroad to the Pacific can hardly be
                        overestimated. The Government is spending millions of dollars annually in
                        transporting men and material to its frontier posts; with a railroad in
                        operation, this expense will be reduced at least three-fourths. The gold and
                        silver mine of the Western States and Territories yield annually about one
                        hundred million dollars; with the increased facilities for emigration, and
                        for transporting the requisite machinery for the thorough development of the
                        mining region which a railroad will afford, this production will at least be
                        doubled. The public land in Nebraska and the Territories west of that State
                        have been comparatively worthless, because they were inaccessible, and,
                        consequently unproductive; the Union Pacific Railroad opens all the great
                        valley of the River Platte and vast regions beyond to the occupancy of
                        thrifty emigrants, and has already established such a succession of thriving
                        towns as will bring all land in the vicinity of the railroad into active
                        demand. In case of foreign war or domestic revolution, the existence of a
                        railway line, by which troops could be conveyed from the Atlantic to the
                        Pacific, or <emph rend="italic">vie versa</emph> in a week would be of
                        incalculable value; while under any circumstances of internal trouble,
                        necessitating a repetition in kind of the Utah expedition, the saving to the
                        Government by means of this road would be enough to construct the entire
                        line. Gen. Sherman has said that "The Government could afford to build the
                        whole road rather than be without it," and there are abundant reasons for
                        pronouncing this opinion a sound one. </p>
                    <p>So great are the manifest national advantages to be derived from a Pacific
                        Railroad, that the two powerful companies authorized to build it received
                        very extraordinary grants from Congress. Donations of land were made to the
                        companies to the amount of 12,800 acres per mile; and then United States
                        bonds, to an average amount of about $30,000 per mile were advanced to the
                        Companies, which have the privilege of paying a large part, if not all, of
                        this indebtedness to the Government by the transportation of mail and war
                        and other national material. No other industrial enterprise ever received so
                        liberal aid from the Government as this.</p>
                    <p>Having made such special grants as indicated its entire confidence in the
                        full success of the undertaking, the Government took unusual care that those
                        who joined with it in assisting the Union Pacific Railroad Company should be
                        amply secured against any probability of loss or failure. The Company was
                        authorized to issue its own bonds to an amount equal to the advances of the
                        Government, and these bonds constituted the first mortgage upon the road,
                        the claim of the Government being made a second lieu. The Government
                        appoints five Directors, who shall look carefully after the management of
                        the road; and also three commissioners whose duty it is to thoroughly
                        inspect each section of twenty miles, before the bonds can be issued upon
                        that section. Thus the bonds represent, not a projected enterprise, which
                            <emph rend="italic">may </emph> be completed, but a finished and
                        equipped railroad, earning very largely in excess of its expenses and with a
                        future which cannot fail of being eminently profitable. </p>
                    <p>The future business of the only railroad connecting the Atlantic and Pacific
                        states must be something marvelous, and we venture the prediction that no
                        single track will long accommodate the endless succession of trains that
                        will crowd its entire line. Western Europe is waiting for it, as the
                        shortest route to eastern Asia; and have many anxious hearts in the old home
                        states are longing for it, to join hands with friends and relatives, without
                        the cost and risk of long, dreary and dangerous voyage in a crowded steamer
                        along two oceans.</p>
                    <p>But if the business of the complete line is to be something marvelous, the
                        local business on the sections already finished is not less satisfactory.
                        The earnings on three hundred and twenty-five miles for a single quarter
                        this season are officially reported at one million dollars, and as the road
                        goes further towards the great mining regions, this sum must be increased.</p>
                    <p>Every reader of this paper is interested in the rapid prosecution of this
                        work. Every new agricultural or manufacturing community established by the
                        opening of this road will add to the national wealth and aid in paying the
                        public debt. Every acre of land hitherto unimproved, which shall now be
                        cultivated, increases the store of food for our own population or for
                        export. every additional ton of gold or silver that is mined puts money in
                        the public purse. The road will be the great agent in the development of the
                        American continent, and its completion in 1870 will benefit an entire
                        population. With such a future before it as the finished line is certain to
                        have, and with so many guarantees for the protection of the interests of

                    Wanamaker was en route to Gettysburg when his horses took fright near the summit
                    of South Mountain and began running a wild fashion down until they encountered
                    another buggy coming from the opposite direction. Wanamaker was thrown from his
                    wagon, though he suffered no serious injuries. One of the horses (which was
                    owned by Robert Black) was struck in the groin with a pole, however. It is not
                    expected to live. In the second, John Huber's four-horse team ran off from
                    George A. Dietz's warehouse.</summary>
