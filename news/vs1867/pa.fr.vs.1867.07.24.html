<b>The Late Radical Convention</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Employing a series of quotes taken from speeches delivered at a temperance
					convention held on June 16th, the article contends that there is an unholy link
					between the temperance movement and the Radicals' drive to grant blacks
					suffrage.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lancaster Intelligencer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In the Intelligencer  of June 16th, 1867, I find
						the proceedings of a Black Republican body which
						met under the false pretense of being a Temperance Convention; and I detach
						a few gems from the masses of verbiage, to show that Democrats, and farmers
						with German names, of whatever political party, cannot affiliate with such
						"narrow minded blockheads." Although myself one of the so-called "Stolid
						Dutch in the northern end of Lancaster county," I express no surprise that
						the epithet of stolid  of "Dr. Gibbons" (whoever
						he may be) was received with approbation by the Convention, and that the
						bloodhounds of Zion present did not call him to order. </p>
					<p>The temperance cause is a growing power; it is making progress everywhere,
						even among the stolid Dutch in the northern end
						of Lancaster county; a soil so barren that I never expected to see such good
						fruit grow on it.-Dr. Gibbons. </p>
					<p>They had been told slavery was a thing of politics and not to be touched by
						the pulpit; but the pulpits of the North had been the
							main agency in working out the great revolution through which we
						have passed.-Rev. C. I. Thompson</p>
					<p>There is one grand over towering question to be settled-the question of the
						social and political equality of all men, without distinction as to race or
						color. Slavery is dead, but its spirit still lives, and the spirit which
						would deny to the black man the equal rights and
						privileges with the white.-Dr. Gibbons. </p>
					<p>The anti-slavery party was not strong until it succeeded in uniting itself
						with one of the great political parties of the country * * * If you show me
						a truly earnest temperance man I will answer for it, in almost every case,
						that he is a faithful and honest advocate of the political and social
						equality of races and classes.-Rev. C. I.
						Thompson. </p>
					<p>He thought the hydra of slavery was no quite dead. If it was he wanted to
						know what there was to induce Congress to assemble in the midst of the dog
						days. He was sure they would wipe out all the crudities of Attorney General
						Stanberry. The temperance man he though should work in secret as did that
						great and good party known under the sacred title of
							Know-Nothing.-Wm. P. Roberts. </p>
					<p>God has sleeted this country as the theatre on which to work out his
						mightiest problems.-Rev. J. C. Cromlish. </p>
					<p>According to this, omniscience must actually work problems on a theatre; and
						we remember that Lincoln was removed to make room for one who, having
						suffered from the rebels, would play-Parsons Brownslow with them! which the
						amiable President would not do. This at least was the 'problem' as stated by
						the bloodhounds of Zion, who "had reason to believe" that the rebels
						"could'nt fool Andy Johnson."</p>
					<p>Here all moral agencies are to war against evil. Such being the case there
						have been but two political parties permitted to exist in the past-the one
						party of morality, and the other party of immorality.-Rev. J. C. Cromlish. </p>
					<p>The robbers at the State Capitol, those who whip children to death, hangers
						of Mrs. Surratt, Butler, Neal Dow, Stevens and Mrs. ----. (not to
						particularize a seduction case at Gettysburg), Sereno How, (clergyman,
						educator, legislator and temperance man), whoremongers and strumpets in the
						Treasury Department, with this small-headed Cromlish ("such being the case")
						bringing up the rump and rear of the so-called God-and-morality party.</p>
					<p>The man who is immoral in one point is immoral in all; the party which
						advocates the continuance of one cause of immorality will be found ready to
						advocate all other immoralities.-Rev. J. C.
						Cromlish</p>
					<p>This is according to the Sunday School dictum, that "if a boy will lie he
						will steal, and if he will steal he will murder." But contrary to this view,
						gamblers are noted for not  being drunkards, and
						Sereno Howe was probably a strict temperance man. </p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The brief piece calls on voters to support George Sharswood in the upcoming

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>THERE is one thing concerning the candidates for the Supreme Bench should not

						State, and is a true Pennsylvanian. He has been identified with the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"We commend the following article from the pen of Horace Greeley, Editor
					of the New York Tribune, to our readers, and especially our Republican readers.
					Mr. Greeley shows up this Jacobin association in its true colors. No true
					soldier can belong to it, for as Mr. Greeley truly says, "The true soldier is
					the generous foeman," and you do not "find Grant, or Sherman, or Sheridan, or
					Thomas, or Meade, assembling together and howlng for more blood, more strife,
					more bitterness." These societies are simply intended to be used be crafty,
					bold, bad men, as so many instruments for their own advancement. They are
					dangerous to liberty, and dangerous to the peace and welfare of the country. It
					is duty of every patriotic citizen toput the seal of his condemnation upon this
					nefarious organization, as Mr. Greeley has done in the following article:"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Mr. Henry W. Bennett, of Davenport, Iowa, sends us a respectful letter, and
						it shall receive a respectful reply. We had occasion some days since, while
						commenting upon the meeting of Congress, to speak our mind of an association
						known as "The Grand Army of the Republic." We spoke with severity, because
						we felt the occasion had arrived for a severe expression of opinion. We
						understand the Grand Army of the Republic to be a secret society, composed
						of persons calling themselves discharged soldiers of the army, with the
						purpose of taking part in politics. Mr. Bennett rather denies this, but we
						are not satisfied with his denial. We scarcely ever can take up a certain
						class of Western papers without finding that some "Post" of the G. A. R. has
						had a meeting, and resolved that everything is going wrong, and that nothing
						will go right until some are hanged and everybody has a confiscated farm.</p>
					<p>In the first place, we call this organization unrepublican. Secret
						associations for social purposes, to aid in charity, or to develope virtue
						and friendship, are very well. They rarely interfere with anybody. If people
						find amusements in meeting in guarded rooms, and wearing spangled dresses,
						and calling themselves sachems, and brothers, and comrades, soldiers of
						Gideon and sons of Rechab, it is their own business.-We may doubt their
						taste, but a man's tastes concerns only himself. When a secret society goes
						beyond the offices of charity and friendship, it takes no root in America.
						These men combine for political purposes. They propose to keep alive the
						wrath and bitterness of that dreadful time. They mean to control conventions
						to nominate men for office-to perpetuate in our civil system the bitterness
						of war. We believe the soldier should receive abundant reward. When a
						soldier and a civilian apply for office, all things else being equal, we
						should prefer the soldier. But we dislike this making a privilege class, and
						especially we dislike this getting into a corner, and having passwords and
						grips, and making an exclusive class. Washington foresaw this when he
						opposed the Society of the Cincinnati. He saw in that association the first
						step toward an aristocracy, and he declined to ally himself with it.-What
						Washington said should be remembered now. Here is an association more
						numerous and more powerful than the Cincinnati, which proposes to ever keep
						alive a war with brothers and fellow-countrymen, to exult in victories over
						Americans, to rejoice over the destruction of men in whose blue veins runs
						the blood which courses in our own, and who, whatever their crimes or
						errors, are of our own country. We say, let all the fearful memories of the
						past sink into the hell to which they belong; let us think only of wounds to
						be healed, of harvests to grow again, of seas once more covered with our
						commerce, education for the ignorant, protection to the oppressed, justice
						to all.</p>
					<p>There are crafty, bold, bad men who look upon these societies as so many
						instruments for their own advancement. They propose to ally themselves with
						this military sentiment, with no more claim upon it than Thenardier in
						Hugo's novel had to be called the Sergeant of Waterloo. He followed the
						army, and robbed the bodies of the slain. The true soldier sheathes his
						sword and buries it in his closet, and it remains an heirloom. He becomes a
						citizen, and makes no claim for political honor but that of citizenship.
						Above all these things he does not carry his epaulets and ribbons, his
						wounds and bruises to a political convention, to be knocked down to the
						highest bidder. There may be many of these men unwittingly in this Army of
						the Republic, who probably entered with the views of Mr. Bennett. They will
						soon see how they may better occupy their time.</p>
					<p>Especially do we entertain these views when we find the declarations of these
						secret soldier associations so many expressions of madness. The true soldier
						is the most generous of foemen. Take the great captains who commanded the
						contending hosts. Do we find Grant, or Sherman, or Sheridan, or Thomas, or
						Meade, assembling or howling for more blood, more strife, more bitterness?
						Do we find Lee, or Longstreet, or Johnson, or Beauregard insisting that the
						hates of secession shall be prolonged? These men fought their fight and
						ended. Their anger ceased with the echo of the last guns fired in anger.</p>
					<p>From this Grand Army of the Republic now parading through conventions in the
						West, commanded by the captains of the caucus, the lobby, and bar room, we
						appeal to the Grand Army of the Republic which carried our banners over a
						hundred fields under the eye of Grant, Sherman and Sheridan. We denounce
						this new secret association as out of sympathy with the true Republican
						party, and as inimical to the Constitution and the Union, It will be a sad
						day for our party when soldiers find no better work than to prowl over the
						battle-fields of the past, and dig up the slain. The country wants peace,
						and rest, and harmony, and justice. These men want a distracted country that
						offices may be gained. They would make America a Mexico, peace would be sent
						to sleep with Turks and infidels, and, instead of Union, they would "the
						wofullest division make that ever fell upon this cursed earth."</p>
