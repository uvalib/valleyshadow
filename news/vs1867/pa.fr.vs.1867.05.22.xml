                <transcript>
                    <p>Jefferson Davis was brought before the United States District Court at
                        Richmond on a writ of <emph rend="italic">habeus corpus</emph>, on Monday,
                        the 13th inst., and released on bail. The amount of the bond was fixed at
                        $100,000, and Horace Greely of the New York <emph rend="italic">Tribune
                        </emph>, who had gone to Richmond for that purpose, was the first to sign
                        the bond. Gerrit Smith, another noted Abolitionist, is also one of his
                        bondsmen, together, with eighteen others, mostly citizens of Virginia,
                        including John Minor Botts. This, in all probability, is the last we shall
                        ever hear of the trial of Jefferson Davis for treason. On this point the
                        Lancaster Intelligencer speaks as follows: </p>
                    <p>The persistent refusal of Chief Justice Chase to try Mr. Davis was not
                        understood by the people; because the majority of them did not know that he
                        feared to trust himself in the position of Judge in such a case. He is a man
                        of some considerable ability, but he never won any distinction as a lawyer.
                        His practice never amounted to anything, and his appointment to the position
                        he now occupies was one of Mr. Lincoln's most unmistakable blunders. Had he
                        felt himself competent to manage the trial of Jefferson Davis, the great
                        State prisoner would have been arraigned within three months of his capture.
                        Mr. Chase's consciousness of his incompetency was the cause of great
                        embarrassment to the government. What to do with Jeff. Davis was the
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The whole management of this prisoner has been in scandalous violation of all
                        known law, in violation of all fairness, and of every precedent to be found
                        in the history of free governments. It is a blot on the fair fame of this
                        nation which can never be effaced.</p>
                    <p>What will be done with Jefferson Davis, now that he has been released on
                        bail, remains to be seen. We are of the opinion that he will never be tried.
                        We hope he may be. We would like to see him have a fair and impartial, but a
                        searching trial, conducted as so important a trial should be. We do not
                        expect it, however. Mr. Jeffer-Davis has been set at liberty; and we do not
                        suppose Mr. Horace Greeley will ever be called upon to produce the prisoner
                        or to answer to his recognizance in Court. The scene in the United States
                        Court at Richmond is the last public one in which Jefferson Davis will ever
                        take part.</p>

                <summary>In the wake of Jeff Davis's release on bail, the article surmises that this
                    is "the last we shall ever hear" of his trial for treson. The failure to
                    adjudicate the Davis case rests solely on the shoulders of Chief Justice Chase,
                    who did not feel sufficiently "competent" to preside over the proceedings. The
                    treatment of Davis "has been in scandalous violation of all law" and "is a blot
                    on the fair name of the nation which can never be effaced."</summary>

                <summary>The editors claim that an address given by William Kelley, "whose
                    blackguardism long ago made him notorious throughout Pennsylvania," touched off
                    a riot in New Orleans, which resulted in the deaths of three blacks and two
                    whites. The piece also includes a report on a disturbance that occurred at a
                    Republican convention in Tennessee on April 13th. The strife there was allegedly
                    sparked by the speech of a black orator who made deragatory comments about
                    whites. This incident, the editors note, "appears to have been purely a family
                    fight between black and white Radicals."</summary>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Forney's press has the following:</p>
                    <p>"The Secretary of War will be compelled to issue an order suspending the
                        payment of additional or other bounties to soldiers and their heirs, until
                        some appropriation for that purpose is made by Congress, the funds already
                        appropriated being exhausted. As Congress will not in all probability meet
                        again until December, the soldiers and their families must make up their
                        minds to bear some further delay."</p>
                    <p>This is the direct result of the reckless expenditures authorized by the
                        Radicals in the Rump Congress. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were
                        squandered within the past year for the mere purpose of making political
                        capital for the Radical party, and to satisfy the insatiable appetites of
                        its leaders for plunder. About five hundred thousand dollars were taken from
                        the Federal Treasury to pay the extra "compensation" to the members of Rump
                        No. 1. Several million dollars were taken to pay the twenty percent.
                        Additional compensation authorized to department clerks. About forty-five
                        thousand dollars were distributed to the worthless negroes of Washington
                        City, in addition to the regular support of the negro Bureau. Hundreds of
                        thousands of dollars were wasted in carrying on the New Orleans negro riot
                        investigation and sowing the country broadcast with a voluminous and costly
                        report of "testimony." An equally heavy sum has disappeared in Ashley's
                        insane political project of impeachment. Millions have gone into the pockets
                        of political favorites through a most corrupt system of private legislation.
                        Five hundred thousand dollars were set aside to commence the execution of
                        the satrap bills, but, during the first two months, over twenty-four million
                        dollars were expended by the War Department, and the end of the year will
                        bring the bills up to at least one hundred and forty millions!</p>
                    <p>These are some of the channels through which the income of the government has
                        gone out, leaving nothing with which to pay the soldiers' bounties and
                        pensions. But the whole trouble does not consist in the enlargement of the
                        channels of expenditure. The channels of income have been clogged and closed
                        up. The exemption list was enlarged, by which less revenue is derived from
                        income. Then, the inauguration of a despotic and destructive policy of
                        government for the Southern States has retarded the material prosperity of
                        ten great States, and kept out of the Federal Treasury millions of dollars
                        which should have gone into it during the past year, and will cause the loss
                        of hundreds of millions which under an enlightened policy, should be
                        realized during the ensuing year. Disfranchisement is paralyzing the hands
                        of hundreds of thousands of Southern men who are willing and anxious to
                        engage in planting and other industrial pursuits. Outlawed and made
                        politically powerless to protect themselves or their property, they can feel
                        no interest in the welfare of the government. Under the negro Radical
                        despotism now in process of formation they will have no rights which a negro
                        will be bound to respect. To add to these disabilities and misfortunes,
                        "mild confiscation" is threatened by one branch of the Radical leadership
                        and "rigorous and universal confiscation" by another branch, so that there
                        is nothing left for the rightful owners of the soil and latent wealth of
                        those States to do but to await in silence and apathy the last blow which is
                        to make them beggars as well as outlaws.</p>
                    <p>This course of the Radical leaders towards the Southern people has not only
                        prevented the flow of revenue from the Southern States but has largely cut
                        down the income from the Northern States. At this time-two years after the
                        final close of the war-every Northern factory and workshop should be busy,
                        employing every willing pair of hands to be hired, in turning out machinery
                        and fabrics for Southern consumption. But such is not the state of affairs.
                        The people of the outlawed States, crushed and threatened as they are, have
                        no need of farming implements or machinery, consequently thousands of
                        Northern work people are idle and less revenue goes from the Northern States
                        into the Federal Treasury. Hence, with these drawbacks and the reckless and
                        infamous squanderings of the Rump Congress, there is no money to pay
                        soldiers' bounties and pensions, and "the soldiers and their families must
                        make up their minds to bear some further delay."</p>
                    <p>Had the Constitution been taken as a governing principle by the Radical
                        leaders, there would no necessity for delay. The Union was restored by the
                        Federal soldiers when the last rebel army laid down its arms, and from that
                        time forth the Southern States were entitled to representation and a share
                        in their own government, through men of good character for truth, honesty
                        and patriotism. The Constitution grants authority to Congress to determine
                        the "elections and qualifications of its members," and in that grant the
                        government possessed every safeguard against a renewal of secession in high
                        places. The resort to the unauthorized and destructive plan of reducing
                        States to a territorial condition, as a punishment for individual crimes,
                        has resulted as disastrously as was to be expected from a scheme of so
                        unlawful, unjustifiable and despotic. These facts should be carefully
                        pondered by not only those who suffer from delayed bounties, but by every
                        Northern manufacturer and workingman.-<emph rend="italic">Patriot &amp;

                    <p>The slight threatening are beginnings of riots in Richmond, on Saturday, do
                        not indicate serious trouble. There seems to have been white men in that
                        city who have given the colored people bad counsel, which some of them have
                        been foolish enough to take. Contrasted with this local and partial disorder
                        is the general excellent and moderate behavior of the freedmen throughout
                        the South, by which they should rightly be judged.-<emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune </emph></p>
                    <p>In spite of the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph>'s attempt to belittle the
                        riots, authentic intelligence from Richmond makes it evident that a
                        saturnalia of carnage is prevented in that city only by the vigilance and
                        alertness of the United States troops. That the negroes need to be overawed
                        and terrified is proved by the speeches made in the African Church, on
                        Sunday night, by Judge Underwood and Horace Greeley. Judge Underwood warned
                        them, by repeating what one of the general had said to him during the day,
                        namely, "that there was a possibility of a riot being made by the negroes
                        to-morrow, <emph rend="italic">and that if there was, he would plant cannon
                            and swept the streets with grape-shot</emph>"-When the rabid and ribald
                        Underwood finds it necessary to go into a negro church and utter such a
                        warning, the volcano of riotous passions must be on the point of a great
                        eruption. Mr. Greeley's speech, as reported, consisted almost entirely in a
                        dissuasion from riots. The fact that the Eleventh United States Infantry is
                        to encamp permanently at the City Springs Park, within the city limits,
                        shows the necessity which General Schofield things himself under of using
                        vigorous measures of repression. The arrest of the Massachusetts Radical,
                        Hayward, for using incendiary language, and the putting him under heavy
                        bonds; the beating of the policemen by negroes; the patrolling of the
                        streets by mounted soldiers; the stationing of squads of policemen at all
                        the churches on Sunday to protect the worshippers against negro outrages;
                        and the excited threats made by the negro populace, are evidence of a most
                        violent and inflammatory state of feeling. </p>
                    <p>The contrast suggested by the <emph rend="italic">Tribune </emph> between the
                        conduct of the negroes in the Southern cities and the great mass of them on
                        the plantations, is instructive. It affords a correct clue to the cause of
                        the riots.-The negroes on the plantations came into contact only with
                        southern whites, and reports from all parts of the South concur in showing
                        that in the rural districts the freedmen are increasingly orderly and
                        industrious, and there is a gratifying friendliness of sentiment between the
                        two races. Why is it different in New Orleans and Richmond? For no other
                        reason than because in the cities the raving and incendiary Radicals have
                        easy access to the negroes, and are exerting all their energy and ingenuity
                        to breed mischief. If the torch-and-turpentine Radicals would forbear to
                        stir up strive, the great problem of Southern society would solve itself in
                        a peaceful, order, fraternal manner. </p>
                    <p>These plotters of disorder refuse to let the South alone because it is
                        apparent that, if things are left to take their course, the freedmen will
                        recognize the identity of interests between themselves and their section,
                        and that their vote will not go to strengthen the Republican party.
                        Perpetual discord and dissension between the two races is necessary to
                        enable that party to reap the crop which it has sown. When the Radicals find
                        that, through the freedmen vote, they are not likely to vote with <emph
                            rend="italic">them</emph>, they begin to conclude that their advocacy of
                        negro suffrage was a political blunder, unless they can detach the negroes
                        from the Southern whites. The South will have a larger representation in
                        Congress and more power in the government in consequence of emancipation.
                        Unless, therefore, the South can be divided, and the negroes organized as a
                        wing of the Republican party, the Radicals have been <emph rend="italic"
                            >fabricating </emph> a weapon for their own destruction. It is for this
                        reason that they are making desperate efforts to array race against race. In
                        inflaming the passions of the negroes up to the point of riotous outbreaks,
                        the more considerate and crafty Radicals are sensible that they have
                        overshot the mark. It is their policy to foster hatred, but to make it run
                        only in the political channels. The instigation of the riots and the
                        inauguration of a war of races tend to recoil which will bring the party
                        into odium. Hence, the energy with which the rascally Judge Underwood, whose
                        infuriated charge so powerfully simulated the present dangerous state of
                        feeling, is exerting himself to prevent an eruption of negro violence.

                <summary>After lampooning an article in the Tribune that described the behavior of
                    the freedmen as "excellent and moderate," the editors contend that the actions
                    of blacks in Richmond during the most recent melee contradict any such
                    declaration. "A saturnalia of carnage" was prevented in Virginia's capital, they
                    insist, only because blacks fled the scene following the arrival of U. S.
                    troops. The editors attribute the violence plaguing the South to the presence of
                    blacks in the region's urban centers; there they encounter "raving and
                    incendiary Radicals" who exert "all their energy and ingenuity to breed
                    mischief." In contrast, they argue, blacks on plantations only come into contact
                    with southern whites, hence "there is gratifying friendliness between the two
                    races."</summary>

                    <p>If an election of any kind were to be held in the South within the next month
                        there is no reasonable doubt, that three-fourths of the negro vote would be
                        cast with the Southern white vote. There is a perfect accord between the
                        larger portion of freedmen and the white population. This is but natural.
                        The negroes were as ardent enemies of the North as their masters during the
                        war. They had no theories to sustain, and no special care as to what
                        questions were involved in the contest. They sympathized with the people who
                        surrounded them; and if the oath of allegiance were distinctly understood by
                        the freedmen when it is administered to them, nine-tenths of them would be
                        unable to say that they had not lent willing aid and comfort to the
                        rebellion. Having stood firmly by their masters in the trials of the war,
                        they are still likely to stand by them in all public questions. It seem to
                        be from a knowledge and appreciation of these facts that the men who are
                        seeking to use the negro vote for partisan purpose find it necessary to
                        delude the poor fellows with promises of a division of the lands among them.
                        The question for the freedman now serious ought to be how to establish a
                        regular and permanent system of paid labor, and how to fix the rate of
                        payment so as to approximate as nearly as may be to the old rate-namely a
                        support for the laborer and his family, in sickness and health, childhood
                        and old age. But the interference of politicians is operating to prevent the
                        determination of these questions and postpone the day of calm settling down.
                        It is impossible to regard the speech-making missions of Northern
                        politicians to the Southern negroes as anything but injurious to them. It
                        is, in fact, adding the final blow to their ruin as a people. Unless they
                        settle down to work, and take the position of laborers whose labor is
                        necessary, and must be cherished and cared for, they will rapidly perish.
                        The suffrage is in danger of providing the destruction of the race. It would
                        ordinarily take a generation to learn the requirements of the new order of
                        things. Where the interests of the employers are so deeply involved in the
                        education of the employed, the process of accommodation to the new system
                        might be much more rapid. But the temptations to idleness which political
                        speakers are offering them are too strong to be resisted by their feeble
                        intellects, and they are easily led to ruin. They would go much faster if
                        the promises were fulfilled. If the lands were divided among them, and they
                        were made to depend upon their own labor for the product of their own farms,
                        the race would melt away in two or three generations.</p>
                    <p>The Southern negro is very much like a hot-house plant. He needs constant
                        care and advice. Exposure is dangerous. It is astonishing to observe how
                        many of them seem to be ill, how few are free from coughs and indications of
                        disease. They know nothing about taking care of themselves.-They require
                        advice, watching and constant help. These are the general truths, while the
                        exceptions serve by contrast to make the common rule more visible.</p>
                    <p>The future, therefore, looks doubtful to the Southern people. There is reason
                        to fear that the negro race will disappear. Already it is plain that it will
                        not be able to supply the demand for labor which is sure to be made within a
                        few years. The indications are that they will diminish from year to year,
                        while the demand will increase in more rapid ration. If these questions were
                        left to the management of Southern men they would be considered with great
                        care, and the utmost attention would be paid to the comfort and well-being
                        of the freedmen. The best friends they have in the world are Southern
                        employers, and their worst enemies are those who, however honestly, are
                        seeking to divert their attention from the primary question of bread and
                        clothing, and shelter, to the work of governing a great nation. Unfit at
                        present to feed themselves, they ought to be spared the miserable delusion
                        of thinking they are fit to make laws for the world or the greatest nation
                        in it. The direction of their minds toward such subjects results in their
                        absolute destruction, physical as well as moral.</p>
                    <p>There are many reason for believing that the tendency of things in the South
                        is toward the breaking up of the old system of large plantations employing
                        many hands. These will continue in some sections because no other system can
                        be made to work successfully. But it will not be strange if the general rule
                        shall hereafter be more like that at the North; where the farmer cultivates
                        a small farm, requiring but a few hands. Here comes in, however, the
                        question of emigration-wether it can be turned to the South, and how. The
                        world's history as shown that emigration does not tend warm climates. But
                        here are inducements such as were never before offered. A land once teeming
                        with abundance, rich soil which rewards labor ten-fold, the prospect of
                        crops which are more valuable than mines of gold, the certainty that the
                        soil will yield support to the laborer and his family from the time that the
                        seed grows, these and other reasons may tempt the emigrant.</p>

                <summary>Alleging that "there is perfect accord between the larger portion of the
                    freedmen and the white population," the article insists that an organic bond
                    links the two groups together. In fact, if an election were held "within the
                    next month there is no reasonable doubt that three-fourths" of the black vote
                    would "be cast with the Southern white vote." Any strife between the races,
                    therefore, is the result of meddling by northern whites who seek to advance
                    their own interests.</summary>

                    <p>While the Yankees are making such a "big fuss" about negro equality, Nature
                        is doing more to make, Titus Pines a colored "gemmen" in our town, a white
                        man with "<emph rend="italic">verbatim et literatim</emph>" than all the
                        ingenuity of New England ever can do. During the "Seven days" fight at
                        Richmond Titus noticed a white spot on his arm, which was at least skin
                        deep, as water and soap would not take it off. Since that time this spot has
                        been increasing in size and the same change has been gradually progressing
                        on different parts of his body, till about one third of the surface is
                        white. And strange to say: where this change has been effected the skin is
                        as soft and white as that of an infant. Titus says "he is going to be a
                        white man before long. He experiences no unpleasant sensation, is not sick
                        but enjoys as good health as ever he did and "<emph rend="italic">peys
                        incaf</emph>" at his trade every day. Come down Mr. Barnum, take Titus
                        around and show the Yanks the only way the negro can ever be made a white
                            man.-<emph rend="italic">Page Valley Courier</emph></p>
