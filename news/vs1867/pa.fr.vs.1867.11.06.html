<b>Seven Years of Radicalism</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the editors, Republican rule has had a devastating effect on
                    the country. They have burdened the American public with bloody conflict,
                    rampant corruption, and costly taxes. But now, the editors say, it appears as
                    though the "doom" cast by Radical rule is approaching an end.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It was just seven years yesterday since Abraham Lincoln was elected President
                        of the United States. Although a Western man himself, with a possible
                        inclination to conservatism, his accession to the Presidential chair put the
                        government completely under the control of the fanatical Radicals of New
                        England. These authors of the Kansas troubles and patrons of the John Brown
                        raid into Virginia had made up their mind to revolutionize the government,
                        and in Abraham Lincoln they found an instrument adapted to their purpose. As
                        first as his dull intellect was able to comprehend their designs, he fell in
                        with them and used all his official power to crush the Constitution, under
                        whose forms he had been elevated to the Chief
                        Magistracy, against the will of a large majority of the people. War came
                        because the Radicals wanted it, and lasted four years because the Radicals
                        were unwilling to end it in two. It required time
                        , even under the demoralizing influences of a gigantic civil war, to
                        bring the people to look with complacency upon the destruction of a
                        government which they had so long been accustomed to regard as "the best
                        ever devised by the wisdom of man." New England ideas prevailed at last, and
                        at the end of these eventful seven years we find ourselves with a dissevered
                        Union, a subverted Constitution, and an altered form of government. </p>
                    <p>This is what seven years of Radicalism have ended in, but this is not all
                        that Radicalism has cost us. We have paid out over four thousand million
                        dollars in money, at least one-half of which went as stealing to shouting
                        "patriots." We have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives, dotted the
                        country over with mutilated human beings, and with helpless widows and
                        children. Property to an immense extent has been destroyed, and the
                        productive industry of the country has sustained injuries which fifty ears
                        cannot repair. From a lightly taxed people we have become the heaviest taxed
                        in the world. All that we eat and all that we wear--all that we produce and
                        all that we consume--is taxed. From the swaddling clothes of the new-born
                        babe down to the last nail in the coffin's lid everything is taxed to pay
                        the cost of these seven years of Radicalism. The picture of the last seven
                        years is dark, but a gleam of sunshine has been thrown upon us at last. This
                        fall's elections show that the public mind is awakening to the enormities of
                        Radical misrule. Honest, fair-minded and well-disposed Republicans are
                        beginning to see through the schemes of the New England revolutionists. The
                        candid admission of Thaddeus Stevens that the Rump Congress has been acting
                        outside of the Constitution, and that he and his associates want no reunion
                        that does not bring negro equality with it, has given them a new view of
                        public affairs. Their eyes will be still further opened during the
                        approaching session of Congress, and thee is reason to hope that the
                        elections of next year will seal the doom of Radicalism and rescue our
                        government from the evil control of the malignant fanatics of New
                    England.</p>

<b>Money</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors attribute the current economic problems in England and the U.
                    S. to the Republicans' "disastrous" economic policies. Of particular concern for
                    the editors is the failure to revive cotton production, which, they say, could
                    have alleviated most of the difficulties.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Money is so abundant in England, according to the London Star, that it goes begging for borrowers at 1 and 1 1/2 per
                        cent. interest, per annum! Its superabundance has an unfavorable effect on
                        trade. People who live on the interest of their money are compelled to
                        economize to an extent never before heard of, because, at the reduced rate
                        of interest, their income is cut down almost to nothing. </p>
                    <p>In the United States, on the other hand, notwithstanding the amount of paper
                        issued by the government and the National Banks, there is a great complaint
                        of scarcity of money, and the prevailing rates of interest are from 6 to 10
                        per cent., with many transactions at even higher figures.</p>
                    <p>The plethora of cash capital in England and the scarcity of it in this
                        country are owing in a great measure to the reconstruction policy of the
                        Radicals. The war cut off shipments of cotton to England, our best customer,
                        and we were obliged to send our gold and silver there in payment of our
                        purchases. The drain has gone on without interruption for seven years, and
                        we have not yet reached the end of it. If the Radicals had promptly restored
                        the Union after the surrender of Lee and Johnston, and allowed the Southern
                        people to sit down again quietly under their own vine and fig tree, with
                        none to molest them, we should ere this have drawn four or five hundred
                        million dollars of English capital here to buy our cotton. This transfer
                        would have relieved the English money market of its superabundance of cash
                        and kept the rate of interest up to it usual point. It would also have
                        averted the stringency in the money market of this country, and prevented
                        the rate of interest here from rising to the ruinous height of 10 and 12
                        percent.</p>
                    <p>Thus the Radical policy is working injury to business, both at home and
                        abroad. The only persons benefited by it are plundering officers of the
                        Freedmen's bureau and low politicians like Brownlow and Hunnicutt</p>

<b>Negro Supremacy</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In elections throughout the South, voters have come out in favor of holding
                    constitutional conventions, but, contend the editors, blacks constituted the
                    vast majority of those who cast ballots. Thus, the editors claim, the "effect of
                    the election is that the negro has not only been made the equal of the white
                    man, but has become his lord and master."<br>
