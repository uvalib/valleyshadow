<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Fools must have their day, and when our citizens have had enough of their
						absurdities we shall again relapse into moderation and good sense. But we
						cannot term the acts of the Republican leaders merely as absurdities, they
						approach more nearly the class of offenses which we call high crimes. But,
						either as absurdities or crimes, for the present, it seems they must have
						their own evil way. The disease of fanaticism has full possession of them,
						and like disorders of the body, we must allow them to exhaust themselves,
						until the patient becomes convalescent and the faculties resume their
						healthful tone. Our political antagonists are at this moment in the height
						of their frenzy, and madness rules the hour. With them the precedents
						established by the fathers of human liberty are as dust in the balance, and
						they tread upon the sacred principles of the Constitution as if they were
						the rubbish of bygone days. In this work of destruction and descreation,
						like all mono-maniacs, they believe that they are acting under a Divine
						impulse. They have a zeal without knowledge, and they mistake the delusions
						of partizan fury for patriotic feelings. They cannot be reasoned with; as
						well might the physician attempt to reason with his patient when his brain
						is in delirium. The control of the mind is lost for the time; we must wait
						the moment of returning reason, when the judgment is allowed full play to do
						the good work of regenerating and disenthralling the public mind. And let no
						Democrat despair, that moment will come as certain as there is a Providence
						guiding the affairs of men; and until it approaches let the Democracy
						"possess their souls in patience." We have some glimpses of returning reason
						even now, the dawning of a better day. That breakwater of fanaticism, the
						Supreme Court of the United States, has spoken out, and it is a source of
						comfort and congratulation that they have justified the Democracy in their
						policy during the war. All their protestation against the acts of the
						general administration have been endorsed. In the company of the Executive
						and Judicial departments of the government our party can afford to stand,
						and with complacency defy the slanders or our opponents.</p>
					<p>To stop the mouths of Democrats from sounding the alarm against the many
						false and heretical doctrines of the Republicans in the first stages of the
						war, that party introduced what is denominated the oath of allegiance, but
						which is better known as the "iron-clad oath." It was presented like a
						poisoned chalice to the lips of free and patriotic men, and because they
						refused to quaff the foul dose they were denounced as sympathizers with
						rebels, and generally traduced in unmeasured terms. When this oath was
						submitted to the court it was decided that it was in direct conflict with
						the Constitution. Were the Democracy wrong? If so what is the status of the
						Judges?</p>
					<p>The Republicans are entitled to the honor of the invention of "military
						courts," a great number of which were instituted by them, side by side with
						the constitutional courts, which were open to try and punish criminals. But
						the legal courts were ignored altogether, and military mobs proceeded to
						deal out justice, not in accordance with any code, human or divine, but in
						accordance with their own crude, uninstructed and misguided judgement. Their
						decisions will remain before the nation forever to appal them with their
						horrors. It would take years to depict the wrongs committed under the
						mockery of military trials. Against these bloody and irresponsible tribunals
						the Democracy raised a most indignant out-cry. What was the result? Oh! It
						was merely the vaporings of the copperheads. The case comes before the
						Supreme Court, composed of many judges, the majority of them appointed by
						the martyr Lincoln, and they decide unanimously
						that these courts had no legal sanction and that they were so many mobs, and
						as a consequence, every person tried by them and consigned to death was
						murdered. </p>
					<p>Again the Republican party at the dictation of a single man, have declared
						the rebel States out of the Union, and one of their cardinal views is that
						Congress shall give them territorial governments.</p>
					<p>Here again the Democracy joined issue with them, denouncing this doctrine as
						subversive of the whole tenor of the Constitution. But these were the
						utterings of traitors, and not to be regarded.</p>
					<p>The highest tribunal of the land, however, thinks differently, and, in all
						the decisions made by them since the rebellion began and since peace has
						been declared, they recognized the rebellious States as clothed with every
						attribute of sovereignty possessed by them before the rebellion began. If
						the Democracy were traitors for their utterances on this subject, what about
						the patriotism of the court?</p>
					<p>But it is well understood that the court, when this question of alien
						Southern States is directly presented, will decide the doctrine as one of
						the monstrosities of the fanaticism of the day. And what now is to be done?
						Either the party must submit to these decisions and obey the law, as good
						and faithful citizens, or they must destroy the Supreme Court. They choose
						the latter, alternative and they have in consequence opened their battery
						upon the judges. The cry is down with the Supreme Court. Where is this to
						end?</p>
					<p>We have marveled much at such stupendous folly, and asked ourselves the
						question can me be so blinded and deluded by party as to believe that there
						will be no reckoning for such criminal acts? Time will show, and we counsel
						the Democrats to bide their time patiently.</p>

<b>Progress of Revolution</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After comparing them to the Jacobins, the article asserts that the Radicals
					are leading the U.S. toward "revolution and anarchy" in the "footsteps of their
					prototypes of the French Revolution."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Jacobin faction which now holds sway in Congress is growing bolder every
						day in its onward march toward revolution and anarchy. The leaders are
						throwing off the mask and beginning to tread openly in the footsteps of
						their prototypes of the French revolution. They have already established a
						"Central Directory," corresponding with the Directory of France during the
						period of its revolution, through which unconstitutional and iniquitous laws
						are hatched in secret council for the government of the people. The next
						step is to get rid of the executive power of the nation by the impeachment
						and removal of the President as the French Jacobins got rid of the executive
						of France by bringing the head of Louis XVI to the block. For this purpose
						Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, the other day introduced a resolution into Congress
						calling for impeachment of the President and boasted that he would have him
						removed before the middle of February. But their parallel between our Jacobin congressmen of to-day and the Jacobins
						of France of 1789 does not stop here. A bill has just been introduced in
						Congress by Mr. Paine, of Wisconsin, providing for the organization of a
							National Guard, three regiments to be located
						in each Congressional district of the so-called "loyal" States, to be
						composed of one-third negroes, and to be subject to the orders of congress,
						or in other words the "Central Directory," in imitation of the "National
						Guard" of France, which, under the commands of the Directory deluged the
						streets of Paris in blood. The next step in the revolutionary programme of
						these radical Jacobins will doubtless be the erection of the guillotine on
						Pennsylvania Avenue for the summary punishment, by severing their heads from
						their bodies, of all suspected persons, or of those who have the boldness to
						question the propriety of their actions. Can it be possible that the people
						of this country are so blinded by their passions and party prejudices that
						they cannot see whither we are drifting? The lessons of history seem to be
						lost upon them while their rulers are revelling in usurped power and madly
						rushing the ship of state upon the breakers of revolution and blood.-Have
						the horrors of the French revolution no terrors for the people of this
						country? It almost seems so. </p>
					<p>In perfect keeping with the lawlessness of the times these bold bad men are
						now ferociously assailing the Supreme Court of the United States because it
						recently delivered an opinion which is likely to check them in their
						revolutionary schemes for power and plunder. Forney calls upon Congress "to
						attend to this decision at an early day," and Thad. Stevens fiercely attacks
						the Court on the floor of Congress. Thus we go, and the people dream on in
						fancied security as if nothing were going wrong, and from present
						appearances they are likely to continue dreaming until they awake some day
						to find the liberties of the country subverted and their lives and propertp
						at the mercy of a faction presuming to govern independently of all
						constitutions and laws.</p>

<b>Governor's Message</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reminding readers that Governor Curtin publicly supported President
					Johnson's Reconstruction policies last year, the editor argues that the content
					of Curtin's annual message is proof that he hopes to become the state's next
					Senator. Curtin's position regarding the restoration of the Union illustrates
					that he plans to "outradical" his opponent to secure his victory.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>To the exclusion of other matter we publish the Governor's last annual
						message, in full, in our columns to-day. It is not a very long document but
						a very weak and foolish one. The Governor evidently aimed at bidding high
						for the United States Senatorship when he wrote the message. On the question
						of reconstruction he out-radicals Thad. Stevens himself. Notwithstanding
						that in his annual message a year ago, after President Johnson had
						reorganized State governments in all the seceded States, he approved of the
						President's policy, he now has the audacity to say that "they (the Southern
						States)are without lawful governments-they are without municipal law, and
						without any claim to participate in the government." Could
						self-stultification go further? If the President's policy for the
						reorganization of the State governments in the South was right and lawful a
						year ago, it is indeed hard to conjecture how it can be wrong and unlawful
						now, and upon what principle of reasoning those States have been left
						"without lawful governments" and "without municipal law."</p>
					<p>Again, in speaking of the right of the Southern States to representation in
						Congress, the Governor says: "It would probably not be contented by the
						wildest partisan that these States had a right to be represented in Congress
						at a time when they were carrying on open war against the government." Just
						the reverse of this is the fact. Not even the "wildest partisan" pretended
						to deny their right to representation in Congress
							during the war. This is a historical fact of
						which Governor Curtin must be well acquainted, as is every man and woman of
						ordinary intelligence in the country. It was not until after the war was ended that, for base partisan purposes, their
						right to representation was seriously questioned. Was not the State of
						Tennessee engaged in "open war" against the government, and was she not
						represented in both Houses of Congress during the first two years of the
						war? Was her right to representation ever questioned during that time?
						Certainly not. We believe that Virginia was also engaged in "open war"
						against the government, and yet she was represented in the United States
						Senate during the entire period of the war, and she only lost her
						representation since the war through the death of
						Senator Bowden and the expiration of the term of John S. Carlile, and the
						refusal of the present Congress to admit their successors to the seats thus
						made vacant.-In addition to this it is a part of the history of the war that
						President Lincoln's standing proposition of peace to the South was that they
						should simply lay down their arms and fill their vacant seats in
						Congress.-Thus does the out-going Governor of Pennsylvania bid for the
						United States Senatorship by sultifying himself and falsifying the facts of
						history. We are glad to learn that his base is truckling to, the madness of
						the hour is likely to prove unsuccessful. </p>

					<p>The extraordinary expenditure, during the war and since its close, in
						payments growing out of it by authority of acts of Assembly, have amounted
						to upwards of five millions of dollars, which, added to the actual payment
						of the indebtedness of the State, and money in the Treasury for that purpose
						shows the revenues, above the ordinary expenditures to have amounted to
						$10,612,000, which would have all been applied to the payment of the debt of
						the Commonwealth in the last six years. A careful attention to the revenues
						of the Commonwealth, with such just and prudent changes as may be required
						in the future, and a wise economy in expenditure, will, in my judgement,
						ensure the entire payment of the public debt, within the period of fifteen
						years.</p>
					<p>The time fixed for the redemption of $23,108,626.24 of the indebtedness of
						the Commonwealth having expired, I recommend that provision be made for its
						redemption by making a new loan for that purpose payable at such periods as
						the prospective revenues will justify.</p>
					<p>I recur, with much satisfaction to the wisdom, prudence and economy of the
						representatives of the people, in the management of the finances of the
						Commonwealth, during a period of much embarrasment, uncertainty and
						distress, and congratulate you and them on the near approach of the entire
						liquidation of the public debt.</p>
					<p>Since my last Annual Message, I have drawn from the Treasury, two thousand
						dollars of the fund placed in the hands of the Governor for secret service
						and other extraordinary expenses, which I have expended, in payment of my
						personal staff, and for other purposes as heretofore, except five hundred
						and sixty-three dollars and forty-eight cents, which I returned into the
						Treasury.</p>
					<p>I present, for your consideration, the amendments to the Constitution of the
						United States proposed to the Legislatures of the several States by a
						resolution of both Houses of Congress, passed on the 16th day of June last.
						I was glad that it was possible, without delaying the final adoption of
						these amendments, to ascertain the opinion of our people upon them, at the
						general election, in October last. By the election of a large majority of
						members openly favoring and advocating the amendments, that opinion seems to
						me to have been abundantly expressed. Indeed, the amendments are so moderate
						and reasonable in their character, that it would have been astonishing if
						the people had failed to approve them.-That every person, born in the United
						States, and free, whether by birth or manumission, is a citizen of the
						United States, and that no State has a right to abridge the rights and
						privileges of citizens, of the United States-these are principles which were
						never seriously doubted anywhere, until after the insane crusade in favor of
						slavery had been for some time in progress. What is called the decision of
						the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Dred Scott case, has made it
						expedient and proper to re-assert these vital principles in an authoritative
						manner, and this is done in the first clause of the proposed amendments.</p>
					<p>The right of prescribing the qualifications of voters is exercised by the
						respective States, under the Constitution of 1789; three-fifths of the
						slaves were counted in ascertaining the representative population of the
						several States. The amendment to the constitution abolished slavery in all
						the States and Territories. Though it was formerly otherwise in most, if not
						all, of the old Southern States, yet for many years past free negroes have
						not, in any of these, been permitted to vote. At present, therefore, the
						late slave States would be entitled to count the whole of their former slave
						population, as a basis for representation, instead of three-fifths thereof.
						That is to say they would have in their existing ratio about twenty more
						members of Congress than they had before slavery was abolished, and the free
						States would lose the same number making a difference of about forty numbers
						of Congress, or, say, one-sixth of the whole body. In other words, the
						treason of the rebellious States, the suppression of which has cost us so
						many hundreds of thousands of precious lives, and so many thousands of
						millions of treasure, would be rewarded by giving them a vast increase of
						political power. This absurdity, the second clause of the proposed
						amendments, designs to prevent, but the just, equal and moderate provision,
						that in future, the representative population of each State shall be
						ascertained by making a proportionate deduction from the whole population
						thereof, if its laws exclude from the privilege of voting any male citizens,
						not criminals, of the age of twenty-one years. I have yet to learn that any
						plausible objection can be offered to such a provision.</p>
					<p>The third clause of the proposed amendments excludes from Congress, and from
						the College of Electors, and from all offices, civil and military, of the
						United States or of any State, persons who, as functionaries of the United
						States, or as Executive or Judicial officers of any State, have heretofore
						sworn to support the Constitution of the United States, and afterwards
						violated their oath by engaging in rebellion against the same, unless
						Congress, by a vote of two-thirds, shall have removed the disability of any
						such persons.</p>
					<p>The fourth clause affirms the validity of the debt of the United States, and
						prohibits the assumption or payment of the rebel debt, or of any claim for
						the loss or emancipation of any slave.</p>
					<p>The fifth clause provides that Congress shall have power to enforce the
						provisions of the other clauses by appropriate legislation.</p>
					<p>That these wise and moderate provisions will meet the hearty approbation of
						the Legislature, I cannot doubt. If proposed by two-thirds of each House of
						Congress and ratified by three-fourths of the Legislatures of the States,
						the Constitution provides that they should stand as adopted amendments of
						that instrument.</p>
					<p>A question has been raised whether the States lately in rebellion and not yet
						restored to their privileges by Congress, are to be counted in this vote-in
						other words whether those who have rebelled and been subdued shall be
						entitled to a potential voice in the question of the guarantees to be
						required of them for future obedience to the laws. So monstrous a
						proposition is, it appears to me, not supported by the words or spirit of
						the Constitution. The power to suppress insurrection includes the power of
						making provisions against its breaking out afresh. These States have made an
						unjust war upon our common government and their sister States, and the power
						given by the Constitution to make war on our part, includes the power to
						dictate after our success, the terms of peace and restoration.</p>
					<p>The power of Congress to guarantee to every State a Republican form of
						Government would cover much more cogent action than has yet been had.</p>
					<p>The duty imposed upon Congress to provide and maintain Republican Governments
						for the States is to be accepted in the broadest meaning of the term. It is
						not a mere formal or unnecessary provision.-The power was conferred, and the
						duty enjoined, to preserve free institutions against all encroachments, or
						the more violent elements of despotism and anarchy. And now that treason
						has, by rebellion, subverted the Governments of a number of States,
						forfeiting for the people all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution,
						including even those of property and life, the work of restoration for these
						States rests with the National Government, and it should be faithfully and
						fearlessly performed.</p>
					<p>By their passage by Congress, and the declarations of the people at the late
						elections, , the faith of the nation is pledged to the amendments, and they
						will be fairly carried out, and their benefits given to the rebellious
						States. But when the amendments shall have passed into the organic law,
						should the people lately in rebellion persist in their rejection, and in
						continued disobedience, and the obstruction of the execution of the national
						laws, it will be an admonition to the nation that the animus[ITAL] and force
						of treason still exist among a people who enjoy none of the privileges of
						the Government, save of its generous tolerance. With their rejection, all
						hope of reconstruction, with the co-operation of the rebellious States, on a
						basis that would secure to the Republic the logical results of the war, will
						have vanished, and the duty must then devolve upon the government of
						adopting the most effectual method to secure for those States the character
						of governments demanded by the Constitution.</p>
					<p>They are without lawful governments-they are without municipal law, and
						without any claim to participate in government.</p>
					<p>On what principle of law or justice can the rebellious States complain, if
						after they have rejected the fair and magnanimous terms upon which they are
						offered brotherhood with us, and a participation in all the blessings of our
						freedom, and they have refused, if the Government in the exercise of its
						powers, should enter anew upon the work of reconstruction at the very
						foundation; and then the necessity will be forced upon us to discard all
						discrimination in favor of the enemies of our nationality, to give us and
						them enduring freedom and impartial justice.</p>
					<p>The Constitution has defined treason, and has given express power to suppress
						insurrection, by war, if necessary. It has not provided , in detail, the
						terms to be granted after such a war. How could it do so! It would probably
						not be contended by the wildest partisan, that these States had a right to
						be represented in Congress at a time when they were carrying on open war
						against the government, or that Congress was not then a lawful body,
						nonwithstanding their exclusion. How then have they regained the right of
						representation? Surely not by simply laying down their arms when they could
						no longer hold them. The United States have the right, and it is their duty,
						to exact such securities for future good conduct as they may deem
						sufficient, and the offenders from whom they are to be exacted, can have no
						right to participate in our councils in the decision of the question of what
						their punishment shall be.</p>
					<p>Practically, common sense determined the question of their right to
						participate, when Congress proceeded in the enactment of laws, after the
						surrender of the last rebel military force. It was determined again, when
						the now pending amendments were proposed by Congress. If two-thirds of
						Congress, as now constituted, could lawfully propose those amendment, then
						three-fourths of the States, not excluded from representation in Congress,
						form a sufficient majority to effect their lawful adoption. It was
						determined again by the formal sanction of both the great political parties,
						when Congress, by an almost unanimous vote, declared the rebellious States
						without the right of representation in the Electoral College in 1864.</p>
					<p>We ought to go on resolutely and rapidly, with all measures deemed necessary
						to the future safety of the country, so that all parts of it may, at the
						earliest day, be restored to just and equal political privileges.</p>

						maintenance, and education of the soldiers' orphans, will exhibit the
						condition and the result thus far of that undertaking. Nearly three thousand
						of the destitute children of the brave men who laid down their lives that
						the nation might live, are now not only comfortably provided for and guarded
						from temptation, but are receiving an education which will fit them to repay
						the care of the State.</p>
					<p>The appropriation made for this purpose at the last session has been
						sufficient to meet all expenses of the financial year just closed. And I
						recommend whatever appropriation may be necessary to continue and perfect
						the system under which the schools are conducted.</p>
					<p>There can be no doubt that the appropriation will be made. Were I to select
						any State interest which I would more warmly commend to your prompt
						attention and liberality than another, it would be this. All Pennsylvanians
						are proud of it, and it, lies near the hearts of all true men.</p>
					<p>Owing to their greater destitution and want of information on the part of
						their relatives, the orphans of our colored soldiers may require some
						special attention.-Perhaps authority to the State Superintendent, to use,
						for a short time, the services of an agent, to ascertain their number and
						claims, and bring them into the schools that may be provided for them, will
						be sufficient. The whole number in the State is not large, of whom a few
						have already been temporarily provided for.</p>
					<p>I recommend that provision be made for the maintenance of such of our
						soldiers as are in poverty, and have been so maimed as to prevent them from
						securing a livelihood by their labor, by renting buildings at once, or such
						other means as you may deem wise and proper, until the arrangements proposed
						by the National Government for their support are completed.-They are
						probably few in number, and it is due to the character of the Commonwealth
						that they should not remain in, or become the inmates of the poor house, or
						pick up a precarious subsistence by begging. Patriotic and charitable
						citizens have done much for them, but speedy and proper relief can only be
						given them by the systematic and continued benevolence of the Commonwealth.
						The Legislature can alone afford immediate relief to all of this class of
						our citizens, and in thus exhibiting gratitude to heroic and faithful men,
						who did so much for the country, the burden will fall equally on her people.</p>
					<p>By our existing laws, juries are selected by the sheriff and commissioners of
						the respective counties. As these officers are generally of similar
						political affinities, the system has always been in danger of being abused
						for partisan purposes. During the last six years, it has been frequently so
						abused, in many of the counties.</p>
					<p>To secure, as far as possible, the administration of equal justice hereafter,
						I recommend that jury commissioners shall be elected in each county in the
						same manner as inspectors of elections are chosen, each citizen voting for
						one jury commissioner and the two personas having the highest number of
						votes to be the jury commissioners of the respective county, to perform the
						same duties, in the selection of jurors, that are now imposed upon the
						sheriff and county commissioners.</p>
					<p>It is impossible to provide, in all respects for the increasing and changing
						interests of our people, by the enactment of general laws, but to a large
						extent it is praticable to relieve the Legislature from special legislation
						which is demanded and occupies so much of its sessions. Special legislation
						is generally passed without due consideration, much of it at the close of
						the session, and is chiefly objectionable from the partiality with which
						powers and privileges are conferred.</p>
					<p>I again recommend the passage of general laws, when it is at all practicable,
						and in this connection, recommend the passage of a general law, regulating
						railroads now existing and the incorporation of new companies, so that so
						far as possible there may be a just uniformity in the franchise granted, and
						equal facilities afforded to the people of all sections of the Commonwealth.</p>
					<p>There are at this time, in the various prisons, a number of persons under
						sentence of death, some of them for many years, and as it has become a
						custom that an incoming Governor should not leave a warrant of execution in
						cases unacted on by his predecessor, it not unfrequently happens that in
						many cases, some of which are recent, while some punishment should be
						inflicted, that of death may appear to the Executive to be too severe.</p>
					<p>I earnestly repeat my recommendation heretofore made, that provision be made
						for the reception of such persons, into the penitentiaries, who may be
						pardoned on condition of remaining a limited time therein.</p>
					<p>I reappointed Hon. C.R. Coburn, Superintendent of Common Schools on the
						expiration of his term in June last, and he continued at the head of that
						Department until the first of November, when he resigned, and I appointed
						Col. J. P. Wickersham. It is due to Mr. Coburn to say that he fulfilled all
						the duties of his office faithfully and efficiently. It appears from his
						report that there in the school year of 1865, 1,863 school districts in the
						State; 13,146 schools; 16,141 teachers, and 725,312 pupils, with an average
						attendance of 478,066. The total cost of the school system, for the entire
						State, including taxes levied and the State appropriations, was for the year
						1866, $4,105,258 57. The increase in the number of school districts was 26;
						in the number of schools, 222; in the number of children attending school,
						19,932; in the average attendance at school, 18,945, and in the total cost
						of the system, $581,620 02. I invite your attention to the valuable
						suggestions made in this report, and that of Col. Wickersham, and commend
						our system of public instruction for the continued fostering care of the
						Legislature.</p>
					<p>I herewith present the reports of Col. F. Jordan, Military Agent of the State
						of Washington; of Col. H. H. Gregg, Chief of Transportation; of S. P. Bates,
						on military history of our volunteers; of trustees of the Soldiers'
						Gettysburg National cemetery; of the proceedings and ceremony of the return
						of the flags, on the 4th of July, in the city of Philadelphia, and of Col.
						James Worall, commissioner appointed under an act relating to the passage of
						fish in the Susquehanna, and invite your attention to them, and the reports
						of the Surveyor General and Adjutant General.</p>
					<p>The Agency at Washington should, in my judgement be continued. It has proved
						to be very useful in all respects, and especially to our volunteers and
						their families.</p>
					<p>Four thousand six hundred and ninety claims have passed the agency during the
						past year, and three hundred and eleven thousand seven hundred and three
						dollars has been collected from the Government and transmitted to the
						claimants free of charge.</p>
					<p>It will be necessary to continue the office of Chief of Transportation, as
						there are unsettled accounts with the railroad companies and the National
						Government, and duties to be performed in the removal and care of the bodies
						of the dead, which require it. - An additional appropriation will be
						required for this Department.</p>
					<p>I earnestly recommend, in justice to the living and the dead, that our
						military history be pushed forward vigorously, and that money for that
						purpose be appropriated.</p>
					<p>The trustees of the State Lunatic hospital represent that it is impossible
						for them to accommodate and care for the number of patients committed to
						them under the laws regulating admissions into the hospital, and earnestly
						recommend that provision be made for increased accommodation.</p>
					<p>I need not say that the institution is carefully and economically managed, or
						to refer to the great good it has produced; and that I cordially unite in
						the statement and recommendations of the memorial herewith presented.</p>
					<p>I invited your attention to the condition of the Arsenal.</p>
					<p>It is too small-unsafe as a depository for the large amount of valuable
						military material to be kept in it, and is, in all respects, inconvenient
						and not adapted to its purposes.</p>
					<p>Much of the inconvenience was experienced during the war for want of
						sufficient room and safety, and I recommend that ground be procured and a
						new commodious arsenal be erected in or near the Capital of the State.</p>
					<p>Since the adjournment of the Legislature I drew my warrant on the Treasury
						for five thousand dollars, appropriated to the National Cemetery at
						Antietam, and appointed Major General Jno. R. Brooks, trustee to represent
						the State. Before the warrant was drawn I appointed Colonel Wm. H. Blair and
						Captain J. Merrill Linn, who examined the ground and made a full
						investigation, their report of which accompanies this message. It will be
						noticed that they report seven hundred and ninety-seven bodies of
						Pennsylvanians that will be removed into the cemetery, and recommend and
						additional appropriation, in which I most cordially unite.</p>
					<p>I cannot close my last Annual Message without renewing the expression of my
						gratitude to the freemen of the Commonwealth, for the hearty approval with
						which they have cheered the labors of the Executive Office. To have earned
						such approval by my official conduct, during the last six years, must always
						be a source of pride to myself and children. Without the consciousness that
						I was endeavoring to deserve their approval, and without the hope that I
						should succeed in attaining it, I must have sunk under the responsibilities
						of my position. It was only a reliance on Divine Providence, and the active,
						resolute, hearty support and zeal of the people and their representatives,
						that encouraged me during the dark and terrible crisis through which the
						country has passed. I tried to do my duty to my country, and know I was at
						least faithful to her in her deep distress, and I conceived that duty not to
						be limited to the merely putting of men into the field to suppress treason
						and rebellion, and maintain the national life, and doing everything in my
						power to sustain the just war forced upon us. I felt also bound so far as I
						could, to protect and promote the rights and comforts of our volunteers,
						after they had left the State, to aid and relieve the sick and wounded, and
						to care for the transmission, to their bereaved families, of the precious
						bodies of the slain and the maintenance and education of their orphans as
						honored children of the country.</p>
					<p>To have been the Chief Magistrate of this great Commonwealth, during the
						period through which we have passed, and to have earned and maintained (if
						indeed I have done so) the confidence and affection of her people and their
						representatives, are quite enough to satisfy the highest ambition, and in my
						retirement from the high trust given me, I pray God that the State may
						continue to grow in power and strength, and her people in prosperity and
						happiness.</p>

					<p>EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,</p>
					<p>Harrisburg, Jan. 2, 1867.</p>
