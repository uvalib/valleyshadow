<b>Making The Application</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates a ficticious story about a conversation between two white men, one
					Republican the other Democrat, in which the consequences of black suffrage are
					discussed.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Several days ago a Republican and a Democrat got into conversation on the
						subject of making voters out of negroes. The Republican contended that
						negroes should be allowed to vote as a matter of right.</p>
					<p>"But," replied the Democrat, "that will lead to social equality."</p>
					<p>"Let it," rejoined the Republican, "the only difference between the negroes
						and the white is the color of skin and in the hair."</p>
					<p>"Then you think," said the Democrat, "that the negroes should have the same
						social, as well as the same political privileges the whites enjoy."</p>
					<p>"Certainly," replied the Republican.</p>
					<p>"Now, suppose a negro and your daughter should conclude to contract marriage,
						what would you do in regard to that?" asked the Democrat.</p>
					<p>"Why, I should let her, of course," responded the Republican.</p>
					<p>"And you would enjoy dandling on your knee a mulatto grand-child, would you?"
						queried the Democrat.</p>
					<p>"Oh, no. I should not do that. If my daughter married a negro, I should
						discard her," replied the Republican with spirit.</p>
					<p>"What," asked the Democrat, "discard your daughter for believing and
						practicing the doctrines you teach? Come neighbor, don't you think you are
						carrying this negro business too far? If there is no difference really
						between a negro and white man, excepting the color of hi skin and in the
						matter of hair, why would you discard your daughter for marrying a negro
						instead of a white man?"</p>
					<p>The Republican hung his head thoughtfully. This is a point all men should
						thoughtfully think over before they vote on the subject of making the
						negroes the political equals of the whites. Political equality inevitably
						leads to social equality, and social equality lays the foundation for the
						intermarriage of the races.</p>

<b>Negro Government</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With most whites in the former rebel states disfranchised, it has become
					apparent that blacks will gain political control of the South, assert the
					editors. Despite the Radicals' claims that the freedmen are up to this task, the
					editors point to a contradiction in the Radicals' logic: if slavery kept blacks
					"in intellectual darkness" and excluded them "from the civilizing influences of
					Christianity," how can they be "expected to make and administer the laws" of the
					land having only recently been freed from bondage?<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>It is now being demonstrated to almost a mathematical certainty, that the
						governments of the late rebel States will soon be under the absolute control
						of negroes. All the legislation of the last Congress seems to have had that
						end in view. The registration of the voters now going on in these States
						shows that the black population entitled to vote will far exceed the white.
						Congress intended to disfranchise the great majority of the white, and it
						has succeeded in doing so. It aimed at the enfranchisement of the blacks,
						and in that it has been equally successful. Who are these whites who have
						been disfranchised? They are the [UNCLEAR] of the Southern people. For what
						have they been disfranchised? Simply because, when the war broke out and
						their leaders organized secession, they, having been taught from their youth
						that their duty to their State was higher than their duty to the Federal
						Government, espoused the [UNCLEAR] of the rebellion. We of the North saw
						their error, or if you prefer it, their crime. But they
						 did not see it. They had a mistaken idea of their duty. They held
						that the tie that bound them to their State was stronger than that which
						bound them to the Union. The Southern masses were educated into the belief
						that they owed their first allegiance to their respective Commonwealths.
						Admit that they were wrong. Grant that they committed a high crime in
						attempting to dissolve the Union. Now that they have failed, and
						acknowledged that their fealty is due to the Federal Government, what excuse
						can be offered for seeking to deprive them of the management of their State
						affairs, provided they conform their action to the requirements of the
						Federal Constitution? This they are willing and anxious to do. Remember that
						they are the intelligent, thinking portion of the Southern people. They are
						the men who are on all sides admitted to be the most capable of conducting
						the affairs and controlling the destines of their respective States-the men,
						and the descendants of men, who in time gone by have won imperishable renown
						by their patriotic utterances in the councils of the nation. Ah! but it will
						be said; this is the very reason why they should be degraded and not allowed
						to have in political matters a voice. Pshaw! who dreads another rebellion in
						the South? Who is apprehensive of another reattempt at secession? Nobody. It
						is the merest balderdash. The military power of the South is broken. Its
						warriors feel that the overwhelming preponderance in numbers and resources
						of the North must ever prove too strong for it. They know that there is no
						possibility, even if they felt inclined to entertain the hope, of a
						dissolution of the Union by force of arms. They have surrendered that idea
						entirely. The Radicals know this. They believe it. They have no fear of
						another armed insurrection. They feel that the South is conquered. They are
						satisfied that it will not again attempt to sever its connection with the
						Union. And yet they have resolved to persecute the Southern people. They
						have determined to proscribe the deluded masses. Any man who participated in
						the rebellion must be deprived of the elective franchise, be he never so
						penitent-unless he agrees to vote the Radical ticket. Though he may have
						treaded to his knees in Northern blood, and though he may have starved
						thousands of Union prisoners, if he will but howl for Congress, and join in
						denouncing his former comrades in arms, he can have full absolution and be
						promoted to one of the highest seats in the Radical Synagogue. Those who
						will not agree to do this must be disfranchised. </p>
					<p>And who are to take their places? Who are to hold the reins of government in
						the South? Who are to control the destines of States which have given to our
						National history some of its brightest names? The negroes. They are now
						declared to be the only loyal people in the South except the loud-mouthed
						cowards who, under military protection, have emigrated thither from the New
						England States since the war. The loyal negroes, who cheerfully dug the
						ditches and labored in the trenches at the bidding of white rebels-the loyal
						negroes, who, while their masters were away in the field, worked on the
						plantations and raised the bread which fed the rebel armies--the loyal
						negroes, who clung to the rebel officers through the hardships of the camp
						and the dangers of the battle-field, in preference to accepting the
						blessings of freedom under the emancipation proclamation--they are the loyal men who are to found loyal State
							governments. These negroes too, have just been emancipated from a
						state of slavery. But a few years have elapsed since the horrors of that
						accursed institution were being constantly portrayed. What vile epithet was
						too strong to be applied to the slave-holder? Slavery was denounced as the
						"sum of all villainies," and as one of the "twin relics of barbarism." It
						was asserted that the negro of the South was not above the level of the
						brute. The opportunity for elevation was never afforded him. No ray of light
						was allowed to penetrate into his intellect. He was kept in the grossest
						ignorance. pretended philanthropists appealed to the charities of the
						public, by picturing the worse than Egyptian darkness in which he was
						enshrouded. He was denied the advantage of schools. It was alleged that he
						was shut out from the light of christianity, and left to follow the
						promptings of the passions of his own wicket heart, and that thus slavery, a
						monster in itself had given birth to the black monsters of iniquity in the
						shape of these ignorant, uncivilized blacks. </p>
					<p>And yet, these same blacks, thus imbruted by slavery,
							kept in intellectual darkness, and excluded from the civilizing
							influences of Christianity, have been suddenly invested with the highest
							political rights, and are expected to make and administer the laws for
							their intelligent superiors of the white race. </p>
					<p>This is not a fancy sketch. It is not a dream. It is not a Rebel canard. It
						is not a Copperhead lie. The figures on the Registration lists show that the
						negro voters are largely in the majority in the South. They have thus the
						power in their own hands. They may elect whites or blacks to office as they
						deem best. Who imagines that they will be contented to allow the whites to
						enjoy the emoluments of official positions when they may just as easily flow
						into the pockets of men of their own race? The negro is naturally impudent.
						Encourage him to "get above his business" and he soon developes a saucy
						disposition. So, being petted by Radical place hunters and caressed by
						Radical strong-minded women, he will soon reach after higher honors, and
						never rest satisfied until he enjoys them.</p>
					<p>Pennsylvanians: Let but the old Keystone State endorse the policy of the
						Radicals, and before another year rolls around, negroes will hold the chief
						positions in the Southern States and the Congressional
							Globe will be publishing the speeches of negroes made from their
						seats in the Halls which once resounded with the eloquence of Clay, Webster
						and the honored white statesmen of the past. Are you ready for this? If not,
						cast your ballot for those who are in favor of having this government
						administered by white men for all time to come. Vote the Democratic ticket
						and you need to have no fear of negro governments. </p>

<b>What The Radicals Intend</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>If elected, the editors avow, the Republicans in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and

</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>It is the aim of the Radicals to carry Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York in
						the approaching elections, so as to construe the result into an endorsement
						by the people, of their impeachment project. They intend, when Congress
						convenes, to present articles of impeachment against the President.-They
						desire him to be removed from office during the pendency of these
						proceedings. They will make an effort to depose him. If so, then will come
						anarchy and civil war.-Andrew Johnson must never allow himself to be removed
						from his official position, until he has been convicted of "high crimes and
						misdemeanors," in accordance with every requirement of the national
						Constitution. The sooner there is a perfect understanding upon this subject
						the better. Any effort to accomplish this result illegally, and for base
						partisan purposes, ought to be met with the most earnest and vigorous
						resistance. Their programme then, is, after they have deposed the President,
						to put Ben. Wade in the Executive chair. Then will come wholesale
						confiscations. Larger swarms of hungry officials will fatten upon the
						"hunks" which fall from the Freedmen's Bureau. The doctrine of negro
						equality will be pushed to the farthest extreme. Negro voters, negro jurors,
						negro lawyers, negro Congressmen, negro Governors will be seen everywhere.
						Conservatives will have no rights which Radicals and negroes are bound to
						respect. The corruption which has made the Radical party notorious, will
						continue to increase. Vast sums of money will be squandered upon the altar
						of their ebony idol. And the honest, hard-working
							mechanics and day-laborers will be taxed more heavily to supply these
							funds. </p>
					<p>Laboring men of Franklin County! if you would save the country from the
						anarchy and civil war into which the Radicals are precipitating it-if you

					<p>The registration of the other States is not on file at Washington.</p>
					<p>In these four States 238,000 blacks have been suddenly invested with the
						right to vote. In the same States, out of a white population of 1,549,667
						only 190,839 are allowed to vote.</p>
					<p>It is the intention of the Radicals to keep the whites disfranchised and to
						enfranchise more negroes. Can any one doubt that these states will soon be
						governed entirely by the blacks? What is to prevent it?-We doubt not that
						the proportion in the vote of the other Southern States will be the same.
						The whole South then will be under the domination of negroes. Are you
						willing that this shall be? Do you desire to see the necks of the brave men
						of your own proud race bend in subjection to the men whom you are unwilling
						to acknowledge as your equals? But there is another gross wrong done to
						those men which it is your duty to remedy. They are taxed to support the
						government just as you are.-Their industry and products must bear their
						share of the burdens of our national debt. This is right. But while they are
						taxed, to defray the expenses and to pay the debt of the government, they
						are not allowed a voice in the halls of Congress. No man from their section
						is permitted to open his mouth there to present their wants, or to ask for a
						redress of grievances. An arbitrary, unconstitutional, fanatical spirit has
						not only placed the seal of silence upon their lips, but will not tolerate
						their presence even.-This is wrong. This is taxation without representation.
						It is the grievance of which, most of all, our forefathers complained to
						King George. It is the oppression which nerved the arms and fired the hearts
						of our patriot ancestors, and which finally severed the tie which bound the
						colonies to the mother country. It is the last tyranny which Americans
						should think of exercising towards Americans.</p>
					<p>But it not only does harm to the spirit of our republican institutions. It is
						an injury to the people of the North pecuniarily.-While this state of
						affairs exists in the South, it can never contribute to the national
						treasury the amounts of money which it could contribute if the obstacles to
						its progress were removed. Its trade is paralyzed. Its business languishes.
						There is nothing to stimulate the whites to labor. They see a determination
						to subject them to the blacks. They fear that their lands will be taken from
						them and be parceled out among the negroes. Hence their soil remains
						uncultivated. Their great staple is neglected.-They work to support
						themselves-not to make money. They have no heart to do more. Their resources
						are therefore limited. They remain steeped in poverty.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, the expenses of the National Government are the same. They must be
						defrayed. The debt, too, goes on increasing. Its interest must be paid. If
						the amount due from the South can not be collected, the North must pay it.
						It must come out of the pockets of our people. Do you not see, therefore,
						that every moment you hold the South in this condition takes more money out
						of your purses? Think of this. Examine these figures carefully. Contrast the
						poverty of the South now with its wealth and productions before the war, and
						judge for yourselves as to which of the two contributes most to the
						prosperity of the National Government, and as to which is better calculated
						to lighten your individual burdens. Self-interest, national pride, and the
						fundamental principles upon which American independence was achieved-all
						call upon you to support that policy which would give to the South its just
						representation in Congress, which will save us from the humiliation and
						disgrace of imbecile negro governments, and which will at once place the
						nation on the broad highway to prosperity, greatness and glory.</p>

<b>Negroes In The Cars</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Beford Gazette</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p> Our attention has recently been called to the practical workings of a law
						passed last winter by our State Legislature, imposing heavy penalties upon
						railroad companies for refusing to permit negroes to
							ride in any of their passenger cars. As the law formerly stood,
						railroad conductors could compel negroes to ride in separate cars provided for them. As it stands now, they have the
						same choice of seats, and berths in sleeping cars, as white people. A friend
						of ours relates that as he was traveling from Philadelphia to Huntingdon, a
						few nights ago, he took a berth in a sleeping car, and when about retiring,
						his attention was attracted by loud talking and scuffling on the platform of
						the car. Proceeding to the scene of the disturbance, he discovered a huge
						male negro in a controversy with one of the railroad officials about
						obtaining a berth in the sleeping car. The ticket agent had refused to sell
						the darkey a ticket, and the colored gentleman was trying to force his way
						into the car without the requisite piece of stamped pasteboard. A policeman
						came up, however, and settled the business, by telling the ticket agent
						that, under the law, if he refused to sell the negro a berth ticket, on account of color, he would be amenable to a fine
						of FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS, and subject to pay a like sum
							to the negro upon an action for debt! This had the desired
						effect, and the African was handed the coveted ticket. It so happened,
						however, that but one berth was vacant, and that was half of a double berth
						partly occupied by a white man. The negro divested himself of hat, boots,
						coat and vest, and proceeded to appropriate his half of the double berth.
						White man, who had been dozing, turned around, looked at the new-comer,
						rubbed his eyes, looked again, and then came such a kicking, tumbling,
						sprawling, and mixture of white and black generally, as would have done any
						amalgamationist's heart good. About this time the conductor appeared upon
						the scene, and the result was that the negro, ticket in hand, tumbled into
						bed, whilst the white man, growing anathemas at the party he himself had
						helped to place in power, doggedly put on his clothes and went forward to
						sit with wrenched back and cramped legs in the passenger car, ruminating
						over the beauties of Radical legislation. We annex, below, a copy of the law
						which gives the negro the privilege of choosing his seat or sleeping berth
						on railroad cars: </p>
					<p>AN ACT making it an offence for railroad corporations, within this
						commonwealth, to make any distinction with their passengers, on account of

						or that shall, for such reason, compel, or attempt to compel any person or

					<p>Thus was this bill to force negroes into seats and sleeping-berths on
						railroad cars, along side of white people, ladies as well as gentlemen
						passed by the Radicals. Mr. Stumbaugh voted against the Boyle amendment,
						which was designed at least to keep negroes out of sleeping cars and cars
						set apart for ladies, but he dogged on the third reading. His colleague from
						Perry county, Mr. Shuman, stood up for the negro all through. This was the
						first step towards negro equality in Pennsylvania. Elect Theodore McGowan
						and Joseph W. Frank, and they will go a step further and vote for a bill to
						admit big niggers to the jury box and little niggers to the public schools.</p>
					<p>White men of Franklin county, the way to keep yourselves where you have
						always stood, above the negro's level, is to vote for B. F. Winger and John
						Shively for the Legislature.</p>

					<p>THE RADICALS are making a vigorous attempt to elect their candidate for
						County Treasurer. They have no hope of saving the balance of their ticket.
						They know that McGowan, Paxton, Etter, Maclay and Witherow, are beaten
						already. Hence they are putting forth every effort in favor of Mr.
						Greenawalt. He is their forlorn hope.--They rely upon his wealth and energy
						to carry him through. It will not avail, however. The people of Franklin
						county intend to reward a gallant young soldier.--They know Captain
						Skinner's unblemished record. They have heard of his bravery and of his
						personal attention to the wants of his men. They have been told of how his
						men respected and loved him. The soldier vote will certainly be cast for
						Captain Skinner. Surely the citizen vote will not be against him. Added to
						his soldierly qualities and untarnished military reputation, are his
						superior qualifications for the discharge of the duties of the office of
						County Treasurer. Vote for the brave soldier, Captain Skinner.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Repository  is at a loss to know why Col.
						Winger left the Republican party and came over to the Democracy after the
						close of the war. The reason is plain enough.--The Republican party has
						abandoned the Union cause and seeks to put out the States which Co. Winger
						fought to keep in. It has "gone back" on the soldiers and on the war
						resolution of 1861. Col. Winger was a warm supporter of the Lincoln policy
						of restoration, which Mr. Johnson is endeavoring to carry out, but which
						Sumner and Stevens have repudiated. He fought to compel the white people of
						the South to perform their obligations to the Union under the Constitution,
						not to disfranchise them and transfer their political rights on the negroes.
						The Republican party having run away from all its solemn professions, and
						become a Disunion party and allied itself with the negroes, Col. Winger has
						severed his connection with it and united himself to the true Union and
						White Man's party. Whoever votes for him will vote for what the Colonel
						fought for--the restoration of the Union.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We saw at the Bank of Chambersburg, on Friday last, three "bricks" of gold
						that had been sent in from Montana, by Col. McClure, to Wm M'Lellan, Esq.
						Two of these were of the value of $2,000 each, and the other was worth
						$1,250.</p>
					<p>For the information of the younger portion of our readers, we would state
						that gold is a metal which, in the good old Democratic times, used to be
						coined into money and paid to farmers for their wheat and to the mechanics
						for their wages. Some of our middle-aged men may be able to remember seeing
						gold coins when they were young. They were nice, bright and clean, and
						ringed [?] merrily together in the purses of the people. But when the
						Republicans took possession of the national government, they banished gold
						coins from circulation, and in their stead gave the people notes that soon
						became as greasy as the negroes they were issued to set free and elevate to
						the level of the whites. Since that unfortunate time, gold has been used
						chiefly to melt into spoons for Radical leaders and to gild the coaches of
						shoddy contracts. There is no telling what base use the three shining
						"bricks" we saw in the Bank may be put to. We suppose they will sooner or
						later find a market in one of the eastern cities, and in due time (having
						been worked up into spoons) Beast Butler may eat soup with them.</p>
					<p>Or is this the dawning of a "golden era" upon Chambersburg? It was the boast
						of Agustus that he "found Rome of brick and left it marble." Col. M'Clure
						left Chambersburg of brick made of clay. Will he, on returning, find it of
						brick made of gold, all sent by himself from Montana? If so, we hope the
						far-famed "future historian" will give him due credit.</p>
