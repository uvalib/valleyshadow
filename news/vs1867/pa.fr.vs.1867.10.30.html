<b>Trouble In The Radical Camp</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since the election, explains the article, the Republicans have splintered
					over the best course of action for the party to pursue. The split has become
					particularly pronounced over the issue of the party's next presidential nominee.
					The conservative wing has proposed Gen. Grant as the Republicans' candidate, a
					move that would surely provoke the ire of the "extreme men" in the party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Radicals are in a pretty muddle since the elections in Ohio and
						Pennsylvania.--they are engaged in the excellent pastime of laying
						"hurly-burly." They are mad, but there is no method in their madness. They
						are splitting into factions whose initiatory sparrings show that there is a
						terrible clashing of rival interests in their ranks. There seems to be "an
						irrepressible conflict" of ideas, too, among them, as to what course is
						expedient for their party to take. Some wish to profit by the lessons of the
						late elections, and therefore cast their influences in favor of Conservative
						measures. They insist, that to ultra ideas in regard to the negro their
						recent defeats are attributable, and that as long as they persist in the
						advancement of their equality notion, they may reasonably expect fresh
						disasters.--There is no intention on their part to abandon the extreme
						tenets of their party creed permanently. They have not been convinced that
						they are wrong. But they are looking to the success of their party. With this end in view, they deem it best to
						sacrifice principle to policy temporarily, trusting to obtain a new lease of
						power by adroit deception, and determined, in that event, to violate their
						pledges to the people, and secure the ascendancy of their doctrines in utter
						disregard of the expressions of the popular will. All they want is a
						President who will be in sympathy with their designs, and a Congress that
						will put these designs into practical operation.--Then, no matter how the
						people may fume and fret and protest, they will proceed to carry out, to the
						fullest extent, their plans for the political and social equalization of the
						races, and the establishment of a strong, centralized government. Knowing
						the unpopularity of these, their darling schemes, they are casting about for
						a candidate whose personal popularity will counterbalance the odium which
						attaches to their obnoxious doctrines. The expediency men of the Radical
						party imagine that they have found such a man in the person of General
						Grant. They argue, that the military services which he has rendered the
						country have been so brilliant and so valuable that his very name would
						excite an enthusiasm throughout the country similar to that which placed
						Harrison and Taylor in the Presidential chair. In pursuance of this idea the
						name of this distinguished officer has been presented for this position by
						several clubs in our own State, and the organ of the Radicals in our own
						county place it at the head of its columns and gravely proceeds to give its
						excuse for doing so. It says, "in preferring General Grant we are influenced
							not by any consideration of availability,"
						&amp;c </p>
					<p>Now we are perfectly familiar with the political ideas of our highly-esteemed
						friend who has charge of the Repository  during
						the absence of its senior editor. We know him to be one of the most radical
						of Radicals. He is in favor of investing the negro with the same political
						rights that are accorded to the white man and does not hesitate to say so
						openly. He prides himself in always making a frank avowal of his honest
						convictions. One of the "superior qualifications" which he would require in
						the man of his choice for President, is the fullest sympathy with the
						extreme Radicals of the party. Has General Grant ever exhibited such
						sympathy? No. Has he ever declared in favor of negro suffrage? No. Has he
						ever expressed himself as partial to the military governments now existing
						in the South? No. Has he ever uttered a word to justify the belief that he
						desires to see the governments of the late rebel States in the hands of
						blacks--or the whites who have emigrated thither from the North? No. Then
						surely there is no peculiar fitness in the principles
						 of the man to make him the choice of the Repository .--On the contrary, unless he boldly identifies
						himself with the Radicals, there is a peculiar unfitness in the nomination. </p>
					<p>The truth is, that the "consideration of availability" is exactly what
						prompted this nomination. It is hoped that the country will get into such a
						furor of excitement over this military chieftain, that the desire to do him
						honor will override every other consideration, and enable the Radicals to
						achieve a victory the prospect of which would otherwise be utterly hopeless.</p>
					<p>We do not believe that General Grant will be nominated. The extreme men of
						the Radical party have determined on the "rule of ruin" policy. They have
						made up their minds that they must have a representative man. They will run
						no risk of treachery hereafter. They want a man who is thoroughly and
						heartily committed to their ideas and mode of thought. No milk and water
						candidate will suit them. Hence they are refusing to second the nomination
						of Grant. They are advancing their ultra principles with more vehemence than
						ever. The Tribune  insists that the fight must go
						on upon the doctrine of "manhood suffrage." There must be no surrender of,
						no backing down from the Radical position. The Press
						 echoes the same declaration. Evidently the advance guard of the
						Radical party does not look with favor, or even with complacency, upon the
						movement to make Grant the Radical candidate. And so the quarrel goes on.
						The Radical party is in a frightful dilemma. If it nominates a Conservative,
						the ultra wing will secede--if it nominates a Radical, thousands of honest
						Conservatives will flock to the Democratic ranks. Take which horn it will,
						victory awaits the Democracy.</p>

<b>Radicalism Plotting Mischief</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Fearing that they will lose the State Senate, Republicans, say the editors,
					have "already commenced the the work of preparing the public mind" for one of
					their nefarious schemes to maintain control of the state government, just as
					they did three years ago when they gerrymandering several districts in the
					state.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Radicals are alarmed at the prospect of losing the Pennsylvania Senate at
						the next election, and they have already commenced the work of preparing the
						public mind for an outrage which they have in contemplation, and which we
						noticed last week, in order to maintain their majority in that body. When
						they made their infamous "gerrymander" of the State three years ago, they
						formed a "double" Senatorial district out of centre, Juanita, Mifflin,
						Blair, Huntingdon and Perry counties.--They made a "double" district, not
						because two districts could not conveniently have been made out of the
						counties they formed into one, but because they wanted to swamp certain
						Democratic counties and secure two Senators for themselves where they were
						entitled to only one. We believe Col. McClure, who is not particularly
						distinguished for scrupulousness in politics, warned his party friends that
						they were making a dangerous experiment, and that their two-edged sword
						might turn and cut themselves, but the warning was disregarded.</p>
					<p>Sooner, perhaps, than Col. McClure himself apprehended, the turn has taken
						place and the cut has been given. The Democracy has wrested this double
						district from the Republicans, and by this one great achievement made a
						difference of four in the count of political noses in the Senate. With the
						certainty that the Franklin and Adams district; and that of Luzerne, will be
						carried against them next year, the Radicals feel that something desperate
						must be done to save them in the Senate. The following from the Pittsburgh
							Commercial foreshadows the violent measures
						they will adopt to maintain their ascendancy: </p>
					<p>The defeat of Mssrs. McVitty and Robinson Republican candidates for the State
						Senator in this Twenty-first district, has caused and investigation to be
						made as to the manner of its accomplishment, and has resulted in developing
						frauds of a glaring character in Juniata, Perry and Centre
						counties.--Sufficient evidence has been obtained, it is said, to give Mssrs.
						McVitty and Robinson their seats, without reference to the large numbers of
						deserters that voted in Juniata and Centre counties. The election of Shugart
						and McIntyre will therefore be contested, with, it is claims, a certainty of
						success.</p>
					<p>We entertain very little doubt that the election of Shugart and McIntyre
							will  be contested with "a certainty of
						success," if the Democracy of Pennsylvania do not give the scoundrels, who
						contemplate this outrage upon the ballot box , to understand that the back
						window of the Senate chamber at Harrisburg, out of which Thad Stevens jumped
						in 1838, is still open, and that some of his disciples may be called upon to
						imitate that famous feat of his if they undertake to imitate his attempt to
						defeat the will of the people. Do these plotters suppose that the party
						which has so signally triumphed at the polls, will permit the fruits of their great victory to be wrested from them
						by the Radical Senate in defiance of law, and in defiance of the verdict of
						the people lawfully rendered in his case, dare to assist in rejecting
						Shugart and McIntyre, and yet hope to escape taking the leap which Thaddeus
						Stevens took thirty years ago? </p>
					<p>The Radical Legislature which passed the infamous apportionment bill, under
						which members of both branches of the General Assembly are now chosen, went
						far enough. They studied how to make districts which it would be impossible
						for the Democracy ever to carry. If now, finding themselves mistaken, they
						undertake to use their ill-gotten power to maintain their waning ascendancy
						in either branch, and refuse to admit members who have been legally elected,
						the time will have come again for the Democracy of the State to assemble at
						the Capitol, as they did in 1838, prepared and determined to maintain their
						rights.</p>
