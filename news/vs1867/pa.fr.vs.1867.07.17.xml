                <summary>The editors provide an update on the case against John M. Surratt for his
                    alleged involvement in the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln. They assert that
                    the prosecution's case has been badly weakened by its principal witnesses, who
                    are "notoriously bad characters, totally unworthy of believe on oath." In
                    conjunction with the "strong array" of other evidence presented in favor of the
                    defendant, the editors conclude that an impartial jury "must" acquit Surratt.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The military reconstruction act was passed by both houses on Saturday and
                        sent to the President. It is iron-Claudine all particulars, and abolishes
                        what little of civil rule was left in the Southern States by the
                        Stevens-Sherman bill and subsequent acts.-This last act totally ignores the
                        President both as Commander-in Chief of the Army, and head of the civil
                        branch of the government, and places all power in the General of the Army
                        and District Commanders.-The latter can appoint all civil and military
                        officers in their respective districts, subject to the disapproval, not of
                        the President, but the General of the army and the last mentioned officer is
                        invested with all the powers of suspension, removal, appointment and detail
                        granted and confirmed to district commanders. Section nine of the bill now
                        in the hands of the President goes even further, and declares that no
                        district commander or member of the Board of Registration, or any officer or
                        appointee acting under them, shall be bound in his action by any opinion of
                        any civil officer of the United States. Thus military power is placed above
                        that of the civil, and a plain principle of the Constitution of the United
                        States violated and treated with open scorn and contempt by a Congress
                        representing only a portion of the States and people of this nation. There
                        is no longer a doubt as to the meaning and intent of the Radical party.
                        Their object is the retention of power by means of the military arm of the
                        government, and yet the people remain inert. They will not see the magnitude
                        of the danger which menaces them. This last attack upon the civil authority
                        of the national government, and the rights of American citizens, is far in
                        advance of the other movements of the party in power. Will it awaken the
                        sleepers?</p>

                    <p>Those who wish to surrender their liberties will always find men or parties
                        to accept the position of tyrants and despots.-This has been the history of
                        all nations.-When the Roman people became unmindful of those great
                        fundamental principles upon which the liberty of the republic rested, the
                        freedom of its citizens, then came demagogues who flattered and promised to
                        obtain power, and then used that power to rivet the chains of servitude upon
                        those who were once the proud masters of the world. In France the same
                        features of history have repeated themselves. The bloody revolution of 1793
                        ended in the elevation of Napoleon to imperial and despotic power, because
                        the people were willing to surrender their rights; because they blindly
                        followed the leaders of factions, and sacrificed their liberties on the
                        altar of political hate and ambition. The present Emperor of France could
                        not have changed the government of that nation from a republic to a
                        despotism unless the people had lost that interest in the preservation of
                        their rights which is the only safeguard of a constitutional democracy.</p>
                    <p>The events of the past six years have shown that what was true in Rome and
                        verity in France, is exhibiting itself in this Republic. One by one the
                        outposts of American liberty have been surrendered, in many instances
                        without a single blow being struck in their defense. The Constitution, once
                        sacred from the rude touch of faction, is now a mere relic of the past,
                        powerless to protect, and useless as a counselor. States are no longer
                        supreme within the sphere pointed out by the great chart of American Union.
                        The right of trial by jury has been denied to American citizens, and in ten
                        States of the Union that inestimable blessing is still held in the grasp of
                        military commanders. The lives of men and women have been sacrificed by
                        military commissions; persons have been torn from their homes at the dead
                        hour of night, and in the broad light of day, without warrant or authority
                        of law; the right of free speech has been denied, newspapers destroyed, and
                        courts of justice invaded and judges dragged from the bench and thrown into
                        dungeons. All this was done by the party in power, and yet so thoroughly has
                        the spirit of faction blinded a portion of the people, that they cry
                        hosannah to their enslavers, and applaud each fresh manifestation of their
                        determination on their part to change the whole form of our government, both
                        State and National.</p>
                    <p>As an example of the readiness of the people to lay down their manhood,
                        independence and liberty at the feet of self-constituted tyrants and
                        despots, witnesses to the recent visit of a delegation of Radicals from
                        Maryland to Congress. Their object was to induce such action on the part of
                        that body as will place Maryland in the same condition as the ten
                        unrepresented States. These men are anxious that self-government shall be
                        denied the people of Maryland, that Congress shall rule them by the sword,
                        as it does Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and the other States covered by the
                        black pall of military despotism. This was the petition of a portion of the
                        people of Maryland.-How was it answered? Did the leaders of the Radical
                        party refuse to accept the surrender, by American citizens, of whose rights
                        to secure which the soldiers of 1776 bled at Trenton and suffered at Valley
                        Forge? Not at all. Mr. Kelley announced the advance of the column of
                        despotism by offering a resolution which provides that "whenever the people
                        of a State propose to change the organic law by the formation of a new State
                        Constitution, and whenever any of the people shall be prohibited from
                        exercising the elective franchise on account of race or color or previous
                        condition of servitude, such Constitution shall not become the organic law
                        until ratified by Congress."</p>
                    <p>It will be perceived that this resolution covers all the States in the Union,
                        and assumes the doctrine that Congress, composed of delegates from the
                        people themselves.-If Congress can act upon such a principle, then power can
                        never be wrested from the faction that now holds and exercises it in such a
                        tyrannical manner, and elections in the future will be a mere farce. Each
                        invasion of those rights set forth and guaranteed by the Constitution has
                        been approved by the Radical party. They have courted tyranny, and tyrants
                        have assumed authority, and are acting as if the rights of people were
                        worthless. The action of the present Congress clearly indicates an intention
                        on the part of the Radical leaders to hold the reins of power, despite the
                        will of the majority, and to advance the column of despotism to any point
                        necessary to secure and cover such a movement. The military reconstruction
                        acts are wide and wild departures from the Constitution and the theory of
                        our government, but they will be followed by still more outrageous acts
                        unless the people stand up like men, and do not carry their liberties and
                        rights and lay them as offerings upon the blood-stained alter of sectional
                        hate and party animosity.</p>

                    <p>The profession of Yankee philanthropy and freedom from prejudice is a
                        miserable pretext-one specially invented for the occasion. Yankee ingenuity
                        is proverbial, but Yankee hypocrisy is not a whit inferior. By reference to
                        section 5, chapter75, Revised Statutes of Massachusetts, Edition of 1836, we
                        find the following; "No white person shall intermarry with a negro, Indian,
                        or mulatto." By reference to section 1, chapter 76, same edition, we find
                        the following: "All marriages between a white person and a negro, Indian, or
                        mulatto shall, if solemnized within this State, be absolutely void without
                        any decree of divorce or other legal process," and section 21, same edition,
                        says "the issue of said marriage shall be deemed illegitimate."</p>
                    <p>Now we think the spirit of this statute eminently proper. We commend
                        Massachusetts very highly for enacting it. But what we inveigh against it is
                        this-this statute remains to the present day unchanged and unrepealed, and
                        yet the tendency of Massachusetts is to <emph rend="italic">force </emph>
                        such marriages upon the Southern people-such marriages as, by its laws, are
                        declared absolutely null and void, without legal process-in other words,
                        that they are merely a state of concubinage. By the laws of Massachusetts,
                        concubinage or adultery is punished by fine or imprisonment. And here we
                        have, indeed, a fit illustration of Yankee morality and Yankee hypocrisy.
                        Urging the commission of adultery for the purpose of receiving fines for its
                        commission! </p>
                    <p>For, if Radicalism succeeds, the law of Massachusetts urges the marriage of
                        negroes and whites. But Massachusetts declares such marriages to be nothing
                        but adultery, and punishes that offense by fine! Here we have indeed the
                        crowning point of Yankee ingenuity! But is it any more than we could expect
                        from a people who preached religious freedom to all, and yet sold young
                        girls and ladies, and old men and helpless boys into tropical slavery,
                        because they dared to worship God according to their consciences?-<emph
