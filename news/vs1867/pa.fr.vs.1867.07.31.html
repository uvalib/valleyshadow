<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To the House of Representatives of the United
                        States:--I return herewith the bill entitled "An act supplementary to
                        an act entitled an act to provide for the more efficient government of the
                        Rebel States," passed on the 2nd day of March, 1867, and the act
                        supplementary thereto, passed on the 23rd day of March 1867, and will state,
                        as briefly as possible, some of the reasons which prevent me from giving it
                        my approval. </p>
                    <p>This is one of a series of measures passed by Congress during the last four
                        months on the subject of Recenstruction. The message returning the act of
                        the 2nd of March last, states at length my objections to the passage of that
                        measure; they apply equally well to the bill now before me, and I am content
                        merely to refer to them, and to reiterate my conviction that they are sound
                        and unanswerable. There are some points peculiar to this bill which I will
                        proceed at once to consider.</p>
                    <p>The first section purports to declare the true intent and meaning, in some
                        particulars, of the prior acts upon this subject. It is declared that the
                        intent of those acts was, first, "That the existing governments in the ten
                        rebel States" were not legal State governments; and second, "That
                        thereafter, said governments, if continued, were to be continued subject in
                        all respects to the military commanders of the respective districts, and to
                        the paramount authority of Congress." Congress may, by a declaratory act,
                        fix upon an act a construction altogether at variance with its apparent
                        meaning, and from the time at least when such construction is fixed the
                        original act will be construed to mean exactly what it is stated to mean by
                        the declaratory statute. There will be then, from the time this bill may
                        become a law, no doubt, no question as to the relation in which the existing
                        governments in those States called in the original act the "provisional
                        governments," stand towards the military authority. As their relations stood
                        before the declaratory act, these "provisional governments," it is true,
                        were made subject to absolute military authority in many important respects,
                        but not in all the language of the act being subject to the military
                        authority of the United States as hereinafter provided."</p>
                    <p>By the sixth section of the original act these governments were made "in all
                        respects subject to the paramount authority of the United States." Now, by
                        this declaratory act it appears that Congress did not, by the original act,
                        intend to limit the military authority to any particulars or subjects
                        therein "prescribed," but meant to make it universal. Thus, over all these
                        ten States, this military government is now declared to have unlimited
                        authority. It is no longer confined to the preservation of the public peace,
                        the administration of criminal law, the registration of voters, and the
                        superintendence of elections, but in all respects is asserted to be
                        paramount to the existing civil governments. It is impossible to conceive
                        any state of society more intolerable than this, and yet it is to this
                        condition that twelve millions of American citizens are reduced by the
                        Congress of the United States. Over every foot of the immense territory
                        occupied by these American citizens, the Constitution of the United States
                        theoretically is in full operation. It binds all the people there, and
                        should protect them: yet they are denied every one of its sacred guaranties.
                        Of what avail will it be to any one of these Southern people, when seized by
                        a file of soldiers, to ask for the cause of arrest or for the production of
                        the warrant? Of what avail to ask for the privilege of ball when in military
                        custody, which knows no such thing as bail? Of what avail to demand a trial
                        by jury, process of witnesses, a copy of the indictment, the privilege of
                        counsel, or that greater privilege, the writ of habeas
                            corpus? </p>
                    <p>The veto of the original bill of the 2nd of March was based on two distinct
                        grounds, "the interference of Congress in matters strictly appertaining to
                        the reserved powers of the States, and the establishment of military
                        tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace." The impartial reader
                        of that message will understand that all it contains with respect to
                        military despotism and martial law has reverence especially to the fearful
                        power conferred on the district commanders to displace the criminal courts
                        and assume jurisdiction to try and to punish by military boards; that
                        potentially the suspension of the habeas corpus was martial law and military
                        despotism. The act now before me declares that the intent was to confer such
                        military authority over all the other courts of the State, and over all the
                        officers of the State, legislative, executive and judicial. Not content with
                        the general grant of power, Congress, in the second section of this bill
                        specifically gives to each military commander the power to "suspend or
                        remove from office, or from the performance of official duties and the
                        exercise of official power, any officer or person holding or exercising, or
                        professing to hold or exercise any civil or military office or duty in such
                        district under any power, election, appointment, or authority derived from
                        or granted by or claimed under any so-called state, or the government
                        thereof, or any municipal or other division thereof, a power that hitherto
                        all the departments of the Federal Government, acting in concert or
                        separately, have not dared to exercise, is here attempted to be conferred on
                        a subordinate military officer. To him, as a military officer of the Federal
                        Government, is given the power, supported by "a sufficient military force,"
                        to remove every civil officer in the State. What next? The district command,
                        who has thus displaced the civil officer, is authorized to fill the vacancy
                        by the detail of an officer or soldier of the army, or by the appointment of
                        some other person. This military appointee, whether an officer, a soldier or
                        some other person, is to perform the duties of such officer or person so
                        suspended or removed. In other words, an officer or soldier of the army is
                        thus transformed into a civil officer.</p>
                    <p>He may be made a governor, a legislator or a judge. However unfit he may deem
                        himself for such civil duties he must obey the order. The officer of the
                        army must, if detailed, go upon the Supreme Bench of the State with the same
                        prompt obedience as if he were detailed to go upon a court-martial. The
                        soldier, if detailed to act as a justice of the peace, must obey as quickly
                        as if he were detailed for picket duty.-What is the character of such a
                        military civil officer? This bill declares that he shall perform the duties
                        of the civil office to which he is detailed. It is clear, however, that he
                        does not lose his position in the military service. He is still and officer
                        or soldier of the army. He is still subject to the rules and regulations
                        which govern it, and must yield due deference, respect and obedience towards
                        his superiors. The clear intent of this section is, that the officer or
                        soldier detailed to fill a civil office must execute its duties according to
                        the laws of the State. If he is appointed a Governor of a State he is to
                        execute the duties as provided by the laws of that State, and for the time
                        being his military character is to be suspended in his new civil capacity.
                        If he is appointed a State Treasurer he must at once assume the custody and
                        disbursement of the funds of the State, and must perform these duties
                        precisely according to the laws of the State, for he is intrusted with no
                        other official duty or other official power.-Holding the office of
                        treasurer, and intrusted with funds, it happens that he is required by the
                        State laws to enter into bond with security, and to take an oath of office;
                        yet, from the beginning of the bill to the end there is no provision for any
                        bond or oath of office, or for any single qualification required under the
                        State law, such as residence, citizenship, or anything else. The only oath
                        is that provided for in the ninth section, by the terms of which every one
                        detailed or appointed to any civil office in the State is required "To take
                        and to subscribe the oath of office prescribed by the law for the officers
                        of the United States." Thus, an officer of the army of the United States,
                        detailed to fill a civil office in one of these States, gives no official
                        bond and takes no official oath for the performance of his new duties, but
                        as a civil officer of the State only takes the same oath which he had
                        already taken as a military officer of the United States. He is at last a
                        military officer performing civil duties, and the authority under which he
                        acts is Federal authority only, and the inevitable result is, that the
                        Federal Government, by the agency of its own sworn officers, in effect,
                        assumes the civil government of the State.</p>
                    <p>A singular contradiction is apparent here. Congress declares these local
                        State governments, and then provides that the illegal governments are to be
                        carried on by Federal officers, who are to perform the very duties imposed
                        on its own officers by this illegal State authority. It would be a novel
                        spectacle if Congress should attempt to carry on a legal State government by
                        the agency of its officers. It is yet more strange that Congress attempts to
                        sustain and carry on an illegal State government by the same Federal agency.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I must call attention to the tenth and eleventh sections
                        of the bill which provides that note of the officers or appointees of these
                        military commanders "shall be bound in their action by any opinion of any
                        civil officer of the United States, and that all the provisions of the act
                        shall be construed liberally, to the end that all of the intents thereof may
                        be fully and perfectly carried out." Its seems Congress supposed that this
                        bill might require construction, and they fix, therefore, the rule to be
                        applied. But where is the construction to come from? Certainly no one cane
                        be more in want of instruction than a soldier or an officer of the army
                        detailed for civil services perhaps the most important in a State, with the
                        duties of which he is altogether unfamiliar. This bill says he shall no be
                        bound in his action by the opinion of any civil officer of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The duties of the office are altogether civil but when he asks for an opinion
                        of another military officer, who perhaps understands as little of his duties
                        as he does himself; and as to his "action," he is answerable to the military
                        authority alone. Strictly, no opinion of any civil officer, other than a
                        judge, has a binding force; but these military appointees would not be
                        bound, even by a judicial opinion.-They might very well say, even when their
                        action is in conflict with the Supreme Court of the United States, "that
                        court is composed of civil officers of the United States, and we are not
                        bound to conform our action to any opinion of any such authority." This
                        bill, and the acts to which it is supplementary, are all founded upon the
                        assumption that these ten communities are not States, and that their
                        existing governments are not legal.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the legislation upon this subject they are called Rebel States.
                        And in this particular bill they are denominated "so-called States," and the
                        vice of illegality is declared to pervade all of them. The obligations of
                        consistency bind a legislative body as well as the individuals who compose
                        it. It is now too late to say that these ten political communities are not
                        States of the Union. Declarations to the contrary in these acts are
                        contradicted again and again by reputed acts of legislation enacted by
                        Congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867. During that period, whilst
                        these States were in actual rebellion, and after that rebellion was brought
                        to a close, they have been again and again recognized as States of the
                        Union. Representation has been apportioned to them as States. They have been
                        divided into judicial districts for the holding of district and circuit
                        courts of the United States, as States of the Union, only can be districted.</p>
                    <p>The last act on this subject was passed July 23, 1866, by which every one of
                        these ten States was arranged into districts and circuits, they have been
                        called upon by Congress to act through their Legislature upon at least two
                        amendments to the Constitution of the United States; as States they have
                        ratified one amendment which required the vote of twenty-seven States of the
                        thirty-six then composing the Union, when the requisite twenty-seven votes
                        were given in favor of that amendment, seven of which votes were given by
                        seven of these ten States. It was proclaimed to be a part of the
                        Constitution of the United States, and slavery was declared no longer to
                        exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>If these seven States were not legal States of the Union, it follows, as an
                        inevitable consequence, that slavery yet exists. It does not exist in these
                        seven States, for they have abolished it also in their own State
                        Constitutions, but Kentucky, not having done so, it would still remain in
                        that State. But, in truth, if this assumption that these States have no
                        legal State governments be true, then the abolition of slavery by these
                        illegal governments binds no one, for Congress now denies to these States
                        the power to abolish slavery, by denying to them the power to elect a legal
                        State Legislature, or to frame a constitution for any purpose, even for such
                        purpose as the abolition of slavery.</p>
                    <p>As to the other Constitutional Amendment, having reference to suffrage, it
                        happens that these States have not accepted it. The consequence is that it
                        has never been proclaimed or understood even by Congress to be a part of the
                        Constitution of the United States. The Senate of the United States has
                        repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of judges, district
                        attorneys, and marshalls for every one of these States, and yet, if they are
                        not legal States, not one of these judges is authorized to hold a court. So,
                        too, both Houses of Congress have passed appropriation bills to pay all of
                        these judges, attorneys and officers of the United States for exercising
                        their functions in these States. Again, in the machinery of the Internal
                        Revenue laws all these States are districted, not as Territories, but as
                        States. So much for continuous legislative recognition. The instances cited,
                        however, fall short of all that might be enumerated.</p>
                    <p>Executive recognition, as is well known, has been frequent and unwavering.
                        The same bay be said as to judicial recognition through the Supreme Court of
                        the United States. That august tribunal, from first to last, in the
                        administration of its duties in bane [UNCLEAR] and upon the circuit, has
                        never failed to recognize these ten communities as legal States of the
                        Union. The cases depending in that court upon appeal and writ of error from
                        these States when the Rebellion began, have not been dismissed upon any idea
                        of the cessation of jurisdiction.-They were carefully continued from term to
                        term until the Rebellion was entirely subdued and peace re-established, and
                        then they were called for argument and consideration, as if no insurrection
                        had intervened. New cases occurring since the Rebellion, have come from
                        these States before that court by writ of error and appeal, and even by
                        original suit where only a State can bring such a suit. These cases are
                        entertained by that tribunal in the exercise of its acknowledged
                        jurisdiction, which could not attach to them if they had come from any
                        political body other than a State of the Union.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in the allotment of their circuits made by the judges at the
                        December term, 1865, every one of these States is put on the same footing of
                        legality with all the other States of the Union. Virginia and North
                        Carolina, being a part of the fourth circuit, are allotted to the Chief
                        Justice. South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida
                        constitute the fifth circuit, and are allotted to the late Mr. Justice
                        Wayne.-Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas are allotted to the sixth judicial
                        circuit as to which there is a vacancy on the bench. The Chief Justice, in
                        the exercise of his circuit duties, has recently held a Circuit Court in the
                        State of North Carolina. If North Carolina is not a State of this Union, the
                        Chief Justice had no authority to hold a court there, and every order,
                        judgement and decree rendered by him in that court were coram non judice and verdi. </p>
                    <p>Another ground on which these Reconstruction acts are attempted to be
                        sustained is this: --That these ten States are conquered territory; that the
                        constitutional relation in which they stood as States towards the Federal
                        Government, prior to the Rebellion, has given place to a new relation; that
                        their territory is a conquered country, and their citizens a conquered
                        people, and that in this new relation Congress can govern them by military
                        power. A title by conquest stands on clear ground; it is a new title
                        acquired by war. It applies only to territory for goods and movable things
                        regularly captured in war are called "booty," or if taken by individual
                        soldiers, "plunder." There is not a foot of the land in any of these ten
                        States which the United States holds by conquest, save only such land as did
                        not belong to either of these States or to any individual owner. I mean such
                        lands as did belong to either of these States or to any individual owner. I
                        mean such lands as did belong to the pretended government called the
                        Confederate States. These lands we many claim to hold by conquest. As to all
                        other land or territory, whether belonging to the States or individuals, the
                        Federal Government has no more title or right to it than it had before the
                        Rebellion. Our own forts, arsenals, navy yards, custom houses, and other
                        Federal property situate in those States we now hold not only by the title
                        of conquest, but by our old title-acquired by purchase or condemnation to
                        public use, with compensation to their former owners. we have not conquered
                        these places but have simply "repossessed" them. If we require more sites or
                        forts, custom houses, or other public use, we must acquire the title to them
                        by purchase or appropriation in the regular mode. At this moment the United
                        States, in the acquisition of sites for national cemeteries in these States,
                        acquires titles in the same way.</p>
                    <p>The Federal courts sit in court houses owned or leased by the United States,
                        not in the court houses of the Staees. The United States pays each of the
                        States for the use of its jails. Finally, the United States levies its
                        direct taxes and its internal revenue upon the property in these States
                        including the productions of the lands within their territorial limits, not
                        by way of levy and contribution in the character of a conqueror, but in the
                        regular way of taxation, under the same laws which apply to all the other
                        States of the Union. From first to last, during the Rebellion and since, the
                        title of each of these States to the lands and public buildings owned by
                        them has never been disturbed, and not a foot of it has ever been acquired
                        by the United States, even under a title by confiscation, and not a foot of
                        it has ever been taxed under Federal law.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I must respectfully ask the attention of Congress to the
                        consideration of one more question arising under the bill:--It vests in the
                        military commander, subject only to the approval of the General of the Army
                        of the Untied States, an unlimited power to remove from office any civil or
                        military officer in each of these ten states, and the further power, subject
                        to the same approval, to detail or appoint any military officer or soldier
                        of the United States to perform the duties of the officer so removed and to
                        fill all vacancies occurring in these states by either, resignation or
                        otherwise, the military appointee thus required to perform the duties of a
                        civil officer, according to the laws of the State, and as such required to
                        take an oath is, for the time being, a civil officer.</p>
                    <p>What is his character? Is he a civil officer of the State, or a civil officer
                        of the Untied States? If he is a civil officer of the State, where is the
                        Federal power under our Constitution which authorizes his appointment by any
                        Federal officer? If however, he is to be considered a civil officer of the
                        United States, as his appointment and oath would seem to indicate where is
                        the authority for his appointment vetoed by the Constitution? The power of
                        appointment of all officers of the united States, civil or military, where
                        not provided for in the Constitution, is vested in the President by and with
                        the advice and consent of the Senate, with this exception:--that Congress
                        may by law, vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think
                        proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of
                        departments. But this bill within the meaning of the Constitution, does not
                        provide for their appointment by the President alone, or by the courts of
                        law, or in the heads of departments, but rests the appointment in one
                        subordinate executive officer, subject to the approval of another
                        subordinate executive officer, so that if we put this question, and fix the
                        character of this military appointee either way this provision of the bill
                        is equally, opposed to the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Take the case of a soldier or officer appointed to perform the office of
                        Judge in one of these States, and as such to administer the proper laws of
                        the State, where is the authority to be found in the Constitution for
                        vesting in a military or an executive officer strict judicial functions to
                        be exercised under State law; it has been again and again decided by the
                        Supreme Court of the United States, the acts of Congress which have
                        attempted to vest executive power in the judicial courts or judges of the
                        United States, are not warranted by the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>If Congress cannot clothe a judge with merely executive duties, how can they
                        clothe an officer or soldier of the army with judicial duties, over citizens
                        of the United states, who are not in the military or naval service.</p>
                    <p>So, too it has been repeatedly decided that Congress cannot require a State,
                        officer executive or judicial, to perform any duty enjoined upon him by a
                        law of the United states. How then can Congress confer power upon an
                        executive officer of the State? If Congress could not vest in a judge of one
                        of these States any judicial authority under the United States by direct
                        enactment, how can it accomplish the same thing indirectly by removing the
                        State judge and putting an officer of the United States in his place?</p>
                    <p>To me these consederations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality of the
                        part of the bill now before me, and I earnestly conmend their consideration
                        to the deliberate judgement of Congress.</p>
                    <p>Within a period of less than a year the legislation of Congress has attempted
                        to strip the Executive Department of the government of some of its essential
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution, and the oath provided in it, devolves upon the President
                        the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed. The
                        Constitution, in order to carry out this power gives him the choice of the
                        agents, and makes them subject to his control and supervision, but in the
                        execution of these laws the constitutional obligation upon the President
                        remains, but the power to exercise that constitutional duty is effectually
                        taken away. The military commander is, as to the power of appointment, made
                        to take the place of the president, and the General of the Army the place of
                        the Senate, and any attempt on the part of the President to assert his own
                        constitutional power may, under the pretense of law, be met by official
                        insubordination.</p>
                    <p>It is to be feared that these military officers, looking to the authority
                        given by these, rather than to the letter of the Constitution, will
                        recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the General of
                        the Army. If there were no other objection than this to this proposed
                        legislation, it would be sufficient. whilst I hold the Chief Executive
                        authority of the United States; whilst the obligation rests upon me to see
                        that all the laws are faithfully executed, I can never willingly surrender
                        that trust, or the powers given for its execution; I can never give my
                        assent to be made responsible for the faithful execution of laws, and at the
                        same time surrender that trust and the powers which accompany it to any
                        other executive officer, high or low, or so any number of executive
                        officers.</p>
                    <p>If this executive trust, vested by the Constitution in the President, is to
                        be taken from him and vested in a subordinate officer, the responsibility
                        will be with Congress, in clothing the subordinate with unconstitutional
                        power, and with the officer who assumes its exercise. This interference with
                        the constitutional authority of the Executive Department is an evil that
                        will inevitably sap the foundations of our Federal system, but is not the
                        worst evil of this legislation. It is a great public wrong to take from the
                        President powers conferred on him alone by the Constitution. But the wrong
                        is more flagrant and more dangerous when the powers so taken from the
                        President are conferred upon subordinate executive officers. Over nearly
                        one-third of the States of the Union military power, regulated by no fixed
                        law, reigns supreme.</p>
                    <p>Each one of the five district commanders, though not chosen by the people or
                        responsible to them, exercises at this hour more executive power, military
                        and civil, than the people have ever been willing to confer upon the head of
                        the Executive Department, though chosen by and responsible to themselves.
                        They know what it is, and how it is to be applied. At the present time, they
                        cannot, according to the forms of the Constitution, repeal these laws. They
                        cannot remove or control this military despotism. The remedy is
                        nevertheless, in their hands. It is to be found in the ballot and is a sure
                        one if not controlled by fraud, overawed by arbitrary power, or from apathy
                        on their part too long delayed.</p>
                    <p>With abiding confidence in their patriotism, wisdom and integrity I am still
                        hopeful of the future, and that in the end the rod of despotism will be
                        broken; the armed heel of power be lifted from the necks of the people, and
                        the principles of a violated Constitution preserved.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are some points of difference in the platforms of the Democratic and
                        Radical parties, in this State, which should not be overlooked, or forgotten
                        by the people.-They indicate plainly and clearly the gulf that separates the
                        organization in reference to the mode of conducting the national and state
                        governments, and also the manner in which they believe the laws of the
                        Commonwealth should be administered from the Supreme Bench. The Radical
                        party has put forth a platform which cannot be justified or defended by law,
                        reason, or right, and hence the appeals that are made to passion and
                        prejudice. They are conducting the campaign as if the nation was still in
                        the midst of a war. The same old party cries are heard, men are denounced as
                        "disloyal," and "traitors," and "sympathizers with the rebellion," who dare
                        to exercise their reason and defend those principles which they thing best
                        calculated to aid the country at this crisis in its history. The Radicals
                        are afraid to test their positions on all the various questions of national
                        and state policy by the calm judgements of the people, hence the violent
                        manner in which their journals and speakers are beginning the campaign.</p>
                    <p>But, despite their efforts to prevent it, the people will contrast the
                        platforms and ask which is best suited for he country under present
                        circumstances? The Democratic party declares, with reference to national
                        issues, that the Union of the States is perpetual, and the Federal
                        Government supreme within its constitutional limits; that representation in
                        Congres is a right pertaining to the people of each State, and essential to
                        our form of Government; that its denial is the destruction of the government
                        itself, that interference with the right of the people of a State to choose
                        its own depositories of political power is usurpation and an outrage, and to
                        this join the announcement that they are opposed to any amendment to the
                        Constitution of the State giving negroes the right of suffrage. This is the
                        plain, republican platform of the Democratic party. If the principles
                        enunciated therein prevail, the hand of military despotism will be lifted
                        from the people, the States will be admitted to constitutional and proper
                        relation with the Federal government, fresh life and animation will be
                        infused into business, taxes reduced, and the general prosperity of the
                        nation improved in a most material degree.</p>
                    <p>In opposition to this constitutional, just, and reasonable platform, the
                        Radical party place a full endorsement of the military reconstruction acts
                        of the Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Congresses. These acts are in open
                        violation of the Constitution, and are so declared by Mr. Stevens, who is
                        the leader of the party; and by them, they have destroyed ten States, placed
                        the military above the civil power in time of peace, suspended courts of
                        justice, closed the doors of legislative halls, raised to full citizenship a
                        particular class of persons in opposition to the expressed will of
                        ninth-tenths of the legal citizens of the Southern States, and now proclaim
                        their intention of invading the Northern States and forcing negro suffrage
                        here, if necessary, at the point of the bayonet. The effects of such
                        principles when carried into action, can be seen in the present condition of
                        the country. The Union is destroyed, the character of the nation injured
                        abroad, our commerce reduced, mills and manufactories stopped, and the whole
                        nation torn and convulsed by the conduct of the revolutionary faction now in
                        power.</p>
                    <p>If the Radical party and its principles are endorsed by the people of
                        Pennsylvania at the coming election the effect will be most disastrous to
                        the country. Stimulated and emboldened by such a verdict, they will grasp
                        still tighter the sword of military power and use it in a more general and
                        remorseless manner. Even under present circumstances, no one of the Radical
                        chieftains has declared that the military reconstruction acts now upon the
                        statue books are finalities. Stevens hints at a wider application of the
                        disfranchising principles, and Wilson and all the more prominent Radicals
                        are in favor of forcing negro suffrage upon the people of this State by
                        Congressional action, even while the word "white still remains at the State
                        Constitution. If Congress can thus set aside the organic law of a State with
                        reference to the qualifications of its citizens, they can nullify all other
                        parts of that instrument, and thus reduce the people virtually to the
                        condition of slaves to the power of a centralized despotism.</p>
                    <p>The contest in this State bears directly upon this point, and hence the
                        people should look at the facts as wise men, not fanatics. The South is now
                        governed by Congress under the military acts passed by that body. The
                        Radicals have announced their intention of applying one feature of that
                        policy to the Northern States. Let Pennsylvania endorse their policy this
                        fall, and not only will they declare negroes citizens of all the States, but
                        at the same time strike down still other safeguards of republican liberty in
                        the North. This is one vital difference in the platform of the parties in
                        this State. Others will be noted hereafter.-Age

                    <p>"The subject was thoroughly discussed by the committee on resolutions, the
                        member of the committee from Bucks county making an argument in favor of the
                        adoption of such a resolution. The expediency of this action, however, was
                        decidedly opposed by some of the delegates from the interior, who thought
                        their constituents were not yet quite prepared to face
                            the music. It was suggested that the subject would at any rate be
                        acted upon by Congress, as soon as the pending constitutional amendments
                        would be ratified, and that the States themselves would be relieved of the
                        responsibilities of fixing the qualifications of citizenship in this
                        respect. Thus it came about that the suffrage plank was omitted from our
                        State platform." </p>
                    <p>Here is a very honest and candid confession, and one too that should open the
                        eyes of thousands of white men, who have heretofore been voting with
                        mongrelism, but have so often asserted that they will no longer vote for
                        that party when they are convinced that it favors negro suffrage. It is not
                        because they are not in favor of negroes voting, not because they would keep
                        the ballot out of his hand, and preserve the superiority of the white man,
                        that their platform says nothing about it, but for the simple reason that
                        they fear that the masses of their party are not quite
                            yet prepared to face the music? Not yet prepared to acknowledge
                        Sambo as their equal; not prepared to give Cuffee the reigns of Government;
                        not yet prepared to march arm in arm to the ballot-box, with these sweet
                        scented "American citizens of African descent." And yet, knowing, feeling
                        and acknowledging that even a majority of their own party together with the
                        hundreds of thousands of noble democrats throughout the State, are bitterly
                        opposed to this infamous and degrading doctrine, they have the effrontery to
                        express the desire that Congress, will "relieve the State of fixing the
                        qualifications of its citizens," or in other words, force negro suffrage
                        upon us, in opposition to the wishes of three-fourths of our white voters.
                        It is to accomplish this that their candidate for Supreme Judge is pledged
                        to make his decisions in accordance with the "wishes of those electing him."
                        And if the white men of Pennsylvania feel that they "are not ready to face
                        the music," and march arm in arm to the polls with an ignorant and degraded
                        race, they must vote for those who will oppose any interference by Congress,
                        with our laws regulating the qualifications of citizens." Williams has
                        pledged himself to decide that Congress has the right to make negroes voters
                        in Pennsylvania in opposition to the wishes of our people. Sharswood will
                        decide that it is a question that the white men of our State alone can
                            settle.-Democratic Watchman</p>
