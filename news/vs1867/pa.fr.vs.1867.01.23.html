<b>The Maryland Negro Sale</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article alleges that an auction occurred in Maryland, in which black
                    convicts were "sold" as punishment. The piece points out the irony that it was
                    the Radicals, in fact, who passed the legislation authorizing the sale.<br>

                    <p>One branch of Congress is in ferment about the sale of several colored people
                        in Maryland under a decree of court, after conviction of crimes. One of the
                        parties-Dick Harris-was found guilty of stealing beef, and sentenced to be
                        sold for six months. Not being a very valuable woolen fabric, he was brought
                        in by his brother for fifty dollars, and he is now working at Annapolis for
                        eight dollars per week. Had he been a white man, the law would have required
                        a sentence from one to fifteen years in the penitentiary. None of the other
                        blacks who were sold brought so high a figure.</p>
                    <p>The law under which this sale was made was passed by a Radical legislature
                        and approved by the Radical Governor Bradford. In the Senate it received
                        every vote except tow, and the vote in the House stood 48 to 6.</p>
                    <p>The same Legislature which passed the bill, passed the "treason bill," and
                        the "defense loan bill," which put the "loyal" stamp upon its character
                        beyond question. If there any wrong about "the revival of slavery in
                        Maryland," it is, therefore, to be laid at the door of the Radical league
                        house.</p>
                    <p>What is singular enough-or what would be strange in any other times than the
                        present-is the fact that out in Missouri the Radical Legislature lately
                        passed a law requiring white vagrants (persons out of employment) to be sold
                        to the highest bidder, and under it some six vagrants were, a few days ago,
                        sold by a court at St. Louis for six months. Is it worse to sell a negro
                        beef thief for six months than to sell a white man for the same period, for
                        no other crime than being out of work?-New York

<b>Inauguration of Gov. Geary</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses Gov. Geary's inauguration and the speech he delivered at the
                    ceremony, which was "remarkable only for its length and its sophistry."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>General John W. Geary was inaugurated Governor of Pennsylvania on Tuesday the
                        13th inst. The ceremonies were attended by quite a demonstration of military
                        and firemen from Philadelphia and other places, and by citizens from all
                        parts of the Commonwealth. At 12 o'clock M. the Governor elect attended by
                        the retiring Governor and a committee of the Legislature appeared on the
                        platform erected in front of the State House, where, in the presence of the
                        members of both Houses and a large concourse of people, the oath of office
                        was administered to him by Speaker Hall, of the Seventh [UNCLEAR]. The newly
                        sworn Governor then delivered his inaugural address, which is remarkable
                        only for its length and its sophistry. It is not worth publishing. Gov.
                        Geary's whole character is embraced in one expressive word-humbug-of which
                        this address affords abundant proof.</p>
                    <p>On the same day, Simon Cameron was elected United States Senator for six
                        years commencing on the 4th of March next by a strict party vote, the Curtin
                        men who had charged Cameron with nearly all the crimes in the calendar,
                        swallowing their resentment marched up to the party rack [UNCLEAR] like some
                        many whipped spaniels. Senator Billingfels [UNCLEAR], of Lancaster, was the
                        only republican in either House who failed to record his vote for the "great
                        [ILLEGIBLE]."</p>

<b>How The Renegades Rule The Radicals</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Among Pennsylvania's Republicans, says the article, a schism has developed
                    between the "Renegades," supporters of Simon Cameron, and the "Radicals," who
                    favored Curtin in the contest for the party's Senatorial nomination. More so
                    than the regular, "dyed-in-the-wool class" of Radicals, the Renegades are
                    dangerous because they have "no fixed principles or defined [political] orbit."<br>

                    <p>"That Gen. Geary throw his whole personal and official power in favor of the
                        election of Cameron, bartering his offices as Cameron directed, can no
                        longer be concealed, and his administration stars with this stain stamped
                        upon it. Gov. Geary may soon learn who easy it is to wreck an
                        administration, but he will prove himself a wise man if he demonstrates how
                        it can be secured and restored to the confidence of the people who created
                        it."</p>
                    <p>As among thieves, there is among renegades, a close community of purposes and
                        interests. Hence Geary's affiliation with Cameron, the pioneer renegade, is
                        a natural combination, aside from the fact that Geary's nomination was
                        brought about through Cameron's machinations. As a class of politicians
                        renegades are anomalous. Having no fixed principles or defined orbits, their
                        satellites are, in consequence, compelled to pursue a like eccentric series
                        of movements or fly off at a tangent. It is useless, however, for those who
                        nominated and elected Geary as "a Democrat without affic or prefix" to
                        attempt to undo their work.-The Radical party of Pennsylvania is now so
                        effectually under renegade domination that there is nothing left for the
                        originals-the dyed-in-the-wool class-to do but fall into line. They may
                        complain and sputter and make wry faces, as they are doing most vigorously
                        in this city and elsewhere over Geary's appointments, but that is all the
                        comfort left them. The renegades have the whip in their hands and they are
                        using it industriously. Fall in, fall in, gentlemen! All is Simon-pure
                        now-so-called. - Patriot &amp; Union</p>

<b>Cameron Declares Against The Word "White" In The Constitution of Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Using an extract from a speech delivered by Simon Cameron, in which the
                    Senator-elect stated his belief that "clothing a black man in the American

                    insists that his remarks reveal the fact "that throughout the war the Radical

                    <p>I wished also to arm all black men who would volunteer. Of course, I thought
                        that clothing a black man in the American uniform clothed him also with the
                        rights of an American citizen; and I am always sorry to see a black soldier,
                        and reflect that even Pennsylvania denies him the ballot-the only weapon by
                        whereby he can protect himself. I hope to live to see
                            the word "white" stricken from our own Constitution, and the spirit of
                            caste, based upon color utterly destroyed."</p>
                    <p>It was not to save the Republic, then that Simon Cameron wanted the negro
                        clothed with the Federal uniform, but merely to make his claim good for
                        citizenship and the ballot. This admission shows that throughout the war the
                        Radical leaders kept negro suffrage in view as the goal to be reached with
                        Northern pluck and resources and not the restoration of the Union.-And yet
                        it was declared "treason" for a Democrat to say that they were prosecuting
                        the war entirely for the negro and their own profit. Before his death H.
                        Winter Davis declared that it was "numbers, not intelligence that the
                        Republican party wanted," and now Cameron admits that he always considered
                        clothing the black man in the American uniform clothing him also with
                        citizenship and invested him with the ballot.</p>
                    <p>In his inaugural Geary declares that the negroes "are rapidly preparing to
                        assume their rights as citizens." Cameron follows and hopes to life to see
                        the word "white" stricken from our Constitution. People of Pennsylvania, is
                        this the object you had in view when you elected a renegade Democrat as
                        Governor of your State? Is this the object you set your minds upon when you
                        allowed your representatives in the Legislature to barter their votes to
                        another renegade Democrat for a seat in United States Senate? We are greatly
                        in error if such were your thoughts and desires. Before the election Geary
                        denied that negro suffrage was an issue in Pennsylvania.-Cameron was silent.
                        They worked together and now both are in office - both have thrown off the
                        mask and tell you, as though you were serfs, that the negro must be made a
                        sharer of your rights and privileges. Are you content?-- Patriot and Union</p>

                    <p>To the Editors of the Valley Spirit: </p>
                    <p>SIRS: The subject of my letter may surprise you, but I hope it may be an
                        agreeable surprise, as that of which I am about to speak, is a subject of
                        some importance which has not recently been brought before the people of
                        this city. Unfortunately no other pen has written concerning it, or I would
                        not have undertaken the task. The question I propose to argue is, whether it
                        is proper to encourage amusements that have a tendency to corrupt our taste.</p>
                    <p>Now Messrs. Editors I consider it a most deplorable fact, that an
                        intelligent, community tolerate and permit their children to attend the
                        place of amusement in this city, to behold the supremely ridiculous
                        performance of slight of hand, practiced by buffoons, who now night after
                        night amuse vulgar audiences. Why do not parents let their children
                        cultivate at home, a taste for things of
                        refinement, instead of sending them to hear the silly remarks of men whose
                        knowledge does not extend beyond the deceptive tricks they practice to
                        entertain an audience of the lowest class? </p>
                    <p>Pray now, what benefits are to be derived from attending such places of
                        amusement? Surely one is not taught there to admire the classics; your eyes
                        do not meet with that which is calculated to develope a taste for a higher
                        order of things, but on the contrary, the youth is instructed in the art of
                        deception, or is led to believe the performers of "those wonderful
                        tricks"-as he deems them-possesses a supernatural power.</p>
                    <p>Parents, is it any wonder that your children become rude and even wicked
                        under the evil influence of that corrupt school.-Yet in the face of all
                        this, intellectual persons permit their children to go to the Hall almost
                        every night to listen to the absurd nonsense of performers and to hear the
                        more absurd remarks of the low and ignorant grown persons who are in
                        attendance at these exhibitions.</p>
                    <p>What is the result? The mind being perverted or corrupted by a false training
                        and evil influence, the morals also become tainted, then when it is
                        unfortunately too late parents perceive their great mistake. - I shall now
                        close, letting your readers to decide whether I be right or wrong.</p>
                    <p>THE AUTHOR OF "BEATRIX."</p>
                    <p>The writer of the above is right in his opinion about the evil influences
                        attending the kind of exhibition to which he refers, and of such our town
                        has had a surfeit for some time past, but he is wrong in attributing the
                        evil to the tricks and jests of the performer. These constitute but a small
                        part of the cause of the evil complained of. The main cause is the gambling  feature connected with these exhibitions
                        - the distribution of gifts to the holders of tickets containing the lucky
                        numbers. - This is neither more nor less than a game of
                            chance, and it is the hope of drawing a valuable prize on the
                        investment of a quarter that draws a crowd to these places, and not to
                        witness the silly tricks of these monnteback [?] performers. Without this
                        "gift" attachment, we venture to say, the audiences attending these
                        exhibitions would number but a few dozen at most, whilst with it they number
                        hundreds. They are certainly most demoralizing in their tendency, and should
                        receive the censure and reprobation of all right-thinking persons in the
                        community. </p>
