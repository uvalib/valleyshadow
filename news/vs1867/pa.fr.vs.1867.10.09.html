<b>Plump Women</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The brief article contends that educated women in America "are notorious

<b>Victory</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With partial returns in from the election, it appears, according to the
                    editors, that the Democrats will emerge with a majority of two to three hundred.
                    By electing the Democrats, they declare, the people "have spoken against
                    military despotisms established by Congress and against negro suffrage."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The news from the election districts of this county is most glorious.
                        Radicalism has been most severely rebuked. Our people have spoken against
                        the military despotism established by Congress, and against negro suffrage.
                        The tide of fanaticism has been stemmed. We have wiped out the Radical
                        majority of last year, and run up a majority for the Democratic ticket of
                        from two to three hundred. The Democracy have done nobly. They have fought
                        the battle most gallantly. In this borough, the Radicals have but 113
                        majority against 193 last year. The "sober, second thought" has been
                        awakened here in their stronghold. In Greenvillage, they have but 54
                        majoring against 103 last year. For the first time in many years "the
                        unterrified" of Antrim have plucked victory from the grasp of their
                        never-tiring opponents. And, so we might go on. The whole Democratic county
                        ticket is elected. We have made a clean sweep.</p>
                    <p>From the State, the news is equally cheering. Almost every precinct heard
                        from shows a Democratic gain. Our latest dispatches indicate that the city
                        and county of Philadelphia have given the Democratic ticket 2,881 majority.
                        This is a Democratic gain of 8,000. we feel satisfied that Hon. George
                        Sharswood has been elected Supreme Judge by a handsome majority. To all
                        appearances, Col. Winger and John Shively have been elected to the Assembly,
                        although we have received no intelligence from Perry county. We feel
                        assured, however, that even if it has been carried by the Radicals, it will
                        not be by a sufficient majority of this county for the Democratic
                        candidates. At last, we breathe freely. Franklin county has taken her stand
                        with the friends of the Constitution and the Union. The "old Green Spot" has
                        been redeemed. Thanks to the patient, working Democracy, victory has at last
                        perched upon our banners.</p>

<b>The Impeachment of the President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    there is no basis for it. Without a legitimate rationale, they assert, the
                    American people will refuse to support an unconstitutional move to unseat the

                    necessities do not imperiously require."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The respectable gentlemen who compose the borough of Chambersburg are said to
                        be seriously considering the propriety of bridging the Coucocheague at Queen
                        street and the Falling Spring at King street. It is to be hoped that they
                        will consider these projects very seriously
                        before entering upon them. This is no time to engage in expensive works that
                        the public necessities do not imperiously require. All of us know how deeply
                        the citizens of this town are in debt. No one with intelligence enough to be
                        fit to fill the least responsible position under the corporation, can be
                        unaware that a large majority of our business men have a load on their
                        shoulders which it will require all their strength to carry through. Taxes
                        are already high, and any attempt to add to them unnecessarily should be
                        sternly condemned. </p>
                    <p>It is not easy to see the necessity for a Bridge across the Factory Dam at
                        Queen street, at the present time. The population immediately west of the
                        Dam is very small, and is pretty well accommodated by the Market street and
                        Factory Bridges, and the intervening Bridge in the alley at the Brewery. A
                        Bridge over the Dam at the west end of Queen street would necessarily be
                        expensive. It would have to be very long or else the low ground on the west
                        side would have to be filled up at great expense. And to open out Queen
                        street west-ward from the creek, which is said to be a part of the
                        programme, would add to the expense. Grading would have to be done at the
                        cost of the borough, and there would be damages to pay for private property
                        taken for the use of the public. We don not say that a Bridge should never
                        be built at the point indicated. What might be very proper five or ten years
                        hence may be very improper now. An improvement which it would be very
                        inexpedient and very censurable for our Council to undertake now, they might
                        be commended for doing when our people get out of debt and better able to
                        bear taxation.</p>
                    <p>But if it is not easy to see the necessity for a Bridge at the west end of
                        Queen street, it is  easy to see the worse than
                        folly of building one for wagons across Falling Spring in King street. We
                        cannot imagine what could have put such an insane project into anybody's
                        head. It is a positive advantage to have no Bridge there except the
                        Footbridge that is there already. The water is not much over a foot deep and
                        the bed of the stream is solid. We have heard but one reason given in favor
                        of a Bridge. This is, that the obstruction placed in the middle of the
                        stream, to cause a certain quantity of water to go down the Mill-race,
                        interferes with the free passage of wagons and carriages. To this we answer
                        that the interference does not amount to much even as it stands at present ,
                        and it would be easy to remedy it altogether. We would not give a fig for
                        the inventive genius of any kind of man who could not furnish a plan for
                        dividing the water of the Spring at the King street crossing, so that the
                        obstruction raised would present no obstacle worth mentioning to the free
                        passage of the wheeled vehicles. And this improvement would not cost more
                        than a couple of hundred dollars at the outside whilst a Bridge would run
                        into thousands </p>
