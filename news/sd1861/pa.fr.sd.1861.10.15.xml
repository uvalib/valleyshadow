                    <p>October 8, 1861.</p>
                    <p>We will give a table of the vote of each District in the County, in our next
                        issue.--The following is the total vote received by each candidate:</p>
                    <p>For President Judge,<lb/> James Nill, 3498 / Wilson Reilly, 2835</p>
                    <p>For Associate Judge,<lb/> Jas. O. Carson, 3643 / Aug. Duncan, 2730</p>
                    <p>For Assembly,<lb/> John Rowe, 3635 / C. D. Lesher , 2766 <lb/> W. W. Sellers,
                        3365 / H. S. Wishart, 2770</p>
                    <p>For Treasurer,<lb/> Geo. J. Balsley, 3650 / Sam'l Fisher, 2730</p>
                    <p>For Commissioner,<lb/> Jno. Nitterhouse, 3597 / Jos. M. Doyle, 2882</p>
                    <p>For Director of the Poor,<lb/> Wm. S. Harris, 3586 / John Croft, 2792</p>
                    <p>For Auditor,<lb/> D. K. Wunderlich, 3603 / Jno. Gillan, jr. [sic], 2770</p>
                    <p>For Coroner,<lb/> J. A. Hyssong, 3606 / W. H. Boyle, 2738</p>
                    <p>We have not been able to obtain the full vote of the several Counties, but
                        the following are the official majorities for Judge:</p>
                    <p>Nill. <lb/> Franklin, . . .663 <lb/> Somerset, . . . 161 </p>
                    <p>Reilly, <lb/> Fulton, . . .172 <lb/> Bedford, . . .563</p>
                    <p>This leaves Mr. Nill 89 of a majority in the District, with the Volunteer
                        vote to hear from. Of this vote sufficient has been received as to induce
                        the opponents of Mr. Nill to concede his election by a majority of 125,
                        which is not very large--not what the friends of the Union Ticket had reason
                        to expect--but yet it is large enough for all useful purposes.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The editor of <emph rend="italic">The Times</emph> says that, "according to
                        the doctrine of the <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>," "the result of the
                        recent election must be calculated to give great encouragement to the
                        rebels." It cannot be otherwise. Instead of a divided, we should have shown
                        the enemy a solid front. The people of the North should have acted upon the
                        advice of such leading Democrats as Holt, of Kentucky; Butler, of
                        Massachusetts; Dickinson, of New York, and that noble Irish patriot, Thomas
                        F. Meagher, all of whom admonished the people to disregard political
                        parties, form Union Tickets, and by giving such Tickets a unanimous support,
                        it would have shown the Southern rebels that the North was a unit in
                        sentiment in its purpose to sustain the Administration in its efforts to
                        crush the rebellion and that fact would have gone farther to dispirit the
                        rebels than a defeat on the battle-field.</p>
                    <p>So far as the Republicans are concerned, there are no sympathizes with the
                        rebellion in their ranks. The Democratic party, we are sorry to say, cannot
                        say as much. While we know that there are thousands of that party just as
                        true and loyal to the Government, and just as ready to die for the
                        maintainance [sic] of the Constitution and the Union, as are the
                        Republicans, we are, nevertheless, constrained to say, that all the
                        sympathizers with the rebellion, in the North, are found in the Democratic
                        party, and this the editor of <emph rend="italic">The Times</emph> knows as
                        well as we do.</p>
                    <p>In the rebellious States there is no open apposition to the rebellion-there
                        is no division of sentiment. In the North we are divided into political
                        parties, and where there are opposing parties, there must be something that
                        causes the people to divide. Division presupposes opposition to something.
                        What is it? And if this division does not "give great encouragement to the
                        rebels," they must be very hard to please.</p>
                    <p>The Republicans of this Representative as well as the Judicial District, were
                        decidedly in the majority, and had no favors to ask from the Democratic
                        party. But desiring to show the world, " and the rest of mankind" that they
                        love their country more than party, they proposed to unite with their
                        Democratic fellow-citizens in the formation of a Union Ticket, to be
                        composed of men of different political views, and thus divide with them the
                        places to be filled. It was magnanimous for the Republicans, under the
                        circumstances, to propose a union with their political opponents. The offer
                        was, however, rejected by a large part of the Democratic party, and we held
                        that the result exhibited by the recent election, and which was bro't about,
                        in a great measure, by the course persued [sic] by the editor of <emph
                            rend="italic">The Times</emph>, is well calculated to "give great
                        encouragement to the Rebels." </p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Washington, Oct. 11--For the information of many persons who have come, at a
                        great sacrifice of time, money, and personal comfort, to Washington for the
                        purpose of visiting their relatives in the army on the Virginia side of the
                        Potomac, it is proper to state, that as General McClellan considers such
                        visits inconsistent with the good of the soldiers, as well as prejudicial to
                        the success of the army generally, he has, by positive orders, refused
                        passes. The constant communication of families with their brothers,
                        husbands, and sons, is prevented by the refusal, which, in very many
                        instances, is the occasion of much painful embarrassment to the officer in
                        charge, as well as to those who, after reaching Washington, are without
                        means of providing for their comfort. Many visit the city merely through
                        curiosity, but they incur a needless expense, as it cannot be gratified. No
                        passes are granted excepting in extreme cases, where it is positively
                        necessary.</p>

                    to the soldiers and to the cause in general.</summary>

                    <p>The benefits of a wise economy are not confined to the mere saving of money.
                        They have a moral bearing, and influence the character for good. An
                        exchange, discoursing on the ingenious methods that resorted to be the
                        feminine part of creation to get along and make a "good appearance," without
                        taking any more money out of the pockets of their husbands and fathers,
                        says:</p>
                    <p>The old bonnet--once such "a love of a thing"--has been taken out and fixed
                        over, and so much taste has been developed in the doing of it, and so much
                        of real cheerfulness of spirit has been cultivated, that it is a subject of
                        sincere regret, that our fair friends are not obliged to wear over their old
                        bonnets and things every year! Think of the good done the social state by
                        it; there is the sweet temper gained, the taste developed, the ingenuity
                        brought out, the self-reliance established, and the true courage made plain,
                        in this single act, that very soon makes itself felt in the social state
                        everywhere.</p>
                    <p>There, my good lady, when you were busy exerting your ingenuity to <emph
                            rend="italic">do over</emph> your old bonnet, you were not aware that
                        you were a public benefactor! We know an old lady who has worn one bonnet
                        for <emph rend="italic">seventeen</emph> years, and she has not been so very
                        far behind the fashions either, but has always appeared like a gentlewoman,
                        even with that old bonnet on. Her tact and ingenuity were equal to every
                        caprice and fashion, and she never allowed it to so far out run her as to
                        give to the appearance of oddity.</p>
                    <p>These times of adversity give our ladies an opportunity to show what stuff
                        they are made of, and some of them shame the men.</p>
