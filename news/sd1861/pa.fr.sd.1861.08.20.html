                        filled to its utmost capacity, of individuals of all party predilections,
                        who came forward, with the highest and most patriotic motives, to
                        countenance and aid the formation of a Party in Franklin county, regardless
                        of all party distinctions heretofore recognized, but governed, animated and
                        influenced by the fundamental nd [sic] leading idea of supporting the
                        National Administration in its efforts to crush the Rebellion, to maintain
                        the Constitution and the integrity of the Union, and to enforce the Laws.</p>
                    <p>A more glorious assemblage never before convened in that Hall of Justice. The
                        patriot's heart could not but leap with joy at the utterances of the several
                        speaker, and the outbursts of applause with which they were received by the
                        audiance [sic], it must have pulsated with feelings of degradation, shame
                        and confusion, at the thought, that while love of country and of National
                        unity animated all around, it alone, like the toad, was cold, clammy, and
                        repulsive.</p>

                        twelve hundred dollars for one. The Rebel leaders are by
                            this time aware that they cannot fight us except with superior numbers,
                            and these they will have, if they have to make a levy en masse of the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An effort is about being made to raise a Regiment of soldiers in Franklin
                        County. A number of prominent citizens in different parts of the County, we
                        understand, are prepared not only to give the movement their aid and
                        influence, but take positions as privates in the ranks, or as officers, as
                        the several companies to compose it may determine.</p>
                    <p>The thing is not only practicable, but highly praiseworthy. This County at
                        the present time, since the return of the three months men, cannot have more
                        than 200 or 250 men in the field, while we have a population of more than
                        40,000. The companies now in the field, and which were organized in this
                        County, are composed in great part, but not entirely, of our citizens.
                        Without stating it as a fact, but which we think will approximate the truth,
                        we would say that of our own people, there are not more than 60 men in
                        Captain Dixon's company, 40 in Lieut. Col. Campbell's, 50 in Capt. Eyster's,
                        and 50 in Capt. Stetzel's, altogether, 200.</p>
                    <p>In the war of 1812, Franklin, with a much less population, threw into the
                        field, if we have been correctly informed, something more than 800 men. If
                        the County could do that much nearly half a century ago, she ought surely be
                        able to raise a Regiment now for the war--especially when it is a war for
                        the very maintainance [sic] of our existence as a Nation.</p>
                    <p>A company can be organized, consisting of 1 Captain, 1 First and 1 Second
                        Lieutenant, 5 Sergeants, 8 Corporals and 63 Privates, making 79 men, rank
                        and file; but to be admitted into the service, each company must ocntain
                        [sic] 104 men.</p>
                    <p>If the proper effort was made, there is no reason why the points we are about
                        to name, in connection with the country surrounding each, could not muster a
                        Company to make up the Regiment, viz: The Valley 1 Company, Loudon and St.
                        Thomas 1, Mercersburg 1, Upton and Welsh Run 1, Greencastle 1, Waynesboro'
                        1, Quincy 1, Fayetteville 1, Chambersburg 2. If a full company cannot be
                        raised at the points named, the greater part of one can, and thus the
                        fractions can be thrown together to form a whole.</p>
                    <p>Let an energetic trial be made, and we feel assured that the patriotism of
                        Franklin Co. would not let the noble object fail of entire and complete
                        success. As yet, our people are not arroused [sic] sufficiently to the
                        importance of the tremendous struggle in which our country is involved. It
                        is time, however, that they were. The enemy is presumptuous and daring, and,
                        to secure his final triumph, resorts to fire, impressment, robbery and
                        purgery [sic]. To meet such an enemy, it is time that the people and the
                        Government would become terribly in earnest. Every movement and act of the
                        Rebels exhibits their determination, and the friends of the Government must
                        put on their whole panoply of strength, and crush out the monster Treason at
                        once, and thus prevent a protracted struggle.</p>
                    <p>The people of Franklin County at least should be in earnest. We occupy a
                        border county, and the thing is within the range of possibilities that we
                        might yet be compelled to meet the enemy on our own soil, and witness not
                        only the destruction of our fields and dwellings, but the ruthless murder of
                        wives and little ones. Arouse! then, people of Franklin, and aid the
                        formation of this Regiment, and thus contribute to push the war into the
                        enemy's country. The South has most cruelly brought it on-let the South feel
                        its full force and weight.</p>
