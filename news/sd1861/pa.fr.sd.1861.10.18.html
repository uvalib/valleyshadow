<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>After an existence of eighty-five years as an independent nation--recognized
                        by all Government as the peer of either; with a growth of population
                        unparalleled, and a development of wealth and national resources which has
                        astounded the world; with a future, upon which the nation was just entering
                        with giant strides, that bid fair to place us, in point of influence,
                        prosperity, strength, and power, if not in the lead, at least among the
                        first nations of the earth; with a system of government the least
                        oppressive, and the best ever devised by human wisdom, in which the rights
                        of all were abundantly protected--to have such a picture, such a glowing
                        prospect, marred by a few bad, ambitious men, is sufficient to arouse not
                        only the wrath of men but the indignation of angels.</p>
                    <p>But deplorable as it is, the bright prospects of our country have been
                        clouded by the rebellious spirits of the South, who have precipitated a
                        revolution for the purpose of subverting the Government, which cannot but be
                        regarded as the most wicked, the most unreasonable and the most
                        unjustifiable that is found upon the page of the world's history.</p>
                    <p>Ours is, emphatically, the People's Government, and it is for the People to
                        say, whether it shall be maintained intact, with all its advantages and
                        blessings, not only for the present but for future generations, or whether
                        the fair fabric shall be permitted to crumble before their eyes, shorn of
                        its strength and beautiful proportions, resulting in anarchy and confusion,
                        and productive of the worst evils which afflict any people anywhere.</p>
                    <p>We are in the war for the maintainance [sic] of the Constitution and the
                        union, and having laid the hand to the plow, it will not do to look
                        back--our watchword must be onward to victory. Any other course would but
                        prove our people cravens, unworthy of their glorious inheritance. If we
                        would command the respect of the world, the rebellion must be crushed out,
                        though it should cost untold treasure and blood, and we must exhibit to
                        mankind everywhere, at home and abroad, the ability of the Republic to
                        maintain itself against the attacks of internal as well as foreign enemies.
                        The time for compromising with the thieving, perjured rebels, has long since
                        passed; and if the whole people have not already made up their minds to
                        carry the war to a successful conclusion, it is time they would. It cost too
                        much blood and treasure to secure our Republican Government, and we should
                        be willing to spend an hundred times as much to maintain it. If the teeming
                        millions of the North but put their shoulders to the wheel, the work will b
                        accomplished in good time--the Constitution will be maintained, the Union
                        will be saved, and peace will be restored--and our country will against
                        resume her march on the road to prosperity and to her destined greatness and
                        grandeur.</p>

<b>A Short Cut to Peace</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mocks the Valley Spirit's solution to the current conflict, which is to
                    eliminate the Republican party. Argues that if the Spirit really wanted to end
                    the conflict and to eliminate all parties, they should have supported the Union
                    party in the recent election.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our neighbor of the Spirit has discovered a
                        panacea which is warranted to cure the ills of the country--"the remedy"
                        that will be sure to restore Peace to our borders; and he is so confident in
                        its curative properties that he asserts that our troubles "never will be settled until that is adopted." Now,
                        reader, what do you suppose the balsam is that is possessed of such intense,
                        double-distilled, concentrated Union-saving virtue?</p>
                    <p>Do you reply, it must be larger armies, more bullets, and heavier blows on
                        the heads of the traitorous crew that are in revolt against our mild
                        government. That is a reasonable and sensible idea, and one that a real
                        Union man would suggest as not only practicable, but the only one that would
                        seem to be possessed of those medicinal qualities and virtues demanded by a
                        natural and sensible treatment of the disease. But even this is not "the
                        remedy" proposed by the Spirit, and not to detain you longer, we will reveal
                        the secret in our neighbor's own language, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"If the real Union men of the North, Democrats, old line Whigs and
                        conservative Republicans will unite and crush out the Greeley and Beecher
                        Black Republican party, the Union may yet be restored without much
                        bloodshed."</p>
                    <p>This appears to be a very silly (simple we should have said) remedy for so
                        terrible a disease; but to show the insincerity of the Spirit, and that it has no confidence in its own prescription,
                        why did it not unite with the "real Union Democrats," old line Whigs and
                        conservative Republicans," at the late election to "crush out" not only "the
                        Greeley and Beecher Black Republican party," which seems to be so very
                        heinous in its estimation, but all other parties that stood in the way, and
                        consolidate a great Union Party on their ruins? No, no; that didn't come up
                        to our neighbor's Union-saving idea. He only wants the "Black Republican
                        party" "crushed out," judging from the manner in which he rejected the union
                        proposed by the Republicans before the election.</p>
                    <p>The Republican party is the "Mordecai at the king's gate," and which so
                        offends this Union-saving Haman; and as long as Mordecai is in the way,
                        Haman will not save the Union. So grievous in the estimation of the Spirit, is the existence [sic] of the Republican
                        party, that if it could save the Union by any other means than the one it
                        suggests, the Union might go to the dogs, for all it cared, rather than use
                        the other remedy.</p>
