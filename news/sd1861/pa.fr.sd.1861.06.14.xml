                    <p>Washington, June 10th.--The non-payment of the troops, which is exciting some
                        comment, is caused by the absence of the necessary pay-rolls. There is no
                        lack of money or of a disposition on the part of the Government to pay them.
                        So soon as the requisite forms can be complied with, this temporary
                        inconvenience will be remedied.</p>
                    <p>A recent General Order of the War Department is as follows:--"Second
                        Lieutenant W. McCreery, Fourth Artillery, having tendered his resignation
                        when in the face of the rebels, his name will be struck from the rolls of
                        the Army.</p>

                    the Second regiment paid a visit to Chambersburg. They became drunk in the
                    morning and then "succeeded in becoming remarkably conspicuous in various parts
                    of the town." They fired their muskets in the street, rang the fire bells, and
                    sang songs before they were apprehended and put into the court house cellar.
                    There, one of the troops began to fight with a Polish volunteer. Finally, the
                    soldiers were marched back to camp.</summary>

                    <p>The following orders have been issued by General Patterson:</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg, Pa., June 5, 1861.</p>
                    <p>General Orders, No. 25--Commanding officers of brigades, regiments,
                        battalions and companies, will give their attention to the following
                        requirements, and will be held responsible requirements, and will be held
                        responsible to a strict compliance with them:</p>
                    <p>I. The allowance of transportation to troops on the march shall not exceed
                        the following: and this, as soon as practicable, will be reduced under the
                        direction of the Chief Quartermaster:--</p>
                    <p>A general officer and his staff, 1 wagon.</p>
                    <p>Field and staff and band of a regiment, 1 wagon.</p>
                    <p>Cavalry or horse artillery company, 1 1/2 wagon.</p>
                    <p>Infantry company, 1 wagon.</p>
                    <p>The baggage will be limited to musket cartridges, camp and garrison equipage
                        and officers' baggage, (mess chest and personal effects included), not to
                        exceed the regulation allowance, viz:--</p>
                    <p>For general officers, 125 pounds.</p>
                    <p>Field officers, 100 pounds.</p>
                    <p>Captains, 80 pounds.</p>
                    <p>Subalterns, 80 pounds.</p>
                    <p>II. The regimental and battalion Quartermasters will each be responsible for
                        the baggage train of his command, and will fill all requisitions for
                        transportation made upon him by the chief of the Quartermaster's department.</p>
                    <p>III. The commands to march from this point will take in their wagons four
                        days' provision, and in their wagons four days' provision, and in their
                        haversacks one ration. Troops will always have in their haversacks, and
                        carry on the march, one ration, cooked.</p>
                    <p>The medical officers will take only those articles which the Medical Director
                        shall designate.</p>
                    <p>IV. A depot or depots for supplies will be established on the line of
                        operations at one or more convenient points, and different commands will be
                        directed to send their requisitions, properly approved, to specified places,
                        always sending in time to be supplied before their provisions are expended,
                        and yet not have on hand enough to trammel a movement.</p>
                    <p>Extra supplies and surplus baggage will be sent with an invoice to the
                        Quartermaster, to be forwarded from this point, on favorable opportunities,
                        after the necessary provisions, medical stores, etc., are in position.</p>
                    <p>V. On the march and in camp, purchases of authorized supplies will be made by
                        the proper Quartermasters and Commissaries only on the orders of their
                        commander, and, if they have not funds, certificates of the purchases will
                        be given, to be presented for payment to the chief of the proper department
                        at these head-quarters.</p>
                    <p>VI. Nothing whatever is to be taken for public purposes without due
                        compensation, and by authorized agents, and if depredations are committed
                        upon persons or property, the offenders, if recognized, must be promptly
                        punished, and when in the power of the United States, compensation rendered.</p>
                    <p>VII. Every opportunity to drill must be employed to instruct the men and
                        discipline them. Officers must not act under the delusion that troops are
                        perfect in their exercises, or that the time will ever come, while they
                        remain in the field, when relaxation in duty or drill will not impair
                        efficiency, and render them unworthy of the confidence of the Government and
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>By order of Major-General Patterson, <lb/> F. J. Porter, Ass't Adjutant
                        General.</p>
