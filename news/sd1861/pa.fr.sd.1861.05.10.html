<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The traitors of the South committed a very grave error, when, because a few
                        northern office-holders held sympathy with them, in the incipiency and even
                        more progressive stages of the rebellion, they supposed the North could be
                        divided against itself, and thus fall an easy prey to their rapacious
                        villainy. The mistake was to many of them a natural one, and shows, most
                        emphatically, their gross ignorance of the Northern people. Their own
                        masses--rude, ignorant, coarse, and in many cases, desperate and
                        semi-barbarous--are easily led on by artful men, to consummate almost any
                        wicked folly in the name of Southern Rights. Having such a population at
                        home, they, measuring Northern intelligence and patriotism by their own
                        standard, supposed that a few energetic leaders here could, as YANCY said of
                        the South, fire from the heart and precipitate a revolution.</p>
                    <p>There was the rock upon which they split; this blunder of their own
                        ignorance, led them to commit the greatest of all blunders--Secession itself. </p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A few days ago, we had the pleasure of visiting Camp Slifer. Everything about
                        it has a military air. The troops are drilled regularly, and are rapidly
                        improving. The quarters, which are board shanties, put up under the
                        supervision of Mr. Joseph Frey, and experienced mechanic of this place, are
                        comfortable, so far as we could learn; and although considerable rain has
                        fallen since the formation of the camp, have leaked but little. There seems
                        to be a disposition in all concerned to do the best for all others, and but
                        one complaint seems to exist. This is a sad one, and we feel sorry it is so.
                        It appears, that a great deal of the bread is of very poor quality, and in
                        many cases, the men have not enough, even of that. How it occurs, we know
                        not, but have heard quite a number of the men express, how different was
                        their treatment at camp Curtin, (Harrisburg,) and say, that if there was not
                        an alteration they should return to their homes whenever their three months
                        of enlistment are up. At the Western Camp, we were informed both by officers
                        and men, that their provisions were both good and plentiful, and we cannot
                        see any good reason why it should not be so at Camp Slifer. Wherever the
                        defect exists we hope it may be speedily remedied. For to have good
                        soldiers, they must be well cared for both as regards food and clothing, but
                        especially that of food. It must be wholesome, or there will be sickness;
                        there must be a sufficiency, or there will be weakness, or perhaps
                        insubordination. Our soldiers deserve well of us. Many of the men here
                        encamped, have left good homes to uphold our liberties, to guard our
                        hearthstones from desecration, and protect us, our wives, and our little
                        ones from the invasion of our foes. Such men should be held in honor by us.
                        They should not want for any comfort be given them while in the service of
                        their country.</p>
