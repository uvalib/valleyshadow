                <summary>Brief articles containing news from Washington, including the announcement
                    that the government has begun to call all volunteers to Washington in order to
                    organize them into companies and regiments regardless of the state from which
                    they came. Also notes that the Lincoln administration has decided to issue a
                    warning to seditious newspapers that persist in publishing journals that support
                    the rebellion. If the warning is not heeded, these journals will be suppressed.</summary>

                    in New York, where he is, according to the Dispatch, "one of the most ultra
                    Democratic politicians." The Dispatch commends Dickinson for preferring "his
                    country to his party" and expresses the wish that those Democrats in Franklin
                    County who subscribe to the Day Book should follow Dickinson's example.</summary>

                            <emph rend="italic">Inquirer</emph>, the Rebel journals have let us
                        plainly see that the exultations over the battle of Bull Run have given
                        place to a most uncomfortable feeling that they have won a victory at a very
                        heavy sacrifice of life that could ill be spared, and yet have advanced
                        themselves little or nothing. We see Washington more impregnable than ever;
                        Northern troops hurrying in at a rate that far more than makes up for the
                        expiration of the three month enlistments; and unconquerable General opposed
                        to them; and they begin to ask themselves how many such fields must be
                        fought and won before they establish their Secession. With ports blockaded,
                        business stagnant, negroes preparing for insurrection, and paper trash
                        circulating in place of specie, the prospect for them is indeed very dismal,
                        and they begin to feel it so. </p>

                    <p>"The <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> wants party issues and is berating
                        the Democracy for not making them in its late County meeting."--<emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph>.</p>
                    <p>In representing us as desiring "party issues" in the approaching canvass, the
                            <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> wilfully misrepresents us. As our
                        neighbor knows exactly what we did say, we leave it to his sense of honor to
                        state our position correctly. With the intelligent reader, truth has more
                        force than falsehood or misrepresentation. </p>
                    <p>Our position is the very reverse of what our neighbor says it is. We are for
                        laying aside all "party issues" until the Rebellion is crushed out. We want
                        Republicans, Democrats, American and Whigs all to forget, for the time
                        being, their various political tenets in the greater question of Union or No
                        Union--Government or No Government that is upon us. This is no time for
                        "party issues," such as have heretofore engaged the attention of the several
                        parties. The House is on fire, and it is too late to inquire how it was
                        fired. Our duty it [sic] to extinguish the flames, and inquire into the
                        cause of the fire afterwards. When we have re-established the Union, and
                        again set the wheels of Government going as formerly, it will be an easy
                        matter for us to resume our position as Republicans, and for Democrats to go
                        back to the household of their political faith. Then, and not before, will
                        we countenance or discuss "party issues," such as have heretofore engaged
                        the attention of politicians--and he who pursues a different course--who
                        discountenances the combination of all parties in a common brotherhood the
                        better to enable them to repell [sic] the destroyer of the Government--in
                        our opinion, lacks that holy, burning zeal of patriotism that warms the
                        heart of every true friend of the Union.</p>

                <excerpt>"We do not now, nor did we ever indulge such a foolish idea that all the

                    <p>The Democratic Press of Montgomery county, says the Harrisburg <emph
                            rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>, are boasting that the regiment which
                        left that vicinity to serve for three months, did not contain more than
                            <emph rend="italic">forty</emph> Republicans. The Norristown <emph
                            rend="italic">Register</emph> is particularly jubilant over this fact,
                        and becomes very sarcastic towards the Wide-Awakes who did not join <emph
                            rend="italic">that</emph> regiment composed entirely of Democrats. It is
                        the best explanation we can possibly quote.--</p>
                    <p>"On the eve of the battle the <emph rend="italic">fourth</emph> Pennsylvania
                        regiment of volunteers and the battery of volunteer artillery of the New
                        York Eighth militia, whose term of service expired, insisted on their
                        discharge that night.--It was granted, and the next morning, when the army
                        moved forward into battle, these troops moved to the rear to the sound of
                        the enemy's cannon." </p>
                    <p>We do not now, nor did we ever indulge such a foolish idea that all the
                        courage and bravery in the country was confined to the Republican party, as
                        such. All Americans are brave, whether Democrats or Republicans, and are
                        ready to offer up their lives for their country. But we have regarded it as
                        in very bad taste for Democratic journals to be constantly impugnity [sic]
                        the courage of Republicans, and asserting that in this war for the Republic
                        the Democrats will wear "the knapsacks," while "the offices" will be
                        bestowed upon the Republicans--or, in other words, that the Democrats will
                        have to bear the brunt of this conflict. Whether this is so or not, one
                        thing is certain, we would endeavor to keep the matter as a profound secret
                        from our children if we had been a member of the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Fourth</emph> regiment, which, according to the statement of Democratic
                        journals, was so exclusively Democratic that not more than <emph
                            rend="italic">forth</emph> Republicans were attached to it, and which,
                        in response to the urgent solicitations of the General and of the Secretary
                        of War (according to the official statement,) who conjured it to co-operate
                        with our brave little army, then in actual deadly conflict with the enemy,
                        and in that trying hour this Democratic regiment peremtorily [sic] declined,
                        and "marched to the rear, <emph rend="italic">to the sound of the enemy's
                            guns!</emph>" </p>
                    <p>We know these comparisons are detestible [sic], odious, but Democratic
                        journals should not institute them. We dislike to refer to this matter, and
                        do it only in self-defense.--But we must say, that if the permanency of the
                        Union depends upon such Democratic Regiments as the <emph rend="italic"

                    <p>A Petition was circulated in our town on Friday last, for signatures, praying
                        the Town Council of the Borough to appoint a Police force or Night Watch.
                        This movement grew out of the mysterious affair of Thursday night last, at
                        Shepler, Clark &amp; Co.'s shop, an account of which we give in another
                        place. The Petition was numerously signed.</p>
                    <p>In compliance with the prayer of the petitioners, the Council appointed some
                        ten or eleven persons as a Police or Night Watch, at a compensation of $20
                        per month each.</p>
                    <p>We were among those who signed this petition, but regret now that we done so,
                        and are sorry, for several reasons, that the Council granted the prayer:</p>
                    <p>I. The extra expense incurred by the Council in the employment of this Watch,
                        will add much to the burden of the Tax-payers of the Borough, which is now
                        no trifling matter, in view of the extreme stringency of the monetary
                        affairs of the Country, and of the complete prostration of every business
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>II. The number employed is not sufficient for the purpose designed, as the
                        beat of each must necessarily be too extensive for any part of it to be
                        efficiently protected.</p>
                    <p>III. We know of no reason why a sufficient number of our citizens could not
                        be brought together and properly organized, to patrol the town for its
                        protection at night, without any cost to the Borough. Surely a body of men
                        possessing public spirit enough for such a purpose, can be found in
                        Chambersburg, sufficiently numerous to throw out twenty or thirty
                        individuals one night in each week as a patrol. It would be no great
                        sacrifice or self-denial for a man to loose [sic] one night's rest out of
                        seven for the good of this community: and if 140 men will combine for the
                        purpose, appoint their officers, and thus reduce the thing to a system, 20
                        of this number could be detailed for each successive night of the week, and
                        thus secure double the protection we have now, without any cost to the
                        Borough--or from a body of 210 men, a patrol of 30 men could be detailed for
                        each night. We suggest this plan for the consideration of the community, and
                        by way of showing that we do not ask others to do what we would not do
                        ourselves, our services are hereby tendered to take our turn, weekly, as
                        long as it would be deemed necessary to maintain such a vigilance.</p>
                    <p>We propose that a meeting of citizens be called to ascertain whether such a
                        force cannot be organized. Property holders are especially interested in
                        this matter, not only because their property may be in peril, but they are
                        interested also from their having to bear the principal burden of Taxation.
                        Property-holders, should compose this Watch, and if any disliked to perform
                        the duties required, they could easily employ substitutes.</p>
                    <p>The Police force now on duty will cost the Borough $240 a month or $2,400 per
                        annum; and owing to the troubles of the country, our proximity to the
                        enemy's lines, and the numerous bad men that will be constantly prowling
                        through our community, there is no telling how long it may be necessary to
                        maintain this Police force. It will scarcely do to dispense with it short of
                        a year anyhow, and it would be well, therefore, for our taxpayers to think
                        of this matter before much expense has been incurred.</p>

                    <p>About ten o'clock on Thursday night last, (as the story goes) a light was
                        observed in the Planing, Sawing and Wood-Working Shop of Messrs. Shepler,
                        Clarke, &amp; Co., by Mr. Levi Lippy, who resides in the vicinity of the
                        establishment. It was something altogether unusual, and Mr. L. proceeded
                        immediately to investigate the cause. On arriving at the place, he
                        discovered a man crawling into the window, while another was inside with a
                        bunch of ignited matches in his hand. Mr. Lippy immediately accosted them as
                        to their business, when they replied that they were hunting a place to
                        sleep. After remonstrating with them, they left, when information of the
                        occurrence was conveyed to one of the proprietors, who employed Lippy to
                        watch the premises during the night.</p>
                    <p>About 1 o'clock of the same night as he was maintaining his vigils, he
                        observed a man approaching. When the stranger had approached within a few
                        steps of him, Lippy hailed him, and inquired his business there at such an
                        hour. The stranger, undaunted, and still approaching nearer, replied, that
                        he had "come to burn the establishment, and he was going to burn the whole
                        town, as it was noting but a d-----d abolition hold anyhow." Lippy drew a
                        pistol, but before he could discharge it, the ruffian knocked it out of his
                        hand, seized him by the throat, drew a knife and made several thrust at him,
                        which Lippy succeeded [sic] in avoiding, when he raised an alarm by crying
                        "fire!" "murder," &amp;c. As the ruffian released his hold, he dealt
                        Lippy a blow in the face, and then run. Lippy states that he succeed [sic]
                        in finding his pistol, fired after the man, but with what effect he could
                        not say. Lippy's clothing is cut in several places, but he suffered no
                        bodily injury.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing is the substance of Lippy's statement, made under oath before
                        Justice Hammon on the morning after the occurrence.</p>

                    Later, another man approached the shop and declared that he intended to burn it
