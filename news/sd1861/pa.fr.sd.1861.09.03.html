<b>Local News</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Complains of the dearth of local news at present.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a complete dearth of items of local news in our community, as can
                        well be imagined. We have not even an occurrence of a dog fight, or the
                        burning of a chimney, to record. Although we occupy a position almost within
                        sight of the camp of the rebels, we never knew this community before to have
                        fallen into a state of such complete repose and quiet as it exhibits at this
                        time. Business is stagnant, men are idle, money is scarce, and yet all seem
                        to be getting along as well as when the hum of industry resounded in your
                        ears at every turn. The omnibus is seen regularly on our streets at stated
                        hours, the cars make their appointed trips, the sun shines occasionally,
                        water runs, and grass continues to grow, but we are not informed of any
                        thing else that might be considered as worth recording.</p>
