<b>False Colors</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that aside from such loyal Democrats as J. McD. Sharpe, the
                    Democrats, who held a convention the previous Tuesday, harbored many men
                    professing to be Unionists, but inevitably revealing their true colors as
                    "traitors" to the flag.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In several of the engagements which have taken place between the Federal
                        forces and the Rebels, some of the Regiments of the latter, for the purpose
                        of deceiving, marched under the Stars and Stripes, and thus obtained
                        advantages over our troops and positions on the field, that they could not
                        have done under their true colors.</p>
                    <p>This is precisely the position which the Breckinridge Day-Book Democrats of Franklin County, under the marshalship of
                        the Valley Spirit, now occupy. In their
                        Convention on Tuesday last, they adopted a Platform similar to that of the
                        Union party, but from their down-cast and sullen countenances, it was
                        plainly perceptable [sic] that they were making a virtue of necessity.</p>
                    <p>We understand that about a quire or quire and a-half of fools-cap was wasted by one or two of the leaders in vain
                        efforts to draw up resolutions expressive of he sense of the Day-Book Democracy, with regard to the Government
                        and the Rebellion, but all failed. What would please the traitors,
                        displeased the Union men, and vice versa. A
                        Preamble and Resolutions, advocating Compromise and Peace, and a prosecution
                        of the war, at the same time was scouted by the few really true men of the
                        Convention. J. McD. Sharpe, Esq., and several others would be satisfied with
                        nothing less than an unconditional surrender of the Day-Book Democracy. He drafted a Plaiform [sic] of Principles,
                        on which he and his friends were willing to stand, which he submitted to the
                        Convention, and urged their adoption in a most thrilling and truly loyal
                        speech, during the delivery of which the leading sympathisers with the
                        Rebellion, quailed before the majesty of the truths he uttered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe's political career is an evidence of the truth of the proverb,
                        that "evil communications corrupt good manners;" but while we are sorry that
                        his political morals have manifestly suffered much by his association, we
                        are rejoiced that he has not yet become totally depraved, but that through
                        his tattered political robes, evidences of "old decency" may yet be
                        seen--evidences of the political virtue which he acquired in the old Whig
                        school in which he was educated. The speech he delivered on this occasion,
                        would have been creditable to him in the palmiest days of his opposition to
                        the disunionists, and but for it, the Democracy of Franklin this day would
                        have been pledged to the support of a degrading "Peace Policy."--When he
                        resumed his seat, his resolutions came up, and one by one they were adopted,
                        about one-third of the Delegates voting, the rest remaining silent and
                        dumbfounded.</p>
                    <p>While Mr. Sharpe was thus successful in throwing the lion's skin over his
                        party in this county, its ears protrude too far to deceive any one as to the
                        species of the animal it covers; but if its ears are no evidence, the bray of the thing should satisfy all as to its true
                        character. Now listen to the bray of the animal.</p>
                    <p>Augustus Duncan, the Democratic candidate for Associate Judge, when called
                        upon to contribute to the fund for the relief of the families of the
                        soldiers who had marched to defend the Capital of the country from the
                        attack of the rebel hordes that were menacing it, and to lay down their
                        lives, if need be, in defense of the Union, replied, in substance, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>"I have no part in this war--have no sympathies with it--and will give
                        nothing towards its support."</p>
                    <p>The lion's skin does not quite cover this Democratic candidate, and from the
                        sounds uttered it is easily told whether he is "a man or a mouse," or, in
                        other words, whether he is not marching under false colors.</p>
                    <p>Christian Lesher, the choice of the Peace Democracy of Franklin for the
                        Legislature, asserted on our streets on the day he was nominated, that</p>
                    <p>"He was for compromise--for Peace; and would now favor the adoption of the
                        Crittenden Compromise to secure that end."</p>
                    <p>If we judge Mr. Lesher by the standard set up by that noble and truly loyal
                        old Democrat, Hon. Joseph Holt, of Kentucky, we must conclude that Mr.
                        Sharpe's lion skin does not altogether hide his deformity either. In a
                        speech in Boston, a few days ago, Mr. Holt said--"The word 'Compromise' now
                        was only uttered by disloyal lips, or those in the interest of the rebellion." This being so,
                        we must conclude that Mr. Lesher is before the loyal people of the District
                        under false colors too. </p>
                    <p>One of the proprietors of the Valley Spirit, just
                        before the outbreak of the rebellion, remarked:</p>
                    <p>"When it comes to fighting, I will be with the South."</p>
                    <p>Another gentleman, whose name was before the Convention as a candidate for
                        Associate Judge, but was withdrawn before a ballot was taken, said--</p>
                    <p>"If there was any shooting to be done, he would go to the other side of the
                        Line and would shoot North."</p>
                    <p>A prominent leader in the Convention, and who has recently filled a Court
                        House Office, to show his colors, and which way his sympathies encline
                        [sic], has remarked that</p>
                    <p>"All the patriotism, all the statesmanship, and all the religion was with the
                        South."</p>
                    <p>As straws show which way the wind blows, these expressions of the Day Book Democracy go to show the real character of
                        both the candidates and the leaders of that party.--They are fighting under
                        false colors, and they should be unmasked--they have "stolen the livery of
                        heaven to serve the devil in." </p>

<b>Death of Jeff. Davis</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Speculates that if Jefferson Davis indeed proves to be dead, the
                    Confederacy may well be doomed. Points out that the South at present does not
                    benefit from the optimistic circumstances it enjoyed when Davis took office, and
                    that his death would only further demoralize the rebels.<br>

<b>True and False Union Men</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asserts that there are two kinds of Unionists, ones that are devoted "heart
                    and soul unconditionally" to the Union, and ones that are "for the Union, but!"
                    The latter appear overly concerned about not violating Southern rights and about
                    blaming both the North and the South for the present conflict. This type of
                    "Unionism," the Democrat remarks, is detrimental to the federal cause.<br>

<b>That Pistol</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses the opinion that J. McD. Sharpe should not have exhibited a
                    pistol at the recent Democratic convention, asserting that the weapon would
                    constitute his answer to certain persons to whom he had alluded. The Dispatch
                    points out that such a crime, putting aside law and order, would be more
                    reprehensible than the murder of Frank Jones by a group of drunken soldiers. The
                    Dispatch maintains that Mr. Sharpe is more law-abiding than this demonstration
                    would indicate and was merely trying to make a point.<br>
