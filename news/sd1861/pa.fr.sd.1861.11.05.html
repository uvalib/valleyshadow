<b>Our First Six Months</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Assesses the state of the Dispatch after six months of publication.
                    Suggests that the paper might have "gained in strength" more quickly during
                    peace times, but that it was surely, if slowly, becoming a strong competitor
                    with the other newspapers of the county.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This number of the Semi-Weekly Dispatch completes
                        the first six months of its publication, and in that time we have given to
                        its patrons as many numbers as a weekly paper issues in a whole year. Our
                        enterprise, so far, has met with but moderate success; but if the period at
                        which it was started is taken into consideration, as well as the peculiarly
                        deranged affairs of the country, since its commencement, growing out of the
                        unhappy civil strife that is now deluging the land with blood, and which
                        naturally unsettles the business of the country--we repeat, when these very
                        unfavorable circumstances for commencing the publication of a newspaper, are
                        remembered, then the success that has, thus far, attended the Semi-Weekly Dispatch is very flattering indeed, and
                        we are by no means discouraged. When making our arrangements for the issuing
                        of the paper, the country was at peace, and, with others, we had fondly
                        hoped that that peace would not be disturbed; indeed, as a general thing,
                        there was but few that anticipated such an event; but the very first number
                        of the Dispatch issued, contained the startling
                        news of the siege and fall of Fort Sumter--and from that period to the
                        present, war has been desolating our fair land, bringing nothing but ruin
                        and disaster to the best business prospects that ever smiled upon our
                        people.</p>
                    <p>This state of affairs, of course, has interfered much with our prospects and
                        anticipations, and but for which, this hour, even in the face of the great
                        competition in Newspaper publication in the county with which the Dispatch necessarily had to contend, our enterprise
                        would have attained a position far beyond our most sanguine expectations. As
                        it is, we are gaining in strength, more slowly, however, than we would have
                        done under ordinary circumstances, but, perhaps, more surely. We are
                        occasionally adding to our list of subscribers the names of some of the best
                        men in the county, while our Jobbing patronage, we feel assured, is as good
                        as any of our cotemporaries [sic].</p>
                    <p>As we grow older we expect to grow larger, although our two issues a week,
                        with our present size, contains nearly or quite as much reading matter as
                        any other paper in the county, and we know that we give earlier news than
                        any of them, frequently anticipating their publications, in this particular,
                        as much as two or three days. This is the day of Railroads and Telegraphs;
                        San Francisco, on the Pacific, is now in hourly communication with New York,
                        on the Atlantic, a distance between them, perhaps, of 5000 miles, and while
                        the whole world is astir with movements of the most momentous importance to
                        mankind, all are desirous of obtaining a knowledge of the latest events that
                        are transpiring at the very earliest moment. TO those who are not in receipt
                        of a City Daily, a better source for early news cannot be obtained than the
                            Dispatch, as it is the only Semi-Weekly paper
                        published in the county, being issued every Tuesday and Friday of each week.</p>
                    <p>We expect to be able to enlarge the Dispatch at
                        the end of the first volume, and to enable us to do so, we solicite [sic] a
                        helping hand from our friends. Give us your Jobbing and Advertising
                        patronage, and induce your neighbors to subscribe for the Dispatch. As it is the first attempt to establish a
                        Semi-Weekly paper in the county, and as a Newspaper is the best index of the
                        business character of the community in which it is published, the business
                        men of the county should not fail to give our enterprise their warmest
                        approval.</p>
