                    <p>We are permitted to make the following extracts from a letter received in
                        this place by a young lady from her brother, a member of the Cavalry Company
                        partially recruited in this place by Captain (now Major) Stetzel, and which
                        is attached to the Regiment known as Harlan's Cavalry. It will be
                        interesting to many as going to show what the duties of Camp life are among
                        the Soldiers:</p>
                    <p>CAMP PALMER, near Washington, Oct. 27.-- * * * * We are just through
                        inspection. On Sunday morning every man must come out with his clothes clean
                        and his shoes blackened, when the officers go around and inspect the general
                        appearance of every soldier. Our company was the cleanest on the ground this
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>We have had very bad weather; mud is over shoe-top, and on the road to the
                        creek it is above the horses knees. The other day when I was returning from
                        watering the horses, there was an ambulance in front of me, containing a
                        sick man and the horse which was attached to it, sank in the mud until we
                        could but see his back. After working a great while they got him out safe.</p>
                    <p>We get very good provision, fresh meat three times a week, and plenty of bean
                        soup and coffee and tea. We found a potato patch about a mile from Camp,
                        from which only one half of the pototoes [sic] had been taken, and one day
                        last week we dug out about three bushels. Yesterday we had boiled beef, bean
                        soup, fried potatoes and onions, for dinner.</p>
                    <p>We have a board floor in our tents. Our Cupboard consists of a box sunk into
                        the ground, the top even with the floor, and covered with a lid, and two
                        holes dug in the center of the tents serve as a cellar for our potatoes,
                        &amp;c., the middle board of the floor being left loose, so as to have
                        easy access.</p>
                    <p>We have some trouble to get horse feed, as it has to be hauled from such a
                        distance. We passed a foraging party of our men yesterday, who were
                        returning, each of whom had a bundle of hay, which was as high as his head,
                        tied to his saddle. You could scarcely see the men for hay.</p>
                    <p>We are kept pretty busy. The roll is called at 5 o'clock, A. M., after which
                        we attend to our horses, which takes an hour; then we have breakfast. This
                        over, we drill on foot from 9 1/2 till 10 1/2 o'clock; after drill, we water
                        our horses, then get dinner. After dinner we get ready for drill on
                        horseback, which lasts from 2 until 3 1/2 o'clock; we then feed and water
                        our horses; by that time it is dark. On Saturdays we have no drill, but
                        clean up ready for Sunday.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday was my wash day. I made myself a washing machine out of a pine
                        board, across which I cut grooves with my penknife and it is a real good
                        machine.</p>

                <summary>Reports the results of court proceedings that had begun the previous
                    Monday. Samuel Kelly was convicted of "surety of the peace" on the oath of
                    Simeon Kroh. Charges against William Hazelet for surety of the peace were
                    dismissed, despite the oath of Miss E. Clemm. Jacob Perry was convicted of
                    adultery and granted a new trial. The case against Charles Kelso, charged with
                    fornication and bastardy, was continued until the next term. Jacob P. Barr pled
                    guilty to the charges of fornication and bastardy, on the oath of Miss Coner,
                    and his sentence was deferred. George Gelwicks was found not guilty of assault,
                    despite the testimony of Miss Mary E. Henry. Andrew Jones "(col'd)" was
                    convicted of assault and battery on the oath of Mary Jackson "(col'd)" and
                    sentenced to pay a fine of one cent and costs of prosecution, and to serve ten
                    days in jail. The charge of assault and battery against William Hartman was
                    ignored, as were unspecified charges against Jacob Wilderson, Hiram Wilderson,
                    and Samuel Wilderson. Samuel Dysert's case for "rescue from an officer" was
                    continued until next term. The bill against Andrew Meades, "col'd," for
                    receiving stolen goods was ignored. George W. Race was found guilty on one of
                    the seven bills against him for burglary and larceny. Race was sentenced to nine
                    years and six months in the Eastern Penitentiary. David Anderson was sentenced
                    on the charge of surety of the peace to pay prosecution costs and put up $100 to
                    ensure his "future good behavior." Anderson is to remain in custody until he
                    complies with his sentence. Robert Miller was convicted of "maliscious mischief"
                    and sentenced to pay $10 and court costs. John Kreigel was found not guilty of
                    burglary. Nicholas Best was found not guilty of assault and battery, and Jane
                    Piper was ordered to pay court costs. The court found in favor of J. H. Lane,
                    the plantiff, in a case against William Elder to "recover for labor done to
                    Defendant's Tannery," and ordered Elder to pay $82.10. In the case of John
                    Barnitz vs. John Frey, "an action in Trovor," the court found for the defendant.
                    The case brought by J. H. Shireman against Geo. Tritle to recover the value of a
                    new reaper and mower was continued. The article remarks that this will be the
                    last court session over which Judge F. M. Kimmel will preside.</summary>
