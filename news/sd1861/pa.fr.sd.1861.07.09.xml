                <summary>Lincoln outlines to the Senate and House of Representatives the course of
                    the war thus far, including the firing on Fort Sumter, and discusses the
                    constitutional issues surrounding the war. Then Lincoln asks for four hundred
                    thousand volunteers and four hundred million dollars to step up the government
                    effort against the secessionists.</summary>

                    off firecrackers at the street corners. In the evening, however, the shining of
                    the comet led the boys to stop setting off their "Sky Rockets and Roman
