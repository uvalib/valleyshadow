                <summary>Waxes indignant at the behavior in Knoxville, Tennessee, of what the writer
                    says Southern newspapers have referred to as the "Flower of the Alabama youth."
                    A group of young Alabama soldiers, the Knoxville Whig reported, fired from a
                    moving train at "innocent women and children" of Knoxville. Earlier, Alabama
                    troops from the same regiment had attempted to pull down the Union flag from a
                    pole at the house of one of the local women, but desisted after her brother
                    threatened him with a gun.</summary>

                    which Ireland, Scotland, and Australia would attempt to gain their own freedom

                        >Tribune</emph>, under date of May 20th, thus notices the arrest of Judge
                        Mason, at this place:</p>
                    <p>"The arrest of J. Thomas Mason, late Collector of this port, at Chambersburg,
                        on suspicion of being a spy, has sent a thrill of terror among his
                        sympathising friends in this city. His release has not comforted them, for
                        they see in this thing the display of the forces that may yet crush them.
                        The idea that he went to that town in quest of a purchaser for three negro
                        children, is rediculous [sic]. A more incorrigible rebel against the United
                        States is not to be found in all Cottondom, and that he went to spy out the
                        land, is just as evident as that Extra Billy Smith was permitted to visit
                        Washington for the same mean and despicable purpose."</p>
