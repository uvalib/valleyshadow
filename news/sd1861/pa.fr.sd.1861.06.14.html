                        commander, and, if they have not funds, certificates of the purchases will
                        be given, to be presented for payment to the chief of the proper department
                        at these head-quarters.</p>
                    <p>VI. Nothing whatever is to be taken for public purposes without due
                        compensation, and by authorized agents, and if depredations are committed
                        upon persons or property, the offenders, if recognized, must be promptly
                        punished, and when in the power of the United States, compensation rendered.</p>
                    <p>VII. Every opportunity to drill must be employed to instruct the men and
                        discipline them. Officers must not act under the delusion that troops are
                        perfect in their exercises, or that the time will ever come, while they
                        remain in the field, when relaxation in duty or drill will not impair
                        efficiency, and render them unworthy of the confidence of the Government and
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>By order of Major-General Patterson, <br> F. J. Porter, Ass't Adjutant
                        General.</p>
                <br>
