<b>An Enlistment Incident</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates that a minor attempting to enlist in a new regiment in Newport,
                    Rhode Island, when his mother agreed to sign his certificate of consent only if
                    the son should move his finger through the Bible and select a passage at random
                    that persuaded her to allow him to go to war. The son did so and chose a passage
                    charging the Hebrews to "go ye down against them," and the mother gave her
                    consent.<br>

<b>The "Day Book" Democracy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Answers the displeasure the Times has apparently expressed about being
                    labeled a "Day Book" Democratic paper by the Dispatch. Points out that there are
                    many Democrats--generally those who harbor sentiments similar to those of
                    Stephen Douglas--who are as loyal to the Union as any Republican, but that the
                    Times supports candidates whose loyalty is questionable at best. Therefore, the
                    Times deserves the label of "Day Book Democrat."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The editor of The Times not only knowing, but
                            feeling the unenviable position he occupies
                        as a co-laborer with the Valley Spirit in an
                        effort to seduce the loyal people of Franklin into support of a Ticket
                        composed, in part at least, of men whose known sentiments are bitterly
                        antagonistic to all his former professions and teachings with regard to the
                        preservation of the Union, wriggles and twists like an injured worm under
                        our strictures.</p>
                    <p>He dislikes the company his peculiar course has necessarilly [sic] thrown him
                        into, and he frets himself wonderfully because we have honestly endeavored
                        to expose his inconsistancy [sic]. We characterized the Convention that
                        nominated the Ticket now supported by The Times,
                        as Day Book Democrats, the meaning of which our
                        neighbor appears to understand. For thus designating them, he charges us
                        with censuring the entire Democratic party of the county. In speaking of
                        that party we have always distinguished between the Douglas and Breckinridge
                        wing, and weeks ago, before a Ticket was nominated we used the following
                        language:</p>
                    <p>The Douglas Democracy, to their honor be it said, are as firm in their
                        support of the Administration, in the war now waging to suppress the
                        rebellion, as the most ardent Republicans.</p>
                    <p>If we have charged the editor of The Times as
                        being a Day Book Democrat, we only judge him by
                        the company he is in. He is supporting a Ticket which he knows is composed,
                        in part at least, of men who are bitterly hostile to the further prosecution
                        of the war--men who would now compromise with the rebels. It was such men,
                        too, who controlled the Convention, and the Convention was presided over by
                        a man who is an out-spoken advocate of Peace.</p>
                    <p>How can the editor of The Times, claiming to be in
                        favor of an uncompromising prosecution of the war, advocate the election of
                        men who are opposed to his views? He has heretofore denounced all who are
                        for compromising with the rebels as "traitors" and "cowardly fools," in
                        which we agree with him, but strange to say, he is advocating the election
                        of just such men, and when he is changed with it, he endeavors to screen
                        himself from a further exposure by saying that "this is no time for such
                        contests."</p>
                    <p>This is just the time, after the election it is too late. The people should
                        be made acquainted with the loyalty or disloyalty of the men for whom they
                        are asked to vote, and The Times, we trust, will
                        no longer call upon the loyal portion of the Democratic party to support men
                        whom it has justly stigmatized as "traitors" and "cowardly fools." </p>

<b>The Issue</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the most important issue in the coming election is whether the
                    candidate is a strong supporter of the Union. Puts forward the Union candidates

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is unusually important and necessary that every voter at the approaching
                        Election should understand and appreciate the true issue that is presented
                        for their decision.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature must be filled with men who will cordially co-operate with
                        the State and National Governments in their plan, or the military operations
                        of the State will be crippled, and Pennsylvania will stand before the Nation
                        a chained lion--a disgraced and humiliated State, and in our prostration the
                        rebels will have secured a triumph. The State administration must be
                        sustained, or the effectiveness of our State troops, to cope with the
                        rebellion, will be crippled and destroyed.</p>
                    <p>This the sympathizers with the Rebellion understand, and they will spare no
                        efforts to defeat the Union Legislative candidates, by fraud an falsehood,
                        in every district where it is possible to do so. If the Union is to be
                        preserved, a vigorous prosecution of the war must be maintained, and to
                        secure this end, candidates favorable to sustaining both the State and
                        National Administrations must be elected.</p>
                    <p>Let the friends of the Union, then rally at once, and see to it that Maj.
                        John Rowe and W. W. Sellers, Esq., the Union candidates of this district are
                        triumphantly elected.</p>
                    <p>All who are unconditionally for the Union will vote for the Union candidates
                        for the Legislature, and all who are for compromising with the rebels will
                        vote for the Democratic candidate. Chose ye between them. Compromise with
                        the traitors means a destruction of the Government--an energetic prosecution
                        of the War means the salvation of the Nation.</p>

<b>Panic in the Seceded States</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports, based on information in the Philadelphia Press, that plans by the
                    federal government to seize posts on the Southern coasts has caused a general
                    panic among the people in the seceded states.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Late information, upon which we can rely, says the Philadelphia Press of Saturday last, authorizes us to state that
                        a general panic has taken place in the seceded States since Monday last. The
                        preparations of the Federal Government to seize certain important posts on
                        the Southern coasts, and the unprotected character of that coast, are among
                        the chief reasons for this rapidly increasing feeling.</p>
                    <p>Davis and the confederate traitors having failed in their absurd
                        demonstration upon Washington, (which was, in fact, never real,) are now losing the confidence of the troops
                        gathered between Richmond and the Federal capital, and are daily attacked
                        with the utmost bitterness by the people they have seduced into their
                        conspiracy. It is a fact which events will soon establish, that thousands
                        now in the rebel army are anxious to be taken prisoners by the American
                        army, in order that they be rescued from the fearful horrors under which
                        they were suffering! Nothing prevents an outburst in favor of the Union in
                        North Carolina, save the invasion of that State by the South Carolina
                        troops; and such men as Holden and Morehead will undoubtedly speak out
                        against the traitors the moment they feel strong enough so to do.</p>
                    <p>Every dollar of gold and silver is caught up and hid away, and merchants and
                        tradesmen only part with their goods for the paper of the Confederate
                        Government, and of the different State authorities, because they are
                        compelled to yield.</p>
                    <p>Let the people of the Loyal States place the fullest confidence in the
                        Administration and the army under General M'Clellan. They can afford to
                        wait. Every hour that we delay the blow upon treason strengthens the good
                        cause, and weakens the bad one.</p>

                        fasting, to be observed by the people of the United States with religious
                        solemnities, and the offering of fervent supplications to Almighty God for

                        furtherance of the President's desire, "earnestly recommends to the people
                        to suspend, on that day, their ordinary avocations and to close their places
                        of business and to humble themselves before the Almighty with earnest prayer
