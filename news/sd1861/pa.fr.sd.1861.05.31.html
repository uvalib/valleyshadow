<b>The Attitude of England</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that England will most likely "remain a neutral spectator of
                    American affairs." The editor applauds this decision because, in his opinion,
                    the United States should be allowed to demonstrate its ability to keep the
                    country together without outside assistance.<br>

                    the Union without blood being shed. This prediction was based on the strong vote
                    against the secessionists in many Virginia counties the previous Thursday, as
                    well as on the difficulties Virginia is experiencing due to the federal blockade
                    of its ports.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On yesterday morning the body of a soldier, named Samuel Hoin, Company G, 2d
                        Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, was conveyed to the railroad station to
                        be taken to his friends. The company of which the deceased was a member
                        followed the corpse to the station, another company with the regimental band
                        preceded it, the band playing a dead march. The whole was conducted in a
                        very solemn manner, and we noticed as the procession passed that some of his
                        comrades in arms were in tears. The disease, we understood, was brain
                    fever.</p>

<b>Disgraceful</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Recounts the story of a soldier who masqueraded as an officer to force his
                    way into the house of a local resident, where he passed through without doing
                    any damage. The editor admonishes disorderly soldiers like this one who, he
                    says, take advantage of their position to disturb the local citizens who have
                    given them nothing but kind treatment.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr.  Christ)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday night a soldier went to the house of Mr. Christ, and represented
                        himself as an officer, sent to search the house for a man whom he named. He
                        was told that no man of that name was there, and was denied admission. He
                        threatened to break the door, when he was admitted, and after passing
                        through the house, went away without doing any damage. What his object was
                        is not known, but such conduct is not to be tolerated. If the soldiers
                        stationed here cannot be kept in order by their officers, some other means
                        must be devised. The citizens here are ever ready to do all in their power
                        for the comfort and kind treatment of our soldiers, and we are glad to
                        record that nearly all the soldiers are well behaved, and appreciate the
                        kindness of the people. We hope the few disorderly ones may see the
                        necessity of maintaining order and conduct themselves accordingly.</p>

<b>Soldiers Letters to be Franked</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a letter from C. H. Van Wyck declaring that he will, to the best
                    of his ability, try to ensure that letters from soldiers stationed in Washington
                    are sent without their having to pay postage on them. The editor comments that
                    something must be done to allow soldiers to send letters free of charge,
                    particularly since the government has as yet paid them nothing for their
                    service.<br>

<b>Pennsylvania Secessionists</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports an attack on some men employed in peeling bark near Shade Gap in
