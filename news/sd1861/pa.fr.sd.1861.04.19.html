                    <p>The refusal of the Secessionist mob in Charleston, to permit the return of
                        Lieut. Talbot to fort Sumter, was an outrage exactly in keeping with the
                        general course of the Secessionists. The following, copied from an editorial

                        that the condition of the forts should remain unchanged, it says:</p>
                    <p>"As far as the administration is concerned, there has been no change in their
                        condition; but in the meantime the secessionists of the South have been busy
                        in concentrating troops around them by thousands. They have put up new
                        batteries and fortifications at every available point. They have availed
                        themselves of the armistice, if armistice it was, to fortify themselves in
                        every respect, and have openly outraged all the rules of modern warfare. In
                        fact they have acted in bad faith, and have most infamously and cowardly
                        broken the pledges that were proposed. They have said to the United States,
                        let us all allow matters to remain as they are until there can be a
                        settlement, and in the meanwhile they have been levying armies and erecting
                        fortifications, which in a state of actual war the forces of the United
                        States would have been fully warranted in attacking. They have asked a truce
                        and have themselves systematically violated it. They have prayed for an
                        armistice, and under the cover of a white flag have been preparing
                        themselves for operations of both offence and defence. They are as they have
                        been from the beginning the violators of the public peace and the fomenters
                        of a civil war, and now they insolently demand that the stars and stripes
                        shall be struck to give place to their miserable Palmetto and Pelican flags,
                        and that two-thirds of the people of this great nation shall SUBMIT to the
                        dictation of a few disappointed locofoco spoilmongers or fight for the

<b>Our New Enterprise!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Outlines the intentions of the new Semi-Weekly Dispatch to keep their
                    readership better informed than weekly papers during a time when important
                    events are happening at a rapid pace. Also argues that Franklin County should be
                    able to sustain two Republican papers with no difficulty.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To-day, we offer to the public a specimen copy of our new paper, and upon
                        this, our first appearance, it will be expected that we present something
                        respecting our movement. In order that any new enterprise be thoroughly
                        successful, it must be of some public utility. Our present movement we
                        believe to be not only of great public utility, but an almost universal
                        necessity. In this County, there is not a single paper issues oftener than
                        once a week. The rapidity of events, now transpiring in our country, the
                        vast importance of those events to every citizen, and the deep anxiety
                        everywhere manifested for early and reliable intelligence, all indicate the
                        fact, that weekly newspapers are too slow for the times, and that there is a
                        demand for dispatch in discrimination of the news of events as they
                        transpire. To meet this demand, the publishers have resolved to issue their
                        paper twice a week, and in order to meet fully every exigency, have put the
                        terms at the extremely low price of TWO DOLLARS PER YEAR.</p>
                    <p>While there is not another County in the Commonwealth, of equal population or
                        Republican strength, that does not support from two or three Republican
                        papers, Franklin has but one. We are fully convinced that two sound
                        Republican papers can and will be fully sustained. The Democrats have two
                        here, and certainly, if they can be supported, we, as the dominant party,
                        ought to do fully as much, and we have the fullest confidence in the
                        ability, zeal, and we may say, intelligence of the Republicans of Franklin
                        County, to believe that they will uphold us in carrying forward our
                        enterprise to complete success.</p>
                    <p>The constant aim of the publishers will be, to give reliable information of
                        the general news of the day, at the earliest moment; to present, twice a
                        week, matter of a choice literary character; to uphold and advance the
                        principles of the Republican party; to give a correct semi-weekly report of
                        the prices current, both of Chambersburg and City markets, thus rendering
                        the DISPATCH essentially requisite to every business man in the County; and
                        an agreeable and welcome semi-weekly visitor in every family.</p>
                    <p>At the extremely low price of publishing, it is necessary to retain, for some
                        time, our present size; but the intention is, as patronage increases,
                        correspondingly to enlarge the paper. We intend using none but good
                        material; our type are all new, and as respect the mechanical execution, our
                        present issue may be considered the sample, and speak for itself. Respecting
                        the matter contained, we will only say that, when our exchange list is
                        perfected, we shall be able to present to our readers a much fuller account
                        of the general news of the day, than in the present issue.</p>
                    <p>The publication of the paper semi-weekly, together with the low price of
                        subscription, must secure such a circulation as will render the DISPATCH the
                        best Advertising Medium in Franklin County; and we are sure our friends will
                        not fail to appreciate the fact and look out for their own interests, by
                        liberally patronizing us.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As our readers are aware, the Militia Laws of Pennsylvania have ever been
                        very defective. Heretofore no emergency has arisen, which has not been
                        promptly and effectively met, but in the present uncertain aspect of
                        affairs, it become [sic] our rulers to look well to our guards, and render
                        efficient every means for the public defence. With such views, Gov. Curtin
                        has issued a message, from which we extract as follows:--</p>
                    <p>I recommend, therefore, that the Legislature make immediate provision for the
                        removal of these capital defects; that arms be procured and distributed to
                        those of our citizens who may enter into the military service of the State,
                        and that steps be taken to change the guns already distributed, by the
                        adoption of such well known and tried improvements as will render them
                        effective in the event of their employment in actual service.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I recommend the establishment of a Military Bureau at the
                        Capitol, and that the militia laws of the Commonwealth be so modified and
                        amended as to impart to the military organization of the State the vitality
                        and energy essential to its practical value and usefulness.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>With the deepest anxiety have the American people been watching the
                        transactions of the Administration, since the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN,
                        with a view to ascertain our true position among the nations, and solve the
                        question, "Have we a Government?" The conditions of affairs toward the close
                        of Mr. BUCHANAN's career, rendered the question a most absorbing one.
                        Treason stalked abroad in open day in our National Capital; plunder seemed
                        to have become a ruling passion among our officers; he who could dive
                        deepest in the robbery of the public treasury, and, and, in official acts,
                        leave the treason of BENEDICT ARNOLD or AARON BURR furthest in the rear,
                        seemed to enjoy the highest honors. Confusion reigned in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Since the new Administration has taken charge of the helm of State, in the
                        short space of six weeks, order has been brought out of political confusion,
                        the public offices have been filled with good and true men, a scattered army
                        and a dispersed navy have been gathered together, the public defences have
                        been duly cared for, and in every movement, our new President has thus far
                        shown himself the man.</p>
                    <p>The consequences of all this firmness and manliness of President LINCOLN may
                        be a war with the so-called Southern Confederacy; but it will merely be an
                        earlier commencement that the end may be the sooner, and will, doubtless,
                        under the Divine blessing, avert from our beloved land, those terrible evils
                        of anarchy, toward which we were so rapidly and fatally drifting. There are
                        worse evils than war. The question is solved, and the fact fully
                        established, for which we nationally and individually should be heartily
                        grateful to high Heaven. We have a Government. Let every patriot be firm in
                        assisting to uphold and sustain it.</p>

                    <p>On yesterday, our citizens raised a Union Pole in the Diamond bearing aloft
                        "The Star-Spangled Banner of the Free." It is 128 feet high, surmounted by a
                        golden ball, with a Streamer floating to the breeze. When the Pole assumed
                        an upright position, one long, loud and tremendous cheer from the crowd
                        (numbering from 1800 to 2000) rent the air and made the welkin [sic] ring.</p>
                    <p>After raising the National Flag, a company of Ladies on the veranda of the
                        Franklin House sung "The Star Spangled Banner" in a style worthy of their
                        patriotism. Then, in response to the earnest calls of the assembly, Messrs.
                        Reilly, Stumbaugh, McClure Brewer, Everett, Stinger and Welsh successively
                        appeared on the verandah, and spoke in a style so thrilling and animating as
                        stirred the very souls of their auditors, and so great was the feeling
                        exhibited that the faces of many stern men were seen bathed in tears. Our
                        citizens are "not wild with excitement," but stern determination is visible
                        in every countenance.</p>
                    <p>Numerous large National Flags are stretched across our streets, while small
                        ensigns wave at the fronts of many a store and delight every exhibition of
                        that patriotic feeling, which we are sure is felt in the hearts of the great
                        body of our people.</p>

                    <p>In anticipation of the departure of the Chambers Artillery, a Town Meeting
                        was called and assembled in the Court House, last evening. The meeting was
                        organized by the appointment of Hon. Geo. Chambers, President, and Hon. Jas.
                        Nill, and D. K. Wunderlich, Esq., Vice Presidents.</p>
                    <p>An eloquent and patriotic address was delivered by the President. The
                        greatest enthusiasm prevailed, and the following preamble and resolutions,
                        presented by I. H. McCauley, Esq., were unanimously adopted with tremendous
                        applause:</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, A band of traitorous spirits, regardless of their allegiance to the
                        Country of their birth, have for years past been plotting the dismemberment
                        of our glorious Confederacy, the hope of struggling Freedom throughout the
                        World and the asylum of the oppressed and down trodden of all Nations:</p>
                    <p>AND WHEREAS, Their hellish efforts have resulted in inducing the people of
                        seven of the Southern States of our Confederacy to declare that they will no
                        longer continue under the same Government with us, and to establish a rebel
                        Government, under the title of the "Confederate States of North America,"
                        which Government has stolen the treasure, seized the Fortresses, and taken
                        possession of the National Vessels, Arms and Munitions of War, belonging to
                        the Union, and placed in their midst for the defence of our common Country:</p>
                    <p>AND WHEREAS, The said "Confederate and Rebel" Government, without just cause
                        has marshalled [sic] its Armies, and treasonably made war upon the
                        Government of the Union, by attacking an unoffending but gallant soldier and
                        servant of his Country, Major ROBERT ANDERSON, and his forlorn hope of 70
                        noble rank and file, and by the aid of starvation and exhaustion, has caused
                        him to surrender his post, though not without honor to himself and those who
                        so faithfully stood by his side, but yet to the great chagrin or all true
                        lovers of the Constitution and the Laws:</p>
                    <p>AND WHEREAS, The Arch Traitor of them all--the Benedict Arnold of the
                        South--Jefferson Davis--the President of the so called "Confederate States"
                        has boldly ad openly threatened to march upon the Capitol of our Country at
                        the head of 25,000 men, and drive out the Constituted Authorities of the
                        land, and seat himself in the mansion and Chair of State, sanctified by
                        those noble Executives who have presided in past times over the destinies of
                        the Republic:</p>
                    <p>AND WHEREAS, The President of the United States of America, in vice of these
                        undeniable facts, in view of the hostile attitude of the said "Confederate
                        States" towards Fort Pickens and the other National Stations South, and in
                        view of the wide spread treasonable sentiment that surrounds the City of
                        Washington, has called upon the soldiery of the nation, who are faithful to
                        their Countrr [sic], without respect to party feelings or predelictions
                        [sic], to the number of 75,000 to rally in defence of the Constitution and
                        the Laws, Therefore--</p>
                    <p>Resolved, by the people of Chambersburg, in town
                        meeting assembled, without respect to party, That we cordially endorse the
                        action of our National Executive, believing that the late and present
                        national Government has been forbearing in the extreme, towards those
                        traitorous spirits who have been plotting to overturn our beloved, and
                        blood-cemented Institutions, paralize [sic] the arms of our national
                        authorities, degrade the Flag of our affections, and deluge the land of our
                        nativity or adoption, in the blood of its citizens. </p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the time has come for all men to
                        sink the Partizan in the Patriot, to forego political principles and party
                        animosities, until the danger that threatens our national existence is past,
                        and to rally as one man, with one heart, one mind, and one purpose at the
                        call of the constituted authorities of the land, for the maintenance of the
                        Constitution and the Laws as they now are. </p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we cordially endorse the
                        recommendation of our Executive and the prompt action of our Executive and
                        the prompt action of our Legislature, in placing the Old Keystone State on a
                        proper war footing, as one of the surest and most certain means of
                        "conquering a peace," and restoring our lately happy land to prosperity. </p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we hail, as one of the most
                        unerring evidences that we have a Government, and that that Government
                        possesses the confidence and affection of the people, the fact that the
                        gallant soldiery of our noble State and the Country generally, have so
                        speedily and so cheerfully responded to the call of their Country, in
                        numbers far over the aggregate desired. </p>
                    <p>Resolved, That our gallant and patriotic fellow
                        citizens, the members of the Chambers Artillery and other Volunteers of our
                        County, who on tomorrow's morn, are to go out from our midst, and from their
                        families and friends at the call of their Country, have our most sincere and
                        heart-felt wishes for their individual preservation from death or grevious
                        [sic] in jury during their absence, and our ardent prayers that they may
                        each and all be speedily restored to the arms of those who so patriotically
                        part with them at the call of duty. </p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we hereby pledge to each one of
                        these our friends, our sacred honors, that we will see that their wives and
                        children, and whoever elsewhere is dependant [sic] upon them, shall not,
                        during their absence, lack for any thing temporal that money and willing
                        hearts can provide. </p>
                    <p>The meeting then adjourned, and the volunteers were ushered into Franklin
                        Hall, where a sumptuous banquet was prepared for them by the citizens of our
                        town.</p>
                    <p>After supper, the Hon. G. W. Brewer, in a neat and appropriate address,
                        presented a very handsome sword to Lieut. John Doebler, which was responded
                        to on behalf of the lieutenant, by J. M'D. Sharpe, Esq. The Rev. Mr. Nichols
                        was then introduced, and after a short but impressive address, closed the
                        exercises with a fervant [sic] prayer in behalf of our noble soldiers and
                        the cause they are about to defend.</p>
                    <p>The exercises of the evening were enlivened by music performed by the
                        Chambersburg Brass Band.</p>
