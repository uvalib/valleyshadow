<b>The Election in Maryland</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that Maryland expressed a strong sentiment for the Union in the
                    recent elections. Argues that even in the Southern states that have rebelled,
                    the predominant sentiment is probably for restoring the Union, but that the
                    people are prevented from expressing this view by those who are in power.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The result of the recent Election in Maryland, (held on Wednesday last,) is
                        most gratifying to the loyal men throughout the country. The result shows
                        that the Union sentiment predominates largely throughout the State, and even
                        in the city of Baltimore, the principal hot-bed of treason in the State, the
                        result is overwhelming in favor of the Union.</p>
                    <p>With all the eighteen Free States solid for the Union, backed by a tremendous
                        loyal sentiment in Missouri, Kentucky, East Tennessee, Western Virginia,
                        Delaware, and now by a fair expression of the sentiment of Maryland, there
                        seems to be but little hope for the success of the rebellion, and but little
                        to cause the patriot to fear for the ultimate result. It is but a question
                        of time--treason must be, will be crushed out, and our glorious Union will
                        again stand before the world more powerful, more grand, more beautiful, from
                        being abscurred [sic] by the cloud that now hangs over it, than she has ever
                        before been regarded by the world.</p>
                    <p>No effort--from cold-blooded murder to perjury--was left untried by the
                        Rebels of Maryland to drag her into the slough of secession, but all failed,
                        and to-day her voice, as expressed at the ballot-box, rings out over the
                        country, in stentorian tones, for the Constitution, the Union, and the
                        enforcement of the Laws. All honor to the intelligent freemen of Maryland.</p>
                    <p>With but, probably, one exception--we believe that a decided majority of the
                        people of every Southern State was decidedly in favor of the Union--of the
                        Government, pure and simple, as it was before the rebellion was
                        precipitated. And even now, if they could be permitted to express their
                        honest sentiments, we doubt not it would be in favor of the Union of their
                        fathers. This was never permitted, however. Force, violence, lynch-law,
                        governed and over-awed, and the ambitious, the bad, and turbulent men
                        assumed the control and proclaimed the several States out of the Union, and
                        thus forced upon the country, against the better judgment of their people,
                        the present unfortunate civil contest. It is a severe ordeal through which
                        our loved Republic is called to pass, but the future will demonstrate, that
                        the trial was for her good, as she will come out of the firey-furnace
                        disrobed of her impurities. The preservation of our Government is worth all
                        the blood and treasure and suffering that may be demanded for that purpose,
                        not only for ourselves, but for our posterity, and as an asylum for the
                        oppressed of other lands.</p>
                    <p>The result of the Election in Maryland is another assurance to the world,
                        that the people are loyal, and that the Republic is safe.</p>

                    <p>The New York Advertiser has a careful review of
                        the various skirmishes, battles and important reconnoissances, from the
                        bombardment of Sumpter to the late battle at Romney, with the most accurate
                        returns of the losses that could be obtained, the result, as figured up from
                        the table, is:</p>
                    <p>Killed. Wounded. Prisn'rs. Total. <br> Union forces. 969 2,041 5,384 <br>
                        Rebel forces, 4,049 1,604 2,808 8,461</p>
                    <p>But this shows greatly to the disadvantage of the Union side, since the
                        losses of the Rebels in many important actions are unknown, while the
                        prisoners on the Union side are largely made up of the troops surrendered by
                        Twiggs' treachery in Texas.</p>

<b>From Negley's Brigade.</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have been permitted to make the following extracts from a letter received
                        by the wife of an officer in Col. Stumbaugh's Regiment, now on duty in
                        Kentucky:</p>
                    <p>Camp of Negley's Brigade, P. V., <br> Hardin Co., (Ky.,) Oct. 24, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Dear Wife:--Well, here we are, in the midst of
                        secession, 50 miles South of Louisville, on the Louisville and Memphis Rail
                        Road. We arrived in Louisville on Monday night, remaining on the boats until
                        morning, when we disembarked and marched through the city to our Camp, at
                        Oakland, a most beautiful spot, about one mile from the city. Louisville is
                        one of the most beautiful of American Cities. The streets are very wide and
                        clean, and many of the private residences are magnificent. We were received,
                        while passing through the city, with shouts of joy, and welcomes to the "Old
                        Pennsylvania Boys." We went to camp, pitched our tents, when our Regiment
                        marched back to town, where the citizens had prepared a substantial supper.
                        Everybody appeared to do their utmost to make us comfortable. After supper
                        we returned to camp, and next morning the whole Brigade--3000--marched back
                        to the city, and were again treated to a good warm breakfast, provided by
                        the citizens.</p>
                    <p>At 4 p. m. we took the cars and moved off, no one knew whither. We traveled
                        about 50 miles and disembarked at this, our present camp. There is now,
                        within 2 1/2 miles of us, 30,000 men, and 15 miles further there is another
                        camp of some 4000 men, all good and true to the Government of our fathers.</p>
                    <p>Kentucky, we find, is largely for the Union; but before the loyal troops came
                        here the Union men wee compelled to keep quiet. Now, however, they are
                        flocking around their country's standard--the glorious old Stars and
                        Stripes--by thousands. * * *</p>
                    <p>Our pickets were within 1 1/2 miles of the Rebel camp, and saw them drilling.
                        You will thus see that we are in close proximity to our enemies. We have no
                        fears of an attack, as they are entrenching themselves, and of course expect
                        us to attack them, which we will do not until we have a sufficient force to
                        insure an easy victory.</p>
                    <p>We have been getting along finely, having had no accident since we left
                        Pittsburg. The health of the Brigade is good--there is not a severely sick
                        man in the entire command.--We have a very fine set of Staff officers, who
                        endeavor to make things as comfortable as possible.</p>
                    <p>Direct your letters to the care of Col. Stumbaugh, Negley's Brigade, P. V.,
                        Louisville, Ky.</p>
                    <p>There goes tattoo, and all lights must be extinguished. Good night.</p>
