<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It appears to be rather unpopular in certain quarters, for newspaper editors
                        to criticize the actions, or rather the want of action, of any of our
                        Military gentlemen, and whenever one of the aforesaid know-nothing-about
                        -war editors presumes to the audacity of venting his thoughts upon such
                        subjects, some others who "acknowledge the corn," quickly open their
                        batteries upon him. At the risk of being "blown up" we also must have our
                        little say, and will preface it with a telegram which appeard [sic] in
                        several of the Philadelphia papers, as follows:--</p>
                    <p>"It is vaguely reported that General Patterson's Division arrived in the
                        vicinity of Manassas this morning, and commenced an attack on the rebel
                        force. He was within twenty-five miles of the battle-ground yesterday, and
                        the exhausted condition of his men prevented him from coming to the aid of
                        General McDowel."</p>
                    <p>Now, we do not intend to contradict this nonsensical telegram, nor to ask why
                        he was not there. The first has been done already, and we can answer the
                        other by saying that he had no business there. But we do ask, why did he
                        allow Gen. Johnson to go there? Is this the 'bloodless victory' he told his
                        men he should achieve? Gen. Johnson left Winchester with 30,000 men leaving
                        5,000 behind. Why did not General Patterson harrass [sic] his retreat, as
                        any good General could have done, and thus either so engaged him as to have
                        compelled his presence at Winchester, or at least cut off the communications
                        of a large portion of his army? A review of the pranks of this
                        take-part-in-the-chase-at-Cerro-Gordo General, looks to us very much like
                        either cowardice or sympathy with the rebellious cause. The Philadelphia
                            Inquirer, a few days ago, asked its readers
                        to look at what General Patterson had done, and then, in most bitter irony,
                        we suppose, told them. </p>
                    <p>Had a written agreement, drawn up by Jeff. Davis himself, between Gen.
                        Patterson and Gen. Johnson, been regularly signed, sealed and delivered,
                        containing full stipulations respecting the method to be pursued by both,
                        allowing Patterson the eclat of having served as a General in the Union
                        cause, acted bravely in battle, retired at the expiration of his time with
                        honor, &amp;c., &amp;c., and at the same time avoid cutting off Gen.
                        Johnson's communications with Gen. Beauregard at Manassas Junction, and
                        permit him to slip through his fingers and unite with Beauregard at the
                        proper time, such an instrument could not have been drawn by Mr. J. Davis
                        more to his own liking than the farce enacted by this
                        forced-to-show-his-colors General. May the race of such Generals be very
                        soon extinct.</p>

<b>The Breckinridge Journals</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Dispatch defends itself against charges by the Valley Spirit that the
                    Dispatch issued false statements with regard to Mr. Cessna and the Bedford
                    Democrats.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Valley Spirit devotes nearly the whole of one
                        of its columns to us, thirteen lines of which is original, and which we do
                        not consider worth noticing, except to say that, if the Spirit had desired to make an honest statement it would, with
                        our article of the 12th have quoted that of the 23d, having the same caption
                        in which we quote part of a letter from Mr. Cessna himself, or not have
                        published anything about it. After quoting our article the Spirit copies about half a column from the Bedford
                            Gazette, another sheet of about the same
                        calibre and patriotic sentiments, which, as their article appeared before
                        our explanation, we will answer very briefly:</p>
                    <p>1.--The article in our columns was handed to us for publication, and was
                        written by a reliable gentleman who received the information, respecting Mr.
                        Cessna, from a Breckinridge Democrat of Fulton
                        County, who, with curses upon Mr. Cessna, related the substance of the
                        article, in the presence of this gentleman and several others. </p>
                    <p>2.--We love truth-telling, clean-worded journals, and of course the Gazette professes to belong to that class, and in
                        "Nailing our Falsehood," has shown due zeal, f not any brilliant acquirement
                        of knowledge. We profess to hold the principles of the Republican Party. We
                        believe them right. </p>
                    <p>3.--The resolutions of that convention were strictly in accordance with the
                        Breckinridge Party Platform, with the present views of Mr. Breckinridge, and
                        just what Jeff. David &amp; Co. desire all parties and conventions in
                        the North to pass. They agreed with the doctrine of "Let us alone."</p>
                    <p>4.--Mr. Cessna was a member of the Democratic Party, and held to the
                        doctrines of Mr. Douglas, honestly, we suppose; he was, therefore, right in
                        supporting him.--We, as honestly, opposed those doctrines, and therefore, as
                        rightly opposed those doctrines, and therefore, as rightly opposed the
                        election of Mr. Douglas. Where mere opinions of political policy are
                        concerned, we oppose the coercion of any man.</p>
                    <p>5.--Respecting the minding of our own business, that is what we are trying to
                        do; and part of that business is, to expose, and hold up for general
                        condemnation, all traitorous acts and influences, of individuals, assemblies
                        and public journals, within the limits of our knowledge, and to the extent
                        of our sphere.</p>

<b>The Sabbath</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the Union army for attacking the enemy at Bull Run on a Sunday.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>While we do not hold to non-resistance upon the Sabbath, or any other day,
                        nor believe that, the Sabbath can be observed with the same quietude and in
                        the same manner in the army as when in our own peaceful homes, we do
                        believe, that the Sabbath might be observed as becomingly in the army as out
                        of it, and that, but few circumstances can be found to justify an attack
                        upon an enemy upon that day. Whether it necessarily follows, that the
                        attacking party is generally worsted, or not, certain it is, that our forces
                        attacked the rebels on Sunday at Bull's Run, and if not worsted, not only
                        did they fail to gain their point, but lost the position they had gained the
                        day before. We are not inclined to be superstitious, but we firmly believe
                        in the overruling hand of a Divine Providence, who will not suffer iniquity
                        to go unpunished. Our cause is just and righteous, and must finally prevail;
                        but we shall be scourged for past national sins, and it behooves us to guard
                        well, that the continued commission of others does not protract the scourge.
                        God has said, "Him that honoreth me, I will honor," and upon this, we would
                        have all; and especially all in authority, everywhere to reflect.</p>
