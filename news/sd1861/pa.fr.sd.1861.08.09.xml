                <transcript>
                    <p>For months past--long before the outbreak of the Rebellion of the South
                        against the government--the country had been shocked by the recital of the
                        most infamous and barbarous acts perpetrated by the Southern people upon
                        persons of Northern birth who had taken up residence in their midst, or who
                        were there, temporarily, on business or in the fond expectation of
                        recruiting their shattered health, in the balmy breezes of the Southern
                        mountains and valleys. We had always been taught to believe, that our
                        'southern brethern' [sic] were the <emph rend="italic">beau-ideals</emph> of
                        refinement, and the possessors of all the elements of the race that are
                        found in the truly brave, the magnanimous, the honorable, and the real
                        chivalrous! But the accounts of brutal violence inflicted upon our
                        unoffending people--their northern birth affording the only justifying
                        cause--together with the exhibition of all the hellish and brutal
                        characteristics of the Commanche Indians, in their recent conflicts with the
                        Federal troops, strips the Southern people of every single trait usually
                        accorded to the true gentleman and brave soldier.</p>
                    <p>If anything were still wanting to complete the record of the total
                        destitution of every honorable and refined principle among the large
                        majority of the Southern leaders, it is found in the fact of their forcing
                        [sic] their slaves into their entrenchments, and in the other fact, as we
                        learn from Southern papers, of their tampering with the Indians and inducing
                        them to aid their villainous and dastardly cause.</p>
                    <p>Thus far, our Government and troops have resisted them only with the modes
                        known in civilized warfare; but if they, by a persistant [sic] course of
                        brutality, arouse all the latent and baser passions of our soldiers, a
                        system of retaliation will be induced that may more than equal their acts of
                        atrocity.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Congress adjourned on Tuesday last. A little more than one month has been
                        consumed in Extra Session, in which an amount of business has been
                        transacted which might well serve as a model in future times. Our
                        Congressmen, at least a large portion of them, went to Washington, not for
                        the purpose of retarding legislation in personal bickerings, party
                        criminations and recriminations, and making long-winded speeches for
                        buncomb, but for to legislate for the people and for the country. What few
                        speeches of any length were made, were generally aimed at some conspicuous
                        mark, and intended for some specific purpose. And what is the result? The
                        country, which by the last Congress was left entirely defenceless, and at
                        the mercy of Traitors, who would, had not our President been a man whose
                        nerves quail not at the assumption of any responsibility, have crushed the
                        vitals of Liberty, is now upheld by an army of five hundred thousand men,
                        and five hundred millions of dollars at the command of Government for this
                        purpose. Many other important measures have been passed; the whole country
                        has been shown that the Government is entirely in earnest for its own
                        preservation; and that if our present resources are not sufficient, either
                        in men or money, they will be doubled, or trebled as the case may require.
                        The People, the President, the Congress and the Army, are a unit upon this
                        question. The Extra Session has developed the fact.</p>

                    <p>"At such a crisis whoever will stand by the Democratic party to resist the
                        adversaries of the peace of the country, the integrity of the Union, and the
                        stability of the Constitution, will be welcome to our ranks and will be
                        reckoned our friends and allies."</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--The foregoing sentence, among others equally obnoxious, I
                        find in an article in the last issue of the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph>. Permit a Union-loving Democrat, a short space in your paper
                        to submit a few thoughts upon the subject that occurred to my mind on
                        reading it. </p>
                    <p>Who are "the adversaries of the peace of the country"? Are they the hundreds
                        of thousands of citizen soldiery, now enrolled in the service of the
                        country, who know no party "at such a crisis," and no political duty but the
                        great one of maintaining the government of a free people and crushing out
                        rebellion? Are they those members of Congress, of the several party creeds,
                        who have, with such cheerful unanimity and patriotism, sustained the acts of
                        the President, and voted immense supplies of men and money for the vigorous
                        prosecution of the war? Are they the vast body of the people of the North,
                        and the loyal citizens of the border States, who manifest such cheerfulness
                        in sustaining the Government, and are willing to pledge both life and
                        fortune for the maintenance of the "integrity of the Union and the stability
                        of the Constitution"?</p>
                    <p>If all these be really "the adversaries of peace," Heaven save the
                        contemptible minority of <emph rend="italic">peace-loving</emph> Democrats!
                            <emph rend="italic">Their</emph> influence, on this side of "Dixie,"
                        towards the restoration of peace on the basis of a compromise with the
                        rebels, will prove so vain and impotent, that all good and true friends of
                        the Union, of whatever party, and especially of the Democratic party, will
                        forget that these <emph rend="italic">peace-lovers</emph> ever existed to
                        disgust their fellow-citizens, and give indirect aid and comfort to the
                        enemy. Recreant indeed must that man be who proclaims his duty to party as
                        paramount to the magnanimous support of the Government in her present
                        efforts to crush rebellion. Peace will eventually crown the efforts of
                        freemen when rebellion shall have been suppressed; but the few, who are
                        already "reckoned the friends and allies" of such men as Breckenridge and
                        Vallandigham, will certainly fail in their efforts to form any very
                        formidable political organization under such leadership. The constituencies
                        of both these worthies are now prepared to discard them; but in this
                        locality a few "friends and allies" are at the service of the Kentucky and
                        Ohio leaders!</p>

                    since the ordinance had been voted down in Town Council recently.</summary>

                    <p>Our townsman, Mr. J. Allison Eyster, and the several gentlemen from
                        Waynesboro', whom we announced sometime ago had been seized while in
                        Virginia and thrown into the Winchester prison--since removed to
                        Richmond--as prisoners of war, are still detained. Efforts by influential
                        parties, we understand, are being made to obtain their release, but with
                        what prospect of success we are unable to say. As these gentlemen are but
                        simple civilians, disconnected with the operations of our army altogether,
                        what object is to be achieved in their detention, we are at a loss to
                        know.--We would be pleased to hear of their liberation; but if this is
                        peremptorily denied, then we trust the most determined and energetic
                        measures of retaliation will be adopted by our people everywhere. This is a
                        game two can play at, and the sooner it is commenced, the better.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Mr. John M. Collins, of Va., son of the celebrated Methodist Preacher, Rev.
                        John A. Collins, has given the following narrative of his experiences, in
                        the South, to the Washington <emph rend="italic">Star</emph> of this
                        evening:</p>
                    <p>"An accomplished young woman, named Anna Giernstein, a native of Maine, who
                        had been engaged in school teaching, near Memphis, was informed that she was
                        an object of suspicion to the Secessionists, and was advised to leave. On
                        the 18th of May she left Memphis for Cairo.</p>
                    <p>In the cars she found three Northern men, named Tomlinson, Duffy, and
                        McGregor, also <emph rend="italic">en route</emph> to Cairo, and said to
                        them, "Thank God! we shall soon be in a land where there is freedom of
                        speech and thought!" The remark was overheard by a fellow named Firman, who
                        immediately demanded to see her ticket and those of her fellow passengers
                        above named. Finding they were all destined to the free States he at once
                        caused their seizure by the vigilance committee. These gentlemen were then
                        stripped naked and whipped, the strokes being administered by a negro with a
                        gnout [sic] some twenty four feet in length, each stroke of which cuts the
                        flesh in stripes an inch in width. Miss Giernstein, who had expressed some
                        natural indignation at these inhuman barbarities, was then seized by the
                        brute who conducted the whipping arrangements, one John Duvall (a native of
                        Cleveland, Ohio!) who requested her to unfasten the upper part of her dress.
                        She indignantly refused, when Duvall said he would do it himself, and laying
                        hands upon her tore her dress away down to the waist. Her feet were then
                        tied with straps and a person named Thomas McElroy (formerly of Syracuse,
                        New York!) held her by the arms while Duvall administered thirteen stripes
                        to her bare back. While submitting to this ordeal the brave girl did not
                        gratify her persecutors by a single tear, but Mr. Collins noticed blood upon
                        her lips, indicating that she had bitten them through in suppressing any
                        outward indications of her agony. The right side of her head was then
                        shaved, and, thus scarred and disfigured she was permitted to resume her
                        journey towards civilization." </p>
