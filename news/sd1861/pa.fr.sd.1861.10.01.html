<b>The End of Breckinridge</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Announces the news that John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky has gone over to
                    the enemy.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is reported, we presume on good authority, says the N. Y. Tribune of Saturday last, that John C.
                        Breckinridge, of Kentucky, has at length gone over to the enemy, and joined
                        the Rebels who are seeking to destroy the Republic, and who, from the
                        beginning of their treasonable movement have had his secret sympathy and
                        countenance. To the country and to the Government his departure is no great
                        loss. To the great majority of loyal citizens the name of John C.
                        Breckinridge is the symbol, not of a great or eminently able man, but of a
                        small and commonplace politician, a mediocre lawyer, and of a soldier who,
                        while in service in Mexico, never faced any other enemies than the opposing
                        counsel in the prosecutions which he assisted the redoubtable Gen. Pillow in
                        bringing against his associate and superior officers.--Born with a gold
                        spoon in his mouth, of one of the most opulent and influential families of
                        Kentucky, of pleasing manners and appearance, and of insatiable ambition, he
                        has been pushed forward in public life more rapidly than any other man in
                        our history. Before the age of forty, an age earlier than which high public
                        position is rarely attained in this country, he has been twice a Member of
                        the House of Representatives, had been Senator and Vice President of the
                        United States, and at length the candidate of a great party for the
                        Presidency itself. In all these posts, with all these opportunities he has
                        done nothing, literally nothing. Outside of his native State no man
                        remembers, no man can recall a speech or an act of Mr. Breckinridge which
                        was striking or important enough to take a hold, however feeble, of the
                        public mind. The act by which he will be hereafter best known and longest
                        remembered, is the act of open treason which he has just committed. In
                        himself he is of no consexuence [sic], but the shameful defection of a man
                        so petted and caressed by public favor will bring a pang of regret to
                        thousands of honest Northern hearts, as they recall the delusion under which
                        they were led to give him their suffrages in last November.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 19th ult., the Conferees, representing the Day
                            Book Democracy of the Sixteenth Judicial District, composed of
                        the Counties of Franklin, Fulton, Bedford and Somerset, met in Bloody Run,
                        and placed in nomination Wilson Reilly, Esq., of Chambersburg, as their
                        candidate for the President Judgeship.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday last, the 24th ult., the Conferees of the Union Party of the same
                        District nominated the Hon. James Nill, of Chambersburg, as Mr. Reilly's
                        competitor.</p>
                    <p>The Conferees of Somerset failed to meet the other Conferees, but they
                        acquiesced in the action of the Conference, and Mr. Nill and Mr. Reilly now
                        stand before the voters of the District as candidates for President Judge
                        for the next ten years, and it requires no prophet to foretell who will be
                        the choice of the people.</p>
                    <p>We presume it is unnecessary for us to draw a comparison between these two
                        gentlemen, as to their qualifications for the position for which they have
                        been selected, or as regards their merits and demerits. They are so well
                        known to the people of the District, and especially to those residing in
                        Franklin and Fulton Counties, that an attempt on our part to do so, would
                        seem almost as foolish as would the act be of introducing members of a
                        community to each other who are in daily communication and engaged in daily
                        business transactions.</p>
                    <p>The people are deeply interested in having the right kind of man to preside
                        over their Courts. A President Judge is only chosen every ten years, unless
                        a vacancy should be created by resignation, death, or otherwise, and to have
                        a man fastened upon the Bench for the next ten years, who, in many ways, may
                        be unfitted for the position, would be a blunder which the people might have
                        great reason to regret.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nill is a man of fine legal attainments, and is an experienced Lawyer,
                        having had a most extensive practice at our Bar for the last thirty years.
                        He possesses a cool head and a well balanced judgment, and is not moved to
                        rashness and excitement by every trivial cause or obstacle. He is not
                        capricious or whimisical [sic]. He is a man of dignified mien and of the
                        most correct moral deportment. The Bench and other similar positions, should
                        be filled by just such men as Mr. Nill. While the duties of the position
                        would be ably discharged, there would be no detraction from the dignity that
                        should be, and is, accorded by the people to the wearer of the judicial
                        ermine.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nill is the man for the place, and the voters of the District should see
                        to it that he is elevated to the Bench beyond a preadventure. The people
                        have a deep interest in the kind of man who is to dispense Law and Justice
                        in their Courts the next decade of years, and while we would not detract
                        from his opponent, we feel assured that the people will very readily
                        indicate by their votes on next Tuesday, that
                        James Nill is the man of their choice for President Judge. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Many among the uninitiated--and this class is in the great majority--echo the
                        question which we use as a caption. In view of the great armies sternly
                        regarding each other at Washington, the Rebel progress in Missouri, and the
                        movements in Kentucky, the curiosity becomes sharpened almost to madness;
                        the suspense lies like an incubus upon the mind. What are we waiting for?
                        Why is not some movement made from Washington?</p>
                    <p>Let us give a few answers to this manifold question. We are waiting to
                        recover entirely from the disaster of Manassas; to re-inspirit the new
                        troops there panic-struck, and to try them in affairs and reconnoissances, such as that of Lewinsville, before
                        they are again subjected to the "leaden rain and iron hail" of a great
                        battle. "We must have no more Bull Run affairs."</p>
                    <p>We are waiting to discipline a vast army, before improperly organized,
                        lacking bone and muscle; lax for want of a system of army-corps, divisions and brigades, with permanant [sic]
                        commanders. This is to be done, now that the proper appointments have been
                        made, by constant drills of the company as skirmishers; of the battalion, by
                        the new and rapid French system embodied in the United States Infantry
                        Tactics; by the army corps, under the Brigadiers, in evolutions of the line. This is being done, silently but
                        vigorously, everywhere, under the immediate direction of experienced and
                        indefatigable Generals.</p>
                    <p>We are waiting to increase our artillery and and [sic] perfect the practice;
                        to place heavy guns in the beautiful chain of forts stretching from
                        Alexandria to the Chain Bridge; and to multiply light batteries until they
                        literally swarm in the battalion intervals.</p>
                    <p>We are waiting for cavalry--at first under-valued--at all times requiring
                        toil, time and expense to provide. We were without that expense to provide.
                        We were without that arm; McClellan's eye saw at once the great disparity
                        and the great want. The Rebels abound in a superior cavalry--a true modern
                        Centaur, intelligent men on superb horses; Manassas told the story of their
                        value. We must have cavalry equally good, as soon as possible. We are
                        waiting for it.</p>
                    <p>We are waiting to let diversions on the Southern coast operate magnetically
                        in Virginia. They are now being felt; and those secretly projected on a
                        greater scale, with the blessing of Providence, shall echo like thunderbolts
                        between the Rappahannock and the Potomac. Add to this the coming frosts,
                        with the rigors of a Northern winter; their want of supplies--Virginia is
                        nearly eaten up--their want of clothing; their home-sickness, which will be
                        another evil laid at the door of States'
                        Rights;--we are waiting for these, and we see the incipient signs
                        already. In a word, we are using every moment of the passing time with the
                        utmost diligence; and those who cannot see the workings of the intricate
                        machinery must be content to hope and to put their faith in the genius,
                        industry, valor and endurance of General McClellan, whose plans are forming
                        and formed, and who will move when we need wait no longer, with secrecy,
                        celerity and success.--Phila. Inq.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have the gratification to announce, that our respected townsmen, J. A.
                        Eyster, Esq., whose arrest by the rebels we announced at the time it
                        occurred, and who has been held a prisoner at Richmond, Va., ever since,
                        during the early part of last week was released, and arrived at home on
                        Saturday last.</p>
                    <p>While in Richmond he was imprisoned in a large Tobacco Warehouse for some
                        five weeks, with Messrs Kurtz, Walker, McCumsey and Brotherton, of
                        Waynesboro', whose capture we also announced. He was then removed to the
                        County Prison, where he was detained up until the hour of his release.</p>
                    <p>Mr. E. looks about as natural as ever, but somewhat thinner in flesh. He says
                        he was treated kindly, as are all the prisoners, as far as his knowledge
                        goes, that are detained at Richmond, of whom it is supposed, there must be
                        some 2500. Many of them are now being transferred to points farther South.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Eyster was arrested and detained as a spy, and would have been discharged
                        long ago could he have obtained a hearing before the proper authorities. It
                        was a mere accident that he finally did succeed in having his case brought
                        up, and no evidence being adduced against him, he was discharged on the
                        spot. He was furnished a pass to Norfolk, from whence, under a flag of
                        truce, with a number of other discharged prisoners, he was sent to Fortress
                        Monroe. From there he embarked for Baltimore, and is now at home, where he
                        has received the congratulations of hundreds of his fellow-citizens, at his
                        fortunate escape from the philistines.</p>
                    <p>The other parties we have named above, were not so fortunate as Mr. Eyster.
                        It appears they are charged with furnishing the federal troops with supplies
                        while on the "sacred soil" of Virginia, and they, doubtless, will be
