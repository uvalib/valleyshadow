                <summary>Notes that a farmer from Greencastle supplied some "poorly fed soldiers"
                    bread, onions, and butter at the price of one cent per onion, 25 cents a pound
                    for butter, and 50 cents a loaf for bread. The editor says that "he got his
                    reward" when his garden was stripped the same night.</summary>
