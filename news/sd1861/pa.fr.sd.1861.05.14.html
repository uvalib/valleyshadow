<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that venders sold "cakes and goodies" to troops in the Relay House
                    in Maryland that contained strychnine. Offers an excerpt from special orders

                    men of Maryland." Claims that when General Patterson's regiment marched through
                    Baltimore, they were not greeted with harassment, but with "the cheers of the

                    Chase, to customs officers in Northern waters. Chase instructs customs officials
                    to examine all vessels departing from U.S. ports to determine whether they are
                    carrying materials intended for Southern ports that are under Union blockade. He
                    reminds customs officers that insurrectionaries are "engaged in levying war
                    against the United States" and thus are guilty of treason.<br>

<b>Fugitive Negroes Passing Through the City</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Estimates that, in a "stampede of slaves" from the South, two hundred
                    African Americans have passed through Philadelphia since the capture of Fort
                    Sumter.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One disastrous effect of the rebellion will be the loss of property to
                        slaveholders. The stampede of slaves from the South has not been confined to
                        a particular locality, and the fugitives have not taken any special route. A
                        great number have been passing through this city during the last few weeks.
                        Of course, no citizen or official will interest himself to send fugitives
                        back to enemies of the Government. Last night, the number that reached the
                        city was said to be twenty. A number of these lodged in the station-houses,
                        and were assisted to go further. The story that they tell of the condition
                        of things at the south should be sufficient to intimidate the rebels, for
                        they exhibit a consummate knowledge of the questions at issue, and state
                        that the blacks are ready to make use of any exigency that may arrive. It is
                        fair to compute that two hundred negroes have passed through this city
                        alone, since Fort Sumter was captured.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The was upon which we have just entered, it appears, is to be characterized
                        by every species of fiendishness. Incendiarism and secret poisoning are to
                        be weapons used by our enemies against us. Notwithstanding these things were
                        threatened months ago, should our Government attempt to retain its authority
                        upon Southern soil, yet our hearts repelled the idea, not supposing that
                        even Secessionists had become incarnate fiends. As our experience with them
                        progresses, however, we are becoming more and more convinced, that, with all
                        their boast of Chivalry, and First Families, our foe is entirely
                        unscrupulous respecting the means employed for gaining their end. The
                        attempt to poison the troops at New York and at Anapolis, was scarcely
                        credited by any of our people not cognizant of the facts; but the firing of
                        Willard's Hotel, and the officially certified fact of the attempt upon the
                        lives of the troops stationed at the Relay House, by means of strychnine
                        placed in refreshments offered for sale, put their lack of honor, and entire
                        Vandalism and inhumanity, beyond a doubt. If these are the means of their
                        warfare upon us, terrible will be the retribution. A few such examples and
                        the worst passions of our people, and especially of our soldiery, will be
                        aroused, and then woe to the South!</p>
                    <p>In the name of Religion, Humanity and Patriotism, we hope it may not be so;
                        that whatever excesses may be attempted by the Rebels, our own soldiers may
                        ever remember that in becoming soldiers they have not ceased to be men. Let
                        all undue excesses be upon the part of the rebellion; while we, knowing our
                        strength and the rectitude of our cause, proceed calmly and deliberately to
                        destroy the treason, and bring the revolted States to their rightful
                        allegiance. Let us ever remember that many loyal hearts still beat beneath
                        Southern bosoms, and, remembering it, let our warfare upon the Rebellion in
                        their midst be characterized by humanity and magnanimity as our cause is by
                        justice and fidelity.</p>

                    <p>From the New York Tribune.</p>
                    <p>For more than thirty years, Nullification and Disunion have afflicted the
                        land. For nearly the same period, Slavery agitation has disturbed the
                        general repose. To appease the former, and silence the latter, all
                        conceivable expedients have been tried. Presidents have issued
                        anti-Nulification [sic] proclamations. Senators have sung paeans to the
                        Union. Tariffs have been repealed and gag resolutions adopted. Mobs have
                        howled through the streets, and compromise measures of varied hues have
                        dragged their slow lengths through everglades of Florida, and chased runaway
                        negroes clear up to the Canada line. We have acquired Texas, and fought
                        about it, and backed down from 54' 40', lest we should have to fight about
                        that. We have sacrificed great statesmen and elevated paltry politicians. We
                        have dissolved old parties and formed new ones; discarded ancient doctrines,
                        and set up novel tests of orthodoxy. But all has been in vain.</p>
                    <p>We will not stop to inquire how, nor whence, nor why Nullification, Disunion,
                        and Slavery Agitation, were originally precipitated upon the country, nor by
                        what means, nor from what motives, their lurid fires have been kept burning
                        till now. We shall not try to apportion the blame nor the praise which
                        belongs to this party or that faction. All this belongs to the past. History
                        will pass its unerring judgment upon it. Our present purpose is simply to
                        say, that we are very sure that all parties at the North have had enough of
                        these disturbing questions, and most heartily desire to see them brought to
                        an end. The disease has reached a crisis. It must be eradicated, or a speedy
                        dissolution of the body politic is at hand. Threats of disunion have ripened
                        into acts of open rebellion. Nullification, covert and cautious, within the
                        Federal Government, has given place to armed resistance to its authority and
                        defiant secession from it.</p>
                    <p>Men of all shades of opinion this side the Potomac long to put a final finish
                        to the causes which have engendered these interminable, distracting, and now
                        most portentous controversies. Even those who are moved by no higher motive
                        than a desire to be relieved from an agitation which, for a whole
                        generation, has absorbed so much of the time, talents, and temper of the
                        country, eagerly hail the present exigency as the Heaven-ordained
                        opportunity for striking an exterminating blow at the root of the evil.
                        Others who regard the existence [sic] of our free institutions as staked
                        upon the issue, demand that the tree which has borne such noxious fruits be
                        now levelled [sic] to the earth. Cut it down, say they; why cumbereth it the
                        ground?</p>
                    <p>It can be done! Peaceful expedients have failed. War is the only remedy. Let
                        timidity stand aside, and leave event to flow on in an uninterrupted
                        channel. Let us listen to no compromises. Let us stop at no halfway
                        measures. In his recent speech, Daniel S. Dickinson has given voice to the
                        Northern sentiment: "Let us," said that veteran National Democrat, "settle
                        this thing speedily and surely. It may ruin this generation; but we owe it
                        to the next that they should have no such troubles as we have had. Let us
                        strike now in our might, and, if necessary, wipe the rebels from the face of
                        the earth.--Let us finish things while we are about it, and leave nothing
                        behind us."</p>
