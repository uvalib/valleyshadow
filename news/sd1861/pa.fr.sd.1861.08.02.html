<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Explains that the government will not recognize the Confederacy by

                    officers of the U. S. army or navy and who give their word not to bear arms

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Disparages the idea that General Banks will be forced to retreat back into

                    Washington. Argues that this will not occur, because Banks is receiving

                    that the camp has been taken care of by Mr. Jos. Fry since the regiments

                    particularly suitable for the instruction of federal troops.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. J. Eberly, Mr. Jos. Fry)</blockquote>
