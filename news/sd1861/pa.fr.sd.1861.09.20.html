<b>The Day-Book Democracy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Brings the Times (a paper published in Chambersburg) to task for not
                    calling Democrats who once purchased the Day Book, which recently has been
                    suppressed by the government, traitors.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"A journal, calling itself the Day-Book, has been
                        published in New York city, and has not only made itself infamous by its
                        traitorous attacks upon the Government, but has rendered it necessary for
                        the Administration to suppress it, as a measure of self-preservation."</p>
                    <p>The above statement we clip from the last number of The
                            Times, a paper published in this place, whose editor is now
                        engaged in the interesting exercise of trying to
                        ride two horses at the same time--the Union and the Rebel. </p>
                    <p>The Times admits that the Day-Book was not only "infamous," but that it became "necessary
                        for the Administration to suppress it, as a measure of self-preservation."
                        Many Breckinridge Democrats of this County were patrons of the Day-Book, and if we are not misinformed, Mr. Orr,
                        the President of the Democratic County Convention, was one of them. One
                        thing is true, that during the day that the Convention was in session in our
                        town, the Book Store of Messrs. Shyock &amp; Smith, where newspapers and
                        periodicals are sold, was literally beseiged [sic] by Democratic delegates
                        to obtain copies of the Day-Book, N. Y. News, and other similar "infamous" sheets.
                        Another thing is true--that these same Democratic patrons of the "infamous"
                            Day-Book have been most earnest and bitter in
                        their denunciation of the Administration for having stopped its publication,
                        which, The Times admits, was "owing to its
                        traitorous attacks upon the Government" and which was rendered necessary "as
                        a measure of self-preservation."</p>
                    <p>In characterizing these friends of The Times and
                        former patrons of the "infamous" Day-Book, as
                        "Day-Book Democrats," thus intimating that all such were no better friends
                        of the Union than they ought to be, our professed Union friend of The Times charges us with being a "calumniator."</p>
                    <p>A man who gives "aid and comfort" to the enemy is a traitor who patronizes and promotes the circulation of a paper
                        which The Times has denounced as "infamous,"
                        owing to "its traitorous attacks upon the Government," and which, "as a
                        measure of self-preservation," the Administration was compelled to suppress?
                        Is not the support of such a paper as the "infamous" Day
                            Book, giving "aid and comfort" to the enemy? If it is, are not
                        the Day Book Democrats, over whom The Times is now spreading its wings, guilty of
                        treason? If so, are they not traitors? We pause
                        for a reply. </p>
