<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Harrisburg Patriot and Union announces with an
                        air of fiendish triumph that "several regiments have been precipitated upon
                        Schuylkill to enforce the draft," and in the same perfidious spirit
                        inquires--"How does that sound?" What becomes of Forney's idea that the
                        draft is an expression of the popular will-something "desired by the people,
                        if it has to be enforced at the point of the bayonet?" Considering that the
                            Patriot and Union has spared no pains to
                        provoke open resistance to the draft, by its shameless perversions of the
                        tenor and aim of the conscription act, and by its undisguised hostility to
                        the war and the success of our army, it is not surprising that it should
                        gloat with infernal joy over the remotest prospect of riot and murderous
                        lawlessness within the limits of its own State. If there shall not be riots
                        and anarchy, in the mining regions of Pennsylvania, it will be no fault of
                        the Patriot and Union, for it has appealed to
                        every base passion, to every unholy prejudice, and now, after having aroused
                        its dupes to the verge of resistance, it plays its last card by pointing to
                        the bayonets it has made to glisten over its own malignant work, and seems
                        impatient lest the bloody pageant should be averted.</p>
                    <p>The fidelity of the people of Pennsylvania to the laws, as a rule, has
                        evidently been a source of the keenest mortification to Judge Woodward's
                        central organ. For weeks past it has labored for a general revolution; but
                        in no section, save in the mining regions, has there been a shadow of
                        response to its mingled malignity and treachery. Despairing in its efforts
                        for a sweeping hurricane of anarchy, it is still unwilling to forego
                        entirely its treasonable enterprise, and it now bends its energies with
                        unrelenting fury to crimson the mining regions of Schuylkill, Luzerne,
                        &amp;c., with the blood of their own citizens. It well knows that there
                        and there only is a lingering hope of lawlessness--there where free schools
                        are contemned and the regular Democratic ticket voted with a yell, it makes
                        its last, exhausting appeal for the deadly work of revolution to begin.</p>
                    <p>It has well selected its field of operations. If it cannot breed lawlessness
                        in Schuylkill, then must its occupation be gone, for in no other section of
                        the State have ignorance, prejudice and partizan hatred promised such
                        abundant fruits of treason. In portions of Schuylkill, peopled exclusively
                        with minters, Jeff. Davis could reign supreme, surrounded by approving
                        subjects, as long as Frank Hughes and such echoes of his sentiments as the
                            Patriot and Union did not invoke their
                        prejudices against him. The writer hereof had somewhat to do with this
                        people a year ago when the last draft was made; and in Cass township the
                        miners stopped work and resolved that they would not be drafted, and that
                        they would permit no resident of that district, however willing, to respond
                        to the call of his country. In pursuance of that resolution they mobbed the
                        cars loaded with patriotic conscripts and drove them out with pistols,
                        knives and stones, and but for the timely interposition of the Catholic
                        clergy, who finally brought them to peaceable submission, we should have had
                        the riots then which the Patriot and Union so
                        badly wants now. A little inquiry into the character, habits and prejudices
                        of these men, and the uses for which they are employed by designing and
                        reckless political leaders, removes all surprise at their probable attempt
                        to defy the laws. During three years there were thirteen deliberate murders
                        in Cass township, and not a single criminal was brought to trial. The
                        District Attorney labored in vain to have processes served and arrests made,
                        but the civil authorities had become completely powerless before this
                        perpetual mob. Democratic politicians must have their votes, and they cannot
                        hand or imprison one half and vote the balance at their pleasure, so the
                        laws have become a by-word and mockery, while an almost unanimous Democratic
                        vote at elections; an occasional little home riot, and now and then seasons
                        of labor at their own prices and under their own regulations, vary the
                        amusements of the innocent creatures upon whom several regiments of men have
                        been "precipitated" to enforce the laws.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Whipple, the military commander at Pottsville, has already had several
                        rifle balls "precipitated' at him by skulking assassins, and the mines have
                        been stopped by the operatives preparatory to a general shindy when the
                        draft is made. They are perfectly masters of law-makers, law officers and
                        property owners in their region; and when they want prices of gods reduced,
                        wages raised, bosses discharged, systems revised, processes prevented, or
                        particular laws defied, they resolve to have it done, and hitherto their
                        decree has been final. Judges, Sheriffs, and other officers of the courts
                        must be voted for by the enlightened and virtuous citizens of Cass and
                        kindred townships, and when once elected it is trouble enough for the
                        leaders to keep them in order for the next election, without exasperating
                        them by imposing upon them the restraints and penalties of the laws. Their
                        last resolve was against the draft--it should not be made--the conscripts
                        should not report for duty, and all labor has been arrested to prepare for a
                        free flight. But it seems ideas about Gen. Couch has some old-fashioned
                        ideas about the Cass township amusements of killing, robbing and defying
                        laws generally, and he has "precipitated" several regiments upon the
                        exceedingly docile citizens of the mines. Instead of making speeches to them
                        and telling them to vote the Democratic ticket and thus stop the draft and
                        this "nigger-war," he has employed as his orators several batteries of
                        artillery and the gleam of several thousand bayonets; and judging from the
                        agonies of the Patriot and Union he has almost
                        persuaded them to reputable citizenship. Whether they will submit, as do
                        better men everywhere, or whether they will bring upon themselves the
                        fearful consequence of lawlessness, is for the Patriot
                            and Union, Frank Hughes, and other owners of their prejudices to
                        determine. If they insist upon a riot in behalf of Jeff. Davis, a small
                        experiment can now be made in that way; but beyond a few funerals of the men
                        who should have been hung long ago for the reckless commission of capital
                        crimes, and the consequent reduction of Judge Woodward's vote at the next
                        election, we don't see the profits of the transaction. The laws will be vindicated--the time has come.</p>

                    <p> Union Leagues should be working institutions.
                        With active officers and efficient committees, every vote in the district
                        can be ascertained--the doubtful strengthened, the timid and hesitating
                        supplied with documents, and, above all, a full vote can thus be secured in
                        October. A full vote in Franklin, bear in mind, will give 1,000 Union
                        majority.</p>
                    <p>Let the good work begin at once. There is no time for delay. The enemy is
                        busy everywhere, quietly talking about taxation, debt, Abolitionism and
                        kindred treachery to mislead honest voters against the government. Their
                        efforts must be met sternly by the patriotic Union men, and they have but to
                        expose the treasonable designs of Copperhead leaders, to alienate hundreds
                        of loyal Democrats from the support of Woodward.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes public meetings are necessary or wise--sometimes not. Let the
                        Leagues see to this, and when speakers or documents are wanted, call on the
                        Chairman of the County Committee for them and they will be forthcoming. Now
                        is the time to begin the work of organization, and we hope that two weeks
                        hence will see a thoroughly officered Union League in every district in the
                        county.</p>

                        of a pass system, has been put on, in order to get out of the city.</p>
                    <p>There is only one thing wrong in the draft of this District. It is this. The poor
                        negro and the sojourners from the loyal States temporarily stopping
                        here, have all been enrolled and their names put in the box, with the cursed
                        disloyal population, natives of this place, "to the manor born"--those who
                        have been sucking the milk of Uncle, or Aunt, Sam, if you please--from
                        childhood to manhood, and gnawing away in their old age--yet silently
                        stabbing the Government by night and by day. Those who you know, as well as

                        mixed. Consequently the chances of these disloyal persons being drawn is
                        diminished so much so, that almost every third name drawn is a poor negro.
                        Consequently nearly all the quota of the District will be filled by citizens

                    warning signs of cholera and its remedies.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is not to be disguised that much sickness prevails in this community
                        although it has not assumed a very malignant or epidemic character; but our
                        citizens should not delay in adopting every proper precautionary measure to
                        preserve the general health. The season has been eminently calculated to
                        produce sickness. The protracted wet spell in July has made a most luxuriant
                        growth of vegetation, and filled all the pools and low lands with stagnant
                        water, which have dried out under the scorching sun of the severe heated
                        term that followed; and deadly miasmas now fill the atmosphere. In addition
                        to these causes, the military occupation of the county has contributed
                        largely to create sickness. In every direction about Chambersburg, camps of
                        soldiers, or corrals of horses, or camps of wagon trains, have abounded, and
                        raw troops, especially when occupying places but temporarily, never practice
                        the rigid rules of cleanliness necessary to preserve health. In the evening
                        the citizens are met with sickening stenches in and around the town, arising
                        from imperfectly buried animals, or the filth of corrals or camps, and
                        unless some rigid sanitary regulations are speedily adopted, we may have an
                        epidemic. It is worthy of notice that the present season is in some respects
                        similar to the summer of 1852, when the cholera prevailed. True we have not
                        the cold, damp weather alternately with hot suns, but we have the similarity
                        unmistakably in the rapid tendency of everything to putrify or mould. It is
                        almost impossible to keep fresh meat for even a day, and mould will be found
                        in every close room or closet if closed up for even a short time.</p>
                    <p>It is not generally difficult to avert epidemics; but it is always difficult
                        to arrest them when once they launch forth their deadly power. The prompt
                        application of disinfectants, under any circumstances at this season of the
                        year, is always wise, and now it is an imperative necessity if we would not
                        expose ourselves foolishly to disease. Quick lime is the most accessible,
                        the cheapest and one of the best disinfecting agents, and it can scarcely be
                        used too bountifully. Every citizen should see at once to his cellar and to
                        any filth about his premises, and have lime applied wherever there is
                        decaying vegetable or animal matter. Old camps should be thoroughly
                        sprinkled with lime, and every damp cellar should be promptly cleansed and
                        limed, and ventilated as well as possible.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, when sun-stroke is alarmingly common, and when no one is
                        altogether exempt from the sudden and usually fatal results of exposure to
                        the great heat just now prevalent, it may be well to disseminate as widely
                        as may be a knowledge of how to remedy, and, if possible, to avoid, this
                        trouble. The following statements concerning coup de
                            soleil may be taken as authoritative:</p>
                    <p>The premonition of an attack are readily recognized. There is a feeling of
                        pressure upon the head; the blood tingles in the vessels; and the air seems
                        too hot and tenuous for breathing. A person who was once thus affected tells
                        us that he was relieved by immediately bathing the head, arms and shoulders
                        in water. While performing this operation he experienced a sensation as
                        though burning coals had been spread over his whole scalp; but in less than
                        an hour every oppressive symptom had passed way. A young brother of his, who
                        was similarly attacked, was not so cautious. He fell to the ground
                        insensible, while at labor in the harvest field, and after lingering two or
                        three days--much of the time comatose, and with what a physician mistakenly
                        termed and treated as typhoid fever--was suffered to die.</p>
                    <p>The remedies "laid down in the books" are alcoholic and ammoniacal
                        stimulants; these are "diffusive" and causing an equable circulation of
                        blood throughout the body, and particularly to the surface. The patient is
                        directed to swallow the medicine; but if he is "out of his head" it can be
                        given by enema. Washing the head with cold water, and rubbing liniments upon
                        the surface with the hands, keeping up the friction as long as may be
                        necessary, will generally answer the purpose. When dullness or stupor
                        remains, coffee and strong tea are efficacious.</p>
                    <p>The means of prevention are simple. Persons in sound health are seldom
                        attacked; previous debility, general depression of the vital forces, unusual
                        and excessive physical exertion, violent gusts of passion, excessive
                        drinking of cold water or alcoholic beverages, superadded to the exposure to
                        the summer sun or a hot fire, create the danger. Careful moderation in these
                        particulars will generally secure exemption. The Arab, wandering in an arid
                        desert, subsisting on camel's milk and a few vegetables, is seldom attacked;
                        his blood is not vitiated by stimulating food or unwholesome drink. Sir
                        Joseph Banks spent twenty minutes in an oven where beef was cooking, without
                        harm. Fishermen, for the sake of protection, sometimes fill their hats with
                        moist sea-weed; though any large leaves, or even a wet cloth upon the head,
                        will answer as well. This is an infallible preventive and should be more
                        generally observed by laboring men.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is officially announced that the Draft will commence on Monday next, at
                        the headquarters of Provost Marshal Eyster, in the Masonic Hall in this
                        place, and will be continued from day to day until completed. The draft will
                        be first made for Adams, then for Bedford, and then for Franklin, commencing
                        with Antrim and the two wards of Chambersburg on Thursday of next week.
                        Capt. Eyster has given notice by hand bills distributed throughout every
                        district that the drawing will be public, and the citizens are asked to
                        witness it. Of the entire fairness and impartiality of Capt. Eyster no one
                        can doubt; but to avoid the remotest pretext for cavil, a joint committee of
                        say three from each political party should be chosen by each township, to
                        attend and witness the entire operation of the draft for their respective
                        districts. This was done in Philadelphia in every ward, and we feel assured
                        that Capt. Eyster would be glad to extend every facility for information to
                        such committees. The people are all interested in the draft--if not for
                        themselves, for their sons or other kindred; but they cannot all attend the
                        drawing; and the better way is that three intelligent and reputable men from
                        each party be chosen by their respective parties to represent the people on
                        the occasion.</p>
