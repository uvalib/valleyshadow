</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit, in an appeal for Union men to
                        volunteer, says that "Rosecrans has been beaten back into the fastnesses of
                        Chattanooga; Meade beats an inglorious retreat from Lee, and retires within the fortifications at
                        Washington--and all for want of men." Three days before the above was
                        printed in the Spirit, Meade was pursuing Lee on
                        the Rappahannock, and if Meade has lately been "within the fortifications at
                        Washington," we are quite sure that no one but the writer for the Spirit had the news. We do not expect the Spirit to represent the gloom of rebeldom
                        truthfully, but we submit that it should not thus defame the gallant Army of
                        the Potomac for the purpose of throwing the cloud of despair over loyal
                        hearts. In another article of the same paper it says that the rebellion
                            "is revelling in the pride of its strength, and
                            pressing our armies back from all its borders!" What a capital
                        organ for Jeff. Davis the Spirit would make.
                        While the whole press of rebeldom is mourning the disasters to their legions
                        of crime at every point, and deploring the waning strength of Treason, the
                            Spirit reminds them that they are "revelling
                        in the pride of its (the rebellion's) strength, and pressing our armies back
                        from all its borders!" Could the Spirit be forced
                        into some benighted corner of rebeldom, where they don't get the news, what
                        hopes it would inspire in its country's foes by the grateful intelligence
                        that the Old Flag is receding from all its borders;" but in the regions of
                        intelligence and light it would only wring contempt from despairing traitors
                        for its awkward falsehoods so clumsily disguised with blatant professions of
                        loyalty.</p>
