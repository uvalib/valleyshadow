                    <p>As part of the history of the Rebel Invasion of the North, we have gathered
                        up all the general orders issued by Gens. Lee and Ewell, relating to the
                        treatment of citizens and property, while in the Cumberland Valley. Lee's
                        first order on the subject was issued on the 21st of June, six days before
                        he [illegible] Chambersburg. It was evidently designed to define generally
                        the plan of operations of his army in our county, and as will be seen aimed
                        at a fair standard of humanity and decorum in his ranks. The following is
                        the order.</p>
                    <p>
                        Headquarters Army Northern Virginia,
                        <br>
                        June 21, 1863
                    </p>
                    <p>General Orders No. 72.--While in the enemy's
                        country, the following regulations for procuring supplies will be strictly
                        observed, and any violation of them promptly and rigorously punished:</p>
                    <p>I. No private property shall be injured or destroyed by any person belonging
                        to or connected with the army, or taken, except by the officers hereinafter
                        designated.</p>
                    <p>II. The chiefs of the Commissary, Quartermaster, Ordnance and Medical
                        departments of the army will make requisitions upon the local authorities or
                        inhabitants for the necessary supplies for their respective departments,
                        designating the places and times of delivery. All persons complying with
                        such requisitions shall be paid the market price for the articles furnished,
                        if they so desire, and the officer making such payment shall take duplicate
                        receipts for the same, specifying the name of the person paid, the quantity,
                        kind, and price of the property, one of which receipts shall be at once
                        forwarded to the chief of the department for which such officer is attached.</p>
                    <p>III. Should the authorities or inhabitants neglect or refuse to comply with
                        such requisitions, the supplies acquired will be taken from the nearest
                        inhabitants refusing, by the order and under the direction of the respective
                        chiefs of the departments named.</p>
                    <p>IV. When any command is detached from the main body, the chiefs of the
                        several departments of such command will procure supplies for the same, and
                        such other stores as they may be ordered to provide, in the manner and
                        subject to the provisions herein prescribed, reporting their action to the
                        heads of their respective departments, to which they will forward duplicates
                        of all vouchers given or received.</p>
                    <p>V. All persons who shall decline to receive payment for property furnished on
                        requisitions, and all from whom it shall be necessary to take stores or
                        supplies, shall be furnished by the officers receiving or taking the same
                        with a receipt specifying the kind and and [sic] quantity of the property
                        received or taken, as the case may be, the name of the person from whom it
                        was received or taken, the command for the use of which it is intended, and
                        the market price. A duplicate of said receipt shall be at once forwarded to
                        the chief of the department to which the officer by whom it is executed is
                        attached.</p>
                    <p>VI. If any person shall remove or conceal property necessary for the use of
                        the army, or attempt to do so, the officers hereinbefore mentioned will
                        cause such property and all other property belonging to such persons that
                        may be required by the army, to be seized, and the officers seizing the same
                        will forthwith report to the chief of his department the kind, quantity and
                        market price of the property so seized, and the name of the owner.</p>
                    <p>By command of Gen. R. E. Lee. <br>R. H. Chilton, A. A. and I. G.
                        <br>Lieut.-Gen. R. S. Ewell, <br>Com'g 2d Army Corps.</p>
                    <p>On the day following the date of Lee's order, Gen. Ewell issued a general
                        order on the same subject, as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        Headquarters 2d. Corp,
                        <br>
                        Army Northern Va., June 22, 1863
                    </p>
                    <p>General Orders, No. 49.--In moving in the enemy's
                        country the utmost circumspection and vigilance is necessary for the safety
                        of the army and the success of the great object it has to accomplish,
                        depends upon the observance of the most rigid discipline. The Lieutenant
                        General Commanding, therefore, most earnestly appeals to the gallant
                        officers and men of his command, who have attested their bravery and
                        devotion to the cause of their country on so many battle fields, to yield a
                        ready acquiescence in the rules required by the exigencies of the case.</p>
                    <p>All straggling and marauding from the ranks, and all marauding and plundering
                        by individuals are prohibited, upon pain of the severest penalties known to
                        the service.</p>
                    <p>What is required for the use of the army will be taken under regulations to
                        be established by the Commanding General, according to the usages of
                        civilized warfare.</p>
                    <p>Citizens of the country through which the army may pass, who are not in the
                        military service, are admonished to abstain from all acts of hostility, upon
                        the penalty of being dealt with in a summary manner. A ready acquiescence to
                        the demands of the military authorities will serve greatly to lessen the
                        rigors of war. By command of</p>
                    <p>Liet. Gen. R. S. Ewell, <br>A. L. Pendleton, A. A. Gen.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing was issued before Ewell entered Chambersburg. On the 23d a
                        portion of his command reached this place, and on the 24th the General
                        arrived, and immediately issued the following:</p>
                    <p>
                        Headquarters 2d Corps
                        <br>
                        Army of Northern Virginia, June 22.
                        <br>
                        Chambersburg, June 24, 1863.
                    </p>
                    <p>General Orders.--1. The sale of intoxicating
                        liquors to this command, without written permission from a Major General, is
                        strictly prohibited.</p>
                    <p>2. Persons having liquor in their possession are required to report the fact
                        to the Provost-Marshall or the nearest general officer, stating the amount
                        and kind, that a guard may be placed over it, and the men prevented from
                        getting it.</p>
                    <p>3. Any violation of Part I. of these orders, or failure to comply with Part
                        II., will be punished by the immediate confiscation of all liquors in the
                        possession of the offending parties, beside rendering their other property
                        liable to seizure.</p>
                    <p>4. Citizens of the country through which the army may pass, who are not in
                        the military service, are admonished to abstain from all acts of hostility,
                        upon the penalty of being dealt with in a summary manner. A ready
                        acquiescence to the demands of the military authorities will serve to lessen
                        the rigors of war. By command of</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Gen. R. J. Ewell. <br>A. S. Pendleton, A. A. General.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the orders of both Lee and Ewell, there were numerous
                        instances of wanton injury to property and outrages committed upon citizens.
                        Gen. Lee reached this place on the 27th, and was doubtless informed that a
                        portion of his army was disregarding his instructions, and he at once issued
                        another order, as follows:</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army Northern
                        Virginia,<br>Chambersburg, Pa., June 27, 1863.</p>
                    <p>General Orders No. 73.--The Commanding General has
                        observed with marked satisfaction the conduct of the troops on the march,
                        and confidently anticipates results commensurate with the high spirit they
                        have manifested.</p>
                    <p>No troops could have displayed greater fortitude, or better performed the
                        arduous marches of the past ten days.</p>
                    <p>Their conduct in other respects has, with few exceptions, been in keeping
                        with their character as soldiers, and entitles them to approbation and
                        praise.</p>
                    <p>There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness on the part of some,
                        that they have in keeping the yet unsullied reputation of this army, and
                        that the duties exacted of us by civilization and christianity are not less
                        obligatory in the country of the enemy than in our own.</p>
                    <p>The Commanding General considers that no greater disgrace could befal [sic]
                        the army, and through it, our whole people, than the perpetration of the
                        barbarous outrages upon the unarmed and defenceless, and the wanton
                        destruction of private property, that have marked the course of the enemy in
                        our own country.</p>
                    <p>Such proceedings not only degrade the perpetrators and all connected with
                        them, but are subversive of the discipline and efficiency of the army, and
                        destructive of the ends of our present movement.</p>
                    <p>It must be remembered that we make war only upon armed [illegible] and that
                        we cannot take vengeance for the wrongs our people have suffered without
                        lowering ourselves in the eyes of all whose abhorrence has been excited by
                        the atrocities of our enemies, and offending against Him to whom vengeance
                        belongeth, without whose favor and support our efforts must all prove in
                        vain.</p>
                    <p>The Commanding General therefore earnestly exhorts the troops to abstain with
                        most scrupulous care from unnecessary or wanton injury to private property,
                        and he enjoins upon all officers to arrest and bring to summary punishment
                        all who shall in any way offend against orders on this subject.</p>
                    <p>R. E. Lee, General.</p>
                    <p>The only other order issued in this valley relating to the conduct of the
                        rebel army, was issued in the form of an address to the citizens of York, to
                        impress the people of that ancient village of the sublimated magnanimity of
                        the rebel commander. It was as follows:</p>
                    <p>To the Citizens of York: I have abstained from burning the railroad building
                        and car shops in your town, because, after examination, I am satisfied the
                        safety of the town would be endangered; and, acting in the spirit of
                        humanity, which has ever characterized my Government and its military
                        authorities, I do not desire to involve the innocent in the same punishment
                        with the guilty. Had I applied the torch without regard to consequences, I
                        would have pursued a course that would have been vindicated as an act of
                        just retaliation for the many authorized acts of barbarity perpetrated by
                        your own army upon our soil. But we do not war upon women and children, and
                        I trust the treatment you have met with at the hands of my soldiers will
                        open your eyes to the monstrous iniquity of the war waged by your Government
                        upon the people of the Confederate States, and that you will make an effort
                        to shake off the revolting tyranny under which it is apparent to all you are
                        yourselves groaning.</p>
                    <p>J. A. Early, Maj.-Gen. C.S.A.</p>
                    <p>Rebel Court Martial.</p>
                    <p>The discipline of the rebel army was admirable. No private or subaltern dared
                        to disregard an order in presence of his superior, or where his superior
                        officer was likely to be advised of it. When the rebel columns filed through
                        Chambersburg, they marched with the utmost order and decorum, and laughing,
                        talking loudly or singing was not indulged in. That this was the result of
                        the strictest discipline rather than an indication of the good breeding of
                        the infantry rank and file, is evident from the fact that whenever a squad
                        could get isolated from their officers or commanders, they would rob
                        mercilessly and commit all manner of outrages. When rebel officers behave
                        badly, they do not dismiss them, but reduce them to the ranks, as in the
                        case of Lieut. J. B. Countiss, given below. The following order, issued by
                        Gen. Ewell, exhibits the proceedings of several cases tried by Court Martial
                        at Ewell's headquarters near the Birch Church north of Chambersburg:</p>

                        effect.</p>
                    <p>By command of <br>Lieut. Gen. R. S. Ewell. <br>A. S. Pendleton, A. A.
                        General,</p>
                    <p>Our Ladies and the Rebels.</p>
                    <p>Our ladies gave the rebels rather a jolly time while they were here. They did
                        not imitate the wives and daughters of the chivalry by spitting in the faces
                        of soldiers, poisoning their meat and drink, flaunting flags in their faces,
                        and unsexing themselves generally; but they did give them rather an
                        unwelcome taste of their heroism and strategy. One lady took her chickens
                        from the rebels after they had killed them, and dined sumptuously at home at
                        least one day under rebel rule. Another arrested Dr. Todd in his insolence
                        by informing him in rather an earnest manner that further searches in her
                        house would result in the splitting of his head with her hatchet. The
                        valiant Doctor subsided. Another amused herself by running rebel deserters
                        out of the lines dressed in hoops and calico; and generally our ladies
                        resented the arrogance of the rebel hosts with such spirit and determination
                        as to astound them. Communication between Chambersburg and Harrisburg was
                        interrupted for ten days, and amongst the many other unreliable reports
                        which reached here was the gratifying information that Gens. Couch,
                        McClellan and Sigel were at Harrisburg with from 80 to 100,000 men, and the
                        intelligence was given to the rebels at every step with all the defiant
                        ardor peculiar to the sex. In many instances our ladies prevented the
                        boldest thieving by resolutely resisting, and shaming the rebels out of
                        their purpose.--Those who shall be so fortunate as to return to Virginia
                        will carry with them the liveliest appreciation of the heroism and
                        intelligence of Pennsylvania ladies.</p>
                    <p>Rebel Ideas of the North.</p>
                    <p>Some of the border State, and most of the more southern rebels, have rather
                        peculiar conceptions of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Quite a number were
                        astonished to find our people speaking English, as they supposed that the
                        prevalent language was the German. At first when they attempted derisive
                        remarks, they would imitate the broken English of the Germans; and judging
                        from Ewell's demand for 25 bbls. of sourkraut at a season when it is unknown
                        in any country, even the commanding officers must have considered our people
                        as profoundly Dutch. It would require an intensely Dutch community to supply
                        sourkraut in July. Our farm buildings and especially our large and fine
                        barns all through the valley, at once excited their astonishment and
                        admiration. Quite a number of officers visited the barn of the Editor as a
                        matter of curiosity, although there are many in our valley much larger and
                        quite as well finished. The private soldiers generally concluded that it
                        must be the church of some very large denomination in this community; and
                        [illegible] out-building about it, such as chicken-[illegible], hog-pen,
                        carriagehouse, &amp;c., were generally supposed to be servant's houses,
                        and very neat ones!</p>
                    <p>Rebel Pretext For Stealing.</p>
                    <p>Clean as Gen. Lee kept his record by his humane orders, his army did the most
                        gigantic and systemic stealing. They stole everything they could possibly
                        use, or hope to use; and when their little remnant of shame compelled them
                        to offer some apology for it, they invariably answered that our troops had
                        done so and much more in their country. Every rebel who wanted to steal a
                        chicken or a hat, or a watch, insisted that he was a most generous and
                        humane conqueror--that his home had been burned down over the heads of his
                        family by the Yankees, while he generously spared our homes from the torch.
                        Dirty, lousy, thieving whelps who had scarcely ever seen a house at home,
                        much less owned one, and who are despised in the south even by the slaves as
                        "poor white trash" declared with one accord that they had been burned out of
                        house and home by the "d----d yankees." Armed with this excuse, they flung
                        the lie into everybody's face until it became a standing joke of the boys,
                        and was treated with scorn by our people generally. Even the scanty
                        wardrobes of the negro famlies [sic] were appropriated by the chivalry by
                        way of demonstrating their elected and humane views of war.</p>
                    <p>Keeping Rebel Spirits Up.</p>
                    <p>Never was an army more confident and jubilent [sic] than were the rebels
                        while in Chambersburg; and the officers evidently appreciated the necessity
                        of keeping their hopes up to the highest point. The Richmond papers were
                        received almost daily during their stay, and the men were inspired by the
                        sensation, lies published representing rebel success in almost every portion
                        of the South; and the universal demand made by the rebel press for a general
                        devastation of the North, induced the soldiers to believe that as soon as
                        their lodgment was made safe, they would be at liberty to occupy or sack our
                        homes at pleasure. One edition of the Richmond papers received here
                        announced that Gen. Johnson had defeated Gen. Grant and raised the siege of
                        Vicksburg. It was read to the army while on parade and they cheered
                        themselves horse over their imaginary triumph. They were inspired by every
                        conceivable falsehood. Not a rebel in the ranks doubted that he had from
                        125,000 to 150,000 men, while he had not over 80,000 all told; and they were
                        all firmly convinced that they had eluded Gen. Meade's army, and that it was
                        in search of them in the valley of Shenandoah, while nothing but the militia
                        stood between them and Harrisburg, Baltimore and Washington. Their rather
                        sudden retreat from York and Carlisle threw a shadow of doubt over their
                        high expectations, and their confidence was not strengthened any by the
                        defiant and jublant [sic] tone of our people who confronted them at every
                        step with the assurance that they were marching to defeat and many to death.</p>
                    <p>Burning of Stevens' Furnace.</p>
                    <p>The only private property destroyed by the order of an officer in this valley
                        was the extensive Iron Works of Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, [illegible] miles
                        east of this place. They consisted of a large charcoal Furnace, Forge,
                        Rolling-Mill, coal-house, shops &amp;c. On Tuesday the 23d a portion of
                        Jenkin's cavalry came upon the works by an unfrequented mountain road from
                        Hughes' works, and demanded the horses, and especially the two riding
                        horses, which they described. They threatened that they would destroy the
                        building if the horses were not given up. Mr. Sweeney, who has charge of the
                        works, agreed to deliver up the riding horses if the property would be
                        protected. This they agreed to, but on going for the riding horses they met
                        the teamsters and compelled them to produce all the horses and mules, nearly
                        forty in all with gears, harness &amp;c. They had evidently been
                        minutely informed of the whereabouts of Mr. Steven's horses, as they
                        described them and knew exactly where to go after them. The day after, Gen.
                        Early rode up to the works accompanied by his staff and vowed his intention
                        to destroy them. Mr. Sweeney reminded him that he would inflict a much more
                        serious injury upon some hundred poor laborers who worked there than upon
                        Mr. Stevens. Gen. Early replies that Mr. Stevens was "an enemy of the South,
                        in favor of confiscating their property and arming their negroes, and the
                        property must be destroyed." He then placed a guard around it and gave
                        special instructions that it should not be destroyed until he gave the
                        order. He seemed exceedingly fearful that he might miss the delightful
                        spectacle of Mr. Stevens' works in flames. He then returned to Greenwood,
                        where he had his head-quarters, but returned the next day, and personally
                        detailed Col. French, of Jenkin's guerrillas, with his command to illustrate
                        southern chivalry and humanity by applying a torch to the private property
                        of Mr. Stevens because he was guilty of the crime of defending the Republic
                        of our fathers. The work of destruction was well done, and soon all the
                        works were in ashes. The houses occupied by families were not fired. Some
                        $3,000 worth of charcoal was destroyed, 7,000 lb. bacon stolen, leaving the
                        families of the laborers without food, in spite of the earnest
                        representations made by Mr. Sweeney as to their necessitous condition. Mr.
                        Stevens [illegible] is not less than $50,000. He is the only one in
                        Pennsylvania who has been thus honored by the vandals for his unflinching
                        devotion to Freedom.</p>
                    <p>Rebel Inquiries Vary.</p>
                    <p>When the rebel horde first entered the State flushed with the hope of early
                        victories on the [illegible] and boundless plunder in Harrisburg,
                        Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington they would yell insolently at every
                        man or woman they met--"Well Yank, how far is Harrisburg?" "How far to
                        Baltimore?" "What's the charge at the Continental?" "How do you like our
                            return to the Union?" "Which is the way to
                        Washington?" "How do you like Lincoln's Devils?" These and similar inquiries
                        were made with a degree of arrogance and confidence that clearly betokened
                        their expectations to see, as conquerors, all the cities named during their
                        stay. When, however, their shattered and bleeding columns commenced their
                        retreat on Saturday after battle, there was but one inquiry made alike by
                        officers and men--"How far to the Potomac?" "How far to the Potomac?" And
                        thus their broken, decimated ranks straggled along the mountain passes,
                        grasping for the last hope left them--the Potomac! Three days of deadly
                        strife with the foe they effected to despise, turned their backs upon their
                        homes already desolated by their wanton, wicked war!</p>
                    <p>Rebel Ideas of Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>Even intelligent rebel officers insisted that Lincoln was a fugitive in
                        Boston and dare not occupy his capital, and the rank and file were regaled
                        with that and equally absurd falsehoods. Others declared that he was
                        habitually intoxicated and unable to attend to his official duties because
                        of his intemperance. Those men were evidently taught to regard President
                        Lincoln as brutal and barbarous in an eminent degree, and they were amazed
                        to find the loyal of all parties alike respecting him and the Government.</p>
                    <p>Their Vandalism Falls Upon Themselves.</p>
                    <p>There was quite an assortment of Hospital goods here when the rebels came,
                        most of which they wantonly destroyed--breaking up the bed frames and
                        tearing the clothes. When they left for Gettysburg they left a number of
                        their sick in the school-house in charge of a young rebel medical student
                        with the charities of the people of our town to depend upon for subsistence,
                        medicines, &amp;c. Subsequently a number of their wounded were captured
                        and brought here and the vandalism of their troops fell upon their own sick
                        and wounded, as we were without the necessary supplies to make them
                        comfortable. After robbing all our drug stores, our physicians had to
                        furnish medicines for their sick and wounded.</p>
                    <p>Pryor and Piety.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Pryor, father of the blustering Gen. Roger A. Pryor, who didn't fight Potter when in Congress, was with Lee
                        as chaplain and seemed to have a general supervision of the piety of the
                        army. He represented the progress of religion as eminently satisfactory, and
                        seemed to regard the rebels as perfectly Cromwellian in morals. True they
                        would steal negroes and from Negroes, and anything else from a ten-penny
                        nail to a six horse team; but they were nevertheless a model army, according
                        to Pryor, in all the attributes of christian character. Our people generally
                        thought that the scale of Zion must be very low down South.</p>
                    <p>Heavy Loss of Live Stock.</p>
                    <p>Mr. David Brandt, residing near town, was taken and held prisoner by the
                        Rebels near Williamsport, on Sunday, the 5th inst. Being released on
                        Thursday, he returned home and informed us that the Rebels attempted to
                        drive 700 head of cattle and 1000 head of sheep across the Potomac on
                        Monday, but owing to the great height of the river, all the stock was
                        drowned except 12 of the cattle.</p>
                    <p>Some Enterprising Doings of the Rebs.</p>
                    <p>The Rebs performed some exploits while in our town and vicinity of an
                        exceedingly chivalric character. As Ewell's corps was about entering town, a
                        young man was compelled by certain parties to give up his watch. Rev. Dr.
                        Schneck was met near town, while one of the Corps were on the march, by two
                        persons wearing the brilliant uniform of Reb Soldiers, and threatened with
                        instant death if he did not at once surrender his watch and his money. The
                        amount taken was $50, and the watch was of great value, a highly prized gift
                        from some of the Doctor's friends when he visited Germany some years ago.
                        Reb. Father Cullom was also robbed of his watch and a sum of money upon a
                        peremptory demand. As the Rebs didn't seems to be entirely proficient in the
                        command to "make time," they evinced good judgment in stealing watches to
                        "make time" for them. Their hatred of "Abe Lin corn" was exhibited in the
                        alacrity with which they sole "greenbacks," containing the said "Abe's"
                        portrait and certain emblems of the Government over which he presides, and
                        holding on to them with the tenacity of leeches.</p>
                    <p>A most brilliant performance was stealing a pipe out of the mouth of our
                        venerable friend, Mr. John Noel, with the remark that he had smoked it long
                        enough. The circumstance gave the old gentleman ample opportunity to express
                        his opinion emphatically on the Rebs and
                        Rebeldom, and, with certain threats he succeeded in getting his pipe back.</p>
                    <p>A number of intelligent and enterprising Rebels declared that the statue of
                        Franklin surmounting the cupola of our Court House was intended to represent
                        "Ole Pete Lincorn," and expressed their determination to destroy it. Their
                        vandalism upon it, however, they failed to execute.</p>
                    <p>The skill of the Rebs in stealing hats from the heads of citizens was
                        admirable and would be sufficient to establish a high character for any
                        thief in the land. Approaching a citizen, they would steal his hat while in
                        the act of interrogating him, or as he was uttering a reply. It may be also
                        stated that some of our people were compelled to sit down while the Rebels
                        stole boots and shoes from their feet.</p>
                    <p>These are only a few minor exhibitions of Reb "refinement, gentility and
                        enterprise." For evidence of what they did on a large scale, our readers
                        need but see our depleted stores, the ruins of the railroad buildings, and
                        the miles of torn and burned railroad track. Nearly every farmer in the
                        whole valley sustained losses in stock almost irreparable, and hardly a
                        citizen but has suffered to a more or less extent.</p>
                    <p>Murder of Mr. Strite.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Strite, a peaceful and inoffensive citizen was cruelly murdered by some
                        of the Reb soldiers of Hill's corps on his farm located near the Greencastle
                        road, three miles from town. He was standing in his yard, when three of the
                        villains approached him and demanded his money. He immediately surrendered
                        it. Soon after two more men came to him making a similar demand. The
                        murderers buried his body in a dung heap, and then fled. Mr. Strite leaves a
                        large family. The shocking manner of his death occasioned the most profound
                        indignation wherever it becmae [sic] known.</p>
                    <p>Another Heroic Act.</p>
                    <p>We learn that Mr. Fisher, residing on the Warm Spring Road, a few miles from
                        town, was shamefully beaten and robbed, and is now in a critical condition.</p>
                    <p>Paroles.</p>
                    <p>Major Adams, 1st N.Y. Cavalry, paroled a large number of invalid Rebs here in
                        the School House Hospital on Sunday, the 5th instant.</p>
                    <p>Rebs in our County Prison.</p>
                    <p>A large number of Rebs, captured on the road leading from town, were
                        quartered during the last week in our county prison, and removed in parties
                        at times under strong guard to Harrisburg. The party sent off on Friday
                        numbered 214. Many of them expressed an earnest desire to take the oath of
                        allegiance, but the military authorities failed to gratify them. The
                        opportunity will, no doubt, be afforded them to give this evidence of
                        returning sense and loyalty at the proper time and place.</p>
                    <p>Bombardment of Carlisle.</p>
                    <p>The only engagement beyond the skirmishing of scouts in the Cumberland Valley
                        was at Carlisle. Gen. Lee had recalled his troops from York, Carlisle and
                        other points North to join him at Gettysburg. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, with his
                        division of Cavalry had crossed from Hanover Station to join Gen.[illegible]
                        at Carlisle, but when he reached that point he found Gen. Smith in the town
                        with several thousand Union troops. Lee was evidently disconcerted, and in
                        order to lead Gen. Smith to suppose that he had purposely advanced to engage
                        him, and thus enable him to make his escape should Smith's force be very
                        large, he at once demanded an immediate surrender of the town. This Gen.
                        Smith emphatically refused; and when a second demand for his surrender was
                        sent him he notified Lee that he would receive no more such communication
                        from him. Twenty minutes were generously allowed
                        by the son of the rebel commander-in-chief for women and children to get out
                        of the town. Of course but few got away as it was after night, and the
                        chivalric Lee opened his guns upon the town. He threw nearly two hundred
                        shells, most of which did not explode, and but little damage was done.
                        Several houses were penetrated, but none of the citizens were injured. Lee
                        then retreated to witness his father's Waterloo at Gettysburg.</p>

                    <p>The Battle of Gettysburg.</p>
                    <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer, of the 7th inst.,
                        contains the only detailed description of the battle of Gettysburg on
                        Wednesday that has come to hand. The correspondent says:</p>
                    <p>To-day, and on Pennsylvania soil, has been fought one of the most desperate
                        and bloody battles of this accursed rebellion.</p>
                    <p>We have attacked a force honestly our superior in
                        numbers--a force not worn down with nineteen days of rapid marching in heat
                        and rain, dust and mud--and one splendidly positioned and entrenched.
                        Against all these advantages a portion of our war-worn, battle-scarred
                        veterans struggled, never flinching or skulking from any duty assigned them,
                        but making desperate bayonet charges, rushing to the very jaws of death, and
                        although suffering severely yet have they managed to seriously cripple the
                        enemy, and at the same time retain possession of the town of Gettysburg,
                        which they sought to repossess.</p>
                    <p>This morning, early, the First and Eleventh corps, which had been during the
                        night encamped near Emmettsburg, advanced, the First corps marching in the
                        following order: First division under Gen. Wadsworth; Third division, Gen.
                        Doubleday; these followed by five full batteries under Col. Wainwright;
                        bringing up the rear was the really splendid division of Gen. Robinson; this
                        corps having been in the advance during the whole time of our march from
                        Falmouth, were the first to come up with and fight the enemy.</p>
                    <p>During the day this corps had been under the direction of Major-Gen.
                        Doubleday, Gen. Reynolds being in command of the right wing, comprising the
                        First, Third, Eleventh and Twelfth Corps.</p>
                    <p>When some three miles from town, and while quietly marching along, the sound
                        of heavy and rapid cannon firing was heard coming from the direction beyond
                        Gettysburg. Almost at the same instant Captain Mitchell, a gallant aid upon
                        Gen. Reynold's staff, came dashing down the road with orders to the various
                        division commanders, to push forward their divisions as rapidly as possible.
                        The order was given to double-quick, which was
                        instantly obeyed, and kept up until the intervening space, where our
                        batteries were engaged, was passed over. These batteries, two in number,
                        were a part of the artillery belonging to Gen. Buford's division, and were
                        stationed some half a mile to the south of the Gettysburg Theological
                        Seminary, while the opposing forces were stationed and snugly entrenched
                        upon the east side of Marsh Creek, and about the same distance from the
                        Seminary as were our own troops.</p>
                    <p>The latter was the first to open fire, and were for a time compelling our
                        batteries to retire from their position. This they were quietly doing and in
                        good order, when the division of Gen. Wadsworth came to their support, the
                        two able regiments, the Second Wisconsin and Twenty-fourth Michigan, rushing
                        up and driving from in front of them the infantry force who were making
                        desperate efforts to capture the pieces. When these supports arrived, the
                        batteries again took up a commanding position, which they were enabled to
                        hold during the day.</p>
                    <p>In rear of the position so taken up, and to the right, the division of Gen.
                        Wadsworth were drawn up in line of battle, with the division of Gen.
                        Robinson holding the second line. At the moment that these formations were
                        completed, the rebels, emboldened by their partial success in driving from
                        position the batteries, attempted another charge, with the object of seizing
                        the pieces, when the brigades of the Second division, with fixed bayonets,
                        made a charge upon them, and such as were not killed were taken prisoners.
                        Two entire regiments--a Tennessee and Mississippi regiment--were then
                        "bagged."</p>
                    <p>Immediately after the arrival and going into position of the First Corps, the
                        Eleventh, under the able and brave Gen. Howard, who had been in the rear and
                        marching on the same road as the First, made their appearance, marched
                        directly through the town, and at once formed a line of battle on the right
                        of the Chambersburg road, and some half a mile west of the College, which is
                        located at the extreme end of the town. After some three hours of artillery
                        dueling, the rebels commenced to retire. There were massed the two infantry
                        corps, and in this formation a pursuit of their retreating column was
                        commenced.</p>
                    <p>After driving them back toward the mountain, something over a mile, soon
                        after four o'clock it was discovered that with an extensive force of
                        infantry and cavalry they were endeavoring to turn our left flank, with a
                        view, probably, to get between us and our supply trains. Upon this being
                        noticed, and it being evident that our reinforcements, the Third and Twelfth
                        Corps, who had been anxiously inquired after during the entire day, were not
                        yet up, no alternative was offered us than to retire to the east of the town
                        and take up a better position upon the top of a hill, and along the line of
                        road leading to Emmettsburg. This was done, but in admirable order, no
                        unusual haste being apparent, while, at the same time, all ammunition and
                        supply wagons as were up to the front were sent to the rear.</p>
                    <p>A little after 4 o'clock, the Third Corps, under command of Gen. Sickles,
                        came upon the field, and went into position upon the left of that field
                        early in the morning by the First Corps; the Twelfth, under Gen. Slocum, as
                        well arrived about the same time, and were stationed upon the right of the
                        Eleventh Corps. After these two corps, as well as those who "had borne the
                        heat and burden of the day" were formed in "battle array," they made an
                        advance, and but with little resistance succeeded in driving the rebels from
                        the town, and back into the positions they first occupied early in the
                        morning. In this manner and in these locations both armies are resting for
                        the night.</p>
                    <p>The Battles of Thursday and Friday.</p>
                    <p>From the Herald's  account we condense the
                        following details of the great battles of Thursday and Friday at Gettysburg:</p>
                    <p>On Thursday evening the enemy sought to gain possession of the hills south of
                        Gettysburg, held by the Third Corps, under Sickles. The attacking force was
                        composed of Longstreet's and Hill's Corps, consisting of the brigades of
                        Graham, Ward and De Trobriand and the heroes of Chancellorsville, with
                        Clark's New Jersey battery, were first in position, and were compelled to
                        meet the first assault alone and unsupported, although completely
                        overwhelmed, and subjected to a fire of musketry and artillery that never
                        was equaled in this or any other war. This latter division held their ground
                        bravely, and fought as veterans only can fight; but they could not be
                        expected to stand long against such fearful odds, and soon were forced to
                        fall back. They were then joined by Sykes' division of the Fifth Corps, and
                        Humphrey's of the Third, Berry's old division, formerly Hooker's; and being
                        heavily re-inforced with artillery, again advanced and renewed the contest.
                        The enemy deployed regiment after regiment, gradually extending his lines
                        along the base of the hills on our flanks.</p>
                    <p>Arrival of the Old Sixth Corps.</p>
                    <p>At this time the [illegible] Sixth Corps [remainder of sentence illegible].
                        As the enemy pushed his way across the ridge, they were enabled to open an
                        enfilading fire upon him that determined the fate of the day. Not expecting
                        this fire when they received it, they were thrown into the wildest disorder
                        and fell back in confusion.</p>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania Reserves then advanced and took possession of the mountain
                        crests, which terminated the fighting for that day; and left us masters of
                        the situation; but in gaining this advantage we had made great sacrifices.
                        Our men had been compelled literally to charge up to the cannon's mouth to
                        contend against vastly superior numbers. On all sides our losses were very
                        heavy, and the proportion of field and general officers that fell was beyond
                        precedent. It was in this deadly struggle that Gen. Sickles was wounded, and
                        also General Graham of the same Corps, and here, too, Generals Zook and Weed
                        both sacrificed their lives, leading their respective commands up to the
                        fight.</p>
                    <p>Preparations for Friday's Battle.</p>
                    <p>During Thursday night our army was all brought up, and most desirably
                        disposed by Gen. Meade for the apprehended battle of Friday. At midnight a
                        council of war was held, at which it was determined that the enemy would
                        probably renew the attack at daylight, on the following morning, and that
                        for that day we had better act purely on the defensive. Dispositions were
                        therefore made with this view for the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps to hold the
                        right, with reinforcements of fresh troops expected during the day to act as
                        a reserve; the First and Second the centre, and the Fifth and Sixth the
                        left, with the Third as a reserve.</p>
                    <p>Formation of the Line.</p>
                    <p>The line was formed in this manner during the night, the left resting on the
                        mountains between the Taneytown and Emmittsburg roads, and the left at the
                        base of the mountain, opposite the Cemetery Hill; the line encircling the
                        Cemetery and embracing the upper portion of the town. Our artillery on
                        Cemetery Hill was largely reinforced from the artillery reserve, and
                        earthworks thrown up in front of it. Batteries were also planted on all the
                        commanding positions within the lines, and such of the reserve as was not
                        thus disposed of was held for use in the field where and as occasion
                        demanded it. The dispositions were most admirable made, and reflected the
                        highest credit on the commanding General.</p>
                    <p>During the night Ewell was removed from the rebel right to the left, against
                        our right. The action commenced at daylight, and soon grew furious. The base
                        of the range of hills held by our troops is precipitous, and up the steep
                        slopes the rebel columns were pushed against a fierce artillery fire.</p>
                    <p>Artillery in Full Force.</p>
                    <p>We had more artillery at work than I have known at any time in the operations
                        of this army. The enemy, too, had a large number of batteries at work, in
                        different localities, throwing principally solid shot, with which they
                        endeavored most faithfully to silence our batteries. Thus the roar or cannon
                        was unparalleled, drowning completely the less noisy though no less
                        continuous rattle of musketry that raged along the line. The demonstration
                        was grand and awful. Not less than three hundred cannon were belching forth
                        their thunders, while nearly two hundred thousand muskets were being
                        discharged as rapidly as men hurried with excitement and passion could load
                        and discharge them.</p>
                    <p>Arrival of Reinforcements.</p>
                    <p>At this critical juncture, when our right was sorely pressed and the fate of
                        the day seemed wavering, a considerable portion of fresh troops arrived and
                        were immediately put into line on the right. Where these reinforcements came
                        from, or what they were, I have been unable to learn. They were raw
                        recruits, wearing untarnished uniforms, and bearing arms that were unsullied
                        by use.--But they wheeled into line like veterans. I only relate the general
                        result--we drove the enemy back with terrible slaughter. The woods on the
                        steep slope of that lofty mountain are crowded with mangled corpses to tell
                        of the fierceness of the contest, and in their piles of fallen men, alike
                        national and rebel troops intermixed, fought like heroes. Their coming was
                        fortunate, and their aid determined the event of the battle. No sooner did
                        they commence their work than the enemy commenced to fall back, and from
                        that moment we steadily crowded them until falling back became retreat, and
                        retreat a rout.</p>
                    <p>Another Account. <br>Operations of the Fifth Army Corps.</p>
                    <p>The Fifth Army Corps, General Sykes commanding, has had its share in the
                        great battles fought in front of Gettysburg and the noble victories won.
                        When Wednesday's fight began we were at Union Mills, twenty-three miles from
                        here. We marched all that night, and at daybreak on Thursday were on the
                        battle field. Notwithstanding this long march and no sleep, and a march of
                        twenty-nine miles the day before, the men were in the finest spirits and
                        ready to fight. The men were held in reserve until three P.M., on Thursday,
                        when the rebels endeavored to turn our left.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Barnes' division was sent to counteract this movement, with orders from
                        General Sykes to take his position on the right of the base of Rock Hill,
                        two miles to the left of where they had been lying. When the order came the
                        enemy was making this point the centre of his attack. At double-quick the
                        entire column pressed forward. Battery C, lst New York, Capt. Burnes, and
                        Battery I, 5th U. S. Artillery, Lt. Watson, were already in position,
                        throwing shells into the woods at the base of the hill. From the enemy's
                        batteries came responsive shells, some of which fell among our men, killing
                        and injuring several.</p>
                    <p>The rebel charge threatened for a time to shake the division, but the
                        personal efforts of Col. Vincent held it firm, until a minnie ball broke his
                        thigh.</p>
                    <p>Desperate Courage of Our Officers.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Rice took command of the brigade, and still the work of attack, and
                        resistance, and death was going on. A few minutes developed many heroes. How
                        can I name all? Officers seized the guns and cartridge boxes of dead
                        privates and hurled death and defiance into the ranks of their assailants.
                        Colonels seized their regimental colors, and by the magic of their valor,
                        kept their men from retiring. All the brigades were jointly working to hold
                        the position. Colonel Sweitzer showed the same coolness and bravery in
                        handling his brigade as at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Colonel
                        Tilson was pre-eminently heroic and self-possessed, and Colonel Rice
                        inspirited his brigade with like enthusiasm as that inspirited by Colonel
                        Vincent, while the staff of all did their duty with soldierly fearlessness.
                        Gen. Barnes had his leg grazed by the passing fragment of a shell; Dr.
                        Shiffler, Division Surgeon had his face blackened with the powder of a
                        bursting bomb, and Captain Barnard, Inspector General, the rim of his hat
                        torn off. The rebels rushed right into the midst of our men in the Fourth
                        and Sixty-second Pennsylvania regiments. It was for a time through our
                        counter-scarp of bayonets. It was a hand to hand conflict.</p>
                    <p>Real Fighting with Bayonets.</p>
                    <p>It was from a bayonet thrust that Colonel Jefferds fell. It was in the
                        thickest of the fight. A rebel officer had seized the regimental colors.
                        Col. Jefferds shot the rebel officer dead with his revolver, took the colors
                        in his own hand, reared them aloft and cried out. "Rally round the flag,
                        boys." A rebel bayonet pierced his vitals and he fell dead, his hand still
                        firmly clutching the flagstaff. The man at whose hands he lost his life a
                        moment after lay gasping in death. A bullet from Major Hall's revolver had
                        entered his brain. Conspicuous for gallantry in this hand to hand conflict
                        was Captain Robinson.</p>
                    <p>Tremendous Fury of the Conflict.</p>
                    <p>The conflict raged with fierce and unyielding fury half an hour. The brave
                        Major Lowry, of the Sixty-second Pennsylvania, had been killed and many
                        Captains and Lieutenants lay dead and dying on the field. The bodies of
                        privates are strewn on the ground and in the crevices of the rocks. Col.
                        Prescott had recieved [sic] five wounds, marvelously escaping death.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sykes' old division, Brigadier Gen. Ayers commanding, came to the rescue
                        of the First Division. A few moments more and our left must inevitably have
                        been turned.</p>
                    <p>Battery D, Fifth U. S. Artillery (General Griffin's old battery,) Lieut.
                        Hazlett commanding, and the Third Massachusetts batterp, [sic] Lieut.
                        Walcott, came to our aid. The groups of the First and Second divisions
                        fought side by side. They never fought with greater or more unflinching
                        courage.</p>
                    <p>At six p.m. while the battle was at its height the First and Fifth brigades
                        of the Pennsylvania Reserve corps, recently wedded to the corps, and under
                        command of General Crawford, and respectively commanded by Colonels
                        M'Candless and Frick, were ordered to drive the enemy from Rock Hill. This
                        so called hill, is in magnitude a small mountain and the base was mainly the
                        scene of battle thus described. It is covered with woods interspersed by
                        huge rocks, which grow in size and rigidness as one nears the crest. Its
                        summit commands an extended view of the battle field and the country for
                        miles around. It was a good point of observation and commanding an effective
                        position for artillery.</p>
                    <p>To the hill, up the hill, and on top of the hill the column pressed its way.
                        It was a post of struggle, of peril, of death, to many. The Bucktails, of
                        bravest memory in many great battles, went ahead as skirmishers. The enemy
                        was compelled to retreat before our advance. Our gallant Pennsylvanians
                        would not be driven back. General Crawford took in his own hands the colors
                        of the First Reserve regiment, whose color bearer had been shot down, and
                        carried it till the crest was reached. The men followed fearlessly that
                        flag. General Crawford calling out to them, "Don't let the Bucktails beat
                        you."</p>
                    <p>Ascending the Summit.</p>
                    <p>As the summit was nearly reached, Col. Taylor of the Bucktails, was shot and
                        fell at the head of his regiment. Undismayed by the death of their gallant
                        leader, the Bucktails moved forward and re-formed. On the hill-top they
                        captured three hundred prisoners. In a few moments Hazlett's battery was on
                        the crest, hurling grape and canister among the retreating enemy who now
                        fled down the hill in the wildest confusion.</p>
                    <p>Sickles Wounded.</p>
                    <p>When the gallant general fell his staff ran to his assistance and bore him
                        off the field. He was struck just below the knee by a shell, and his leg so
                        badly shattered that it hung merely by a shred. He was carried to a wheat
                        field in the rear, where amputation was performed under the influence of
                        chloroform.</p>
                    <p>The loss of blood, combined with the effects of the chloroform and his
                        previous physical prostration, caused him to remain insensible for some
                        time, but on rallying he discovered your correspondent and recognized him
                        with a "God bless you," and gain [sic] sank away. Rallying again, he looked
                        in my face and said feebly, "Cook, in this war a man is but a cipher. God
                        rules and directs all for the best."</p>
                    <p>The Bravery of Our Troops.</p>
                    <p>We cannot refrain from keeping steadily in our mind, nor can we keep from
                        alluding to the splendid behavior of our troops during the past four days of
                        incessant engagement with a desperate and determined enemy greatly
                        outnumbering them. With the exception of but one single corps, two brigades
                        of which, however, are entitled to credit, a corps which for the sake of its
                        excellent commander we do not care to mention too harshly, our army have
                        well and nobly performed their parts. The brilliant bayonet charges, where
                        cold steel clashed with cold steel; the many sallies from the slight
                        fortifications, and rushing against the enemy aimed a perfect torrent of
                        shot and shell, grape and canister, are too numerous to be speedily
                        mentioned, but are worth to be classed with the much-talked-of and
                        world-renowned charge of the celebrated six hundred at Balaklava. Nobly have
                        they battled for the cause of freedom, while the blood which has been
                        spilled will still stronger cement the bonds of union, under which we have
                        grown and prospered for nearly a century, while the name of the heroes of
                        Gettysburg will ever be handed down to posterity by the side of those who
                        fought, bled and died at Bunker Hill, Monmouth and Lexington.</p>
                    <p>Order Before Battle.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army of the Potomac, June 30,
                        1863.--The commanding General requests that previous to the engagement soon
                        expected with the enemy, corps and all other commanding officers address
                        their troops, explaining to them the immense issues involved in the
                        struggle. The enemy is now on our soil. The whole country looks anxiously to
                        this army to deliver it from the presence of the foe. Out failure to do so
                        will leave us no such welcome as the swelling of millions of hearts with
                        pride and envy at our army. Homes, firesides and domestic altars are
                        involved. The army has fought well heretofore. It is believed that it will
                        fight more desperately and bravely than ever if it is addressed in fitting
                        terms. Corps and other commanders are authorized to order the instant death
                        of any soldier who fails to do his duty at this hour.</p>
                    <p>By command of Maj. Gen. Meade.</p>

                        Potomac for the glorious result of the recent operations.</p>
                    <p>An enemy superior in numbers and flushed with the pride of a successful
                        invasion attempted to overcome or destroy the army.</p>
                    <p>Utterly baffled and defeated, he has now withdrawn from the contest.</p>
                    <p>The privations and fatigues which the army has endured, and the heroic
                        courage and gallantry it has displayed, will be matters of history to be
                        ever remembered.</p>
                    <p>Our task is not yet accomplished, and the Commanding General looks to the
                        army, for greater effort to drive from our soil every vestige of the
                        presence of the invader.</p>
                    <p>It is right and proper that we should, on a suitable occasion, return our
                        grateful thanks to the Almighty Disposer of Events that in the goodness of
                        His Providence He has thought fit to give victory to the cause of the just.
                        By command of</p>
                    <p>Major eGneral [sic] Meade. <br>(signed.) S. Williams.</p>
                    <p>The New Commander.</p>
                    <p>Major General George G. Meade, the new commander of the Army of the Potomac,
                        was born in Spain, about the year 1815, of American parents. His father was
                        at the time of his birth a very wealthy man, and was residing in Barcelona,
                        Spain, where Captain Meade, now commanding the North Carolina, and the
                        subject of our sketch, were born. The two boys were brought to this country;
                        one was educated for the navy, which he entered in 1826, and the other for
                        the army.</p>
                    <p>George C. Meade entered West Point Military Academy as an appointee from the
                        State of Pennsylvania during September, 1831, and graduated on the 30th of
                        June, 1885, standing number nineteen in his class, which has produced such
                        men as Generals Morel, Naglee, Haupt, Partick, Martindale, Roberts, and
                        others, as well as Postmaster General Montgomery, Blair, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>He was appointed to the army from the District of Columbia and entered the
                        service as brevet second lieutenant of the 3rd Artillery on the first of
                        July, 1824. On the 16th of October, 1835, he resigned his connection with
                        the United States army and was engaged in private pursuits until 1842.</p>
                    <p>On the 19th day of May, 1842, he was reappointed to the United States service
                        as a second lieutenant of Topographical Engineers. In this capacity he
                        joined the troops engaged in the Mexican war. At this time we find the names
                        of his companions in the Topographical Engineer corps were Major Turnbull,
                        Captains Wm. G. Williams, killed at Monterey; Geo. H. Hughes, John
                        McClellan, Thos. B. Luinard, and Joseph E. Johnston (now a rebel general);
                        First Lieutenants Wm. H. Emory (now a General), Jacob E. Blake (killed in
                        Mexico), L. Sitgreaves, W. H. Warner (killed by Indians), E. P. Scammon (now
                        General), and C. N. Hagar; Second Lieutenants John C. Fremont, J. D.
                        Webster, George Thorn, Martin L. Smith, John Pope (now General), Wm. B.
                        Franklin (now General), and Wm. J. Peck.</p>
                    <p>His conduct in Mexico was marked by determination and bravery, and at the
                        battle of Palo Alto he was particularly distinguished, and so mentioned in
                        the official reports. During the several conflicts of Monterey, 21st 22d,
                        and 23d days of September, 1846, he again became distinguished, and for his
                        bravery was breveted a first lieutenant, to date from September 23, 1846.
                        During the month of August, 1851, he was promoted to a first lieutenancy of
                        his corps, and on the 19th of May, 1856, was further promoted to a
                        captaincy, which rank he held at the breaking out of the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>When the rebellion broke out, and President Lincoln called for three hundred
                        thousand volunteers, the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps was raised and placed
                        under the charge of Gen. McCall, as division commander, and Generals
                        Reynolds, Meade, and Ord as brigade commanders. Each of these brigade
                        commanders has nobly distinguished himself during the present war, having
                        all risen to a rank equal with a marshal of France. Gen. Meade was appointed
                        a brigadier general of volunteers, with a commission to date from August 31,
                        1861. He was then placed in charge of the Second brigade of that division,
                        and proceeded to organize it at Tennallytown, near the waters of the
                        Potomac, and in this vicinity wintered during 1861-62.</p>
                    <p>June 18, 1862, he was promoted to a majority in the Engineer corps, which
                        rank he still holds in the newly organized Engineer Corps of the regular
                        army.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th of June, 1862, he took part in the famous battle of
                        Mechanicsville, where Gen. Stonewall Jackson made such a terrible dash upon
                        Gen. McClellan's right wing, and Gens. McCall, Reynolds, and others were
                        taken prisoners. His noble conduct and bravery on this occasion were
                        particularly noticed.</p>
                    <p>The next day he was engaged under Gen. Fitz John Porter in the battle of
                        Gaines' Mill, and was so distinguished that he was nominated for a brevet of
                        lieutenant colonel for distinguished services during that battle. He also
                        took part in some of the subsequent engagements of the seven days' fight.</p>
                    <p>At the battle of New Market Cross Roads he was severely wounded, but, under
                        skillful treatment, he recovered, and almost immediately returned to the
                        army, where he took command of the division until the return of Generals
                        McCall and Reynolds from captivity in Richmond.</p>
                    <p>When the rebels invaded Maryland and Pennsylvania, after the defeats of
                        General Pope's army, General Reynolds, who had commanded the division, was
                        then detached to organize the Pennsylvania militia, and General Meade was
                        placed in command of the division of Pennsylvania Reserves. He led these
                        troops during the eventfully battles of South Mountain and Antietam, and
                        when at the latter battle, Gen. Hooker was wounded and had to leave the
                        field, Gen. Meade for a short time had charge of the Ninth army corps,
                        formerly under Gen. Reno.</p>
                    <p>After Gen. Burnside had been placed in charge of the Army of the Potomac,
                        Gen. Reynolds, who formerly commanded the Pennsylvania Reserves, after the
                        retirement of Gen. McCall, was ordered to command the whole of the 1st Army
                        Corps, and Gen. Meade was formally placed in command of the division of
                        Pennsylvania Reserves. At the battle of Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862,
                        he greatly distinguished himself and his division lost very heavily; the
                        brigade commanders and several field officers being placed hors de combat during the attack on the rebel
                        right. The whole loss of the division was 1,624, being the greatest division
                        loss during the whole of that disastrous fight.</p>
                    <p>On the 15th of December, 1862, two days after this eventful battle, he was
                        ordered to command the 6th Army Corps, formerly under Gen. Fits John Porter
                        and more recently under Gen. Butterfield. To enable him properly to hold the
                        position he was appointed by the President and was regularly nominated to
                        the Senate during January 1863. The Senate making certain objections to the
                        list of appointments, it was revised, and Gen. Meade's name[illegible] sent
                        in by the President. During [illegible] 1863, the Senate, in executive
                        session confirmed the appointment and Gen. Meade took his rank and
                        commission as major general of United States volunteers, from November 29,
                        1862, and assumed the command of the 5th Army Corps.</p>
                    <p>When Gen. Hooker assumed command of the Army of the Potomac, and reorganized
                        the same, he still continued to retain General Meade as the commander of the
                        5th Army Corps, Gen. Butterfield having obtained a position on the staff of
                        the commanding officer. In general orders, dated February 5, 1863, Gen.
                        Meade's name and command is specified accordingly.</p>
                    <p>During the advance upon Chancellorsville, Gen. Meade's corps formed part of
                        the right wing of Hooker's army. The corps started on its march on the 26th
                        day of April, 1863, and arrived at Kelly's Ford on the 28th. The next day it
                        crossed the Rappahannock by that ford, and the Rapidan by Ely's Ford. It
                        then pushed on to Chancellorsville, where it arrived on the 30th, and
                        engaged the skirmishers of the rebels, taking their rifle pits and temporary
                        works.</p>
                    <p>Gen. John Fulton Reynolds.</p>
                    <p>The first great sacrifice in the defense of Pennsyluania [sic] is one of her
                        own distinguished and gallant soldiers--Major Gen. John Fulton Reynolds. He
                        fell on Wednesday morning last, July 1st, near Gettysburg, in the opening of
                        the campaign against the invaders of his native State, and so near to his
                        immediate home that the reports of his guns might have been heard by his
                        sorrowing neighbors.</p>
                    <p>General Reynolds was born in Lancaster, and at the age of seventeen entered
                        the West Point Military Academy as a cadet. He graduated in 1841, when just
                        twenty-one years old, receiving a commission as brevet Second Lieutenant in
                        the Third Artillery. When the Mexican War broke out he was a First
                        Lieutenant in the same regiment, and while serving in that rank won the
                        brevets of Captain and Major, for gallant and meritorious conduct in the
                        battle of Monterey and Buena Vista. Subsequently he was aid-de-camp to
                        General Wool. In 1855 he was promoted to a full captaincy in his regiment,
                        and served with great distinction in the severe battles with the Oregon
                        Indians, in 1856.</p>
                    <p>On the 20th of August, 1861, Captain Reynolds was promoted to the tank of
                        Brigadier General of Volunteers, and took command of one of the three
                        brigades of the Pennsylvania Reserves under Gen. McCall, the other two being
                        under the command of General Meade, who now heads the Army of the Potomac,
                        and General Ord, who has just relieved General McClelland at Vicksburg. With
                        that noble division General Reynolds took part in nearly all the great
                        battles in Virginia, except the disaster at Bull Run. Having gone down to
                        the Peninsula, and marched to the front at Richmond, he was posted with his
                        brigade on the extreme right, and with McCall and Meade, bore the brunt of
                        the first great onslaught on McClellan's army, on the 26th of June, 1863 at
                        Mechanicsville. He took part in all of the seven days battles except
                        Malvern, and the General McCall he was taken prisoner and removed to the
                        city of Richmond. During all those terrible conflicts General Reynolds was
                        distinguished for his courage, skill and brilliant fighting. After his
                        return from Richmond he took command of the whole Division of Pennsylvania
                        Reserves, and led them through their terrible fighting in the disastrous
                        campaign of General Pope. The casualties in "Reynold's Division" in those
                        battles show how bravely they fought, and how resolutely their gallant
                        commander resisted the fiery assaults of Jackson, Ewell and Longstreet.
                        Immediately after the close of that campaign General Reynolds was called to
                        the command of the fifty thousand militia summoned by Governor Curtin for
                        the defense of Pennsylvania, in September, 1862, in which service he earned
                        and received the thanks of this Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>When Lee retreated across the Potomac, General Reynolds being no longer
                        required for the defense of Pennsylvania, he rejoined his command and
                        marched with it through Virginia to Fredericksburg. Here he was advanced to
                        the command of the First Army Corps, having in the meantime been promoted to
                        the rank of Major-General. He led that corps in the bloody and terrific
                        assaults made on the Rebel fortifications at Fredericksburg, on the 13th of
                        December, 1862, and also in General Hooker's Chancellorsville campaign.</p>
                    <p>In all these various grades of service, from fighting his battery of
                        artillery, as a Lieutenant, at Monterey and Buena Vista, to leading a
                        brigade and then a division, and finally marshaling an army corps on the
                        field of battle, General Reynolds always won distinction, and proved himself
                        to be a brave, thorough, accomplished and intrepid soldier. He was just as
                        thorough a gentleman.</p>
                    <p>We have yet but few particulars of the fight in which he fell, but when they
                        shall come to hand we feel assured that they will prove that General
                        Reynolds met his death from chivalrous exposure of his person, while too
                        eagerly seeking the invaders of his native State. His death comes at a
                        critical hour for his country. May she find as true, as brave, and skillful
                        a soldier to take his vacant place.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee's Plans.</p>
                    <p>[From the Richmond Enquirer, July 2.]</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee's army has occupied without resistance, the flourishing town of
                        York, the centre and capital of a great county which is the garden of
                        Pennsylvania situated on the railroad on which Baltimore depends for its
                        supplies, and within fifty miles of that city, almost due north. The
                        intelligence of the capture of Harrisburg is not confirmed, and was at least
                        premature.</p>
                    <p>The plans of Lee are still a secret to our enemies as well as to ourselves;
                        whether he means to strike for Philadelphia or for Baltimore, and in either
                        case to cut off the railroad communication of Washington with the North, as
                        he has already with the West, whether his intention be to establish himself
                        quietly in the richest part of the Keystone State, and make its fertile
                        valleys support his army until he can force Hooker to a battle, perhaps in
                        front of the fortifications of Washington. All this remains a matter of
                        conjecture for the present. One thing, however, is plain: Gen Lee's
                        movements are directed not to indiscriminate plunder and devastation, but to
                        the winning of victory; and victory will leave all Maryland and the best
                        part of Pennsylvania absolutely in his power, to levy regular contributions
                        upon the country, to burn or to ransom the towns and cities at his pleasure,
                        to free Maryland and Baltimore, and strike a blow right at the enemy's head
                        in Washington.</p>
                    <p>It is true the enemy's country deserves no consideration at our hands; to
                        leave it all one waste like the Stony Arabia would be only fitting
                        retribution, but the natural desire to bring home to the foe some portion of
                        that desolation which he has visited upon us must, for the present, give way
                        to the necessities of strategy. In the meantime our good Confederate boys
                        are living like the sons of kings. We wish them a very good appetite, and
                        only apprehend that they will not with to come back to us at all. They will
                        want to settle in that land flowing with milk and honey, where our rose-
                        colored notes will buy six times as much as they do at home, and where men
                        use sugar with their coffee, and coffee with their sugar.</p>
                    <p>The Whig says:</p>
                    <p>The terror of the enemy at the approach of our troops is just as guilt and
                        cowardice should have been expected to manifest at the prospect of
                        punishment. They know that their invasions of us have been attended by the
                        most shocking barbarities and outrages, and they naturally expect
                        retaliation proportionate to [illegible] We sincerely trust that they may
                        not be disappointed. They have chosen to disregard all the humanities of
                        war; substitute the torch for the word; to incite our own slaves to the
                        hellish work of massacre; to make war upon non-combatants upon women and
                        children--the old and the infirm; to openly avow the purpose of destroying
                        the means of subsistence, and creating famine and starvation, and although
                        we cannot retaliate precisely in all respects, yet we can teach them the
                        sharpness and bitterness of a war waged in this spirit, and make them repent
                        in the agony of their suffering the enormous wickedness of which they have
                        been guilty. If General Lee gets Yankeedom fairly on the rack, he should not
                        stay his hand till every sinew in his monstrous carcass is snapped and every
                        bone broken. Men are sometimes made the instruments of Heaven's vengeance;
                        and in punishing such atrocious crimes as have marked this war, in the only
                        way in which they can be adequately punished, and their repetition
                        prevented, it could not be [illegible] that he was doing the work of Him who
                        has said, 'Vengeance is mine.'"[sic]</p>
                    <p>Cui Bono?</p>
                    <p>For what purpose, asks the Savannah Republican is
                        our army marching into the enemy's country? Is it to give the Yankees a
                        taste of war; to inflict upon them, in some measure at least, the terrible
                        calamities which they have scattered broadcast through every portion of our
                        country where they have been able to gain a foothold, or is it that
                        [illegible] feed our army, forage our horses, keep guard for a time around
                        the Yankee cities and towns, and they retire to our side of the line? Is it
                        child's play that we are at, or is it war: war, real, earnest, terrible,
                        such as shall humble our vainglorious foe, destroy his power for harm, and
                        bring him to our feet for peace?</p>
                    <p>There is one thing too evident to be questioned. We have, from the beginning
                        of this revolution, looked more to the opinion of their world, and acted
                        with reference to "what 'Mrs. Grundy' would say," than for the success of
                        our arms and the safety and welfare of our people. Pray what has public
                        opinion benefitted us in this war? Has it raised an arm in our defence or
                        extorted a word of sympathy from any Government abroad? Has it in any way
                        helped us to fight our battles and secure our independence? On the contrary.
                        Has it not positively militated against us, and the neutrality of the world
                        proved under the circumstances a powerful obstacle in our path, and a direct
                        aid to the enemy? Nothing is more evident, and yet we are allowing ourselves
                        to be deterred from duty to ourselves by such flimsy considerations as the
                        ever-changing opinions of nations and men. It is a great mistake, and has
                        proved a fatal one to us thus far in our struggle.</p>
                    <p>We hope, then , that the leaders of our armies will do away with all this
                        sickly sentimentality, and go into the war in real dreadful earnest. Let
                        Yankee cities burn and their field be laid waste. The real native population
                        of the North will never feel its hardship until we carry fire and sword to
                        their own hearthstones. In this way alone can we counterbalance the profits
                        of the war and bring them to their senses.--Charleston

                    <p>The remnant of the heroic Pennsylvania Reserves surpassed, if possible, the
                        accustomed gallantry, at Gettysburg, under the lead of their youthful
                        commander, Gen. S. W. Crawford. The Philadelphia Inquirer of Monday thus records the achievements of this justly
                        famed division:</p>
                    <p>"All will remember that the battle of Thursday was mainly an overwhelming
                        attack of the enemy on the left of our position, and that the brunt of the
                        assault was borne for several hours by the Third Corps, under Sickles, which
                        was at last compelled to give way. He was literally overwhelmed. Then the
                        Fifth Corps and parts of others were moved in, but a portion of the Fifth
                        was turned and driven back, and disaster was imminent. The retreating column
                        came pressing back on the Reserves when Gen. Crawford, seizing a color, rode
                        up and down the line of his Division, keeping his men steady until the way
                        was clear, when he ordered a charge on the advancing and almost victorious
                        enemy. This was executed by the brigade of Col. McCandless and the Ninth
                        regiment of Col. Fisher's brigade. Led by those gallant officers in person,
                        they charged and drove back the enemy when victory was just within their
                        grasp, prevented them from gaining the hills, where our left would have been
                        turned, and where they in a few moments more would have been in amongst our
                        trains and in our rear. This charge was witnessed by a large number of our
                        officers, who attest its priceless value, and we have no hesitation in
                        declaring that it saved the army from defeat on that day. That high honor is
                        due to the Reserves, and it should be given without stint.</p>
                    <p>"On Friday the brigade of Col. McCandless and the Ninth, of Fisher's, were
                        the heroes of another gallant action. Holding the position they had so
                        handsomely won, they were again ordered forward. Two brigades of the Rebel
                        General Hood were in possession of the hill called the "Round Top."--These
                        were charged, driven out and flanked by which means the trophies of the day
                        were augmented by a stand of colors, one twelve-pounder cannon, three
                        caissons, and one hundred prisoners. But more than that, the honor of the
                        army was saved by the recapture of more than six
                            thousand stands of arms, which the enemy had taken the previous
                        day, and by the restoration to our own lines and the care of our own
                        surgeons of an immense number of wounded men.</p>
                    <p>"The Reserves were fighting on the soil of their dear old State, and noble as
                        were the deeds, they had done before, they were eclipsed by their conduct at
                        Gettysburg. Their services in that important battle, and the fact that they
                        saved the fortunes of the day at a most critical period of that battle
                        should not be for a moment overlooked, nor should the names of General
                        Crawford, Colonel McCandless and Colonel Fisher be omitted from the front
                        rank of the heroes of that memorable field."</p>

<b>The Invasion Ended! Lee Retreats Across The Potomac!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    <p>Chambersburg, July 14--2 P.M.</p>
                    <p>Official information has just been received at the head-quarters of Gen.
                        Couch that Gen. Lee completed his pontoon bridge at Williamsport yesterday,
                            and crossed his entire army over the Potomac last
                            night.</p>
                    <p>Most of his artillery was got over safely, but considerable of his baggage
                        and a number of his horses were lost in the river. Part of his army and
                        trains forded the river, so great was Lee's haste to retreat, and the loss
                        of wagons and horses was heavy.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Kilpatrick entered Williamsport this morning with his Cavalry, and the
                        entire line of the Potomac is now held by the Union troops.</p>
                    <p>Thus ends the second and last rebel Invasion. Gen. Lee came upon loyal soil
                        this time with the finest army the so-called Confederacy ever possessed, and
                        it retreats upon its own desolated soil with its columns broken, its numbers
                        reduced nearly if not quite one-half, by deaths, wounds, captures and
                        desertions in the brief space of thirty days!</p>

                    <p>The day dawns brightly upon the Old Republic! After two years of mingled

                        to us and to posterity the Free Institutions of the Western World! Let Him

                    <p>--The usual programme for the celebration of our National Holliday, [sic]
                        owing to "peculiar circumstances" could not be fully observed on its late
                        recurrence in our town. We missed the brilliant processions and joyous faces
                        of the children of our various Sabbath Schools, and the old fishing parties
                        and hilarious assemblages, of former years. Reb occupation of our beautiful
                        valley and the extensive patronage of a certain character which our
                        "Southern brethren" had bestowed for ten days previous on our people, with
                        their constant threats of wholesale destruction of the town almost drove
                        from our minds that we were to have a 4th of July this year in its National
                        sense. However, Saturday morning dawned upon us with the ringing of the
                        bells of the different churches and public buildings, and a short time
                        before noon, the National ensign floated from a temporary pole in the centre
                        of the Diamond. At 6 P.M. our citizens assembled in front of the Court
                        House. Chief Burgess Hoskinson presided, assisted by those two tried
                        soldiers, Capt's Samuel McKesson and Geo. L. Miles as Vice Presidents.
                        Sergeant J. Porter Brown, who served gallantly in the three and nine months
                        service, was Secretary of the meeting. The organization completed, W. I.
                        Cook read the Declaration of Independence. This was followed by eloquent and
                        patriotic speeches delivered by Hon. Geo. W. Brewer; Wm. Stenger and W. S.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Franklin County has contributed probably a dozen to the rebel army, and two
                        have paid the penalty of death. James Allison, who studied law with Hon.
                        Wilson Reilly some eight years ago, enlisted in Stuart's Cavalry a year or
                        more ago, and was killed at Ball's cross-roads a short time before the
                        battle of Chancellorsville. He was shot through the temple and died
                        instantly. This information was given by the Rev. Charles Boggs, a native of
                        this county, but now a chaplain in the rebel army, when the rebels occupied
                        this place. Hugh Logan, formerly of this county, was a Captain in Stuart's
                        Cavalry, and was here with him in October last. He was overtaken in
                        Hagerstown last Saturday by our cavalry, and in attempting to escape was
                        shot in the back, the ball passing through the bowels. He was in Hagerstown
                        and alive on Sunday, but no hopes were entertained of his recovery. They
                        will no be widely regretted since they invited death by taking up arms
                        against their government, but they, in their treason, preserved their
                        manhood by openly espousing the traitor's cause.</p>
