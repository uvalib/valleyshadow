                    <p>The leaders of the rebellion, defeated at every point, have resolved in their
                        desperation to exhaust inhumanity in their death-struggle. Never before in
                        the history of civilized warfare, has such a record of brutality been made
                        as has recently marked the career of the insurgents; and now they openly
                        acknowledge it before the world, and plead in extenuation of it their
                        purpose to compel the government to accept their theory of the war; their
                        views of the status of soldiers, and their system for the exchange of
                        prisoners. They now hold some 13,000 Union prisoners--many of them private
                        citizens, arrested and imprisoned without even the pretence that they were
                        spies, or on any other ground subject to capture and confinement by the
                        rules of war. yet they are crowded into loathsome prisons; subjected to the
                        most barbarous treatment at the hands of low officials; fed, as a rule, on
                        most unwholesome food and often insufficient in quantity; and denied almost
                        every article essential to their comfort. Our military prisoners often fare
                        worse, if possible, and the testimony from all sources is concurrent, that
                        they are dying by hundreds from actual starvation, and from disease
                        engendered by the habitual atrocities practiced in every conceivable shape
                        upon them by the subordinate rebel officers.</p>
                    <p>Our government has exhausted its efforts to effect a just and equitable
                        exchange of prisoners, but without success. It has generously offered to
                        postpone the questions in dispute as to negro troops; officers of negro
                        troops, and the alleged return to service, without authority, of the rebels
                        captured at Vicksburg; and exchange man for man and officer for officer
                        until one side or the other should be without prisoners; but this
                        proposition has been declined by the rebel authorities. the last offer made
                        by our government was to exchange 10,000 men, which would leave but few in
                        rebel hands; but they rejected it, and they stand before the world to-day as
                        holding thousands of prisoners of war--recognized by all civilized nations
                        as entitled to humane treatment--for no other reason, than to coerce our
                        government into a partial recognition of the Southern Confederacy in order
                        to rescue our brave soldiers from the horrors of rebel brutality. When the
                        government proposed to send rations to our suffering heroes, the rebel
                        officers quibble first upon one point and then upon another, and finally
                        reject the needed provisions entirely; and when the benevolence of private
                        individuals and christian and sanitary associations demands access to their
                        deadly prisons, they dare not openly reject the proffered humanity, but they
                        deny all agents admission to our prisoners, and manage by arbitrary official
                        regulations to defeat measurably if not wholly the relief intended.</p>
                    <p>Finding, however, that our government cannot be driven from its just purpose,
                        we have hope now that the exchange of prisoners will soon be resumed by the
                        rebels, and that citizen prisoners will shortly be at liberty. The brilliant
                        victory of Gen. Grant at Chattanooga is an argument in favor of the early
                        exchange, and of the humane treatment of prisoners, that can scarcely be
                        unheeded at Richmond. It opens to our army the very heart of Georgia and a
                        most vital point of the remnant of the bogus Confederacy; and unless
                        non-combatants are speedily discharged by the rebels, Gen. Grant has
                        abundance of material in Georgia, in the persons of chivalric planters, to
                        make the rebel authorities glad to recognize the propriety of adhering to
                        the dictates of humanity in the treatment of prisoners. We do not doubt
                        that, unless the exchange of prisoners shall be speedily resumed by the
                        rebels, Gen. Grant will commence such retaliatory measures as must operate
                        like magic upon the rebel leaders. He will not imitate their barbarous
                        vengeance by starving prisoners, or confining them in loathsome prisons to
                        die an hundred deaths by wasting disease; but he doubtless will take
                        prominent rebel citizens and hold them as hostages for our non-combatants
                        now imprisoned without any charges against them whatever; and if necessary
                        to carry retaliation still further, he can, by the accepted rules of war,
                        inflict any punishment upon hundreds of his prisoners lately captured, as
                        they are in the rebel service in insolent violation of their parole at
                        Vicksburg, and their lives are thus forfeited.</p>
                    <p>There is one chapter of rebel atrocity in this war that remains to be
                        written, and we hazard little in saying that when it shall be truthfully
                        portrayed, all other atrocities of the war will pale before it. We refer to
                        their treatment of our negro troops. The rebel leaders have steadily refused
                        to recognize negro troops or their officers as entitled to the treatment of
                        prisoners of war. Various acts of assembly of the insurgent States; an act
                        of the rebel Congress, and several proclamations of Jeff Davis, alike
                        condemn them to the ignominious death of the felon; and it is feared that in
                        many instances they have fulfilled their threatened vengeance.
                        Notwithstanding, their various laws and proclamations, they have not dared
                        to fulfill them so far as to execute officers of negro troops; for they well
                        know that such inhuman butchery could not escape our notice, and when once
                        known, they are well convinced that retaliation would come in the name of
                        Justice and take eye for eye and tooth for tooth with terrible certainty.
                        But our government has no information, and can get none, of the negro
                        soldiers captured by the rebels. Every effort has been made, officially and
                        otherwise, to ascertain the fate of our negro troops captured, but as yet no
                        evidence of their existence can be found. There have been some hundreds
                        captured. At Milliken's Bend, where two negro regiments, by matchless
                        heroism, saved Gen. Grant's lines of communication, a few were
                        captured--principally wounded men; at Banks' unsuccessful assault on Port
                        Hudson, where they won immortal honor by their bravery, many of their
                        wounded and some not wounded fell into the enemy's hands; in Gen. Strong's
                        fatal assault upon Battery Gregg, near Charleston, many of his wounded negro
                        troops were taken, and in various skirmishes and battles in Louisiana and on
                        the Gulf, negro soldiers have been made prisoners by the rebels; and since
                        their capture our government <emph rend="italic">has never heard of
                        them!</emph> Earnest and persistent inquiries have been made by our officers
                        at every point; but all efforts have failed to elicit any information
                        respecting them. The government is well convinced that they have been either
                        brutally murdered, or what is equally revolting, sold into slavery. The
                        fearful reckoning to come upon the rebels from the rebels from this cause
                        has doubtless made them resort to every possible pretext to prevent the
                        exchange of prisoners; for the issue touching negro troops must be met as
                        soon as a general exchange is effected, and they dread to face the
                        government and the world on their own record of inhumanity. But they cannot
                        long delay this terrible retribution. Our government is bound by every
                        consideration of duty; by its plighted faith to its soldiers, regardless of
                        color, to vindicate their rights and avenge their wrongs; and there is no
                        alternative but to demand and take life for life until exact justice is
                        measured out to the remorseless murderers, and humanity is taught them
                        through their fears since it cannot reach them through their conceptions of
                        justice. To this fearful necessity our government is driven by the
                        persistent atrocities of the leaders of this causeless, this wicked war; and
                        when the day of avenging justice comes, we may hope for some measure of
                        humanity thenceforth on the part of the foes of the Republic.</p>
