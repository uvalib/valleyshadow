<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Baltimore American, the ablest journal in
                        Maryland, and one that is not obnoxious to the charge of radicalism, thus
                        earnestly and cogently demands that the destruction of Slavery shall be
                        thorough in the Cotton States as it is confessedly in the Border States.
                        After noticing the fact that the Cotton States had precipitated the Nation
                        into fraternal war; destroyed Slavery on the border and gathered the slaves
                        into the Gulf States, it says:</p>
                    <p>"And now, in view of al this--in view of the wholesale, murderous swindle
                        which the Cotton States have perpetrated in getting their quotas of
                        negroes--the border States beg leave to protect against any peace or
                        cessation of the fight in any shape which leaves the Cotton States to the
                        quiet possession of their ill-gotten spoils. Peace, now, is just what they
                        want. With millions of acres of wild and fertile lands at their command, and
                        this additional force of cheap negroes there, with the poor whites killed
                        off out of the way, and cotton at a high price, they would, indeed, revel in
                        wealth; they would crowd into the most guilty of the Revolutionary States
                        every element of prosperity, such as they never knew in the past. And so it
                        would result that to 'rescue a remnant of Southern slavery' would be the
                        very crowning good fortune over which they would exult, since, although they
                        failed of achieving their so-called 'independence,' they would have
                        accomplished the next most desirable thing--have gotten plenty of negro
                        labor at cheap rates, without re-opening the African Slave Trade, and broken
                        down all competition elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>"Now, we say, make no terms with the Rebellion whatever, except on the naked
                        basis of submission; and let the 'fearful'
                        consequences deprecated fall on those obstinate enough, or stupid enough, to
                        invoke these 'consequences.' Let us have no 'remnant of Slavery' left, even
                        if the conflict continues as much longer as it has already done. And if the
                        President were to cease to direct his blows against the guilty Cotton
                        States, for fear of distressing the enemy, he would hazard, and more, lose,
                        the labor already undergone, and compromise the cause of the Republic and
                        his own fame forever.</p>
                    <p>"Meanwhile, we reiterate the hope and trust that the war may be pushed to the
                        uttermost; and, in urging this, we put in no reserve plea to deal tenderly
                        with the Cotton States. They are the guilty ones,
                        and if the infliction of war, which they invoked and caused, is now coming
                        home to them, all the better, since they proposed, long ago, to make our own
                        and other innocent communities bear the brunt of the conflict. Let the
                        National troops drive these guilty communities, these original
                        revolutionists, into a corner, and, once within control, let such men as
                        Ex-General Toombs have their spoils wrenched from
                        them; let Governor Brown be made to re-consider his former words, 'Go
                        on with your cotton planting, for the war will never reach you!' Let them be
                        made to fell that 'peace,' with Slavery undisturbed there, is no longer
                        practicable; that, as they have broken up Slavery for us, they themselves
                        shall never be permitted in quiet to thrive upon our misfortunes, as now
                        they would gladly do.</p>
                    <p>"But, finally, there is no danger of this. The latest intimations from
                        Washington as to the policy to be observed are conclusive on this point. The
                        President and his advisers will stand firm; and, doing so, the days of
                        Slavery are numbered everywhere. Could Toombs and his fellow-conspirators
                        stop matters just where they are, conceding thus to the far Cotton States
                        the palpable advantages they have gained, could Slavery there remain, we
                        have not a doubt but that they would consider the war, so far, a good
                        speculation in better fitting the Gulf States for the homes of a would-be
                        'aristocracy.' The 'poor whites' are--the bulk of them--dead. They no longer
                        'cumber the ground.' The tragedy the leaders set on foot is a frightful one,
                        and it is still for themselves to say whether it shall be played to the end.
                        And no simpler proposition could be made to relieve them at once than the
                        one already advanced---the one steadily insisted upon by the
                            Government--'Let them lay down their
                    arms."</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A clerical correspondent writes us from the Southern coast protesting against
                        the rapid tendency to amalgamation. He says that he has been called upon to
                        perform the marriage service repeatedly where the bride was mulatto,
                        quadroon or octoroon, and he calls upon Congress to arrest this unnatural
                        mingling of the races, which, to use his own language, "threatens the
                        annihilation of the white race in the United States."</p>
                    <p>We beg our correspondent to quiet his fears on the subject. He cites some
                        half a dozen cases to vindicate his apprehensions; but not one of them
                        presents the union of a northern man with the southern negress. All the
                        happy grooms were either southerners or foreigners, and they have been
                        adopting no novel social system. Slavery has never fastened its desolation
                        on any land without carrying the social evil of amalgamation with it; and
                        the crime has been peculiar to the chivalric and opulent rather than to the
                        lowly. Had our correspondent cast a thought as to the origin of the mulatto,
                        quadroon and octoroon brides of whom he speaks, he might have cherished a
                        reasonable suspicion that amalgamation is not just dawning upon the world,
                        but has blotted and blurred the whole social organization of the South ever
                        since slavery came with its endless train of crime.</p>
                    <p>In the North, where the negro race is free and not the legitimate prey of a
                        brutal master's lust, amalgamation is very rare, and embraces only the most
                        abandoned of both sexes; and we regard the destruction of Slavery as the
                        only hope of dealing a death-blow to that unnatural evil. Slavery has been
                        its parent, its shield, its apologist and stripped it of its hideous moral
                        deformity by bringing virtuous wives and daughters and sensual sons in daily
                        contact with it; and when its great foundation is destroyed, the whole
                        structure of social pollution will fall with it. The remedy is not in
                        Congress, but in the moral tone of the people, and that seems to be
                        progressing well toward a better and brighter Nationality, free from the
                        blistering stains of both legalized and lawless mingling of the distance
                        races of the Continent.</p>
