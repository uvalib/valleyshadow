<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Suggests the formation of local military companies to prevent raids on Franklin County.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>It is not to be disguised that the people of Franklin county have been much exercised during
      the last few weeks, because of the general apprehension that cavalry raids may be made upon
      us, plundering our people of horses, cattle and provender. We consider the apprehension well
      grounded, and unless the people themselves shall take prompt and effective steps to guard
      against such incursions, there can be no doubt about the result. We have had frequent
      complaints from different sections of the county against the government because it has not
      placed a large force upon our border. Such complaints are unreasonable and unjust. What force
      Gen. Couch has about him and at his disposal, it would not be best to state; but if he had
      50,000 men he could not protect the border of the States from rebel raids. It must be
      remembered that there are hundreds of miles of border exposed, all opening into rich valleys,
      and it is an utter impossibility to guard the entire line against well drilled and mounted men
      with daring and skil[l]ful leaders. They might be caught as was Morgan in Ohio and Streight in
      Mississippi; but they have every advantage in such an enterprise, and usually pay no respect
      to armies. Thus Stuart spent three days in Pennsylvania, plundering indiscriminately, during
      which he ran the arc of the circle around a Union army of 100,000 men; and although he was
      never over twenty miles from it, he escaped with his booty. So Stoneman made his grand raid
      around Lee, with rebel soldiers on every side; penetrated into the fortifications of Richmond,
      and returned in safety with his command. So Carter did in Tennessee, Grierson in Alabama, and
      Averill in Western Virginia, and so it will be until the end of the war.</p>
     <p>It is time our people understood that armies are no serious obstacle to cavalry raids. They
      may protect certain points, and by chance capture the raiders, but as a rule, when it is
      important to make a raid, the existence of an army is not deemed an insuperable obstacle. If
      the country be clear of armed citizens, raids can be made almost anywhere, and in spite of
      almost any numbers or the most skil[l]ful generalship. This has been the safety of our cavalry
      when penetrating into the enemy's country. The able bodied men are all in the rebel army, and
      if they only avoid the rebel armies, they have no resistance. So in the North, although
      abounding with able bodied men, they have been unorganized and unarmed, and could offer no
      obstacles.</p>
     <p>There is but one way to prevent raids, and in that one way they can be
       most effectually prevented. Cavalry detachments cannot penetrate a densely populated
      country like ours if the citizens are organized and armed. If we had 2,500 men organized in
      Franklin county, with experienced leaders such as we have in abundance in every district, and
      with their muskets and well filled cartridge-boxes at home, ready to fill up their company
      ranks as soon as a rebel should cross the Potomac, and to offer resistance in every locality
      where marauding parties should appear, there would be no raids attempted upon us. No raid
      could be made with such organizations assailing it at every step, for the contest would be too
      unequal and deadly. Every thicket, every hollow, every pass, would be fruitful of death, and
      the assailants could protect themselves almost entirely in such warfare. No rebel cavalry
      officer would dare to enter Franklin county if he knew that in every district there were
      experienced officers with well armed bands ready to cut him off and assail him from every
      shelter; but if Gen. Couch had 50,000 men in his Department, and the citizens unorganized and
      unarmed, Gen. Stuart would not hesitate an hour to traverse portions of our county, and he
      would have every advantage in the way of escape.</p>
     <p>Copperheads are ever ready to whisper in the ears of our people that the government is
      neglecting us; that without troops we are at the mercy of rebel plunderers; and loyal men are
      appealed to in every way to desert the government and throw themselves into the arms of
      traitors. We ask our people to look at the history of this war, and a little reflection will
      satisfy any honest, unprejudiced mind, that unless troops should be encamped immediately about
      him, they can afford no protection against raids. If we would not be plundered this fall, we
      must put every able-bodied man in a military company under tried soldiers--have them well
      armed and supplied with ammunition, and ready to fly to arms the moment a foe enters the
      county. If this be done promptly no rebel raids will be attempted--if it be not done, the
      whole Army of the Potomac could not cover our entire border nor protect all our people from
      rebel plunderers. Our militia laws furnish ample means to meet this emergency. Every company
      duly organized can have regularly commissioned officers, and be well armed at once and kept
      well supplied with ammunition; and we appeal to our people to show that they mean to do their
      whole duty in the matter of their own protection. It need cost no money, and very little time;
      and let it but be known that in every district of Franklin county there will be well armed
      companies to repel raids, and there can be no doubt but that raiders will give us a wide
      berth. When malignant copperheads complain of the government, propose to join them in taking a
      musket for home defence, remind them that it is our first duty to show our willingness to join
      in the defence of our homes and property, and they may be shamed into doing one good at in
      spite of themselves.</p>
     <p>We earnestly urge the immediate and thorough organization of companies in every district for
      this purpose. Chambersburg should have not less than five companies--let us not be behind in
      the work. Certainly 2,500 can be thus enrolled and armed, and if so, we may rest easy about
      raids. If we neglect it, the rebels must become duller than usual if they don't divide our
      stock and crops with us this fall, in spite of any army we could possibly have here. This is a
      clear duty; let it not be delayed. What district will be foremost in the good work?</p>
