<b>Gossip With Our Friends</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Responds to slogans of "Orrstown will never, never, NEVER go White Slavery
                    or Negro Equality" at the Democratic mass meeting. The author denies black

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are untainted by politics. We were never proposed for an office, never
                        served in any official capacity, and never expect to. We have even a holy
                        horror of a politician, particularly an unsuccessful one, and in the present
                        instance wash our hands of any intention to meddle out of our sphere.
                        Nothing but outraged humanity could bring us out, and outraged humanity
                            has brought as [sic] out. Listen to our story
                        and judge for yourselves, O, Black Republicans, and ye too, O,
                        Cop--Democrats.</p>
                    <p>Thursday was the great Democratic mass meeting day. We have nothing to say
                        about "the brawny sons of toil," "the unterrified," "the salt of the earth,"
                        and all that; nothing to say about the flags and banners, not even of the
                        motto which renders Orrstown immortal, which places that village among the
                        wonders of the world, of the motto that will go down to posterity
                        "Kite-ing," the motto which some Ashantee, Dahomey, Benin or Biaffra negro
                        in future ages, sitting on an aged fence-rail, will order to be photographed
                        for his negro grand-children by negro Hogarths, and Michael Angelos, and
                        Murillos, and Zeuxis-es who are yet to be. This
                        motto was noticed by Joseph Pritts, Esq., of yore, once the Editor of this
                        paper. He that read this article will never forget it. With what deep
                        emotion he dwelt upon those solemn words, "Orrstown can't go White Slavery,"
                        "Orrstown can't go White Slavery," "Orrstown can't go White Slavery,"--"nor
                        Negro Equality." What a love for the white man in general does the first
                        clause exhibit, and what a respect for the degraded white man in particular,
                        the second. "Britons never, never will be slaves," and "Orrstown will never,
                            never, Never go White Slavery or Negro
                        Equality." How well do we remember in our school-boy days the acute anguish
                        we felt when a smarter or sharper neighbor "trapped" us; as we grew older we
                        hated to be "cut out" Sunday nights at the church door; and when we
                        graduated into a dry goods store we didn't feel pleased when our opposition
                        sold more than we did. A low, ignorant, degraded white man can't admire a
                        negro like Fred. Douglas. We wouldn't under the
                        circumstances. Now we don't think the white and
                        black races equal, but when a negro does get ahead of a white man, why not
                        admit it. Suppose, for instance, to be practical, that Orrstown prefer as
                        tenants, respectable negroes who would pay the rent, or some mean white men
                        that wouldn't? Suppose Orrstown was attacked by the Rebels, who were just
                        about applying the torch to Orrstown's houses and barns. would Orrstown
                        object to the timely arrival of a negro Union regiment who would cut in
                        pieces their thieving enemy? Suppose--but that's not enough; you may think
                        so, but we have not forgotten the outrage that we threatened to expose.</p>
                    <p>One of many of the wagons in the Democratic procession was not full, in fact
                        almost empty, and a bonus of fifty cents was offered to any that would ride
                        in it. This tempted one of our Republicans to such a degree, that he
                        undertook the job, the ride for nothing and fifty cents for the disgrace.
                        Would the world believe it? after the ride he was offered fifteen cents;
                            fifteen cents for a ride in a Democratic
                        procession; fifteen cents to be gazed upon by the
                        youth and beauty of Chambersburg, in an open wagon; fifteen cents to be pointed at by the dirty fingers of ragged
                        boys, as the Republican who had pilloried himself ffor [sic] fifteen cents! But hold, the worst is to come; that
                        fifteen cents has been secured by us; we have it in our office, and can show
                        it to the antiquarian. We give below as near as our types will admit a
                        facsimile of it--the color of the paper and the torn edges are
                        untransferable:</p>

                    <p>will pay to the bearer, at the office of the County Treasurer,</p>
                    <p>Fifteen Cents</p>

                    <p>There, it is off our mind now, and for that was a
                        Republican bought. Are we as Republicans to bear this? Does not, this prove that the Rebel agents, assisted by renegade
                        Democrats, are buying up Republican votes--the money furnished in profusion
                        by the South. O, the Times (not the Spirit and
