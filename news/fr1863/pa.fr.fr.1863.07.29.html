<b>Inside Of Rebeldom</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints and comments on articles from several Confederate or
                    Confederate-sympathizing newspapers. All the papers complained of the terrible

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Col. Grierson, who made the most daring raid through rebeldom on record,
                        having penetrated some six hundred miles of its territory, declared it was
                        an "empty shell" and ready to break at time [illegible] the success of the
                        Union arms. [Note: A piece of tape blocks out some text in the next two
                        paragraphs.] Since [illegible] the Old Flag has been triumphant at
                        [illegible], at Port Hudson, in Tennessee, at [illegible], at Helena, and it
                        is confidently hoped that it will soon float over Charleston.</p>
                    <p>Since then we have [illegible] with no common degree of interest [illegible]
                        comments of the journals in the [illegible]of the traitors upon the progress
                        [illegible] the Union cause. We now have them [illegible] us, and they are
                        confused in the [illegible] suggestions, and naturally enough [illegible]
                        despondent in tone. Some seem to think a falsehood well adhered to answers
                        the purpose of truth, and accordingly the Richmond Dispatch, insists "Lee gained a tremendous victory at
                        Gettysburg," and that "he fell back purely of his own will and from no
                        compulsion of the enemy." The Richmond Examiner
                        is crying for blood, and denounces the weakness of Jeff. Davis in not
                        promptly hanging Union persons by way of retaliation. It says:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. President Davis' proclamations and pronunciamientos, [sic] his horrible
                        threatenings and gloomy appeals, have been so often repeated that they are
                        the sneer of the world. But never have they resulted in one solitary
                        performance. He is very obstinate, very bitter; when he gets into a quarrel
                        with some Southern officer over whom the law gives him temporary control. He
                        is very firm indeed in maintaining a minion or a measure against the
                        smothered indignation of a people who are compelled by their present
                        unfortunate situation to support silently a great deal from their officials.
                        But when his duty brings him into contact with the enemy he is gentle as the
                        sucking dove.</p>
                    <p>* * * "Mr. Stephens was sent to Washington with a letter of credence to
                        Lincoln, and another of instructions to himself from President Davis: A good
                        deal was said in this last letter about titles, &amp;c., which looks
                        pitiful enough; and the rest relating to the business on hand, amounts to
                        this: that if the Federal Government will only vouchsafe a civil word or so,
                        will say, for instance, that it would like to mitigate the horrors of war,
                        the Confederate Government would be happy to indulge in boundless compassion
                        for the two Yankees aforesaid. As to the two murdered Confederate officers
                        in Kentucky, who feels compassion for them?</p>
                    <p>* * *"Now, who will deny that the Confederacy makes a sorrowful figure in
                        this matter?"</p>
                    <p>The retreat of Lee across the Potomac into Virginia again was as unexpected
                        as crushing to the rebels. It at once blighted all their hopes of
                        transferring the war to Northern soil, and cost them half of their best
                        army. The Richmond Dispatch says that "opinions
                        are various with regard to the motives which induced Gen. Lee to withdraw
                        his army to the Virginia side." Again it says:</p>
                    <p>"That it has had the immediate effect of stimulating the war passions of the
                        North, and enabling Lincoln with the more ease to recruit his shatter ranks,
                        can hardly be denied. But it must be recollected that this was the
                        consequence, not of the expedition itself, but of the withdrawal of the
                        troops, and has not therefore the slightest bearing upon the wisdom of the
                        measure. Had Gen. Lee destroyed the army of Meade, as there was every reason
                        to hope, we should then have seen how fatal was the blow he had struck.</p>
                    <p>"He failed to accomplish his object; but failure in execution implies no want
                        of judgment in the conception, unless the means should be ridiculously
                        small. They were not so in this case. Gen. Lee believed them to be ample."</p>
                    <p>The Richmond Examiner says:</p>
                    <p>"Gen. Lee has re-crossed the Potomac. With this announcement, it is supposed,
                        the second invasion of the United States is at an end. The Government and
                        its chief General undertook this campaign on their own responsibility, and
                        at their own time. Public opinion did not impel their action. But public
                        opinion did most certainly justify, approve, and adopt it. Although it has
                        been abruptly terminated by an unsuccessful battle, we are far from thinking
                        that the design was injudicious.</p>
                    <p>"This war can be terminated only by such a measure. It might have been
                        gloriously terminated in a month had Gettysburg witnessed the annihilation
                        of the Union army of the Potomac. But that battle was fought in a position
                        which rendered success impossible. Why it was fought is yet unknown."</p>
                    <p>The Montgomery Advertiser gives a doleful account
                        of rebel prospects in Tennessee. It says Bragg's retreat from Tullahoma is
                        "much to be regretted," and that it "will have a very injurious effect, not
                        merely on the people, but on the troops, particularly those from Tennessee,"
                        a number of whose troops, it says "have already deserted." It thus pictures
                        the results of Braggs retreat:</p>
                    <p>"The retreat from Tennessee opens the northern counties of Georgia and
                        Alabama to the incursions of the enemy. In our own State the Tennessee
                        valley will be desolated, and raiding parties will penetrate the counties
                        lying between the Tennessee and the Alabama, and east of the Bigbee rivers.
                        This will bring the enemy to our own doors, and open the way to the rich
                        counties of South Alabama.</p>
                    <p>"But there is another view of this question which is important. Vicksburg
                        having fallen, Grant has an army of eighty thousand men at his disposal. It
                        will be impossible for Gen. Johnston to oppose this army with any hope of
                        success, and as he retires toward the Bigbee, which we suppose he will do,
                        Grant will close on him, and unite his army with that of Rosecrans. Here,
                        then, will be an army of one hundred and sixty of seventy thousand men
                        encamped on the soil of Alabama."</p>
                    <p>The Chattanooga Rebel, Vallandigham's organ in
                        rebeldom, thus discourses upon the advantages gained by the retreat of
                        Bragg:</p>
                    <p>"Among the object of repining to which the mind very naturally reverts in
                        contemplating the loss of Middle Tennessee, none forces itself more
                        persistently upon us than the rich crops of grain which our retreat threw
                        into the hands of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>"The crops of Tennessee, like the soil and all else therein, were fair to
                        see. Many a time during the last three months have we cast a hopeful eye
                        upon the teeming acres and their fruitful promise. But luxury, rather than
                        absolute want, was the main figure in the prospect. We saw with
                        gratification the energetic industry which was converting a thousand cotton
                        fields to patches of corn and wheat in the fat South, and at no time did we
                        fear starvation or even need. Hence we have not regarded the Middle
                        Tennessee crops--whilst to be greatly desired--as absolutely essential to
                        our existence, nor do we at this time.</p>
                    <p>"It would be wanton affectation were we to deny an extreme regret at the loss
                        of so much produce; but we can continue to do without it;' and, in any
                        event, there is no use crying over spilled milk."</p>
                    <p>The attack upon Charleston seems to have thrown the rebel papers into
                        consternation. They see the hand-writing upon the wall, and confess that the
                        home of treason is probably doomed. The Charleston Courier hoped to save the city, but says its "hope may prove a
                        delusion," that "the capture of our city, may, perchance, delight his (our)
                        base and corrupt hear." It has dim perceptions of the "last ditch," but is
                        philosophical withal. It says:</p>
                    <p>"On the supposition of the foe's success, it is our duty to avoid incurring
                        his fiendish malignity. All who can be of no service in the work of defence
                        should betake themselves to places of shelter. And it were well not to defer
                        removal to a late day. We may be compelled to remain, or, if we make good
                        our escape, circumstances may oblige us to leave all our personal effects
                        behind."</p>
                    <p>The Mercury, commenting on the attack upon Morris
                        Island, says:</p>
                    <p>"It appears to us to be useless to attempt to disguise from ourselves our
                        situation. By whose fault we got into it, it is vain now to inquire. The
                        Yankees having gotten possession of the southern half of Morris Island there
                        is but one way to save the city Charleston, and that is by the speedy and
                        unflinching use of the bayonet. If the fight on Morris Island is to be now a fight by engineering contrivances and cannon
                        merely, the advantage is now with the enemy. With their iron-clads in the
                        water and their men in occupation of the land, it is likely to be a mere
                        question of time. The fall of Fort Wagner ends in the fall of
                        Charleston--Fort Sumter, like Fort Wagner, will then be assailed by land and
                        sea, and the fate of Fort Pulaski will be that of Sumter. Gen. Gilmore,
                        commander of the Department, was the man who reduced Fort Pulaski.
                        Charleston must be saved as Richmond was."</p>
                    <p>The Mobile Advertiser has been holding a post-mortem examination on the rebel carcass, but,
                        after careful inspection, thinks that there is life in it yet. But some of
                        the subjects of Jeff "seem to be weak in the knees. It says that "there are
                        those who are ready to submit, and anxious for peace and the security of
                        their property on the basis of submission." It adds, that "there have been
                        some signs of this white feather." Will Vallandigham please "make note
                        on't!"</p>
                    <p>The Richmond Enquirer, of the 16th, contains a
                        proclamation by Jeff. Davis, calling out, under the Confederate Conscription
                        act, all white men between the ages of 18 and 45, to serve for three years,
                        under penalty of being punished for desertion in case of disobeying the
                        call. They are offered the privilege of joining Volunteer organizations
                        before the enrollment.</p>
                    <p>The Enquirer, in an article headed "Military
                        Necessary," urges that the only salvation of the Southern Confederacy is in
                        making a levy en masse, such as is called for in
                        this proclamation. The application of martial law to a country in a state of
                        siege, the absolute control of all trading, especially of drink, within
                        military lines, the abolition of substiue [sic] exemptions and foreign
                        protections, the material enlargement of the President's power to revise
                        elections of officers, to make appointments, and to get rid of incompetent
                        officers. We believe that Jeff. is not expected to wait for a decision of
                        the courts to ascertain whether such despotic powers are constitutional or
                        not!</p>
                    <p>The New York riots furnish the only faint gleam of hope for the despairing
                        traitors. They grasp it as sinking men reach for straws. The Enquirer says the news is "cheering to us, indeed,
                        because it portends the breaking down of the whole structure of Yankee
                        society." It had evidently judged the result by the cowardly conduct of Gov.
                        Seymour, forgetting that there is a national government, at once determined
                        and able to enforce its laws.</p>
                    <p>The movement of Gen. Grant in the Southwest have stricken terror into the
                        very heart of rebeldom. The fall of Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Jackson, and the
                        defeat of Price at Helena, are described by the Richmond Whig as "the most serious disasters that have attended our arms
                        since the commencement of the war." The same paper deplores the loss of
                        Jackson, the capital of Mississippi. It says:</p>
                    <p>"The evacuation of Jackson, Miss., left in the hands of the enemy the rolling
                        stock of the New Orleans, Jackson and great Northern, the Mississippi
                        Central and Mississippi and Tennessee railroad. The motive power alone
                        consists of over forty engines. The loss is of incalculable importance and
                        is wholly irreparable. Nothing goes well in the Southwest."</p>
                    <p>The markets in Richmond are eminently interesting:</p>
                    <p>Gold sells at $9 premium; bacon at $1.50 per lb.; butter $1.50; candles $5;
                        coffee $4; sole leather $3.75; upper $5.50; salt 45c.; sugar $1.50; whiskey
                        $85 per gallon; wheat $7.50 per bushel; rye $7; peas $15; corn $20; flour
                        $35 per barrel; Hay $400 per ton; molasses $10 per gallon; potatoes $15 per
                        bushel; oats $6 per bushel; lime $10 per bbl; dried apples $11 per bushel;
                        dried peaches $16 per bushel. Such are some of the fruits of this causeless,
                        unholy rebellion!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Tuesday evening after the fight, we found ourselves among the crowd of
                        visitors to the battle field of Gettysburg. There were many whose sad faces
                        and anxious inquiries proclaimed their errand. Others, again, were busily
                        attending to the necessities of the wounded; but perhaps in every breast
                        there was felt something of that strange feeling which instinctively draws
                        us to a battle field. It is not a morbid curiosity as some would claim. It
                        is with a feeling more akin to reverence that we draw nigh to the broad and
                        bloody altar, on which thousands of our fellow beings have so freely laid
                        down their lives for our redemption. Such spots are shrines to which true
                        patriots will ever make their pilgrimages; and we may rest assured that the
                        nation is nigh destruction when it can forget or walk thoughtlessly over its
                        battle grounds. It was with much feeling that we stood on the now historic
                        heights of Gettysburg. The sun was just setting as we began our walk, and
                        the silence of coming night seemed best calculated to impress the scene. A
                        fried who had witnessed the fight walked along, and through his vivid
                        descriptions the whole battle seemed to rage before us. The rising fogs of
                        evening were not unlike the smoke of battle as we had seen it before; and as
                        they hung over the hills on the rebel lines, fancy could easily picture on
                        this misty background, marshaled lines and charging columns. It is
                        exceedingly difficult, as every one is aware who has made like visits, to
                        arrive at the truth concerning the details of the fight. Each soldier claims
                        for the point where he stood, special importance. Never was there so fierce
                        an assault as the one repelled by his brigade. But there are certain points
                        that tell their own story. The deep ruts made by the artillery wheels, the
                        broken fragments of shell, the shrubbery cut down as with the scythe of the
                        mower, the trampled caps and haversacks that no soldier comes to claim, and
                        the graves, thick as if sown broad-cast on the hillside, need no
                        interpreter. There are many such places at Gettysburg, but there is one
                        which will ever claim special interest. It is Cemetery Hill, occupied by our
                        centre. It was, as Gen. Lee said in his address to his soldiers, "the key to
                        the whole position, and the Confederacy expected them to take it." Standing
                        on it one could realize as never before the magnitude of the issues at stake
                        in this one battle. That little hill alone stood between the hosts of the
                        rebels and victory. It was all that seemed to interfere between us and
                        disaster and humiliation to the whole North. But it was peopled that day
                        with heroes; it fairly bristled with cannons and bayonets. The tide of
                        battle swept up to its foot, then back, then forward and partly up its
                        sides, leaving them in its fearful ebb, covered with mangled and bleeding
                        bodies; but still like some bold headland mocking the waves the hill held
                        out.</p>
                    <p>On the top you can still see the field works marked with the wheels of the
                        cannon. Just on the brow of the hill, was a square field, enclosed by a
                        stone wall. This made two parallel walls to stretch between the patriots on
                        the hill and the rebels; and behind [illegible] long lines of eager soldiers
                        waiting for the coming of the foe. The tops of these walls are now ragged;
                        in some places broken quite to the ground. There is good reason for it, for
                        first the artillery, from those woods opposite, played on them, and then a
                        column, the forlorn hope of the charge, stormed over them. They passed the
                        first with a yell; broken, but not dispirited, they reached the second and
                        clambered over it. They sweep to the brow of the hill, and over it, and at
                        last lay their hands on those cannon behind the field works. But there were
                        men with those guns who scorned to fly. Bravery was met with equal bravery,
                        and they flew to embrace each other in the fearful struggle of death. A
                        rebel laid hold of an artillery man, and in the struggle threw him to the
                        ground, and then seized a limestone to beat out his brains. A patriot
                        lieutenant sprang to aid his comrade; then a rebel officer joined in the
                        fray. It was a brief struggle--a shot, a snapping stab with a bayonet, and
                        two more traitors passed to their doom. This was the way they fought around
                        these guns. For a few brief minutes the enemy held the batteries, then broke
                        and fled in disastrous rout down the hill. Few reached the meadow below.
                        They lay upon the hillside crushed by the pitiless storm that overtook their
                        flying feet. Behind the second wall lay a company of Texians, [sic] unable
                        to move forward or backward. They could not lift their heads, so fierce and
                        incessant was the fire that swept over them. They were afterwards taken
                        prisoners. Next morning after the assault a man might have walked from the
                        muddy stream below, up to the very muzzles of the cannon above, on dead and
                        bleeding bodies. All this occurred just outside the gates of the Cemetery.
                        It seems as if war in cruel mockery of death, had flung a thousand victims
                        at his door. We walked back through the Cemetery, and on all sides were
                        traces of this most sanguinary conflict. Artillery horses had trampled the
                        flower which the hand of affection had planted over the dead; monuments were
                        overturned, and the green sod of graves torn by bursting shells. We noticed
                        one monument shattered by a cannon ball. It was one marking the grave of a
                        young soldier who fell at the battle of Fair Oaks. His last words: "Tell my
                        father I died for my country," were chiseled on the marble, and it seemed,
                        as if for these words, the bitterness of rebellion would disturb his last
                        resting place. But he sleeps on a field of victory after all. To give an
                        account of a walk along the whole line of battle, without entering into a
                        detailed history of the conflict, would be to repeat what has been written.
                        Each hill top has its story of desperate assault and gallant defence; and
                        alike are baptized with patriot blood.</p>
                    <p>But in order to obtain a correct conception of the sanguinary character of
                        this battle, one must visit the hospitals. The dead are soon covered from
                        the sight; the scarred earth, washed by pitying rains and nursed by the
                        sunshine, quickly recovers from its wound, but men must bleed and groan and
                        die for long days after the shock of battle is over, and the shattered
                        columns have swept away to other scenes. The multitude of such sufferers at
                        Gettysburg is appalling. There are literally acres covered with them, while
                        in the town every available building is turned into a crowded hospital. As
                        we were there early in the week, it was to soon to find much done to relieve
                        their wants. The citizens of the place were doing all in their power, and so
                        far as our personal knowledge goes, we can assert most positively that the
                        charges of extortion and indifference preferred against them are altogether
                        unfounded. The Christian Commission were already present and actively at
                        work. Too much praise cannot be awarded them for their labor of love.
                        Dressing wounds, administering cordials, sponging a parched face, writing
                        letters, or administering a few words of comfort to the dying, thousand of
                        grateful soldiers will bless their names and the charity that sent them. The
                        sufferings of the rebel wounded, for the first five days after the battle,
                        were indescribable. They had been left by their friends lying under trees
                        and sheds, without any adequate medical attendance, or indeed supplies of
                        any kind. The gnawing of hunger soon added to the pains of their neglected
                        wounds, while the drenching rains that followed the battle increased the
                        discomfort of their condition. Every effort was made as soon as possible to
                        relieve their wretched state. They were gathered up and conveyed to a
                        convenient locality on the Chambersburg pike, where tents and supplies were
                        furnished them.</p>
                    <p>At this point the fields look as if an army were still encamped there; but a
                        closer look is enough to move the hardest heart. Pity turns away to weep,
                        while indignation bursts out afresh against the wicked leaders who betrayed
                        these misguided men to such horrible sufferings. Maimed, wounded, covered
                        with gore and writhing in agony they lie there to mark the pathway the
                        monster secession has trodden. There is a most remarkable contrast between
                        the wounded of the opposing armies. We need not allude to the outward
                        appearance, for the filth and squalid attire of the rebels are proverbial.
                        It is also to be expected from the result of the battle, that one party
                        would be dogged and sullen while the other would be cheerful. But the
                        contrast may be traced in the cheerfulness and patience with which the men
                        bear their wounds. I have yet to hear a regret from our brave soldiers that
                        they entered the army, or that they had sacrificed too much for their
                        country, while among the rebels one could hear without inquiry, most hearty
                        wishes that they were out of the army and safe at home. Frequently did we
                        hear the desire expressed that the "war might soon be over and the Union
                        restored as before." A dying rebel from Georgia, the son of a wealthy
                        planter, sent for a minister in the town to beg of him that he would see him
                        decently buried and write to his friends of his death. He stated that he had
                        been driven into the army by the bayonet, and that his father had offered
                        fifteen hundred dollars for a substitute but none were to be had at any
                        price. Others expressed their sorrow that they had taken up arms against the
                        Union, but who can point out a soldier in our army, sorry for the part he
                        has taken in subduing this rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The debt the North owes to the Army of the Potomac is one we can never repay.
                        But for it, we would to-day, be lying helplessly in the power of the
                        insurgents. Surely then no appeal need be made to our generosity, to send
                        all necessary supplies to the suffering soldiers at Gettysburg. The number
                        is so great that it will require continuance in well-doing on our part to
                        supply their need. It will be months before this vast army of suffers can be
                        discharged. We might add indefinitely, to what has been written, but every
                        one is busy repeating the story of how they fought at Gettysburg. Nor will
                        it now grow old. History shall record it on her pages, and generations yet
                        unborn, shall read it with throbbing pulses, and with glowing words bring
                        their tribute to the memory of those who have bled and died for their
                        country's redemption.</p>

                    <p><br>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository</p>
                    <p>Gettysburg, July 15, 1863.</p>
                    <p>Gen. S. Wylie Crawford being identified with our county, his father, Rev. Dr.
                        Crawford, residing but a few miles from Chambersburg, I think it will be
                        interesting to your readers to have a sketch of his connection with the
                        celebrated "Pennsylvania Reserves" in their recent action at Gettysburg. It
                        has been the fortune of this Division to be commanded by some of the ablest
                        generals in the Army of the Potomac. Reynolds, Meade, Ord, and Seymour,
                        disciplined it for the field, and led it in engagements in which it won the
                        proud name it bears, and so often saved the general army from ruin.
                        Accustomed to such leaders, the Reserves' ideas of commanders were very
                        high; and when Gen. Crawford, a young man, came from another quarter to take
                        command, he was scrutinized zealously. You can readily see how delicate the
                        position in which he was placed; that the utmost that he dared hope was to
                        keep upon an equality with his able predecessors. At Upton's Hill, Va., near
                        Washington, and among its defences, he took command of two of the three
                        brigades composing McCall's Division P.R.V.C.,--the 1st Brigade under Col.
                        McCandless, of the 2d Regiment consisting of the "Bucktails," 1st, 2d and
                        [illegible] Regiments, and the 3d Brigade under Col. Fisher, of the 5th
                        comprising the [illegible], 10th, 11th and 12th Regiments. Quickly and
                        unostentatiously he assumed his charge, and proceeded at once to the more
                        efficient organization of the Division, and to the strengthening of our
                        position. Just as we had ourselves nicely fixed, the order came for us to
                        join the Fifth Corps of the Army of the Potomac, then commanded by Maj. Gen.
                        Meade. Our marches were eminently forced; day and night, in almost constant
                        rains, footsore, weary, faint and hungry, we hurried along from the 25th
                        June until the 2d July, when we closed our long march on the battle-field.
                        The General conducted this fatiguing march with great judgment, and evinced
                        much sympathy with the men, sharing the exposure and cheering them on their
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Immediately before we crossed the "State Line," the historic, "Mason
                        &amp; Dixon," while the Division rested, Gen. Crawford issued the
                        following animating address to his troops:</p>
                    <p>
                        Soldiers of the Pennsylvania Reserves:
                    </p>
                    <p>You have once more been called to the field, by an order from the Commanding
                        General, and a rapid and fatiguing march has placed us again by the side of
                        our comrades, endeared to us by sufferings on many hard fought fields. If
                        you would hail the prospect of active service, at any time, with delight,
                        how much more now! Our native State is invaded by the ruthless hordes of
                        plunderers, who, forgetting South Mountain and
                            Antietam, and allured by the spoils of our
                        rich valleys, have polluted the soil of Pennsylvania. Our homes are
                        desolated, our fields laid waste, our property destroyed! To-day, within a
                        few hours, we shall tread the soil of the Keystone. The eyes of all will be
                        upon us. To us, they will look with anxious hearts for relief. Let the sight
                        of our mountains and our native plains free your hearts and nerve your arms
                        in the hour of battle. We strike for all that is dear to man. Remember, you
                        are Pennsylvanians. Let no breach of discipline mar the glory of the past,
                        but let us pledge to each other to-day never to cease until we drive the
                        enemy of our country, our constitution, and our peace, forever from our
                        soil.</p>
                    <p>S. W. Crawford, <br>Brig. Gen.</p>
                    <p>The address was received with enthusiasm, and the men crossed over to
                        Pennsylvania, whose loyal hills and forests resounded with the cheers of her
                        gallant sons, who were about to repeat upon her own soil the deeds of valor
                        which made famous the battle-fields of Virginia and Maryland.</p>
                    <p>A gentleman, who witnessed all he writes, gives me, at my request, the
                        following sketch of the part the General and his Division displayed at the
                        battle of Gettysburg:</p>
                    <p>The 1st and 3d Brigades of the Penn'a Res. Vol. Corps, commanded by Brig.
                        Gen. Crawford, had been hurrying by forced marches to the defence of the
                        Keystone State. Through rain and mud, from daylight until dark, and often
                        through the dark hours of the night, they trudged along the Leesburg pike,
                        down the green slopes of the upper Potomac, through the gardens and
                        wonderful farms of the Maryland valleys, until, with colors flying, drums
                        beating, and the air resounding with their cheers, they crossed the border
                        line. At the first halting place on Pennsylvania soil, a soul- stirring
                        address was made to them by Gen. Crawford, reminding them that their
                        position was no common one; that they, the chosen sons of Pennsylvania, were
                        now called upon to save their homes and firesides from pollution, and
                        exhorting them to conduct themselves as no soldiers ever did before, now
                        that the eyes of their own people were upon them.</p>
                    <p>At 11 o'clock in the morning of Thursday, July 2d, the Reserves arrived on
                        the battleground at Gettysburg, and were ordered to lie with the 5th corps
                        in reserve. The booming of the guns increased, until about 3 o'clock, P.M.
                        The battle on the left raged with the greatest fury, the 5th Corps were
                        ordered to the front; first, was Griffin's Division, commanded by General
                        Barnes, then the regulars commanded by General Ayres, and, finally the
                        Reserves. Griffin's Division took the centre, on the slope of a rocky and
                        precipitous hill side; in front was Ayres, his men lying behind a
                        stone-wall, separated by a swamp from the rest of the corps; they were
                        actively engaged, sheets of fire flamed from the wall, and long quick,
                        rattling replied from the woods in front. High up on "Hazlitt's rock"
                        flashed the guns, lower down right and left, batteries were vomiting forth
                        shot and shell. The Reserves were first placed in position on the hill-side
                        between Griffin's Division and one of Hancock's Division. Then Fisher's
                        Brigade, 3d Brigade P. R. V. C., was ordered to the extreme left, the enemy
                        then threatening our flank.</p>
                    <p>At half past six o'clock the fate of the day was undecided--suddenly a
                        murderous fire was opened on Ayers' flank,--unexpected, and enough to daunt
                        the staunchest heart as was this attack, his men for a time stood firm, but
                        their rapidly diminishing ranks, the hopeless position they held was soon
                        manifest, and General Ayers gave the order to fall back. In good order, with
                        closed ranks, they rose up and commenced to retreat; but the swamps and
                        broken ground soon threw them into confusion. The rebels, seeing their
                        position, rushed down upon them with savage yells, pouring volley after
                        volley among them, and finally occupied the stone wall. General Crawford
                        rode to the front,--Col. McCandless and General Crawford's staff officers
                        called to their men to stand steady, as the human tide came down upon them.
                        Through their (Ayers') ranks they rushed. Quicker and quicker came the boom
                        of the guns as the advantage the rebels had gained became so fearfully
                        apparent. Gen. Crawford gave the word to advance. Down the hill; and in a
                        steady line, the Brigade went; paused at its foot, and delivered a single
                        volley; before the smoke had cleared, General Crawford gave the order to
                        charge across the swamp. The "Bucktails" leading with a wild hurrah, they
                        passed. General Crawford seized the colors of the leading regiment and
                        raised them aloft. Suddenly the fire from behind the wall ceased. Cheer
                        after cheer rang from the hills, now crowded on every rock and tree with
                        spectators, and towards the woods a crowd of "greybacks" could be seen
                        running. A few steps further the lost position was gained, and the left of
                        the line was saved, many a gallant man however marked the track behind. The
                        "Bucktails" had suffered most, and Colonel Taylor, their leader, lay dead on
                        the ground. A murderous fire was kept up on both sides until night
                        terminated the contest.</p>
                    <p>The 3d Brigade had not been idle during this time, just in front of them rose
                        a wooded pyramidal hill, occupied by a considerable force of rebel
                        sharpshooters, who inflicted a serious loss [illegible] troops. This hill,
                        towards dark Col. Fisher with the 5th and 12th Regiments, and the 20th
                        Maine, of Griffin's Division ascended and held, securing a strong position
                        on which the left of the army [illegible].</p>
                    <p>After dark, General Crawford, Colonel McCandless and Capt. Auchmuty, the
                        newly appointed Assistant Adjutant General of the Division, made a personal
                        inspection of the line of skirmishers thrown out on the edge of the wood
                        beyond the wall. The fierce nature of the conflict was there fully realized
                        in the dead and wounded that lay around. The wheat was trodden down, arms
                        lay scattered about. The bright full moon looked calmly down, the quiet
                        broken now and then by a rifle's crack or the whiz of some sharpshooter's
                        bullet.</p>
                    <p>Crouched behind the wall, ready at any moment for an attack, the Brigade
                        passed the night, while the troops on the left piled rocks and logs into
                        formidable breastworks.</p>
                    <p>Day-break of Friday was ushered in by the customary volleys of musketry, the
                        skirmishers shifting during the night, are at day-break compelled to take a
                        regular positton [sic]. At ten o'clock, the battle re-commenced by
                        tremendous attacks on the right of the line. From the left a scene was
                        presented which has had no parallel in the war. The high rocky hill,
                        previously described, commanded a view of the entire field. The 146th New
                        York was disposed among the rocks as sharpshooters, their red figures
                        brightening up the rocks. On the summit still stood Hazlitt's battery. There
                        Major General Sykes, commander of Fifth Corps, General Crawford, and General
                        Ayers estab- [sic] their headquarters, and later in the day, General Meade
                        himself. For two miles or more extended an open country, dotted with farm
                        houses, with here and there a clump of wood. On this plain, as it appeared
                        from the height, the two magnificent armies were in full view, and every
                        movement could be traced with the naked eye. The never to be forgotten scene
                        was rendered more exciting by the enemy sharpshooters, who, occupying the
                        opposite trees, dealt death with an unsparing hand. General Weed was here
                        killed, and Dr. Hazlitt, while listening to his dying words, fell dead upon
                        his body. Still no danger could counteract the attraction of that sternly
                        grand army, and crowds of officers gathered constantly upon the rocks. At 5
                        o'clock, General Sykes directed General Crawford to send McCandles' Brigade
                        in the woods in front from which the firing had nearly ceased. Bartlett's
                        brigade was ordered to support it in case of necessity.</p>
                    <p>The woods in front were about a mile long and some eight hundred yards wide,
                        with a narrow wheat field running partly thro the centre. A rebel battery,
                        posted on a ridge of land overlooking the woods, opened a hot fire of
                        canister and round shot, as the men rose up from behind the wall. Into the
                        woods on the right, the brigade swept, driving the enemy's skirmishers
                        before them. Loud cheers rang from the hillsides as the advance was made,
                        and the battery, evidently supposing a general advance was to be made,
                        hastily limbered up and retired. Having cleared the woods on the right, the
                        Brigade changed front and moved down parallel to the front, receiving and
                        returning a severe fire of musketry from the enemy, who now appeared in
                        considerable force. The Brigade moved rapidly on, obeying the injunction of
                        Gen. Crawford, that speed was safety in such a movement. Suddenly the left
                        flank of the line was discovered to be in the rear of the 15th Georgia,
                        drawn up in line of battle. In a moment, Col. McCandless swept his right
                        flank around, and charged them in the rear. Completely panic-stricken, down
                        went their arms, and a general skedaddle ensued; their colors, their Liet.
                        Colonel, 120 of their men, and most of their arms, were captured. This
                        brilliaut [sic] manoeuvre finished the operations of the day. A line of
                        pickets was posted, and an examination was made of the field. It was found
                        to be thickly covered with dead and wounded. Groans issued from almost every
                        bush and sheltered spot, where some poor wretch had crawled for safety from
                        the shot and shell poured from either line. The wounded, many of whom had
                        been uncared for during twenty-four hours, were removed, and a collection of
                        the abandoned arms was made. These amounted to 4,687 stand; one brass
                        Napoleon gun was also taken, and three caissons. Many of these arms,
                        however, had been left by our own men in the fiercely contested battle which
                        had raged on this ground the previous morning. This ended the fighting at
                        Gettysburg, and the service at that battle of the Pennsylvania Reserve
                        Corps. Their loss was 230 in killed and wounded, including 21 reported as
                        missing.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Crawford displayed the utmost concern for the care of the wounded, and
                        as he had gained ground last in front, he sent at once for the litter
                        bearers and ambulances, and had the wounded borne to the rear; thus our
                        hospitals were filled with the wounded from several other corps, and with
                        rebels.</p>
                    <p>The following gentlemen constitute Gen. Crawford's staff; Capt. R.T.
                        Auchmuty, Asset Adj. General; Major Spear, A. I. G.: Capt. Livingston, A. D.
                        C; Capt. Fox, Division Qr. M.; Lieut. Henderson, A.D.C.; Lieut Thos.
                        Oakwell, 5th Ky., A.D.C.; Surgeon L. W. Reade, Med. Director of Division.</p>
                    <p>I have written this in great haste, having crawled into a vacant ambulance to
                        find shelter from the dashing rain. I close with the hope that God may give
                        a great victory in the coming battle to the cause of the Union and
                    humanity.</p>

                    <p>When the impartial historian shall come to record the victories, defeats and
                        embarrassments of our Government in its sacred effort to preserve our free
                        institutions, the most appalling chapter in his chequered pages will be that
                        devoted to the covert treason, the cowardly misrepresentation, the base
                        appeals to partizan prejudices, and the thin guise of hypocrisy that
                        presents cold professions of loyalty to a loyal people, while beneath
                        rankles the deadliest hatred to the preservation of our nationality, save
                        upon the altar of dishonor.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic State Convention held its sessions at Harrisburg, while armed
                        traitors reveled in the Cumberland Valley, plundering our people, holding
                        possession and exhausting the wealth of our towns and distracts; insolently
                        defying alike National and State authorities, and inflecting upon the fair
                        fame of our Commonwealth the dishonor of rebel occupation of our soil. Some
                        of the delegates in attendance were fugitives from their homes, and their
                        families and property at the mercy of the minion of murderous treason. The
                        people of the State were flying to arms in obedience to the call of the
                        proper authorities, and the measured tread of recruits unceasing around the
                        halls wherein were congregated the magnates of Democracy struggling to
                        obtain the power and spoils of office.</p>
                    <p>The main duty of that Convention was to nominate a candidate for Governor,
                        who, if chosen, would be charged with the maintenance of peace, order and
                        security of the citizens and the honor of the State, and to declare the
                        principles and policy upon which the Government shall be preserved and
                        administered. How that duty was discharged, let the record answer. A man was
                        presented for Governor who has yet to utter the first earnest word of
                        encouragement to the Government in preserving the life of the Republic
                        against unholy treason; and whose every declarations upon the subject deny
                        the power of the Nation to meet armed traitors with arms, and thus assert
                        its inherent right to live. A platform was presented by Hon. F. W. Hughes,
                        who signalized his devotion to the Government, when the war commenced by
                        tendering Pennsylvania as a free offering to those who have by wanton,
                        wicked war, made millions mourn. Avowedly a friend of the deadly foes of the
                        republic, he could do no less, in a loyal State, than guise treason in every
                        resolution, and attempt to poison the whole fountain of honest devotion to
                        the cause of a common country.</p>
                    <p>That he succeeded well, is a painful, palpable truth. Of the eleven
                        resolutions adopted, not one--not so much as a single sentence or line,
                        breathes the spirit of an earnest, honest friend of the preservation of our
                        Nationality. In reckless misrepresentation; in the recital of imaginary
                        errors of the administration; in the denunciation of every measure adopted
                        to give success to our arms in the errors of the administration; in the
                        denunciation of every measure adopted to give success to our arms in the
                        field and to our honored flag; in defending the cause of open, insolent
                        traitors upon whom the hand of the government had but too leniently
                        fallen--in all this they are matchless in vigor and elaborate in terms. But
                        they are wanting--sadly, wholly wanting in every expression of devotion to
                        our Country's cause; in every impulse of patriotism that looks to the
                        subordination of all things to the preservation of our government; in every
                        expression that would cheer a soldier's heart, or solace the thousands of
                        bereaved whose loved ones died that Freedom might live; in the reprobation
                        of the relentless murderers of our gallant sons in the cause of mad ambition
                        and deadly treachery--in all these they are silent as the grave!</p>
                    <p>The People of Pennsylvania are loyal. They may be defrauded into the embrace
                        of treason, but they cannot be marshaled under a traitor's flag or on a
                        traitor's platform, if not deceived by subtle, insidious foes. We ask every
                        man, of whatever political attachment, to peruse carefully and ponder well
                        the platform from which Judge Woodward hopes to climb into the Executive
                        chair. Had Seymour's speeches and platform last fall been half so frank in
                        espousing the cause of our country's foes, he would not have been clothed
                        with the power of the Empire State to prostrate it at the feet of a
                        murderous, plundering mob; and if Woodward can be successful, the bitter
                        foretaste of Democratic rule given to New York will be the ruling power of
                        the land. Anarchy will hold undisputed sway in the great States of the
                        North, and treason will compass the entire government in its triumphant
                        embrace. Loyal men of Pennsylvania!--think well of the entertainment to
                        which you are invited!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Stahle, Editor of the Gettysburg Compiler, has
                        been discharged from Fort McHenry. He took the oath of allegiance to the
                        government, and gave his parole of honor to appear at any time to answer
                        charges, should any be preferred against him sufficiently grave to demand
                        the cognizance of a court. For his own sake, as well as for the sake of his
                        kindred who shall survive him, we hope that his record is clear, and that he
                        has been wronged. The man who could play the part of a spy for an enemy at
                        his own home, is the foe of order, of humanity, of every virtue, and is
                        unfit to live. Of such a crime we should not judge a man guilty in haste or
                        prejudice; but when dispassionate proof fixes guilt, it would be an act of
                        inhumanity to every loyal house-hold, and the veriest fraud upon Justice, to
                        permit him to live. Mr. Stahle has suffered some for his country, and may
                        boast his martyrdom like scores of fools before him; but he should not be
                        unmindful that an hundred thousand patriotic hearts have sealed their
                        devotion to a common country with their life blood, that he might enjoy for
                        himself and posterity the Free Institutions of our fathers. If he will not
                        imitate them by rallying to the Old Flag in the field, let him at least
                        disarm suspicion by giving heart and hope to the Nation's cause.</p>
