<b>In Memoriam. The Martyrs Of Human Freedom: The Heroic Dead Of Gettysburg!
                    Dedication Of The National Cemetery At Gettysburg</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes the dedication of the National Cemetery and includes Lincoln's

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Civilized nations have ever deemed it befitting to honor the heroic dead. In
                        marble, granite and bronze, the genius of the artist has been employed to
                        convey to posterity a just appreciation of bravery, valor and heroism. In
                        our own country, and in our own time, there are no evidences of respect too
                        solemn, no pageantry too grand that a gratified people can render to the
                        memory of the martyrs who have given their lives that their country might
                        live. The stupendous and momentous struggle through which our country is now
                        passing has furnished examples of the highest heroic type. The pages of
                        neither ancient nor modern history present such glorious examples of self
                        sacrifice, bravery, devotion, patriotism, as has been developed in the
                        course of this war. There is no eulogy too eloquent, no granite too enduring
                        to extol and perpetuate their virtues. The initial act of homage and
                        reverence of the nation has been rendered. The ceremonies of the dedication
                        of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg to-day, and the presence of thousands
                        from every part of the loyal Union, testified the devotion of the people to
                        Liberty, their firm purpose to maintain it, and their profound reverence for
                        those who have already given their lives in its defence.</p>
                    <p>The country has been for some time familiar with the fact, that the
                        establishment of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg for the interrment
                        [sic] of the remains of those who fought and died in the memorable struggle
                        of July, originated with Gov. Curing. It was a noble idea, prompted by the
                        highest patriotism and holiest affection for the memory of brave and gallant
                        men. In carrying out this grand purpose, the Governor has been greatly aided
                        by David Wills, Esq., of Gettysburg, a gentleman to whom was assigned the
                        chief management of the purchase of the ground, the proper arrangement of
                        it, the exhuming and re-interment of the dead, and the dedicatory exercises.
                        Mr. Wills has discharged his duties in a manner entitling him to the highest
                        praise.</p>
                    <p>The new Cemetery contains about ten acres of ground and is located less than
                        half a mile south-west of the town. Thus far, it contains only a portion of
                        our dead, the work of re-interment not being yet completed. The receptacles
                        are ditches, mostly from twenty to one hundred feet long, with proper width,
                        and walled with stone. In every instance where the dead are known,
                        headboards are placed properly inscribed. The long rows which met our eye
                        gave ample proof of the heroism and bravery which filled the hearts of the
                        glorious men who not only repelled the rebel hordes from our soil, but did
                        so much toward consummating the great work of re-establishment of the
                        nation's honor and renown.</p>
                    <p>What has been styled the old Cemetery presents rough evidences of the
                        conflict. Broken tomb-stones, mutilated monuments, delapidated [sic] iron
                        closures and defaced inscriptions tell how fearful was the strife. No grave
                        was too sacred then; no token of affection too cherished to be spared by the
                        red hand of war. This ground was perhaps as hotly contested as any portion
                        of the field. The earth works of our batteries still remain, and on this
                        hill they were in direction to engage Ewell's Corps as he advanced over the
                        road from Carlisle. The line of battle was comparatively short, hardly seven
                        miles. [At Fredericksburg it was about twelve and at Chancellorsville
                        sixteen.]</p>
                    <p>It is not our purpose to describe the fierce conflict. Our people have been
                        made familiar with every detail in print, and many of them indeed from
                        observation. Gens. Meade's and Lee's reports have been recently published,
                        and these, with the graphic accounts of intelligent reporters, is sufficient
                        material for to make up the permanent history of the Battle of Gettysburg,
                        and give it a renown hardly less than that which attaches to Waterloo. It is
                        contemplated to erect a monument to the memory of our fallen heroes and in
                        its preparation the genius of our best artists should be engaged.</p>
                    <p>We will now describe the Dedicatory Exercises, intended as the last solemn
                        tribute to the heroic dead. The programme was, we believe, arranged by Mr.
                        Wills. Invitations were sent to the President and Vice President of the
                        United States, and the members of the Cabinet; to Lieut. Gen. Scott and Rear
                        Admiral Stewart, the two veteran and most distinguished representatives of
                        the army and navy; to Maj. Gen. Meade; to the various lodges of Free Masons
                        and Odd Fellows throughout the loyal States. The Governors of the loyal
                        States were invited to be present either in person or by deputy. A general
                        invitation was also given to citizens from every part of the Union.</p>
                    <p>The President left Washington in a special train Wednesday noon. He was
                        accompanied by Messrs. Seward, Blair and usher of his Cabinet and a large
                        number of other distinguished officials connected with the army, navy and
                        civil service. The President's escort was from the 1st Regiment of the
                        Invalid Corps. The celebrated Marine Band of Washington was also on the
                        train. The party arrived at Gettysburg about 6 P.M. The President was the
                        guest of Mr. Wils, and Secretary Seward that of Robert G. Harper, Esq. The
                        residences of these gentlemen were adorned with flags, wreaths and
                        evergreens in honor of the occasion, and as a mark of respect for the
                        illustrious visitor.</p>
                    <p>After supper the President was serenaded by the splendid band of the New York
                        Fifth Artillery. They played most exquisitely. Repeated calls were made for
                        the President, when with some reluctance he presented himself and spoke as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>I appear before you fellow-citizens, merely to thank you for this compliment.
                        the inference is a very fair one that you would hear me for a little while
                        at least were I to commence to make a speech. I do not appear before you for
                        the purpose of doing so, and for several substantial reasons. The most
                        substantial of these is that I have no speech to make. [Laughter.] Believing
                        that is my present condition this evening, I must beg of you to excuse me
                        from addressing you further.</p>
                    <p>The President retired amidst loud cheers. The band then proceeded to where
                        Mr. Seward was staying, and paid him the compliment of a serenade, to which
                        he responded in a brief speech. Col. Forney, of the Philadelphia Press was also honored with a serenade and
                        responded in a speech highly eulogistic of the departed Douglas, and
                        denunciatory of slavery as the chief cause of the war.</p>
                    <p>The trains conveying the Governors came here at midnight having been delayed
                        by a slight accident. At an early hour this morning the streets became
                        crowded and from every direction people were flocking to witness the
                        ceremonies of the day. The Baltimore City Council were present in a body
                        wearing the insignia of a metallic monument fixed upon a neat rosette. A
                        number of the Baltimore Police force were visible among the crowd.</p>
                    <p>The weather was in every way propitious. The sun rose clearly, but when the
                        hour approached for the commencement of the exercises the atmosphere became
                        damp and for a short time the dark clouds portended rain. When, however, the
                        procession moved off, the sky again became clear and the remainder of the
                        day was pleasant and agreeable.</p>
                    <p>At 10 o'clock Marshal Lamon who had charge of the civic portion of the
                        procession read the order of exercises. It was as follows:</p>
                    <p>Military, under command of Major General Couch. Offices of the Navy and
                        Marine Corps of the United States Aids. Chief Marshal, President of the

                        Cemetery. Bearers with the flags of the States. Members of the two Houses of

                        Fraternity. Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Other Benevolent Associations.
                        Literary, Scientific and Industrial Associations. The Press. Officers and
                        Members of Loyal Leagues. Fire Companies. Citizens of the State of
                        Pennsylvania. Citizens of other States. Citizens of the District of
                        Columbia. Citizens of the several Territories.</p>
                    <p>The various Assistant Marshals, were two gentlemen from each of the
                        respective loyal States. Ex-Governors Johnson and Pollock were the Marshals
                        from Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>The President took his position in the procession mounted on a splendid black
                        horse. On his appearance he was greeted with enthusiastic and long continued
                        cheers. In the few moments before the procession started many persons
                        gathered around the President, shaking him by the hand. He received every
                        one in the most gracious manner. One of our own well known witty and jovial
                        citizens accosted him with "How are you Father Abraham?" following it
                        quickly with the remark, "I am most happy to meet you, Mr. President!" The
                        President received the salutation becomingly and gave his special
                        interrogator one of his best bows.</p>
                    <p>The head of the column moved at precisely ten o'clock. The route was up
                        Baltimore street to the Emmettsburg Road, thence to the junction of the
                        Taneytown road, thence by the latter road to the cemetery, where the
                        military formed in line, according to the order of the General in command,
                        for the purpose of saluting the president of the United States. The military
                        then closed up and occupied the space on the left of the stand. The civic
                        procession advanced and occupied the area in front of the stand, the
                        military leaving sufficient space between them and the line of graves for
                        the civic procession to pass. The ladies occupied the right of the stand.</p>
                    <p>During the morning Battery E, 5th U.S. Artillery, under direction of Lieuts.
                        Simons and Piper, fired Union and Presidential salutes. Signals and salutes
                        were also fired when the procession reached the Cemetery.</p>
                    <p>The platform for the accommodation of the distinguished visitors was hardly
                        adequate to the large number present. We noticed upon it, in addition to the
                        Presidential party, Gov. Curtin, of Penna.; Gov. Seymour; of N.Y.; Gov. Tod
                        and Mr. Brough (Gov. elect) of Ohio; Gov. Coburn, of Me.; Gov. Morton and
                        Ex-Gov. Wright, of Ind.; Gov. Bradford, of Md.; Ex-Gov. Pierpont, of West
                        Va.; Mrs. Commander Henry A. Wise, daughter of the Hon. Edward Everett; Gen.
                        A. L. Russell, Adjutant General of Penna.; Hon. J.W. Forney; Gov. Parker, of
                        N.J.; Ex-Gov. Dennison, of Ohio; Hon. S. Cameron; Major Gens. Schenck,
                        Stahl, Doubleday, Stoneman, Couch; Brig. Gen. Gibbon and Provost Marshal
                        General Fry. A number of flags and banners adorned the stand.</p>
                    <p>The crowd surrounding the stand was immense, and were gathered so compactly
                        that it was almost impossible to breath. A number of persons fainted and it
                        was with the greatest difficulty that they were extricated from their
                        position. The value of hoops, bonnets and other articles of ladies wear
                        destroyed in the jam would amount to no ordinary sum.</p>
                    <p>The exercises commenced with music by Birgfield's Band from Philadelphia. It
                        was a composition of exquisite pathos and executed in a superb manner. The
                        Rev. Dr. Stockton, Chaplain of the United States Senate, then delivered a
                        fervent and patriotic prayer. The Rev. gentlemen, venerable in appearance
                        and most impressive in his utterance, was heard with due solemnity, the vast
                        multitude standing with perfect quietness and uncovered heads.</p>
                    <p>America's greatest living orator, the Hon. Edward Everett, then arose and for
                        two hours held the crowd in one of the most splendid intellectual efforts of
                        his life. It was a superb tribute to bravery and heroism; a glorious record
                        of deeds of patriotism; a grateful remembrance of generous action; a history
                        of glorious events for perpetual admiration and appreciation. [We shall
                        publish Mr. Everett's Address complete in our next week's paper.--Ed.]</p>
                    <p>At the close of Mr. Everett's oration, the Baltimore Glee Club sung the
                        following Ode, written for the occasion by B.B. French, Esq., of Washington:</p>
                    <p><br>'Tis holy ground-- <br>This spot, where, in their graves, <br>We place
                        our Country's braves, <br>Who fell in Freedom's holy cause, <br>Fighting
                        for Liberties and Laws-- <br>Let tears abound. <br>Here let them rest--
                        <br>And Summer's heat and Winter's cold. <br>Shall glow and freeze above
                        this mold-- <br>A thousand years shall pass away-- <br>A Nation still
                        shall mourn this clay, <br>Which now is blest. <br>Here, where they fell,
                        <br>Oft shall the widow's tear be shed, <br>Oft shall fond parents mourn
                        their dead, <br>The orphan here shall kneel and weep, <br>And maidens,
                        where their lovers sleep, <br>Their woes shall tell. <br>Great God in
                        Heaven! <br>Shall all this sacred blood be shed-- <br>Shall we thus mourn
                        our glorious dead, <br>Oh, shall the end be wrath and woe, <br>The knell
                        of Freedom's overthrow-- <br>A Country riven? <br>It will not be! <br>We
                        trust, Oh God! Thy gracious Power <br>To aid us in our darkest hour.
                        <br>This be our prayer. "Oh Father! save <br>A people's Freedom from its
                        grave-- <br>All praise to Thee."</p>
                    <p>The dedicatory remarks were then delivered by the President, as follows:</p>
                    <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent
                        a new Nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
                        all men are created equal. [Applause.] Now we are engaged in a great civil
                        war, testing whether that Nation or any Nation so conceived and so dedicated
                        can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We are met
                        to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting-place of those who here
                        gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
                        proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we
                        cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and
                        dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our power to add or
                        detract. [Applause.] It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here
                        to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on.
                        [Applause.] It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
                        remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion
                        to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion;
                        that we here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain
                        [applause]; that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom;
                        and that governments of the people, by the people and for the people, shall
                        not perish from the earth. [Long continued applause.]</p>
                    <p>The exercises were closed by a hymn from the choir present. The procession
                        then returned to the town.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon, President Lincoln attended the Presbyterian Church, where
                        Mr. Anderson, the Lieutenant-Governor elect of Ohio, eloquently addressed
                        the Ohio and other delegations. The President walked to the Church arm and
                        arm with John Burns, the heroic Gettysburger, who fought voluntarily in the
                        ranks of the army during the great battles of the 1st, 2d, and 3d of July,
                        and the only man from the place who took part in three days' fight. The
                        President was escorted by Marshal Lamon, and about 100 of his special aids,
                        together with the Commissioners representing the several States.</p>
                    <p>The Presidential train started for Washington at 7 o'clock, and at this hour
                        the largest portion of the immense multitude had vacated the town. The high
                        and sincere exhibitions of respect paid the President must have been greatly
                        appreciated by him, and we are quite sure the people themselves felt honored
                        by the presence of their Chief Magistrate among them. Various computations
                        of the number of people present have been made. Twenty thousand comprises a
                        crowd of considerable magnitude, and we give this as in our judgment the
                        approximate number.</p>
                    <p>Inseparably with this event, which has become history--must be recorded this
                        fact, that the proceedings of the day were conducted with profound
                        solemnity, and that in no instance was the bounds of decency and propriety
                        disregarded. No accident of any character occurred, and the demeanor of all,
                        without scarcely a single exception, was in conformity with the rules of
                        law, respect and good order.</p>
                    <p>Major Gen. Couch, to whom was assigned the command of the military, gave his
                        personal attention to every movement. The members of his Staff present were
                        prompt in carrying out his orders; and in this connection we must especially
                        mention Capt. Shipley, whose respectful requests were invariably regarded by
                        the crowd, and presented a striking contrast with the conduct of certain
                        other parties clothed with a little authority. We heard Capt. Shipley's name
                        mentioned to-day frequently in high praise. A gentleman, he must be a
                        correct and good soldier.</p>
                    <p>And now we must close this communication. The "wee sma' hours" are upon us
                        and we must return to our home. It is hallowed ground we depart from, ground
                        consecrated forever as the last resting place of martyrs who surrendered
                        life in the noblest of causes. To this sacred spot will be ever applicable
                        the lines of the poet:</p>
                    <p><br>How sleep the brave who sink to rest <br>By all their country's wishes
                        blest? <br>When spring with dewy fingers cold, <br>Return to deck their
                        hallowed mould, <br>She there shall dress a sweeter sod <br>Than fancy's
                        feet have ever trod. <br>By fairy hands their knell is rung, <br>By forms
                        unseen their dirge is sung; <br>There honor comes, a pilgrim gray, <br>To
                        bless the turf that wraps their clay, <br>And freedom shall awhile repair,
                        <br>To dwell a weeping hermit there.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Hon. Joseph Holt on Employing Slaves as Soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The following is the chief part of a letter addressed to Secretary Stanton by
                        Mr. Holt:</p>
                    <p>The right of the Government to employ for the suppression of the rebellion
                        persons of African descent held to service or labor under the local laws,
                        rest firmly on two distinct grounds: First, as Property. Both our organic
                        law, and the usages of our institutions under it, recognize fully the
                        authority of the Government to seize and apply to public use private
                        property, on making compensation therefor. What the use may be to which it
                        is to be applied does not enter into the question of the right to make the
                        seizure, which is untrammeled in its exercise save by the single condition
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, as persons: While those of African descent held to service or labor
                        in several of the States, occupy under the laws of such States the status of
                        property, they occupy also under the Federal Government the status of
                        "persons." They are referred to conomine in the
                        Constitution of the Untied States, and it is not as property but as
                        "persons" that they are represented on the floor of Congress, and thus form
                        a prominent constituent element alike in the organization and in the
                        practical administration of the Government.</p>
                    <p>The obligation of all persons--irrespective of creed or color--to bear arms,
                        if physically capable of doing so, in defense of the government under which
                        they live, and by which they are protected, is one that is universally
                        acknowledged and enforced. Corresponding to this obligation is the duty
                        resting on those charged with the administration of the Government, to
                        employ such persons in the military service whenever the public safety may
                        demand it. Congress recognized both this obligation on the one hand, and
                        this duty on the other, when, by the 12th section of the act of 17th of
                        July, 1862, it was enacted that the President be and he is hereby authorized
                        to receive in the service of the United States, for the purpose of
                        constructing intrenchments, or performing camp service or any other labor,
                        or any military or naval service, for which they may be found competent,
                        persons of African descent, and such persons shall be enrolled and organized
                        under such regulations, not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws, as
                        the President may prescribe.</p>
                    <p>The terms of this act are without restrictions, and no distinction is made,
                        or was intended to be made, between persons of African descent held to
                        service or labor, and those not so held.</p>
                    <p>The President is empowered to receive them all into the military service, and
                        to assign them such duty as they may be found competent to perform. The
                        tenacious and brilliant valor displayed by troops of this race at Port
                        Hudson, Milliken's Bend and Fort Wagner, has sufficiently demonstrated to
                        the President and the country the character of service of which they are
                        capable. In the interpretation given to the enrollment act, free persons of
                        African descent are treated as "citizens of the United States," in the sense
                        of the law, and are everywhere being drafted into the military service.</p>
                    <p>In reference to the other class of persons of this race, those held to
                        service or labor, the twelfth section of the act of July is still in full
                        force, and the President may, in his discretion, receive them into the army
                        and assign them such field duty as he may deem them prepared to occupy. In
                        view of the loyalty of this race, and of the obstinate courage which they
                        have shown themselves to possess, they certainly constitute, at this crises
                        in our history, a most powerful and reliable arm of the public defence.
                        Whether this arm shall now be exerted is not a question of power or right,
                        but purely of policy, to be determined by the estimate which may be
                        entertained of the conflict in which we are engaged, and of the necessity
                        that presses to bring this waste of blood and treasure to a close.</p>
                    <p>A man precipitated into a struggle for life, on land or sea, instinctively
                        and almost necessarily puts forth every energy with which he is endowed, and
                        eagerly seizes upon every source of strength within his grasp; and a nation
                        battling for existence, that does not do the same, may well be regarded as
                        neither wise or obedient to that great law of self preservation from which
                        is derived our most urgent and solemn duties. That there exists a prejudice
                        against the employment of soldiers of African descent, is undeniable; it is,
                        however, rapidly giving way, and never had any foundation in reason or
                        loyalty. It originated with and has been diligently nurtured by those in
                        sympathy with the rebellion, and its utterance at this moment is necessarily
                        in the interests of treason.</p>
                    <p>Should the President feel that the public interests require he shall exert
                        the power with which he is clothed by the twelfth section of the act of the
                        17th July, his action should be in subordination to the constitution
                        principle which exacts that compensation shall be made for private property
                        devoted to the public uses. A just compensation to loyal claimants to the
                        service or labor of persons of African descent enlisted in our army, would
                        accord with the uniform practice of the Government and with the genius of
                        our institutions.</p>
                    <p>Soldiers of this class, after having perilled [sic] their lives in defence of
                        the Republic, could not be re-enslaved without a national dishonor revolting
                        and unendurable for all who are themselves worthy to be free. The
                        compensation made therefor[e] should be such as entirely to exhaust the
                        interest of claimants; so that when soldiers of this class lay down their
                        arms at the close of the war they may at once enter the enjoyment of that
                        freedom symbolized by the flag which they have followed and defended.</p>
