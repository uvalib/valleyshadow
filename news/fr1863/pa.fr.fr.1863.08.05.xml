                <commentary>The Repository reprints an article from the Knoxville Register, an
                    "organ of Jeff. Davis," for the "consideration of those Germans here and
                    elsewhere, who have been led, against their better judgment and the tradition of
                    their Faderland, by copperhead demagogues, to sympathize with the rebels, or at
                    least to place themselves in an attitude of opposition to the administration of
                    the United States Government. We think that with this knowledge of what the
                    rebels think of the Germans and how they purpose to treat them, any German who
                    still blindly follows their Copperhead leaders, is utterly destitute of
                    self-respect and of brotherly feeling for the gallant Germans in our army:"</commentary>

                <summary>Continues the Repository's argument with the Spirit over attitude of the
                    Democrat candidate for governor, Judge Woodward, toward foreigners. The
                    Repository asserts that Woodward motioned to exclude immigrants from voting or
                    holding office in Pennsylvania.</summary>

                        equality with negroes. When the government calls for white volunteers, they
                        denounce the war as a "nigger war" and discourage enlistments by declaring
                        that the "nigger-worshippers" must fight it out. When the authorities refuse
                        negroes as substitutes for white men who are drafted, they denounce the
                        government because it does not regard the negro soldier as on perfect

                    <p>War Department Adj't Gen's Office, Washington, July 31--General Orders, No.
                        252. The following order of the President is published for the information
                        and government of all concerned:</p>
                    <p>Executive Mansion, Washington, D.C., July 30, 1863--It is the duty of every
                        Government to give protection to its citizens, of whatever class, color or
                        condition, and especially to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the
                        public service. The law of nations, and the usages and customs of war, as
                        carried on by civilized powers, permit no distinction as to color in the
                        treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies. To sell or enslave any
                        captured person on account of his color, and for no offense against the laws
                        of war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a crime against the civilization of
                        the age.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States will give the same protection to all its
                        soldiers, and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of his
                        color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's
                        prisoners in our possession. It is therefore ordered, that for every soldier
                        of the United States killed in violation of the law, a Rebel soldier shall
                        be executed, and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a
                        Rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and
                        continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the
                        treatment due to a prisoner of war.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) Abraham Lincoln. <lb/>By order of the Secretary of War.

                        men from this county, reached Harrisburg last week, in care of Rev. Daniel
                        Hartman. The regiment, if not there by this time, will be there in a very
                        few days and the men will be mustered out, and discharged. It is conceded on
                        all hands that our drafted men from Pennsylvania made excellent soldiers,
                        and none surpassed Col. McKibbin's command in all the qualities which make
                        valuable and reliable men in the service. We doubt not that many of them
                        will volunteer after they have been home a little time, and again enter the
                        service during the war. Being experienced men, they will be entitled to the
                        liberal bounty of over $400 should they enlist.</p>
