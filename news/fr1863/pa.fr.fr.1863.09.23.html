<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the impending struggle between the friends of the government, and the
                        opposition in the North, there is nothing sadder than to see the intense
                        bitterness manifested by the last named party. It seems to resemble most of
                        all that concentrated malice which first planted its batteries against our
                        honored flag at Fort Sumter, or still later, with fixed bayonet hurled
                        itself in desperate but unavailing valor against the army of the nation at
                        Gettysburg. One needs but to glance at their state and county organs to find
                        them overflowing with bitterness. There is every degree of it, from that
                        which gives coloring to nice little stories of the war, insidiously
                        calculated for stirring up partisan blood, to open, furious tirade against
                        every act of the administration. We are not surprised at this, for it has
                        always been the distinguishing mark of a bad cause. Nor yet does the vigor
                        with which they seek to compass their ends and the measure of success that
                        accompanies it fill us with wonder. Zeal fired by malice often outruns truth
                        in its onward steady march; and the devil owes no small amount of his
                        success to his diligence. At the same time every right minded citizen looks
                        with alarm at the results of such conduct. Already have their cunning
                        appeals to party zeal and blind prejudice, their constant outcry about
                        "oppressive taxation," the unconstitutionality of the draft and the
                        "injustice of the conscription act to the poor" done too successfully their
                        work. The poor have been excited against the rich, one laboring class
                        against another, while riot and bloodshed such as would put to shame a
                        heathen nation have followed as the legitimate consequences of such
                        teaching. We have been pained to hear men in our own community, fresh from
                        the reading of a tory paper, express themselves in this way: "We poor men
                        have nothing to lose by this war yet we have done the fighting. We will now
                        stand back until the rich shoulder arms." From the same source too, we have
                        denunciations of the policy of the government in freeing the slaves on the
                        ground that they will take the place and lower the character of northern
                        laborers. Did we hope to find any honesty in a press thus unscrupulous in
                        the artifices they use to accomplish their ends, we should ask them to pause
                        and consider what means they have of allaying the spirit they are thus
                        conjuring up to their aid, should they be successful. Do they not fear,
                        that, like Banquo's ghost before the guilty king, it will remain to torment
                        them? Gov. Seymour stands before a mob of his constituents, red with the
                        blood of inoffensive blacks, wearied with plundering the houses of the rich,
                        and hoarse with outcries against the law that calls men to their country's
                        defence, and his piteous appeals to his "friends" are as impotent as the
                        pleading of man to angry flames which devoured his dwelling and which he
                        himself had kindled. Cannon and musketry must come in to uphold the majesty
                        of violated law. But we turn from those who seek in party triumph only their
                        own gain, to the poor man himself, and ask him to consider a few facts. No
                        one in the least acquainted with the antecedents of the rebellion which now
                        distracts our land, will venture to claim that it has any democratic
                        tendencies. It doe not look down to the condition of the poor and weak and
                        say, "it is for these that we have unsheathed the sword and thrown down the
                        gage of battle." Among the many reasons gathered together to justify it, we
                        have never yet seen the abject and disenfranchised condition of the poor
                        whites in the South assigned as one. On the contrary this rebellion is
                        notoriously a protest on the part of the South against the democratic
                        tendencies of the North. The "Yankee idea of universal suffrage" and the
                        dignity of labor are nowhere held in greater contempt than among the leaders
                        of the slaveholders' rebellion; and were they to succeed, it would be the
                        most fearful blow human liberty has received for many a long year. These
                        facts are so well known that it seems almost commonplace to repeat them; but
                        we ask him who has been led away by the delusion that he has no interest in
                        this war, because he has no property, to ponder them a moment. The poor man
                        is most vitally concerned at any time in the preservation of this
                        government, but most especially when the attack against it comes from a
                        party avowedly seeking its overthrow, that it may the more effectually
                        enslave the laboring class. The war, then, that resists this, is
                        emphatically the laboring man's war. It is the laboring man's flag, and the
                        laboring man's government that are endangered; for nowhere else on the broad
                        face of the earth, will he find his rights so secured, and himself so
                        effectually guarded from oppression, as here in the free North. It is an
                        utterly false conception that the excellency of government lies in the
                        protection it gives to property, and that it is most valuable to him who
                        possesses most wealth. Property is just as secure under the despotism of
                        Austria as here; just as safe in aristocratic England as in republican
                        America. In fact, an aristocracy is the rich man's government; it is made
                        especially with regard to his wants. But we claim, as the distinguishing
                        excellency of our government, the perfectness with which it secures the
                        rights of all, high, low, rich and poor. While all those who love a common
                        humanity are interested in its perpetuity, and the overthrow of this
                        rebellion, the poor man is especially so. It matters little under what
                        government the rich live; wealth, under any circumstance, must command
                        influence and station. But it makes every difference to the poor man. When a
                        proud aristocracy looks down upon him; when he no longer stands their peer
                        at the ballot-box; when he finds certain avenues to honor and influence in
                        society closed against him, then indeed has he lost most ruinously. To such
                        a condition we have at times feared he would be betrayed; for should the
                        principles advocated by southern secessionists be successful, either by
                        force of arms, or through the arts of their "constitutional friends" in the
                        North, we do not see how he can escape it. No class among us have been more
                        prodigal in their efforts to sustain our government than those who live and
                        labor in the humbler walks of life. While the rich have given their wealth,
                        they have poured out their blood. All honor to them! But we would charge
                        them to beware, lest deceived by a delusion, they lose the fruits of their
                        great sacrifice. A party of men calling themselves democratic ask for their
                        support. Democracy, the friend of slavery, the sworn ally of a proud
                        aristocracy, proclaiming that the true theory of society is "capital should
                        own labor!" The term in this case is a misnomer, and used only to deceive.
                        We ask the laboring man then to reflect. We appeal to his reason, not his
                        prejudices, and ask him to consider, whether in the ranks of those who are
                        notorious for their sympathy with this rebellion, and avowed opposition to
                        the war, who at this day are reckoned by the South as their best allies, and
                        who, to gratify their lordly masters, are ready to re-fasten the fetters
                        upon a thousand slaves, whether among these, or the ardent friends of the
                        government and the democratic doctrines of "liberty and equality," will he
                        find his truest and best friends?</p>
