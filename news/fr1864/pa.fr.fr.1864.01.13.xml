                <summary>The lengthy annual message of Governor A. G. Curtin, as delivered to the
                    Senate and House of Representatives of Pennsylvania. He suggests that the
                    legislature consider letting interest on debts be paid in U. S. Treasury notes,
                    because coin is so scarce. One of the several other issues the Governor raises
                    concerns providing aid to the families of soldiers who have been or will be
                    killed or wounded.</summary>

                    <p>Snow and sleighing, delightful words to the young, and foolish, and careless.
                        We confess that time was when we could enjoy a sleigh-ride, with all its fun
                        and frolic, its upsets and suppers, and colds and indigestions; but thank
                        time! we have outgrown such follies, and are disposed to take Ben.
                        Franklin's advice, should the fit take us to sleigh once more. We don't in
                        the least object to the merry laughter of the belles or cheery ring of the
                        bells as they hurry past our window, but we stir the fire, and do wonder how
                        they can prefer discomfort to comfort, frosted feet to slippers, and frozen
                        noses to genial warmth. Well, well, we all have to find out for ourselves,
                        like Solomon and Dr. Johnson, the vanity of human wishes! Still we must say
                        the sleighing <emph rend="italic">seems</emph> good, and we hardly think we
                        would get <emph rend="italic">very</emph> cold should we take a <emph
                            rend="italic">short</emph> ride. We shall see. We <emph rend="italic"
                            >have</emph> taken one more sleigh-ride--to Gettysburg, have once again
                        enjoyed the luxury of frosted feet, frozen ears, blue nose, chill-blains in
                        the fingers, and cold through the whole system. We must say the sleighing
                        was good--very good, but how much pleasanter a sleigh-ride would be in July!
                        Nature is all in the wrong, decidedly. We were chilled all the more at the
                        sight of the numerous rebel graves dotted here and there on hill-side and in
                        hollow-nameless graves where the poor fellows lie, dishonored and neglected.
                        God forgive the wicked leaders who know better than their misguided
                        followers. Many a fearful story was told us by eye-witnesses of the terrific
                        battle. Each historical location pointed out with painful minuteness, but we
                        confess the vividest impression upon our mind is that of carnage, slaughter,
                        death. Shame, a thousand hisses upon the man who stays at home, and raises
                        his voice in complaint of the noble Army of the Potomac! Such a battle and
                        such a victory should immortalize any army that ever existed. We were
                        compelled to believe what before we were afraid was an exaggeration. Gen.
                        Lee did really use the observatory of the College, protected by a hospital
                        flag, as a point for directing the battle. The testimony is such that should
                        we believe anything, we must credit this. Alas for poor Lee! The obscurest
                        grave of the meanest rebel in all the valley is honorable compared with the
                        reputation of Gen. Robert E. Lee.</p>
                    <p>Will some kind friend from Adams county tell us which order of architecture
                        those porches belong to, that are built in front of the houses along the
                        road between Cashtown and Gettysburg? At New Salem there are some seven or
                        eight new ones--impossible to be described, and can be compared only to huge
                        white rectangular ginger cakes set upon cambric needles. Were we seated
                        under one of these porches, we should feel like a fly caught under a
                        hydraulic press. Seriously, we beg the Sheriff of the county, or the
                        Commissioners, or somebody, to put a stop to it. The houses are handsome and
                        comfortable, but the porches are so absolutely out of proportion as to be
                        painful to a cultivated taste.</p>
                    <p>It is pleasant, <emph rend="italic">for a change</emph>, to come across a
                        real out-and-out Copperhead, (for we are one of those who are far from
                        believing a Democrat necessarily a Copperhead) and such a one we had the
                        pleasure to overhaul on our way. As a memorandum for posterity we here note
                        the heads of his arguments.</p>
                    <p>1. We are at present under a monarchy, because the President has ordered a
                        draft.</p>
                    <p>2. We have broken the Constitution into bits, because we have freed slaves in
                        the South.</p>
                    <p>3. We have made the nigger as good as a white man--<emph rend="italic"
                        >yes</emph> by G-- better, because we wish to pay him a dollar's worth of
                        work.</p>
                    <p>4. We have ignored Christianity by electing a Unitarian chaplain to Congress.</p>
                    <p>5. That he didn't think a decent white women ought to marry a nigger.</p>
                    <p>6. Negro Equality--Constitution--damn Lincoln--nigger--joker.</p>
                    <p>Our arguments ran as follows, number for number.</p>
                    <p>1. If we don't like King Stork, let us elect King Log at the end of the four
                        years.</p>
                    <p>2. The unconstitutionality of some parts of the Constitution had not
                        constituted ourselves <emph rend="italic">nor him</emph> constitutional
                        constituents--[Heavens! how he winced at this scathing remark!]</p>
                    <p>3. We <emph rend="italic">did</emph> think some niggers fully as good as some
                        white men--the black Douglas for instance as good as present company.</p>
                    <p>4. We thought a conscientious Unitarian somewhat more respectable than an
                        evil minded Lutheran.</p>
                    <p>5. We didn't think a decent white woman <emph rend="italic">would</emph>
                        marry a negro.</p>
                    <p>6. Good bye--We trust you may be converted before you are choked, or [here
                        Frank cracked the whip and away we trotted out of -----].</p>
                    <p>Stevens' Furnace--that is the stack of the Furnace--is a speaking commentary
                        upon the chivalry of the South. Well, we'd rather be Stevens than Lee.
                        Hurrah for Thaddeus--indeed we might say, from some of his old
                        speeches--Thaddeus of <emph rend="italic">war-saw</emph>. We were very cold
                        when we reached home--indeed, as a Southern friend of ours used to say, cold
                        as blazes.</p>

                <summary>The German Reformed Messenger, although still under the control of Rev. Dr.
                    Fisher, has changed proprietors. The firm of M. Keiffer and Co. has dissolved,
                    and Messrs. S. R. Fisher, A. B. Wingerd, John Meily, D. W. Gross, John Wiest and
                    G. S. Griffith constitute the new publishing firm, under the instructions of the
                    Synod of the German Reformed Church. The Church also puts out a weekly German
                    publication, the Kirchenzeitung, and another English language one, called the
                    Guardian.</summary>
