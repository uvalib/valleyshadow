<b>Davisegination</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Instances are common of the most afflictive separation of family relations
                    by this unnatural war. Brothers, and even parents and children, are found in the
                    ranks of the hostile armies. One of the most touching cases of this kind is that
                    of a son of the Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who is serving in the
                    National cause on the gunboat Carondolet, fighting to crush the Rebellion which
                    his father is leader of. The Davis junior is the son of Eliza, late a slave to
                    the patriarchal Davis. An officer of the army of Vicksburg who had heard of the
                    fact, verified it from Eliza's lips. How sharper than a serpent's tooth must be
                    the grief of that parent whom unrelenting fate compels to take sides against his
                    own son in a war for freedom!"<br>(Names in announcement:  Jefferson Davis)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Come all men from the east and the west, and let us sing the new
                        epithalamium. Let joy prevail throughout the land, for after man years of
                        bitterness between the radicals and Copperheads we are to have peace and
                        union, and felicity. The banns have been read--the marriage settlements are
                        being prepared--the bride is blushing, and timid, and anxious--the
                        bridegroom looks forward with impatience to the happy hour. The day of the
                        wedding has been fixed, and prudish gossips bid us anticipate happy fruits
                        from the happy union. It is no family affair of ours, perhaps but let us all
                        be neighborly and kind, and go to church on the appointed morning. We then
                        may greet the new couple and wish them all manner of happiness, and many,
                        many returns of the day.</p>
                    <p>Who are to be the happy pair? Nay, do not laugh and turn away, and chide and
                        deride them; for if they are to love and cherish each other, what right have
                        we to interfere or pronounce impediments? Miss Radical Democracy, from
                        Cleveland, supported by Misses Fremont and Cochrane, to Mr. Copperhead
                        Democracy, of Chicago, Whose next best friends have not been named--these
                        are the happy beings, and may the sun shine brightly upon them on the
                        eventful morning. People do talk, of course, and say that Misses Fremont and
                        Cochrane are two old maids who have been a long time in the market, and
                        having tried all means to make a match of their own, find the chances
                        becoming desperate and their charms familiar. They can find no opportunity,
                        in any respectable family, and so try their fortunes with this new concern
                        in Cleveland, in the hope that all will be arranged at Chicago, with wine
                        and cake for every guest. We do not know the terms of the settlement, but
                        many good things are reserved for the deserving old maids; and if the affair
                        can be arranged, the balance of their lives, dear old souls, may be spent
                        over snuff and tea. What delightful stories they could tell! What varied
                        experiences they have had--and if they are old maids, it is not their fault,
                        for they have been all their lives true to themselves, and anxious for a
                        change--how Miss Fremont went to California, and the gold mines, and the
                        Rocky Mountains, and the Blairs, and the Benton family, and South Carolina,
                        and Missouri, and emancipation, and among the Germans--and how she might
                        have been fortunate but for that ugly Mr. Lincoln, who was jealous of her,
                        and made people believe that she was no better than she ought to be! But a
                        more interesting story we shall have from Miss Cochrane. The old lady is
                        somewhat garrulous, and rather eccentric of speech, like most old maids, and
                        has been in more families than one since her earlier life. How she went to
                        Buffalo after the Van Burens, and to Mr. Pierce after certain loaves and
                        fishes, and to Richmond after Jefferson Davis, and to Mr. Lincoln after
                        further loaves and fishes, and down into the army, where that envious fellow
                        Burnside worried her so that she got sick and had to come home. She has had
                        her own time tramping around, this poor Miss Cochrane; and now there is hope
                        that she will have peace and comfort, and cake and wine, and tea and snuff,
                        at Chicago.</p>
                    <p>This, of course, will be a happy union. Ill-natured people tell us that there
                        has been much ill-feeling between the families, and that great scandal will
                        ensue. But if they love each other now, what difference will it make? "I am
                        sure," says Mrs. Malaprop. "I hated your poor, dear uncle, before marriage
                        as if, as if he'd been a black-amour, and yet, Miss, you are sensible what a
                        wife I make." There are two intimate friends of the family, for instance,
                        Mr. Wendell Phillips and Mr. Fernando Wood. We all know that Phillips and
                        Wood have been as far apart as the antipodes, as different in their temper
                        as the cobra-di-capello and the dove. They have been the political Montagu
                        and Capulet, never meeting without a brawl. Phillips has been a high-priest
                        among the anti-slavery radicals, and for twenty years has swung the censor
                        in the anti-slavery temple. Wood has been a prince among Secessionists, as
                        consistent but hardly as courageous a rebel as Davis or toombs [sic]. All
                        these things will be forgotten at Chicago--and when the benediction is
                        pronounced over the newly-united Copperhead-Radicals, their glasses will
                        clink together in the joyous libation. We shall have McClellan and
                        McKinstry, Fitz John Porter and the staff-majors with unpronounceable names,
                        William B. Reed and Mrs. B. Cady Stanton, Charles Ingersoll and Mrs. Abby
                        Forster, Samuel S. Cox and Frederick Douglass, all surrounding the
                        newly-married pair and overwhelming them with congratulations. Charles
                        Mackay, with his Cockney Copperhead rhymes, will write the nuptial song; and
                        the "night-clerk" of the World, with his German
                        friends of the New Nation, will sing the chorus.</p>
                    <p>It is not for us to be too busy with our neighbors' affairs, or to ask
                        impertinent questions. The New Nation tells us
                        that the main cause of this affectionate sympathy between the Copperheads
                        and Radicals is "the hatred of Lincoln." This controlling thought overrides
                        and surpasses all difference of principle, of record, of former association.
                        What are freedom and Union compared with the "hatred of Lincoln?" This is
                        the chain that links them all together. This "hatred of Lincoln" is so
                        engrossing, so intense, so all-pervading--so general in its application,
                        from Wendell Phillips to Jefferson Davis--that we venture to make a
                        suggestion. Why not transfer the marriage-ceremony from Chicago to Richmond?
                        If "hatred of Lincoln" is to be the motto of the new epithalamium, there
                        will be more singers in Richmond than in Cleveland, or Chicago, or the Five
                        Points. Let them all herd together, and go to the place of all places where
                        the "hared of Lincoln" is a virtue and a religion. They need not have any
                        hesitancy about getting through the lines. Vallandigham found it easy
                        enough, and if these people are really desirous of going Gen. Butler will be
                        happy to meet them at City Point, and escort them as far as the guns of Fort
                        Darling.</p>
