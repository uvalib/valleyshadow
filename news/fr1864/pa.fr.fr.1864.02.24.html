                    <p>The Spirit, speaking of the proposition to guard
                        the Commonwealth against claims for military damages of men who have aided
                        and abetted the enemy, insists that there shall be no oath whatever imposed.
                        It calls upon the Democratic members of the legislature to "defeat the bill itself, rather than have this odious
                            provision in it!" To this Mr. Sharpe and every member of the
                        committee, both union and Democrat, respond by requiring a just test of
                        loyalty. The legislature don't seem to appreciate the Spirit's anxiety to protect men who may have given, aid comfort
                        and information to the rebels, and they will probably pass the bill in spite
                        of its command to "defeat" it.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>What remains of the gallant 77th Regiment is now at home on furlough. This
                        Regiment, as most of our readers know, was organized in this town in
                        September, 1861. The original commander was Col. F.S. Stumbaugh, and it was
                        mainly owing to his efforts that the Regiment was speedily fitted out for
                        field operations. When Col. Stumbaugh took command of a Brigade he was
                        succeeded by Lieut. Col. Housum, and upon the death of that brave man the
                        command devolved upon Capt. Rose. The Regiment has participated in some of
                        the hardest fights and undergone some of the severest marches in the history
                        of the war. It was conspicuous at Shiloh; lost its commander at Stone Riber;
                        and covered itself with glory at Chattanooga and Chickamauga. These were
                        leading engagements, to speak nothing of the almost numberless skirmishes
                        and minor contests in which it took an active part. When the Regiment left
                        Pittsburg join the army in Kentucky, it numbered, including the Battery
                        attached, 1,000 men; now it numbers scarce 250, disease and death having
                        thus decimated its strength. Out of its present strength only eleven have
                        refused to re-enlist. It is but just to say however, that most of this
                        number are suffering from disability, and are to some extent unfitted for
                        service. We hail the return of these brave soldiers with inexpressible
                        pleasure, and would add that no evidences of respect can be tendered them
                        but what the richly merit.</p>
