<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The desperation of the defeated Democrats in this Congressional and Judicial
                        district fitly emblems their hostility to law and order, and shows with what
                        tenacity they cling to the spoils of office. After failing in their studied
                        efforts to disfranchise our gallant soldiers, they next resolved to defy the
                        law and defame them out of their votes; and to that end the Democratic
                        return judges have been manipulated by crafty and reckless politicians and
                        driven to open, insolent disregard of the laws they were sworn to execute.</p>
                    <p>The plain English of the complications in our congressional and judicial
                        districts is that the Democratic candidates for Judge and Congress were
                        defeated at the polls by the army vote; and not relishing defeat they, or
                        their friends, resolved that they wouldn't be defeated if enough of votes
                        could be crowded out to elect them. Just how they were to be crowded out,
                        they did not seem much to care, only so that apparent majorities should come
                        to their side. To this end, Mr. O. N. Shannon, Prothonotary of Bedford
                        county--the same who withdrew his subscription to the soldier bounty
                        fund--took the lead, and manifested his appreciation of his solemn oath of
                        office, and his respect for the integrity of our elections, by usurping the
                        sanctions of a court in a contested election, and rejected such returns as
                        did not suit his views. We say he rejected such as suited him, because he
                        had no right--not even the shadow of a right to reject any; and all his
                        proceedings were extra-judicial to use a charitable phrase, and villainous
                        and fraudulent to apply the honest Saxon. His
                        duties as Prothonotary, touching election returns are thus clearly defined
                        by the law:</p>
                    <p>Section 1--It shall be the duty of the Prothonotary of the county, to whom
                        such returns shall be made, to deliver to the return
                            Judges of the same county, a copy, certified under his hand and seal of
                            the return of votes so transmitted to him by the Judges of the
                        election, as aforesaid or as officially certified by the Secretary of
                        the Commonwealth, as aforesaid, by said Prothonotary."</p>
                    <p>Instead of obeying the instructions "to deliver to the return judges" the
                        returns, Mr. Shannon imagined himself to be judge and jury to determine just
                        what votes should be allowed in the count and what should not ; and of
                        course, he only rejected such votes as did not benefit his particular
                        ticket. To consummate a fraud upon the people, upon the soldiers, and upon
                        Judge Klug and Gen. Koontz, Mr. Shannon deliberately defied the law,
                        disregarded his oath of office, and has clouded himself with infamy. But he
                        was not alone in his insolent disregard of sworn duty. The return judges of
                        the Democratic faith in Fulton, Bedford, Adams and Franklin seem to have
                        been trained to aid in the fraud; and with one accord they seem to have been
                        impressed with the necessity of rejecting enough votes to elect their
                        candidates. How far they, in this doing, disregarded the law, let the law
                        itself explain. Their duty touching election
                        returns are thus defined:</p>
                    <p>"The return Judges, so met shall include in their
                            enumeration, the rates so returned, and thereupon shall proceed, in all
                            respects, in the like manner as is prescribed by law, in cases where all
                            the votes shall have been given at the usual place of election."</p>
                    <p>And lest some fool or scoundrel should not understand the law, or pretend not
                        to understand it, its provisions go so far as to expressly forbid that they
                        shall assume to determine the legality of any votes brought before them. It
                        says in section 79:</p>
                    <p>"The clerks hereupon shall in the presence of the judges, make out returns in
                        the manner here-inafter directed, which shall be signed by all the Judges
                        present, and attested by said clerks and "it shall not be lawful for said
                        Judges or clerks; and it shall not be lawful for said
                            Judges or clerks, in casting up the votes which shall appear to have
                            been given, as shown by the certificates under the 76th and 77th
                        sections of this act to omit or reject any part
                        thereof, except where in the opinion of said Judges, such certificate
                        is so defective, as to prevent the same from being
                            understood, and computed in adding together the number of votes, in
                            which case it shall be the duty of said clerks to make out a true and
                            exact copy of said paper or certificate; to be signed by said
                        Judges, and attested by said clerks, and attached to and transmitted
                        with said return to the Secretary of the Commonwealth &amp; c."</p>
                    <p>It will be seen by the foregoing section of the law that neither the
                        Prothonotary nor the return judges have any right whatever to determine the
                        legality of the votes returned. They are sword to receive, compute and
                        certify them, and "It shall not be lawful for
                        them to omit or reject any part thereof!" It is
                        to pretended in these cases that any part of the vote returned could not be
                        "understood." The trouble was that it was too easily understood, and for
                        that reason it was rejected. It was understood that it defeated two
                        Democratic candidates, and to defraud those honestly elected, and with that
                        view only could men thus deliberately cast aside their oath of office and
                        usurp the functions of the courts. They are forbidden even to reject for any
                        sort of informality. If the votes lack all the formalities of the law, they
                        must nevertheless be returned by the Prothonotary and counted and certified
                        by the judges. Such is the language of the law, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"No mere informality in the manner of carrying out, or executing, any of the
                        provision of this act shall invalidate any election held under the same or
                            authorize the returns to be rejected or set
                        aside."</p>
                    <p>In the face of all these provisions of the law under which the return judges
                        act, and which they are sworn to execute faithfully, the Democratic return
                        judges have pretended to give certificates of election to F.M. Kimmell for
                        Judge, and A.H. Coffroth for Congress, in the face of an undisputed record
                        defeating them both. That Gen. Coffroth will take any sort of a certificate
                        and imagine himself a Congressman until his vain dreams are dispelled when
                        Gen. Koontz takes his seat, is natural enough and will surprise no one; but
                        can F.M. Kimmel accept a certificate in plain violation of law, and assume
                        the functions of an office thereby which charges him with the execution of
                        the laws? Coffroth has nothing to lose--neither reputation nor honors, but
                        Judge Kimmell has been Judge and retired with credit, and he cannot now, in
                        the face of the law, accept so sacred a trust merely because a few mad
                        political partizans have been false to their oaths and faithless to justice.
                        No one knows better than himself that return judges have no right to reject
                        any returns whatever, and that the whole power to determine questions of
                        illegal voting belongs to the courts; and for him to claim the advantage of
                        an insolent wrong--a palpable infraction of the laws of the State, and a
                        shameless disregard of the oaths of the return judges, would make our
                        judicial tribunal but a mockery of justice and of law.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Koontz has a regular certificate of election; will be proclaimed elected
                        by the Governor, and will be called in the House and sworn. Attempts to
                        defraud him by a bogus certificate given Gen. Coffroth will be entirely
                        futile; but should Judge Kimmell accept the brief and blotted honors
                        presented to him by men who seem insensible to duty or shame, a contest
                        before the legislature must ensue and Judge King would be in the false
                        position of a contestant, while he is entitled by every declaration of the
                        law to his commission on the return. It matters not, so far as the
                        correctness of our position goes, whether the legal votes would elect Judge
                        Kimmell or not. Not knowing anything about it, we do not assume to determine
                        that question; but prima facie Judge King is
                        elected, and the law declares in the most unequivocal language that he shall
                        be so returned, and that Judge Kimmell shall be contestant if they be any
                        contest. We shall see what we shall see, with abiding faith that all will
                        end well.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Chambersburg was thrown into a fever of excitement on Saturday night last, by
                        the apparently well authenticated rumor that Maj. Gilmore with fifty of his
                        rebel command had crossed the Potomac at Shepperdstown on Saturday. Gen.
                        Couch made prompt disposition of his forces to meet any movement of the
                        enemy by throwing his men forward to the border to cover the more exposed
                        points; and as the troops left this point for the border our people were
                        apprehensive that a small raiding party might reach our town. Considerable
                        uneasiness prevailed during the night; but with Sunday morning came
                        assurances of safety, and the venerable village assumed its serenity again.
                        We submit whether it is not worthy of reflection on the part of every
                        able-bodied citizen, whether a rumor of fifty or even five hundred rebels
                        advancing, upon this point, should create alarm
                        and confusion? If there were no military forces here at all, the people of
                        Chambersburg could readily defend themselves
                        against small raids, and they would do so if they
                        had but organization. Let us have organization at once, not only here, but
                        throughout the entire county, and raiding and all danger of raids will be at
                        an end.</p>
                    <p>The fact which led to the fluster here on Saturday night were about as
                        follows: On Thursday Major Gilmore with perhaps twenty men, was in
                        Shepperdstown. He robbed the stores and individuals in the most approved
                        rebel style, and we learn, killed one man named Snyder for want of
                        promptness in delivering up his pocketbook. After glutting his appetite in
                        the way of free-booting, the command dispersed, and a portion of the party
                        crossed the river and scattered through the country in citizens dress,
                        doubtless to look out good points for plunder. That a portion of them are in
                        this county there is no reasonable doubt, as three of them were arrested on
                        the cars on Saturday last near Newville. The mean robbery, arson and murder
                        if necessary to carry out their plans, and every citizen should be on the
                        alert to compass their arrest. No stranger should be allowed to loiter in
                        any part of the county without being required to give a satisfactory account
                        of his business, and failing to do that, he should be allowed the privilege
                        of explaining his business to the nearest military commander. The common
                        safety demands that suspicious characters should not be tolerated at all in
                        any part of the border, and if honest and innocent men suffer some
                        inconvenience at times, they can well afford it in view of the perils
                        against which we have to guard. Let every citizen be vigilant, and fully
                        prepared for rebel prowlers, and in their vigilance and preparation will be
                        their entire safety.</p>
