                    <p>Camp Two Miles North of Marietta, Ga., <lb/>June 20th, 1864.</p>
                    <p>More than a month has passed since I last wrote to you from near Kingston,
                        Georgia. I would liked to have written again before this, but time would not
                        allow. Since then we had quite a stirring time. We left our camp near
                        Kingston on the 23d of May, and crossed the Etowaw river some six miles to
                        the right of Kingston. We crossed on a splendid bridge, which the enemy in
                        his hurry had not time to destroy. A few miles south of the river we found
                        ourselves on the direct Atlanta road again. On the 24th of May we marched
                        hard all day, and on the 25th until noon, when we were halted on the north
                        bank of the Pumpkin Vine Creek. Now we could hear heavy volleys of musketry
                        several miles in our front, which plainly told us "fighting Joe" was into
                        them again. Our infantry as they came up all crossed the bridge over Pumpkin
                        Vine Creek, and battery after battery came up and pulled into park. The
                        ground the rebels chose to fight us on this time was so densely wooded that
                        artillery could not be used with any advantage. Before night all the
                        batteries, with the exception of one or two, of the 5th and 20th Corps, had
                        pulled into park. Fortunately Generals Hooker and Howard soon succeeded in
                        driving the enemy so that we could get some artillery into position. On the
                        morning of the 27th all the batteries found themselves in position along the
                        line, with heavy works in front, and Battery B got into a very hot place,
                        which has invariably been its luck since we started out on this campaign. We
                        had our Battery strongly fortified within one hundred yards of the enemy's
                        main line of works. During the afternoon of the 27th we were in a
                        desperately hot place, and had it not been for our strong works half of our
                        men would have been killed. We had only five wounded, who were all shot
                        through the port holes. Three of these were "No. 1" at their pieces. If I
                        were to give the details of one day's fight after the other, it would fill
                        one side of your paper, so I will just give you details of some of our
                        warmest engagements. Captain S.M. McDowell is now Chief of Artillery in the
                        1st Division, 4th Corps, and is on Maj. Gen. Stanley's staff. His command
                        was very sorry to lose him, but he richly deserves the honorable position he
                        now fills. Captain Simonson, who was Chief of Artillery of the 1st Division,
                        was killed in one of the late engagements while getting a position for one
                        of his batteries. He was a heroic and daring officer, and was beloved by all
                        who knew him. We have now but two commissioned officers present with our
                        Battery, and are entitled to five. Lieut. Ziegler is in command. He is a
                        brave man and good soldier, and I know will take the Battery through any
                        fight with credit. Since Capt. McDowell is on Gen. Stanley's staff, he had a
                        musket ball put through his cap. Lieut. E.F. Shatzer, commanding the third
                        section, had it in the hottest place any part of our Battery has been yet.
                        The whole Battery was ordered to the left to support the 2nd Division,
                        (Newton's) 4th Corps, and there was only position for two pieces. Lieut.
                        Shatzer advanced within one hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's strong
                        fortifications, which were fully thirty feet thick. He had no cover whatever
                        for his men, but open he would, and fired thirty-six rounds with the two
                        pieces before retiring. At one piece he lost one man killed, and at the
                        other, four badly wounded. These were all the casualties, but there was
                        scarcely a man but had his garments cut with bullets. The Lieutenant had a
                        hole through his overcoat. Gen. Geo. H. Thomas personally complimented our
                        Battery for its accurate shooting, and the good conduct of the men in the
                        face of the enemy. We have frequently gone out on the skirmish line with our
                        Battery since this campaign. Since we left Blue Springs our Battery has been
                        much cut down by disease and wounds. This is too hard a campaign for new
                        recruits. We have now over thirty sick and wounded men in the hospital, but
                        we still have one hundred and forty-one casualties. [We have already
                        published them.--Ed.]</p>
                    <p>Samuel Dine, your old townsman and wood-chopper, was wounded the second
                        time--first at Chickamauga severely, but through good attendance he got well
                        in time to enter the veteran service. This time, he was struck on the
                        forehead by a minnie, which made a terrible gash. He walked to the hospital,
                        and two days after receiving his wound told the Surgeon in charge of the
                        hospital he wanted to go to his company. The Doctor said he could not do
                        duty. He said he could, and would remain no longer. The Doctor said he was a
                        brave man, and let him return to duty.</p>
                    <p>I must not forget the 77th Regt. Pa. V. V., which belongs to our Brigade.
                        This heroic little band, commanded by Col. Rose, has suffered more than any
                        other regiment in the Brigade. It lost forty men killed and wounded. I was
                        with Capt. John Walker, of Co. A, this forenoon. He told me there was but
                        one Chambersburger wounded, by name Mr. Troutman. One of his heels was shot
                        off. I do not think there is a company in the regiment or brigade that has
                        done more duty or been on the skirmish line more than Capt. Walker's, and
                        the Captain remains with and endures all the hardships of his men. He is a
                        good soldier, and deserves promotion. The 4th Corps has done more fighting
                        than any other Corps in this campaign. I hope you will excuse this miserable
                        letter as it was written within six hundred yards of the rebel
                        fortifications, and minnies and shells constantly whizzing over and around
                        my head.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Tuesday the 2nd of August--one week from Tuesday next--the people of
                        Pennsylvania will be called upon to approve or reject several important
                        amendments proposed to the Constitution of the State. The election will be
                        held during the same hours, and governed by the same laws in all respects,
                        as our general elections. Three distinct propositions or amendments are to
                        be submitted to the popular vote, and separate ballots headed "First
                        Amendment," "Second Amendment" and "Third Amendment," with "For the
                        Amendment" or "Against the Amendment" below, must be cast. The second and
                        third amendments relate to legislative restrictions which are essentially
                        just and expedient, and they will be adopted without serious opposition. The
                        following are the several amendments in full:</p>
                    <p>There shall be an additional section to the third article of the
                        Constitution, to be designated as section four, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Section 4. <emph rend="italic">Whenever any of the qualified electors of
                            this Commonwealth shall be in any actual military service under, under a
                            requisition from the President of the United States, or by the authority
                            of this Commonwealth, such electors may exercise the right of suffrage
                            in all elections by the citizens, under such regulations as are, or
                            shall be, prescribed by law, as fully as if they were present at their
                            usual place of election.</emph>"</p>
                    <p>Section 3. There shall be two additional sections to the eleventh article of
                        the Constitution, to be designated as sections eight, and nine, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Section 8. No bill shall be passed by the Legislature, containing more than
                        one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in the title, except
                        appropriation bills.</p>
                    <p>"Section 9. No bills shall be passed by the Legislature granting any powers,
                        or privileges, in any case, where the authority to grant such powers, or
                        privileges, has been, or may hereafter be, confer[r]ed upon the courts of
                        this Commonwealth."</p>
                    <p>The only contest will be on the first proposition--that confer[r]ing the
                        right of suffrage upon our gallant soldiers in the field, and it becomes the
                        friends of our heroes to be fully prepared for the issue. That the
                        Democratic leaders will exhaust themselves by every means short of open,
                        manly opposition, to defeat this amendment we cannot doubt. Judge Woodward
                        delivered the decision of the Supreme Court of this State in 1862
                        disfranchising them, after their vote had been counted during the Mexican
                        war, and in the election of 1861 without question; and the Democrats of the
                        legislature last winter were prevented from defeating the proposition only
                        because they were in a minority. Had they controlled either branch of the
                        legislature, our soldiers would have been denied the right to vote solely
                        because they are periling their lives to preserve our Nationality. True, the
                        Democrats of the House did not vote directly against the amendment
                        confer[r]ing the right of soldiers; but they voted against the second and
                        third propositions in a body, with the single exception of Mr. Marshall, of
                        Adams, knowing well that to defeat one would defeat all. The Constitution of
                        the State requires in express terms that amendments must pass two
                        consecutive legislatures without alteration, before they can be submitted to
                        the people; and had they been modified by the failure to adopt all the
                        propositions passed by the previous legislature, all the
                        amendments--including the one giving the right of suffrage to
                        soldiers--would have been postponed for another year, and the army vote
                        would not have participated in the coming Presidential election. Thanks to a
                        Union legislature, this unmanly effort to disfranchise our soldiers failed,
                        and a full vote now is only necessary to enable the gallant defenders of the
                        Union to vote for the cause for which they have periled everything.</p>
                    <p>We have closely observed the action of the Democratic press and politicians
                        throughout the State on this vital question; and the first word has yet to
                        be given to the public from that party in favor of allowing our soldiers to
                        vote. While the Union State Committee has earnestly advocated the measure in
                        an elaborate and pointed address to the people of the State, and the entire
                        Union press heartily commends it to voters, not a single Democratic journal
                        has yet spoken of it, save to ridicule or denounce it, and the Democratic
                        State Committee has thus far failed to call attention to the special
                        election. In short the Democratic politicians are opposed to confer[r]ing
                        the right of suffrage upon our volunteers, believing as they do that
                        soldiers who fight for a common Nationality will not vote with its foes.
                        They have not dared to array themselves openly against it, for they fear the
                        honest of their own party cannot be driven to disfranchise the army; but
                        their hope is that the election may be neglected, and that with a quiet
                        organization they may succeed by default of its friends. If any man doubts
                        the hostility of the Democracy to the soldiers voting, let him wait until
                        the vote is polled and compare the returns from Allegheny or Lancaster with
                        the returns from such intensely copperhead counties as Berks and
                        Northampton.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to Union men to be on their guard. They owe it to the brave men who
                        are defending our homes and our sacred cause, to give one day to secure them
                        their civil rights, and declare to our patriotic men who are in the service,
                        and who may hereafter enter it, that they shall not sacrifice their rights
                        as citizens by protecting our government from murderous traitors. Let
                        patriotic men of every party make a common effort in behalf of our
                        battle-scarred heroes, and declare in favor of their right to vote by such
                        an overwhelming majority as will make the foes of our Nation's cause and of
                        its defenders hide their treachery in sullen silence.</p>

                    giving Coffroth the credit for the change when "it was first urged in the

                <summary>The Repository discusses the perambulations of Colonel Pearce. When the
                    rebels were at the border, Pearce left his troops to give orders to several of
                    his companies on the railroad and detoured in Chambersburg. The Repository
                    criticizes Pearce for not meeting his troops at Harper's Ferry.</summary>

                <summary>Reports that the Headquarters of the Provost Marshal made a draft in
                    Chambersburg on July 5, for "actual deficiencies on the late draft" which
                    resulted due to exemptions. The new law that abolishes commutation does not
                    apply to this draft, but anyone who avoids this draft by paying a commutation,
                    can be drafted by a new call. A list of the Franklin men follows: Antrim
