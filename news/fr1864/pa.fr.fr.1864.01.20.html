<b>Gossip with our Friends</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author addresses the ladies of Chambersburg, telling them that if
                    Chambersburg had a fancy restaurant and bar, their "male appendages" would be
                    far less likely to go to the cities on "necessary business."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Among the many advantages possessed by a gossiper, preeminent is that of
                        gossiping about what is not (the ladies will please note and appreciate,) as
                        well as what is. We love our native town with all her faults and wants; and
                        often plan in our mind what we would do were we
                        elected Burgess or High Constable. We are not fully aware how far the powers
                        of the above mentioned officers extend, but would presume either could
                        accomplish what we purpose should ever have the chance. Chambersburg needs a
                        good Restaurant, with its accompanying bar, very much. Now we know that the
                        ladies (God bless them) as rule are opposed to such things, but we will for
                        their benefit explain. We have restaurants in town, but not a single fancy
                        one. Let no Restaurateur take offence at what we say for each one may, if he
                        will, open one whenever he pleases. Ladies, have any of you ever calculated
                        how much money is spent in this town per month for ale and oysters and such
                        like? We will whisper it to you, but you must not breathe it, for should
                        your lords (don't bridle) discover the source of your information our life
                        would not be worth a tinker's --hem! On second thoughts, however, we think
                        we had better not tell it. You were never in a
                        first-class restaurant were you? (We still address the ladies.) Some we dare
                        say have not. Shade of Michael Angelo assist us! Ladies, imagine a spacious
                        room hung round with handsome pictures, such as you never saw in your
                        parlors, portraits of celebrated danseuses, race horses, Heenan, Morrissey,
                        King, Sayers; Adam and Eve in the garden, Susannah surprised at her bath by
                        the Elders (Biblical); Jupieter et Semele et Danse et Alise, Diana et
                        Endymion, Cupid et Psyche, Venus et Adonis (classical); correct likenesses
                        of Thais, Aspasia, Sappho, etc., etc. One entire side of this spacious room
                        is devoted to a handsome marble-topped counter, upon which are arranged at
                        intervals silver chafing dishes containing fried oysters, pigs' feet, fish,
                        fowls, birds, scallops, slaw, pies, everything edible. Behind the same, on
                        gorgeous shelving are tastefully placed cut-glass decanters containing many
                        colored liquids; stone bottles holding within their ample bellies many a
                        kind of malt liquor; pyramids of limes and lemons. Immediately underneath
                        you will find casks and barrels. Cigars and tobacco too are there, crackers
                        and bread and cheese, spices and condiments; what will make you hungry, that
                        which will induce thirst. Here and there are little apartments curtained off
                        where your husbands and sons can eat and drink and be merry without
                        annoyance from vulgar gaze. Some restaurants occupy the entire building, in
                        which case there are private rooms to which your husbands can take other
                        men's wives to what Gallic neighbors call un petit
                            souper. (These houses have all private entrances.) Shut your
                        eyes, if you are alone and your husband is on
                        business to the city (or even to Harrisburg), and if it be say 11
                        P.M., and conceive the scene of such a room as we have faintly pictured,
                        brilliantly lighted, adorned with huge mirrors and crowded with
                        gentlemen--add to all this the clatter of knife and fork, popping of corks,
                        exchange of jest, oaths and laughs, cigar smoke, tobacco spittle, and an
                        occasional fight. The picture can be made more complete by introducing the
                        billiard table and card room which occasionally accompany the foregoing. Now
                        ladies, dear ladies, let us have such an establishment here, and my word for
                        it, we (your male appendages) would not find so much necessary business to take us to the cities. As Patrick Henry
                        once felicitously remarked upon a like occasion, "if this be gossip, make
                        the most of it."</p>

                        from Pennsylvania. Formed in this place in 1861, it was originally attached

                        independent organization. Its first officer was Capt. Meuler, who

                    have the preference over all others, and no others will be considered."<br>
