<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Lieut. Gen. Grant has assumed the command of the armies of the United States,
                        and his orders are supreme in all the Military Departments. It is understood
                        that his forces are about to take the offensive at all important points, and
                        the plan of the campaign of course contemplates the occupation of various
                        portions of country not now, and never as yet, held by our forces. It is due
                        to the sacred Nationality for which we are struggling, that the wanton
                        destruction of the private property of the enemy be arrested; and it would
                        commend the new Chieftain and his holy cause were he to declare to the world
                        by an order, that this war is not urged against private citizens,
                        non-combatants or private property. We know that such is the theory on which
                        the war has thus far been conducted; but it has been shamefully violated in
                        various instances by subordinate commanders. The destruction of private
                        property may be necessary at times to coerce treacherous citizens into
                        decency, but the burning of houses, mills, and other property simply because
                        they belong to the enemy, is unwarranted by any rule of civilized warfare;
                        and we cannot afford to be responsible for it. True, the enemy may provoke
                        it by similar acts of barbarity, or by the brutal treatments of our living
                        prisoners and the more horrible atrocities committed upon our heroic dead;
                        but this will not justify the almost unbridled license given to our men in
                        several instances recently, to destroy private property.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Various movements are now on foot to connect the Cumberland Valley with the
                        Connelsville Railroad and the Broad Top Coal region; but we fear that the
                        enterprise must fail unless there can be some concentration of our energies
                        and capital. The Southern Pennsylvania Railroad Company, formerly known as
                        the Sherman's Valley, is now making an effort to reach the East Broad Top
                        coal lands, and we learn that at a meeting of the Directors held on the 19th
                        ult., it was resolved to locate the road through Fulton county before the
                        first of May next. This road, as at present managed, cannot make its way to
                        the point proposed. If it is taken hold of by New York, as its present
                        owners contemplate, it may become a through route to the Ohio, and thus
                        reach the Broad Top; but as a local effort it cannot succeed. It has a
                        feasible route, and it may be disposed of as a speculation and be made by
                        New York.</p>
                    <p>The Pittsburgh people are moving to extend Con[illegible]sville through
                        Cowan's Gap and Greencastle to join the Western Maryland; and another
                        project proposes the extension of the Columbia Railroad through Gettysburg
                        and Chambersburg to Broad Top. This should be the acceptable measure of the
                        people of Southern Pennsylvania, it offers the very best connections, and at
                        once shortens the distance to Baltimore and puts us in direct communication
                        with the Broad Top Coal lands. The road from Reading to Columbia was
                        complete last week, and is now running trains regularly; and the new route
                        proposed would put this point in the very best possible position for
                        receiving and shipping [illegible].</p>
                    <p>The Cumberland Valley must get direct communication with Broad Top at an
                        early day. It has become a necessity; and the growing trade of the country
                        clearly points to another great Pathway to the West through this region. The
                        Southern counties should lose no time in making common cause in this
                        important movement, and secure the priceless advantages it offers us.</p>

<b>Glanders in Horses</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author seeks to educate the public about the glanders, which is much
                    like consumption. This dread disease is "insidious," "incurable," "contagious,"
                    and may be contracted by people. Many of the army horses have it, and the author
                    warns against purchasing government stock that may then infect existing stock.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Popular Prejudices</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author observes that "there is a class of farmers who seem to think
                    that they have already attained perfection in their way," and that they
                    generally are the ones "whose fields are least productive and most untidily
                    kept." He urges these men to improve their farms by improving themselves, and
                    exhorts them to "dig up those deep-rooted prejudices which fill your minds."<br>
