<b>The Military Claim Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author expresses amazement that the bill for the payment of military
                    damages in the border counties continues to be subjected to fierce political
                    debate. The bill has finally been referred to the committee on Federal
                    Relations, "although it is clearly not within the legitimate province of that
                    committee," but in that committee it should find a refuge from the political
                    strife "aimed at its vitals."<br>

<b>The Township Elections</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author urges Union men to come out for the elections for township and
                    other local officers in order to try to regain positions lost to the Democrats
                    in the election the previous spring, and as preparation for the national
                    election to come.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The township elections for election and other local officers will take place
                        on Friday of next week, the 18th inst., and the Union men should be on their
                        guard against surprise by the well organized Democracy. Last Spring the
                        Democrats elected every Judge of election in the county but two, while thirteen of the twenty-two election
                        districts give Gov. Curtin a majority last fall. The North Ward and
                        Greenvillage were the only districts in which we had Union election
                        boards--all the rest, even Mercersburg, the Old Gibralter, chose Democratic
                        officers. We doubt not that very many Union votes were lost to the party
                        last fall by these adverse boards, and it is the imperative duty of Union
                        men to give timely attention to the elections now near at hand.</p>
                    <p>The coming Presidential election will be the most important in the history of
                        the government, and the friends of the administration cannot prepare for
                        action too soon. It is of the first importance that the local elections
                        should be carried wherever it is in the power of the Union voters to do so;
                        and we appeal to them to commence the work of organization at once.
                        Guilford, Antrim, Fayetteville, Washington, Peters, Montgomery, Loudon,
                        Fannettsburg, Dry Run, Sulphur Spring, Mount Rock, Warren and the South
                        Ward, should each reverse their present election boards and carry their
                        local tickets. It can be done if the Union men
                        resolve to do it, and the time to begin the work is now. It would be
                        discreditable to our organization, and fearfully peril our cause, if by our
                        remis[s]ness we surrender to the foes of the government the control of our
                        election boards and the district offices. Union men! the place to begin the
                        good work for the great struggle of 1864 is at the township elections on
                        Friday of next week!</p>

<b>(No Title)</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit of the 17th ult. protested against any
                        oath being applied to claimants for military damages. Mr. Kelly had offered
                        a resolution instructing the committee to require parties to "furnish
                        positive proofs of their loyalty," and the Spirit
                        called upon the Democratic members to "oppose all
                            amendments to the bill and defeat the bill itself, rather than
                        have this odious provision in it." Mr. Sharpe did
                        amend the bill so as to require claimants to furnish "positive proofs" of
                        loyalty by solemn oath, and now the Spirit says
                        "there is not a Democrat in the county that objects to taking the oath
                        prescribed by the bill as reported by the committee." What side of the
                        question it will take in its next issue, we couldn't guess. As it has
                        already been on both sides, it will have the merit of consistency let it go
                        as it may hereafter.</p>
