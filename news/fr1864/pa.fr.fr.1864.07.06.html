<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Shadows of War--The Hospitals--Heroism of the Black Troops--The
                        Conscription Bill.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>Washington City, June 24, 1864.</p>
                    <p>At the present time our city is almost devoid of any sort of attraction
                        interesting enough to call strangers to it, unless it be the numerous
                        hospitals in which at present, are so many thousands of wounded
                        heroes--brave men who have sacrificed all the comforts and pleasures of
                        home, endured untold hardships and privations in periling their lives for
                        their country.</p>
                    <p>In passing through the hospitals and looking on the limbless and sick victims
                        of this accursed rebellion, one's heart is filled with mingled pride and
                        sorrow at the sight of the brave young men--the light and joy of many a
                        home--cut down in the pride, strength and glory of all their young manhood.
                        Yet it is wonderful to witness the uniform cheerfulness which they evince
                        even while suffering from the severest wounds. In the hundreds of times that
                        I have visited these hospitals, conversed with these patients and written
                        letters dictated by them to friends at home, I have found no word of regret,
                        but the same cheerful tone throughout, and in cases where death is
                        inevitable, there is still the same satisfied look and expression which
                        clearly shows their appreciation of the magnitude of the object for which
                        they are sacrificing themselves.</p>
                    <p>Our hearts bleed for the mothers that bore noble men, for the young wives
                        left desolate, for the sisters who will wait in vain for their return. Alas!</p>
                    <p>"No more return-- <br>Till sisters, brothers all unite. <br>In another and
                        a better world."</p>
                    <p>After the gallant charge of Duncan's Black Brigade on the outer works of
                        Petersburg, who will stand up and say that "poor old slave" will not fight.
                        As the blacks approached, the rebels stood upon their works with a black
                        flag, taunting them to come on, with all the odious epithets which the
                        genius of blackguardism has invented. Notwithstanding all this, the blacks
                        rushed on undaunted, and after a terrible struggle, in which some rebel
                        cannon were captured and immediately turned upon their late owners, and with
                        the terrible bayonet dealt out death right and left, sparing none who fell
                        in their way, taking not a single prisoner, they compelled the remainder to
                        flee in utter confusion to the woods in their rear, and held the ground
                        which to-day gives Grant a position where he can at any time lay Petersburg
                        in ashes.</p>
                    <p>This heroic act of the colored soldiers has raised them very high in the
                        estimation of our old veterans, and hereafter they will be found side by
                        side in the hottest of the fight for their country and universal freedom,
                        and so they will fight on, until no spot shall be saddened by the footprints
                        of a single slave.</p>
                    <p>The bill amendatory of the Enrolling-act was passed last night in the evening
                        session of the Senate by a vote of 24 to 7. The Commutation clause is
                        stricken out, and all drafts hereafter made are to be for such term of time
                        as the President shall direct, not exceeding one
                        year. Each district is to be allowed for the number of men
                        volunteering up to the time of draft and that number deducted from the
                        number to be drafted.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that the House will yet acquiesce in this action of the
                        Senate. The question is simply, shall the contest for the suppression of the
                        rebellion be continued or abandoned? If it is to be continued, we must have
                        the additional troops necessary to do so, and to get them the commutation
                        law must be repealed. The cause requires the men, not money; and he who
                        votes to exempt any drafted man capable of serving efficiently without
                        furnishing an exempt substitute, simply votes to insure the eventual success
                        of the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The news from the front is still very encouraging. Petersburg can be taken at
                        any time Grant sees fit. Grant is aiming at a deeper game than the taking of
                        that town. One more move from the ground he yesterday occupied and
                        Petersburg must fall without an attack on it.</p>
                    <p>S.C.</p>
