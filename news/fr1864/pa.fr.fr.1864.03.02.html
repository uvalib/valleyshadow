<b>Army of the Potomac</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The unnamed author of this "Correspondence of the Franklin Repository" was
                    a member of the Fifth Reserves, who were then responsible for guarding the
                    trains running on the Orange and Alexandria Rail Road: "You may imagine what it
                    is to be perched on the top of a burden car, exposed to the winds that sweep
                    over the plains of Manassas and down the windings of the Rappahannock, as though
                    the ghosts of dead heroes that people this expanse of desolate country, were
                    directing and embittering the blasts, like the phantoms of Ossian." He also
                    described how in Alexandria, the "F. F. V.s, with their wealth and refinement
                    have been substituted mostly by Jews and sharpers--by keepers of restaurants,
                    billiard saloons, shooting galleries, and their complements of vice."<br>

<b>Harrisburg</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Harrisburg correspondent reports on the session of the legislature set
                    aside to debate the bill for the payment of military damages in the border
                    counties. Democrat Sharpe spoke eloquently in favor of the bill for over an hour
                    but then Mr. Pershing of Cambria, the political leader of the Democrats, opted
                    to make passage of the bill a partisan issue: "he wandered, blundered,
                    equivocated, mystified, garbled, and confused the status and condition of
                    parties until he confused half the audience out of the Hall and finally sat
                    down; wiped his perspiring brow, and apparently waited for the immediate
                    disintegration of the Union party. It was, however, intact at last accounts."
                    Mr. Sharpe did decide to postpone further efforts to pass the bill "until the
                    present political squabble passes over." Correspondent "Horace" also notes that
                    the Democratic newspaper editors recently convened in the state capitol to
                    discuss modifying their pro-slavery views and presidential nomination
                    strategies.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We earnestly appeal to the Union members of the legislature to give the bill
                        providing for the adjudication and payment of military damages, a candid,
                        dispassionate consideration, unprejudiced by any political complications
                        which may have been thrown around it by violent partizans. The test oath
                        reported in the bill, and which was unanimously accepted by the committee,
                        is a fair one--just to the State and just to the loyal people; and to seek
                        to impose needless and humiliating tests, striking at the mere political
                        belief of the citizens on the one hand, or striving to exempt all from
                        giving evidence of loyalty, so that Rebel and Union men could claim alike,
                        on the other hand, make the sufferings of a despoiled people a mere
                        political foot-ball for the amusement of ambitious legislative orators.</p>
                    <p>The measure is free from all political bearings. It applies to men of all
                        parties: for all have suffered alike under rebel invasion; and if there be
                        exceptions to the fidelity of our people during rebel rule in our midst, no
                        fears need be apprehended, under Mr. Sharpe's restrictions, that such men
                        can profit by it. The bill is urged with uncommon earnestness by the entire
                        press and members of both parties, of York, Adams, Franklin, Cumberland,
                        Fulton and Bedford; and they are not seeking charity from the State, nor are
                        they desiring that the highest just standard of loyalty shall be lowered.
                        They have given their fathers, sons and brothers to preserve our
                        Nationality; they have promptly borne their full share of the burdens of the
                        government, and they feel that they can justly demand that the great
                        Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall not be unmindful of her highest duty to
                        her citizens, and forgetful of her first prerogative as a sovereign State.</p>
                    <p>"But it will cost a million dollars or more!" exclaim those who ever hesitate
                        between expediency and right. True, it may cost a million or a million and a
                        quarter; but if it should cost five millions instead of one, the necessity
                        for compensation would only be the more imperative; because the more
                        grievous would be the burden upon individual citizens. Pennsylvania has five
                        millions due her for years from persons who hold unpatented lands--three
                        times the amount necessary to vindicate her fame as a protecting sovereignty
                        in this instance; and will the legislature allow the just claims of the
                        State upon her debtors, who have been forgiven interest for a time whereof
                        the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, to remains undemanded, and at
                        the same time withhold compensation to citizens who have suffered by
                        invasion? Must one class of our people receive gifts from the State, and
                        another be refused protection and many left to bankruptcy? If so, our
                        boasted Commonwealth is a fiction and a fraud, and our pride in the genius
                        of our government a delusion. Let the legislature be just--the people of the
                        border want nothing more. Let the revenues of the State be gathered and
                        husbanded--let just claims be collected and just debts be paid, and we are
                        content; but it is not justice to practically
                        give away five millions to owners of lands, and declare the State too poor
                        and powerless to give security to the persons and property of her
                    citizens.</p>

<b>What of the Democracy?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author observes that many Democrats, in their effort to elect the next
                    President of the United States, have joined their foes, the Republicans, in
                    declaring that slavery must be overthrown.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The hand-writing on the wall relative to Slavery, has at last been read by
                        the Democratic leaders, and they are about to declare that it has been
                        "weighed in the balance and found wanting." For years they have been the
                        main dependence of Slavery. It was by their aid it was emboldened to
                        aggression upon the genius of our government, until it became imperial in
                        its demands, and proclaimed itself master of the continent. It was by their
                        aid that it reversed the doctrine of the fathers of the Republic, declaring
                        the Territories free; by their aid that it was en[a]bled to defy the
                        solemnly plighted faith of the Nation by the repeal of the Missouri
                        restriction; by their aid that Kansas was over-run by brutal ruffians,
                        usurping the power of government, and imperiling life and property unless
                        devoted to the cause of bondage; by their aid that the highest judicial
                        tribunal of the Nation was made to confront the common law of the civilized
                        world, by declaring that Slavery could exist in Territories without
                        municipal regulations giving it life; and it was by their aid that Treason
                        was at last strengthened for its crowning crime in seeking to destroy the
                        great Republic of the world by wanton war. But three years of appalling
                        conflict have written in letters of flame upon the Nation's pathway, as did
                        Jefferson in the earlier and better days of our fathers, that God is just;
                        that His justice will not sleep forever: and He proclaims in His own good
                        time "Venveance [sic] is Mine--I will repay!"</p>
                    <p>Slavery is doomed! The earnest and faithful have so declared it for years
                        past; but the hesitating, the timid, the temporizing, the faithless
                        struggled for its existence for months after it had become the giant suicide
                        of the world's history. But slowly and surely they are awakened to the fact
                        now patent as the sun at noon-day, that it has staked its existence in a war
                        against Justice and Humanity--against Man and God, and it has lost in the
                        struggle. Still the weak tremble lest its death throes shall be too violent;
                        lest it shall rend a government from centre to circumference by its dying
                        convulsions; but the overruling hand that "shapes our ends, rough-hew them
                        as we will," is a stranger to the expedients which would stand between the
                        triumph of Right when its day has come, and the morn of universal Freedom
                        dawns brightly upon the Western World.</p>
                    <p>There are still thousands who are blind; who would follow Slavery upon the
                        altar of suicide, and wreck political fortune with it, and share its
                        dishonored grave. But the world moves; and Democracy moves with it. It is
                        slow to surrender its early and constant love; it is sluggish in
                        appreciating manifest truth, and reluctantly admits that there is a present
                        whose new duties have been created by the chequered and crimsoned past; but
                        it is coming; it is seeing; it is acting, and it will soon champion
                        Emancipation with all the ardor of a modern convert. It loves Slavery none
                        the less; but it loves Power more, and it will not war against destiny. It
                        has tried it, and lost; it will now unfurl new banners with strange devices,
                        and Slavery may die if thereby Democracy lives. So it faltered in 1849, when
                        the Democracy of every Free State but Iowa declared for the Wilmot Proviso;
                        but its master re-asserted its power, and with relentless vengeance Slavery
                        bid Democracy atone for its perfidy by new evidences of affection. But now
                        Slavery has passed the boundaries of hope--the decree is inexorable that it
                        must die, and again Democracy, after fruitless efforts to preserve its life,
                        pronounces it dead and entombs it under the epitaph of retributive justice!</p>
                    <p>He who supposes that the Democracy are going to venture upon a Presidential
                        contest with banners streaming for the dead, reads the signs of the times to
                        little purpose. The humble followers who but re-echo the dictates of
                        leaders, may still be for Slavery; but they will be schooled in time, and
                        will follow the new path with that confidence in masters that has ever made
                        Democracy formidable. The World declares that
                        Slavery's "downfall is the natural result of the war and the Democratic
                        party cannot interpose to save it. Its destruction is a risk which the South
                        voluntarily incurred when they resorted to arms, and it would be great
                        inconsistency for us to intervene in favor of an institution which we
                        disapprove." The New York Express says that "all
                        feel that Slavery has gone by the board. Politically it was dead before the
                        war began. Physically it is now dead, and ought not for one moment enter
                        into any discussion relating to the war, any more than anything else that is
                        dead beyond all hope of resurrection." The Chicago Post, the leading Democratic organ of the West, says it has from the
                        first declared that "rebellion would be the natural destruction of Slavery."
                        The Pittsburgh Post declares that "the future
                        peace of this now distructed [sic] and bleeding country requires the total
                        extinction of Slavery among us." The New York Herald daily declares Slavery dead beyond the hope of future life,
                        and the Catholic organs of Cincinnati and Philadelphia have both pronounced
                        the doom of human bondage as inevitable. Hon. James Brooks, Democratic M.C.
                        from New York, said in Congress a few days ago that "as a Roman in the days
                        of Caesar, or a Frenchman in the days of Napoleon, I must cease protesting
                        and resisting. Hence I recognize the abolition of Slavery; hence I intend to
                        act hereafter upon that recognition, because it is inevitable." Hon. Cyrus
                        L. Pershing, leading Democrat in the Pennsylvania legislature, in a
                        carefully prepared political speech in the House last week, declared that
                        "Slavery had stabbed itself to death--it must die;" and a convention of the
                        Democratic Editors of this State, in secret session in Harrisburg on the
                        24th ult., resolved informally that their cherished idol should be mourned
                        as a thing of the past; that all their hopes of success demanded but few
                        tears and moderate sorrow for their departed ally. True, one of the journals
                        there represented declared but a week ago that "the enslavement of the black
                        race is one of the Almighty's great purposes,
                        whereby out of evil he educes good," but "the Almighty's great purposes"
                        will be reversed in theory and day that the interests of Democracy
                        intervene.</p>
                    <p>What means this revolution? It is not accident, or impulse, or any new born
                        love for humanity, on the part of Democratic leaders. It means that the
                        Democratic party regard the success of the war and the overthrow of the
                        rebellion and Slavery as inevitable, and they seek to reap the fruits of
                        this great victory over themselves by electing the next President of the
                        United States. They are now silent as to M'Clellan, save in a few localities
                        where they know no better. In the great centres of Democratic power, where
                        the Seymours, the Woods, the Richmonds rule, no follies as to platforms or
                        "Little Napoleons" are committed. The delegates chosen are silent as to
                        their choice; the declaration of principles allows the widest latitude for
                        the mutations of ninety days still in the womb of the future; and if the
                        Union armies are crowned with fresh victories in the West this spring, they
                        will accept their last lingering hope of success--take Gen. Grant for the
                        Presidency if they can get him, and declare for the abolition of Slavery in
                        all the States of the Union. Gen. M'Clellan will have served his purpose.
                        His letter to the President pleading for the life of Slavery will be
                        assigned with him among the relics of the past, and Democracy will champion
                        War, Abolition, Confiscation, and summary executions if need be, to compass
                        the next Chief Magistracy of the government. Such is the manifest drift of
                        Democracy. In despair it turns from the Slavery it loved and cherished to
                        the Freedom it has hated and maligned, and bringing gifts to the Republic
                        and its noblest chieftains, it will seek to regain power over the Nation
                        just rescued from the bloody fruits of its perfidy.</p>
