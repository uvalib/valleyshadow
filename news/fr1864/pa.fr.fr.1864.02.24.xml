                <excerpt>"The Regiment has participated in some of the hardest fights and undergone
                    some of the severest marches in the history of the war. It was conspicuous at
                    Shiloh; lost its commander at Stone Riber; and covered itself with glory at
                    Chattanooga and Chickamauga."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>What remains of the gallant 77th Regiment is now at home on furlough. This
                        Regiment, as most of our readers know, was organized in this town in
                        September, 1861. The original commander was Col. F.S. Stumbaugh, and it was
                        mainly owing to his efforts that the Regiment was speedily fitted out for
                        field operations. When Col. Stumbaugh took command of a Brigade he was
                        succeeded by Lieut. Col. Housum, and upon the death of that brave man the
                        command devolved upon Capt. Rose. The Regiment has participated in some of
                        the hardest fights and undergone some of the severest marches in the history
                        of the war. It was conspicuous at Shiloh; lost its commander at Stone Riber;
                        and covered itself with glory at Chattanooga and Chickamauga. These were
                        leading engagements, to speak nothing of the almost numberless skirmishes
                        and minor contests in which it took an active part. When the Regiment left
                        Pittsburg join the army in Kentucky, it numbered, including the Battery
                        attached, 1,000 men; now it numbers scarce 250, disease and death having
                        thus decimated its strength. Out of its present strength only eleven have
                        refused to re-enlist. It is but just to say however, that most of this
                        number are suffering from disability, and are to some extent unfitted for
                        service. We hail the return of these brave soldiers with inexpressible
                        pleasure, and would add that no evidences of respect can be tendered them
                        but what the richly merit.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Washington's Birth-day was not observed with that patriotic enthusiasm that
                        should have marked its occurrence. Capt. Piper's Regular U.S. Battery fired
                        a salute of 32 guns on Federal Hill, and Capt. Ege's company of Infantry
                        paraded the streets; but beyond this there were no demonstrations worthy of
                        notice. We must give credit to these two named organizations by saying that
                        the firing of the Battery was admirable, and the appearance and drill of
                        Capt. Ege's company elicited much praise. Our streets were crowded during
                        the day by citizens and soldiers, but there was no disturbance of the peace
                        requiring police or especial military interference that came to our
                    notice.</p>
