                <excerpt>". . . the Rebel authorities have determined to subject our soldiers and
                    officers who fall into their hands to physical and mental suffering impossible

                    little more than skin and bones, some maimed for life, and some frozen by lying
                    without tent or covering on the bare ground at Belle Isle."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Committee on the Conduct of the War, has made a report to Congress, on
                        the condition of the Federal prisoners, returned from Richmond, who have
                        arrived at Annapolis. From an examination made at the request of the
                        Secretary of War, it is proved beyond all doubt, in the estimation of the
                        Committee, that the Rebel authorities have determined to subject our
                        soldiers and officers who fall into their hands to physical and mental
                        suffering impossible to describe, many presenting now the appearance of
                        living skeletons, literally little more than skin and bones, some maimed for
                        life, and some frozen by lying without tent or covering on the bare ground
                        at Belle Isle. The general practice is shown to be the robbery of the
                        prisoners, as soon as they were taken, of all money, valuables and good
                        clothing. The food allowed was totally insufficient to preserve the health
                        of a child. It consisted usually of two pieces of bread made of corn and cob
                        meal, badly cooked, with about two ounces of meal, badly cooked, with about
                        two ounces of meal, unfit to eat and occasionally a few black, worm eaten
                        beans.</p>
                    <p>They were obliged to sell clothing received from home to buy food to sustain
                        life. Those in the hospitals were little better fed. Worn and neglected
                        wounds remained for days undressed. One witness, when asked if he was
                        hungry, replied: "Hungry? I could eat anything in the world that came before
                        me." They were submitted to unmerciful and murderous treatment from those in
                        charge of them. They were shot and killed for violating rules of which they
                        had no knowledge. When they arrived at Annapolis their clothing was so
                        filled with vermin that it had to be destroyed, and repeated washings failed
                        to relieve their heads and bodies of the pests. They are now dying daily,
                        and the physicians in charge entertained no doubt that there [sic]
                        emaciation and death are directly caused by the brutal and merciless
                        treatment received while prisoners of war.</p>
                    <p>The testimony shows that the treatment received at Columbia and Dalton was
                        far more humane than at Richmond. The Committee say that they cannot resist
                        the conclusion that these inhuman practices are the result of a
                        determination on the part of the rebel authorities to reduce our soldiers by
                        privations and exposure to such a condition that they never will be able to
                        render effective service in the field--the result, like the massacre of Fort
                        Pillow, of a predetermined policy. They deem it evident that the rebel
                        newspaper statements, claiming for the prisoners the same treatment received
                        by their own soldiers, are glaring and unblushing falsehoods; and say no one
                        can for a moment be deceived by such statements who will reflect that our
                        soldiers, who, when taken prisoners, were stout, healthy men, in the prime
                        and vigor of life, have died by hundreds under the treatment they have
                        received.</p>
                    <p>The Washington <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph> adds this statement: "We
                        learn from Conversation with one of the members of the Committee that the
                        scene witnessed by them at Annapolis beggars description. Of the four
                        hundred men returned--officers and privates--who arrived at Annapolis a few
                        days since, one hundred have since died of rebel starvation, and one hundred
                        more, it is believed by medical men, cannot live. So emaciated are many of
                        the men that photographic artists were employed by the committee to take
                        pictures of them, for the purpose of showing their actual condition and
                        appearance to both Houses of Congress."</p>

                <summary>The Committee on the Conduct of the War reported to Congress that the
                    "Rebel authorities have determined to subject our soldiers and officers who fall
                    into their hands to physical and mental suffering impossible to describe, many
                    presenting now the appearance of living skeletons, literally little more than

                    the testimony indicated that "the treatment received at Columbia and Dalton was
                    far more humane than at Richmond," and they "cannot resist" concluding that this
                    inhumane treatment of prisoners is a predetermined policy to ensure that their
                    prisoners are never fit enough to return to the field.</summary>

                <summary>The editors indulge in an extended critique of public transportation, one
                    of their favorite butts. This time it is the omnibus on Broadway in Manhattan,
                    and (among other things) they compare the torture of being wedged between a fat
                    and a thin woman to the delights of being between "two plump, pretty lassies."
                    In the latter scenario, "every jolt of the stage sways him to and fro like a
                    spoon between two pyramids of blanc mange." They then switch gears and urge the
                    community to contribute to the Fair that will be held in June to benefit the
                    Christian Commission: "If there is a farmer who can spare but one egg, and but
                    one potato, let us have it."</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Friday last, Mr. Latshaw, the caroling officer for Franklin township,
                        Adams county, met a suspicious looking character on the road, and questioned
                        him as to his residence. He answered that he resided in that township, but
                        when interrogated as to the name of his neighbors, had found that Mr.
                        Latshaw was likely to detect him and he said he had made a mistake--that he
                        resided beyond Mercersburg. From his confused and unsatisfactory statements,
                        Mr. Latshaw felt it his duty to arrest him, and he did so. The prisoner made
                        no resistance, but proposed to walk back to New Salem; but on the way he
                        took the first favorable opportunity to jump the fence and run away. The
                        officer pursued, and was joined by the people of the neighborhood; and after
                        a chase of about three hours, he was recaptured without being injured.
                        Officer Latshaw then bound his feet together, and started for Chambersburg
                        to deliver the prisoner to Capt. Eyster, the Provost Marshal. Latshaw and
                        the prisoner were in a single seated buggy, and Mr. Sonaker rode behind on
                        horseback. When in the South Mountain, the prisoner managed quietly to get
                        his feet loose, and when opposite a dense thicket of laurel, he sprang from
                        the buggy into the bushes. Mr. Slonaker fired at him and lodged a ball in
                        his shoulder, making a slight wound, but it did not arrest the prisoner.
                        Latshaw immediately jumped from the buggy and rushed into the thicket after
                        him, and called to him twice to halt or he would fire; but the prisoner
                        continued to get away as fast as possible. Latshaw fired and struck him in
                        the hip, shattering the bone badly, and of course arresting his progress. He
                        at once called out that he was mortally wounded. Mr. Slonaker went up to
                        him, while Latshaw pursued his horse, and the prisoner told him that he was
                        fatally injured--that he could not live long, and at once admitted that he
                        was a rebel spy, and had met a just fate. He gave his name as Lloyd, and
                        stated that he had been in this section making observations for the benefit
                        of the rebels.</p>
                    <p>He is a man of about forty years of age, stoutly built, with dark hair and
                        goatee, is quite intelligent, and has evidently not been a laboring man. It
                        is more than probable that he is a rebel officer. On his person was found a
                        belt with nearly $100 of gold, and he had Chattanooga and Virginia rebel
                        money, and a little Pennsylvania currency. He represents himself as a native
                        of Lee county, Virginia, but says that he has lived in Missouri for some
                        years, and was about to return to Lee county. He had a letter, with the date
                        and place where it was written torn off, which refers to a journey to be
                        undertaken, and certain information to be conveyed; but it furnishes no clue
                        to parties in complicity with him. He had also a Cincinnati paper of the
                        28th ult. in his pocket from which we think it probable that he passed
                        through that place several weeks ago. He was in this town a few days before
                        he was arrested; tried to sell some gold at the Bank, and very carefully
                        scanned a map of the county hanging in the Bank.</p>
                    <p>His thigh wound is very serious, but not necessarily mortal, and his recovery
                        is altogether probable. Had his wound been less dangerous, it might have
                        been difficult to gather sufficient evidence to warrant holding him as a spy
                        but when he was shot he supposed he was about to die, and he admitted his
                        purpose and business frankly. He is now in the Hospital in this place, in
                        the custody of Gen. Couch, and will, we learn, be sent to Fort Mifflin as
                        soon as he recovers sufficiently to be removed. Great credit is due Officer
                        Latshaw and Mr. Slonaker for his arrest and delivery to the authorities at
                        this place. We presume that Lloyd came into our lines through the Cumberland
                        mountains, came East by way of Cincinnati, and meant to escape through the
                        Shenandoah Valley.</p>

                <summary>Mr. Latshaw, the enrolling officer for Franklin township in Adams County,
                    apprehended a "suspicious looking character on the road," and arrested him. In
                    the company of Mr. Slonaker, Latshaw started for Chambersburg to deliver the
                    prisoner to Capt. Eyster. When the prisoner attempted to escape, Latshaw shot
                    him in the shoulder and the hip. Thinking he was dying, the prisoner said his
                    name was Lloyd, and confessed that he was a rebel spy. Although presently in the
                    Chambersburg Hospital and in the custody of Gen. Couch, Lloyd will be sent to

                <summary>A report of the Franklin County Educational Association, which met in
                    Waynesboro on May 11. The group was organized by electing Joseph Douglas
                    President and D. B. Russell and Joseph Eckhart Vice Presidents. The Rev. Mr.
                    Krebs addressed the "extremely sparse audience," and the new President offered
                    encouraging words to the teachers who were there. Thirty to forty teachers did
                    attend, amounting to only about one fifth of the teacher population in the
                    county. Discussion touched upon many topics, including "'Object Teaching' which
                    is now being freely discussed particularly in the more Eastern States," and
                    teachers maintained that they wanted to test new theories before adopting them.</summary>

                    the Provost Marshal last week, and placed in the Hospital in consequence of
                    serious injury to one of his feet which rendered it impossible for him to walk.
                    He is a scienced deserter, having deserted from four regiments, and would
                    doubtless have been punished severely and probably shot had he been tried. On
                    Thursday night he made his escape, and as he could not walk, the query is a
                    grave one as to the means by which he got away. He must have been aided by
                    persons in this place, and taken off on horseback or in a buggy. Can any of our
                    copperheads guess as to how he escaped?"</summary>
