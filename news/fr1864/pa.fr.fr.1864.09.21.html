<b>Soldiers Vote For Your Cause!</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges soldiers to vote for the Union candidates. The Repository reminds
                    that a Democratic court disfranchised soldiers and that the Union members of the
                    legislature re-established suffrage to soldiers. The author argues that 105,000
                    votes against enfranchisement came from districts who plan to vote for
                    McClellan.<br>

<b>Address Of The Union State Committee</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Prints the address of Simon Cameron, president of the Union State
                    Committee, supporting votes for the Union candidates. Cameron believes that
                    support for the war will bring peace and reunion. The Democrats only offer peace
                    with Confederate independence.<br>

                        To the People of Pennsylvania:
                    </p>
                    <p>Fellow-Citizens: The result of the recent election on the amendment to the
                        Constitution of the State, allowing soldiers in the field to vote, is
                        gratifying, inasmuch as it shows that the great heart of the commonwealth is
                        right, in the fearful and bloody struggle going on to preserve the great
                        republic, and that these brave men are worthy to help govern the country for
                        which they make so many sacrifices and suffer so many privations.</p>
                    <p>The friends of the Union have brought about this result, while the opposition
                        have used their powerful organization to prevent it, with the evident object
                        of weakening the Union armies by disfranchising the soldier, and thereby
                        strengthening themselves at the approaching Presidential elections; and in
                        connection with this election let us reason together.</p>
                    <p>The campaign of 1864 is now fairly opened. The issue upon which the campaign
                        is to be made is clearly indicated. The enemies of the government have
                        publicly and authoritatively declared their purpose in the contest. That
                        declaration places the duty of patriots in a light as broad and clear as
                        that of noon. There is no mistaking either the spirit or the object of our
                        opponents; it is the same that impelled the chiefs of armed treason to
                        attempt the overthrow of free government on this continent as 1860-61.
                        Neither time nor reflection, nor regard for the peace of society in the
                        loyal States, nor the desolations which have devoured the prosperity of the
                        south in the grip of war, have wrought any modification of their hatred for
                        a government founded upon the opinions of the people expressed through the
                        ballot box.</p>
                    <p>It is the part of wisdom to anticipate evil, and to prepare to destroy it
                        before it grows too formidable to overthrow. The attitude of the parties to
                        the Presidential contest gives rise to a serious question--the most serious
                        of any which can engage the attention of the true patriot and good citizen.
                        That question is briefly stated: Shall we have lasting peace, through a
                        vigorous prosecution of [t]his war for national life, or interminable war,
                        through a peace based upon disunion?</p>
                    <p>The issue is sharply defined. The utterances of the Baltimore Convention
                        decisively declare for peace through effective war; the utternances [sic] of
                        the Chicago Convention as decisively pronounce for the alternative presented
                        in the question stated. They mean that, or they are without meaning. The
                        opposition to Mr. Lincoln contemplates disunion as a cure for the ills under
                        which we lie. His defeat would divide the continent into factious States.
                        Nor is this mere assertion. The political history of the country for the
                        last four years is a mass of overwhelming evidence in support of its entire,
                        its disgraceful truth.</p>
                    <p>And first, in evidence of its truth, we have the declaration, informal but
                        not less weighty (because reiterated and unvarying,) of the rebel chiefs,
                        that the South will not treat for peace save upon the basis of a recognition
                        of its independence--The press of the South omits no opportunity to impress
                        upon us and the world that peace can only come through recognition.
                        Recognition is but an other name for separation. And finally, every European
                        nation has come to regard the result of this war as certain to be one of two
                        things--either subjugation or disunion. It is the clear conviction which
                        truth brings to every rational, enlightened mind. It is, therefore, entitled
                        to great weight, second only to the resultant fact.</p>
                    <p>It is due to the opponents of Mr. Lincoln to state that they pretend to
                        believe in the probability of peace and Union through some compromise, the
                        terms of which are not clearly stated.</p>
                    <p>It will be easy to show the futility of such hopes, if it has not already
                        been done. It will not be a difficult task to show that such a belief does
                        not take root in conviction. The leaders of the opposition are men of great
                        ability and more than ordinary sagacity. They cannot, therefore, be ignorant
                        of the facts which are of public record. Those facts effectually preclude
                        the possibility of peace and Union through any compromise, unless the terms
                        involve recognition; and that would be disunion.</p>
                    <p>But let us thoroughly consider this question of peace through compromise. It
                        is reasonable to suppose that the chiefs of the rebellion would have
                        accepted terms at the outset, if at all. It is alleged by our opponents that
                        Mr. Lincoln hurried the nation into war, not only without constitutional
                        warrant, but even against the wishes of the rebel chiefs themselves. They
                        reproach the Congress then in session with having refused to adopt the
                        Crittenden Compromise measure, and thus forced the south into rebellion in
                        exercise of the right of self-defence and self preservation. It is
                        unnecessary to pause to show that all this transpired while the reins of
                        power were held by southern men, most of whom are now in arms against the
                        government. Let that pass. The question hinges upon the responsibility of
                        the rejection of the Crittenden Compromise. It was rejected. By whom!</p>
                    <p>Reference to page 409, part first of the Congressional
                            Globe of the second session of the Thirty-sixth Congress, will
                        place the responsibility for the rejection of that Compromise where it
                        properly belongs. It will be seen that the Crittenden Compromise was
                        defeated by the substitution (in effect) [sic] of what is known as the
                        "Clark Amendment." The record shows that the vote on the motion to
                        substitute was--yeas 25, nays 30. The vote on the adoption of the Clark
                        proposition, taken directly afterwards, was--yeas 25, nays--23. The
                        presumption would be, naturally, that if the south had votes enough to
                        reject the substitute, it would also have had enough to reject the
                        proposition when offered independently. There was a falling off in the
                        negative vote on the proposition, as compared with that on the first motion
                        to substitute, of seven votes. This is accounted
                        for by the fact that Senators Benjamin and Slidell, of Louisianna [sic];
                        Wigfall and Hemphill, of Texas; Iverson, of Georgia, and Johnson, of
                            Arkansas--six Southern Senators--sat in their seats
                            and refused to vote. Had these six southern men voted "no," the
                        Clark proposition would have been defeated by a majority of four votes, and
                        the Crittenden Compromise could have been taken up and carried by the same
                        majority. It appears of record, then, that the Crittenden Compromise was
                        rejected because six of the leading Senators from the south virtually
                        refused to vote for it. A motion to reconsider was carried some weeks later,
                        and a direct vote upon the Compromise was taken. The proposition was lost by
                        a single vote. But one of the six Senators referred to voted on that
                        occasion, nearly all of them having withdrawn on the secession of their
                        respective States. Had they remained to vote for the Compromise, it would
                        have been adopted.</p>
                    <p>The chief object in alluding to this matter is to show that when, before the
                        overt act of war was committed, the south had the election of compromise or
                        war, she, through her highest dignitaries, deliberately chose war.</p>
                    <p>The south would not have compromise then. Is it reasonable to suppose that it
                        would accept such an accommodation now? Her rulers have the southern masses
                        by the throat, and can mould them to their imperious will. They are playing
                        for a great stake. They could not withdraw from the contest now unless
                        forced into withdrawal. Pride, love of power--both inbred and fostered by
                        the institution of slavery--would force them to elect, as they declare they
                        do elect, extermination rather than submission and union.</p>
                    <p>Early in the struggle--before the government had taken the
                        aggressive--President Lincoln offered peace in most liberal terms. The terms
                        were, briefly, the laying down of arms and the abandonment of their hostile
                        attitude. The world knows how those terms were met. It need not be reported
                        here. The desolation of southern fields; and the vacant seats in thousands
                        upon thousands of homes, both north and south, bear the record. Still later,
                        amnesty and pardon have been offered by the President; still the chiefs of
                        rebellion abate not a tittle of their energy to maintain themselves in their
                        wrong. They demand recognition and independence of a government they hate.
                        Intimate knowledge of the directing minds of the rebellion teaches that they
                        will never abanden [sic] their wicked scheme until obliged to do so by the
                        sheer force of such iron circumstances as control the results of war.</p>
                    <p>There is no ground then for the hope of peace through compromise; no hope of
                        permanent peace. There is no such discharge in the war. Those who go before
                        the country upon such vicious pretexts, are not deceived themselves, however
                        much they may deceive the ignorant and unsuspecting. To charge
                        self-deception upon them in a matter so unmistakably clear, would be
                        equivalent to charging them with imbecility. They do not deceive themselves.
                        The pretext of seeking the defeat of Mr. Lincoln that peace may return to
                        our borders covers a sinister purpose. If they wish peace they can have it
                        but in two ways--in a cowardly abandonment of the struggle, followed by
                        disunion, or by a more vigorous (if possible) prosecution of the war.</p>
                    <p>Thus the true issue upon which the campaign is to be made becomes sharply
                        defined. None can deprecate the horrows [sic] of war or desire the return of
                        peace more than do the warmest supporters of the National Union nominees.
                        But they ask for and will acquiesce in no peace that is not founded upon the
                        integrity of the Union and established upon the principles of the
                        Declaration of Independence. They recognize greater evils than war, such as
                        this is in which the nation is plunged. Divide the nation geographically,
                        and to what end do we inevitably gravitate? With the precedent and justice
                        of secession established, who can presume to say that we shall not repeat
                        the humiliating history of Mexico and the South American States? United, the
                        common danger was, and would rontinue [sic] to be, our common security.
                        Divided, the land would groan with the wreaking out of individual vengeance.
                        Divided, the torch and brand would never be idle along the line of division.
                        The country would at last awake to the bitter knowledge that open, vigorous
                        war, prosecuted with a high purpose, is a thousand times less dreaded than
                        an armed peace.</p>
                    <p>As an example, a little more than a year since, when Lee, with his rebel
                        army, invaded Pennsylvania, and when the fate of the Republic was decided by
                        the battle of Gettysburg, how prompt wicked and designing men were to
                        inaugurate the insurrection in New York city, trusting in the hope that the
                        Government was not able to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and
                        the laws. It will be long before the blackness of the crimes committed by
                        that conspiracy will be obliterated.</p>
                    <p>As another example, take the recent conspiracy discovered in the
                        northwest--the banding together in secret of a large number of men, the
                        concentration of thirty thousand stand of arms and a large supply of
                        ammunition. The papers of this conspiracy, which were seized, evidencing too
                        clearly that their design was, and is, the over throw of the Republic,
                        trusting that division and anarchy would shield them from harm, but in utter
                        disregard of the concomitant wrongs to the people--murder, robbery,
                        arson--in a word desolation for the time.</p>
                    <p>Now fellow-citizens, in both these examples the moving spirits are prominent
                        men in the Opposition, and controlled the nomination and platform at
                        Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Yet it is to such peace as this that our opponents invite you. They ask your
                        suffrages for a man who either is pledged to such a peace, if elected, or
                        who is determined on a war grander in scale and bloodier in results than the
                        world has yet witnessed. There can be but two issues out of the present
                        difficulty. The intelligent freemen of Pennsylvania need not to be led like
                        children. They will not fail to comprehend the nature of these issues, and
                        to choose between them. In so choosing they choose for their children and
                        their children's children. They can do nothing of a public nature in these
                        pregnant times that shall not cause coming generations either to revere or
                        despise them. The re-election of Mr. Lincoln, and the election of Andrew
                        Johnson as his associate, will indicate to the chiefs of the rebellion that
                        the war for Union and permanent peace must go on until those ends shall be
                        attained. It will also signify to the nations of Europe that the people of
                        the whole United States will, soon or late, become an united people and the
                        government remain, as it has heretofore been, a star of hope to all the
                        appressed [sic] people of the civilized world, and an everlasting monument
                        to the wisdom of the grand old heroes who conceived it. If we could basely
                        afford to abandon the struggle now, the world, mankind, could not afford the
                        sacrifice. If we could afford to bear the shame,
                        and wear the shackles of defeat so cravenly invited, our children could not
                        stand erect under the deathless reproach of our behavior. As men, as
                        freemen, as patriots, we have no choice but to stand by the government as
                        administered. The alternative presented by our opponents is disunion and
                        dishonor, which is national death. If a man recognizes the existence of the
                        principle of Eternal Justice he could not despair of the republic. There may
                        be some in whom the principle of hope maintains but a feeble existence,
                        unless stimulated by uninterrupted success. Such must be encouraged and
                        sustained by the example of the more hopeful and enduring. They must be
                        assured of what the philosophy of history and of events teaches, that danger
                        lies in turning back, as security lies in pressing forward. The desolations,
                        and bereavements, and burdens of war may be, nay, are terrible, but the
                        tempest which ravages forest and field, destroying the increase of labor,
                        and even human life, is also terrible. Yet it is beneficent. With unvarying
                        calm the atmosphere would degenerate into putridity, and the earth would
                        revolve in endless night. So war involves nations in its fearful vortex that
                        social and political renovation may follow. As a fire sweeping over the
                        fields licks up the chaff and stubble, yet effects not the solid earth, so
                        the fiery trial which we are called upon to endure is consuming the
                        notorious crimes of society. The nation will issue out of this struggle
                        stronger and purer than before. Wrong, such as confronts us, cannot drive
                        right into exile. Craft and villainy are not to be the subjugators of wisdom
                        and virtue. And whatever crimes may have been, or may yet be, perpetuated in
                        the name of civilization, it is not now to be proved either a farce or a
                        failure. But these calamities are not to come upon the American people, for
                        the reason that the masses are to remain true and steadfast in this great
                        effort to establish their liberties upon a surer foundation than the
                        anomalies upon which they have hitherto rested.</p>
                    <p>The victory is to be won by unremitting labor, and a watchfulness that shall
                        be proof against the surprises planned by traitors at home or abroad. We are
                        to look for no fortuitous happenings, no miraculous interpositions. The
                        friends of the government, working together, cannot be overthrown by any
                        combination possible among their opponents. They may seek to divide and
                        distract us as they have done, and they may partially succeed. But not if
                        the people remain firm, calm and self-contented. United, we are invincible
                        against any force that can be brought against us. Divided we should invite
                        defeat, and attach to ourselves the name of having rejected the counsels of
                        experience and enlightened reason.</p>
                    <p>Our victorious armies are bravely doing their duty in the field. What is
                        required of the loyal men of Pennsylvania is a great victory at the polls In
                        October and November. it is not only essential that the Federal government
                        and the policy required to crush rebellion should be indorsed by the
                        re-election of Abraham Lincoln; but at the coming contest in October it is
                        important that in the election of Congressmen and members of the
                        Legislature, as many districts as possible should be carried by the loyal
                        candidates now in and to be put in the field. We want the moral effect of
                        overwhelming majorities as well as the prestige derived from military power
                        and force. We expect to close the war as much by the influence of the ballot
                        as the bullet. We hope to stop the effusion of bloody by the unmistakable
                        demonstration at the polls that the war is to be waged till the rebellion is
                        ended; and that hostilities will not cease while there is an armed traitor I
                        the field. Such a cessation of hostilities cannot be obtained by compromise
                        or negotiation. It must be achieved by the stern influence of force--by the
                        unmistakable, clear, and well defined proofs of the ability of the
                        government to cope with and conquer all or any of its foes.</p>
                    <p>Men of Pennsylvania, the issues are now before you for consideration and
                        decision. You must abide the result as you establish it for good or evil. We
                        ask you to support Abraham Lincoln because we believe his re-election will
                        fully vindicate the authority of the national government, and fully
                        establish the fact that the free men of the loyal States are able to sustain
                        the existence of the Union and the government against the hazard of
                        opposition from abroad or at home. We ask you to assist not only in the
                        re-election of Abraham Lincoln, but in the election of all loyal candidates
                        for State and Federal offices, because their triumph will recognize our
                        nationality--a result which must contribute to the maintenance of the
                        national government. It needs no argument of our own to establish this
                        position, because our political opponents now antagonize us to achieve
                        entirely the opposite results.</p>
                    <p>Can we hesitate--can there be any trust or confidence in men placed in
                        nomination by such men? Men of family, hesitate--men of property,
                        hesitate--young men, who hope to enjoy both these blessings, hesitate before
                        you cast your votes for nominees made by such agencies.</p>
                    <p>By order of the Union State Central Committee.</p>

                    <p>To Gen. U.S. Grant:: I have the honor to report
                        that I attacked the forces of Gen. Early on the Berryville at the crossing
                        of Opequan creek, and after a most desperate engagement, which lasted from
                        early in the morning until five o'clock in the evening, completely defeated
                        him, driving him through Winchester, and capturing about 2,500 prisoners,
                        five pieces of artillery, nine army flags and most of their wounded. The
                        rebel Generals Rhodes and Gordon were killed, and three other General
                        officers wounded. Most of the enemy's wounded and all their killed fell into
                        our hands. Our losses are severe, among them Gen. D.A. Russell, commanding a
                        division in the Sixth Corps, who was killed by a cannon ball. Generals
                        Upton, McIntosh and Chapman were wounded. I cannot yet tell our losses. The
                        conduct of the officers and men was most superb. They charged and carried
                        every position taken up by the rebels from Opequan creek to Winchester. The
                        rebels were strong in numbers and very obstinate in their fighting. I desire
                        to mention to the Lieutenant General commanding the army, the gallant
                        conduct of Generals Wright, Crooks, Emory, Torbert, and the officers and men
                        under their command. To them the country is indebted for this handsome
                        victory. A more detailed report will be forwarded. Signed,</p>

                    <p>Hon. F. M. Stanton!--Just received the following
                        oficiaal [sic] from Gen. Sheridan, dated 1 o'clock this morning: General: We fought Earley from daylight until
                        between 6 and 7 P.M. We drove him from Opequan Creek through Winchester and
                        beyond the town. We captured from 2500 to 3000 prisoners, five pieces of
                        artillery nine battle flags and all the rebel wounded and dead. Their
                        wounded in Winchester amounts to some 3000. We lost in killed, Gen. David
                        Russell, commanding a division of the 6th army corps, wounded Gen. Chapman,
                        McIntosh and Upton. The rebels lost in killed the following general
                        officers: Gen. Rhodes, Gen. Wharton, Gen. Gordon and Gen. Ramseur. We just
                        sent them whirling through Winchester and we are after them to-morrow. This
                        army behaved splendidly. I am sending forward all material supplies,
                        subsistence stores and all the ambulances.</p>

                    Coffroth voted against the bills that would provide the revenue for those
                    appropriations. Coffroth did not deny the charge.<br>(Names in announcement: Colonel  Stumbaugh, Mr.  McClure)</blockquote>

                    <p>Coffroth in a Snarl--One of the largest political gatherings of the kind ever
                        held in Chambersburg, met at Brown's Hotel on Tuesday evening of last week,
                        to hear Gen. Wm. H. Koontz, the Union candidate for Congress. Col. Stumbaugh
                        presided, and the Fayetteville Band discoursed choice music adapted to the
                        occasion. Probably two hundred soldiers were present, and manifested the
                        liv[e]liest interest in the proceedings. The Keystone Battery marched into
                        the meeting in column, with a Lincoln and Johnson banner, promising 150
                        votes for the Union candidates. They stood in line and preserved the best of
                        order during the whole meeting. After the organization tion [sic] had been
                        completed, Gen. Koontz was intruded, and was received with hearty cheers. He
                        spoke for over an hour, discussing the great issues in a more candid,
                        earnest and eloquent manner, and elicited the warmest commendations of his
                        friends, and expressions of respect even from his political foes. He exposed
                        in a masterly manner the treachery of the Democratic leaders in attempting
                        to mislead the people from the interests of the government by a Peace
                        platform and a quasi War Candidate. His review of Gen. McClellan's position
                        was in the highest degree creditable and entirely unanswerable. He indulged
                        in no personal abuse--no low assaults; but stated his positions with the
                        utmost candor, and elucidated them with clearness and force. Being a
                        stranger to most of his audience, he surpassed all expectations as a stumper
                        and cogent reasoner, and left the Union men most enthusiastic in his support
                        and proud of their standard-bearer. We cannot pretend to give even a
                        synopsis of his remarks.</p>
                    <p>After he had concluded, Mr. M'Clure was called for, and he responded in a few
                        pointed allusions to the congressional record of Gen. Coffroth, the
                        competitor of Gen. Koontz. He stated that the office of Congress was the
                        most important position to be filled at the October election, and urged the
                        people to elect Gen. Koontz because he would vote for every measure
                        necessary to sustain our armies in the field; to pay our brave soldiers; to
                        fill up their ranks, and to maintain the credit of the government. He stated
                        that against Gen. Coffroth personally he had nothing to say; but of his
                        official record he must speak. He said that Gen.
                            Coffroth had never voted for any measure to fill up the ranks of our
                            armies or to raise means to pay them; and said the speaker, I
                        make the statement knowing that I am in the presence and within the hearing
                        of Gen. Coffroth himself. Gen. Coffroth at once stepped up to the outer edge
                        of the crowd, and said--"Col. M'Clure, I wish to say that I voted for every
                            appropriation ever asked for to sustain the
                        armies--I never voted as you have stated." Cries of "turn him out,"
                        &amp;c., were heard from al parts of the meeting, as it was not known
                        that Gen. Coffroth was there; but Mr. M'Clure at once said that if he had
                        misrepresented Gen. Coffroth he had a right to correct him, and let him be
                        heard orderly. He said it was true that Gen. Coffroth had voted for all
                            appropriations asked for to pay the soldiers;
                        but you have read that--</p>
                    <p>"Old mother Hubbard <br>Went to the cupboard <br>To get the poor dog a bone
                        <br>But when she went there <br>The cupboard was bare, <br>And so the
                        poor dog got none!"</p>
                    <p>Gen. Coffroth took good care that no bone for the soldiers should get into
                        the cupboard by his vote, and then generously invited them to take all that
                        was there. When the government wanted revenue to pay the soldiers, who were
                        four months without their wages, Congress was appealed to for a revenue to
                        enable them to be paid, and to sustain the government credit. Against this
                        measure--the only one by which the means could be procured to pay our
                        soldiers--Gen. Coffroth voted at every stage of the proceedings. Does he
                        deny it? Gen. Coffroth did not answer, and the vast meeting cheered most
                        heartily and called for his answer; but none come. Mr. M'Clure then said he
                        had charged that Gen. Coffroth voted steadily against every measure designed
                        to fill up our shattered armies so that they might give triumph to their
                        holy cause. The draft was first urged by Gen. M'Clellan as the only means to
                        fill up our armies, and when the conscription bill was before Congress and
                        conceded on all sides to be the only means of saving our brave defenders
                        from utter defeat, Gen. Coffroth voted against it at every stage, and he
                        never voted for any measure calculated to put a single soldier in the field.
                        He then came home and voted against the right of the
                            soldiers to vote at the next election! Does Gen. Coffroth deny
                        the truth of this statement? The speaker paused, but the valiant General had
                        no answer to make, and his signal discomfiture, provoked by his own folly,
                        was hailed with the widest enthusiasm. His opposition to the armies and
                        their sacred cause was thoroughly exposed, and he could not dispute his own
                        record. He left that meeting certainly a sadder, and possibly a wiser man.
                        The meeting adjourned with cheers for the ticket, for the speakers; for the
                        Keystone Battery, for the band, for the Union, and for the Old Flag.</p>
