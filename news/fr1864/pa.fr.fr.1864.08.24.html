<b>Gen. M'Causland in Chambersburg!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article describes McCausland's invasion of Chambersburg. The Repository
                    explains that General Couch had no troops because as soon as he organized
                    troops, they were called to fortify Grant's forces. General Averill was unable
                    to move his troops into Chambersburg until five hours after the burning. On
                    Friday the 29th, McCausland moved his forces into Chambersburg. The rebels
                    demanded either $500,000 in greenbacks or $100,000 in gold, but the citizens
                    refused to pay. The rebels fired fifty houses in ten minutes. Captain Smith, son
                    of the Virginia governor, burned Norland, A. K. McClure's mansion. The citizens
                    were able to catch and execute some of the rebel soldiers. After leaving
                    Chambersburg, the rebels moved on to McConnelsburg. The rebels robbed many of
                    Chambersburg's citizens and caused enormous destruction. The article lists the
                    names of those whose properties were destroyed: South Side of Market: J.
                    Wolfkill--Josiah Allen; North Side of Market: C. Stout--S. Eckert, and including
                    a building owned by C. W. Eyster, the Court House and the Engine House; West
                    Side Main to Square: B. Chambers--R. Austin, and including a building owned by
                    R. Austin; East Side Main From Square to King: J. Hoke--Mrs. G. Goettman, and
                    including a building owned by D. Trostle; West Side Main From Square to
                    Washington: Mrs. Gilmore--B. Radebaugh, and including the Chambersburg Bank, a
                    building owned by J. B. Miller; East Side Main From Washington to Square: F.
                    Spahr--A. B. Hamilton, and including a building owned by J. P. Culbertson, one
                    owned by D. Reisher, one owned by J. A. Eyster, one owned by James Eyster, two
                    owned by Eyster &amp; Bro., one owned by Brand &amp; Flack, a Mansion
                    House and the Academy; Queen-South Side: J. W. Reges--A. Banker, and including
                    another building owned by J. Flinder, one owned by W. Wallace, one owned by J.
                    A. Eyster, and one owned by Mrs. Fisher; Queen-North Side: Huber (&amp;
                    Co.)--J. P. Culbertson, and including the Baptist Church, a brewery owned by G.
                    Ludwig, a building owned by T. Carlisle, one owned by W. Wallace, and one owned
                    by J. P. Culbertson; Second Street: P. H. Peiffer--A. Reineman, and including

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository contradicts the rebel excuse that the burning of
                    Chambersburg retaliated for similar destruction committed by Union forces. The
                    Repository justifies several examples of destruction committed by Union forces
                    including Hunter's destruction of six houses on his march to Lynchburg, the
                    burning of Governor Letcher's house, the destruction of the Lexington Military

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The fairest town of the Cumberland Valley is in ruins. Half its people are
                        homeless and very many of them penniless and helpless. The stoutest heart
                        must quail as the blackened walls, and withered shades of our beautiful
                        village are witnessed, where were once cheerful and hospitable homes,
                        heartsome trees, the busy hum of industry and the enterprise of our
                        merchants.</p>
                    <p>But let us borrow no sorrow over our desolation. There are enough hearts
                        which must bleed--enough who must embrace relentless want, when all is done
                        that can be done. Let stout hearts therefore review the future of
                        Chambersburg. They are wanted for their own sakes, for the sake of the many
                        doomed to suffering, and they are wanted to give new life to the charred
                        homes and dismal ruins around us. Chambersburg must be
                            re-built. It was not the unhealthy fruit of speculation. No
                        fictitious business--no surge of wild adventure created it. It was the
                        natural, healthy offspring of the great and growing wealth of the beautiful
                        valley in which it was centred. In its business it had no rival, and can
                        have none hereafter. It must supply the same inevitable wants hereafter as
                        heretofore. Its stores must be replaced--its shops must resound again with
                        the sound of the anvil and chisel; its artizans must find the same demand
                        for their handi-work, and its professions have the same duties to-day they
                        had a month ago. Its vast water-power still courses through the heart of our
                        ruins, and new structures must soon turn it to enterprise and profit. In
                        short, the business of Chambersburg, in all its various branches, was
                        imperatively demanded by the wants of the community, and it must be
                        restored.</p>
                    <p>How shall it be done? We hope that the great
                        Commonwealth of which we are an integral part--to which we yield obedience
                        and tribute as the price of common safety--will not be unmindful of the just
                        claim of our people. If not now, we think hereafter this just principle must
                        be recognized; but the future of Chambersburg, however aided, depends upon
                        the energy and determination of her own people. Many escaped the ravages of
                        the fiendish foe entirely, and many others were but crippled in various
                        degrees--not broken in capital or means of livelihood. To such men--one and
                        all--the ruins of Chambersburg appeal for the prompt restoration of our
                        homes and places of business. Ours is a common sorrow. Neither in age, sex,
                        condition or persuasion were shared in the brutality of the enemy, and the
                        cause of one is the cause of all; and to all who have escaped, whether
                        wholly or partially, they have a right to appeal for substantial aid in
                        making new homes and stores, and shops and offices. If we thus go hand in
                        hand and stand shoulder to shoulder, we shall soon see our people employed
                        and thus supplied, and the town will revive as if by magic. If we stand
                        selfishly aside, and make our own our only cause, we shall drive the broken
                        and despairing from us, and thus lose a very large class of our best
                        population.</p>
                    <p>Who shall profit by our misfortunes? There will be
                        more money made in Chambersburg during the next two years, in legitimate
                        business than has been made in the last five. Shall our own sufferers gather
                        these profits, or shall adventurers and strangers? One or the other it must
                        be. If our own people do not rebuild substantially, and slow determination
                        to retain their places and their business as far as it may be at all
                        possible, then will adventurers and sharpers take their places. They will
                        squat on our best vacant corners, gather the profits which should be
                        received by our own people, and as substantial improvement makes them, they
                        will pocket their gain and strike off for some new field I which to reap and
                        carry off a harvest. Our own people can in most instances preserve their
                        business to themselves if they will manfully and resolutely stand together
                        to help each other until the cloud of adversity passes away. True, some must
                        sink beneath the load of misfortune, and for these let the generous
                        contributions of the people of the State perform their kindest offices.</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg is just about to enter upon a prosperous
                            future. After years of fruitless effort we are about to be
                        connected with the great West by a railroad, which must add immensely to the
                        wealth and prosperity of our people. The bill incorporating the Southern
                        Pennsylvania Railroad Company became a law a few days ago, and we are
                        assured that it will be promptly made. It will open new fields of wealth in
                        the Southern counties--must build new villages, and enhance the price of
                        every acre of land in our valley. It comes as the silver lining to the dark
                        cloud just cast over us, and bids us take heart and hope in retrieving the
                        sad calamity that has befallen us. This great enterprise must give a new
                        impulse to the business of Chambersburg, and those who are first and boldest
                        in appreciating the fact, will most profit by it.</p>
                    <p>Dark as is the hour, let us not forget that it has the promise of future
                        prosperity to our town. Let us therefore make common cause to restore
                        Chambersburg; to help the needy; to encourage the desponding, and to give
                        prompt and permanent aid to make the town better if possible than before.
                        The man who erects the first good house on the ruins of his old one, will be
                        the best benefactor of our people, and every man who imitates his example
                        will do a good deed alike for himself and for the many dependent around us.
                        One and all let us resolve that Chambersburg shall be rebuilt, that her
                        population shall again sit down in prosperity where rebel brutality made
                        withering desolation, and when once resolved upon, the good work will be
                        more than half done.</p>
