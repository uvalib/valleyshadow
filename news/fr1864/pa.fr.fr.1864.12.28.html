<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The leading conspirators of the South are about convinced that they have made
                        war to preserve the dominion of Slavery only to reap its total annihilation.
                        Nor are they of this kind who have eyes but see not, such as we have in our
                        midst in the North. Seeing that Slavery is but a mighty suicide, they accept
                        the truth and stand aside to allow the irresistible march of progress pass
                        them by. Several of the rebel Governors have openly advised the freeing of
                        their slaves with the hope of inducing them to accept military service in
                        behalf of the tottering fortunes of treason. Jeff. Davis gravely discusses
                        it in his late message, and the rebel congress is as much distracted by this
                        ever disturbing question as our congress was in days of Southern domination
                        in our National legislature. Even Gen. Lee, the careful, prudent, brave
                        soldier, upon whom the last shadow of the fading confederacy depends, now
                        asks, in despair, that the experiment of freeing and arming the slaves be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>Thus have the leaders of crime determined to abandon Slavery, the author of
                        this wicked, desolating war, and shall the North still cling to the dead
                        body after it has drenched our fair land in blood and is now in the last
                        violent throes of death. Union men will not do so; but many Democrats will,
                        although the shrewder leaders are about to follow the rebel leaders and
                        surrender Slavery to its inevitable fate. The New York World, confessedly the ablest Democratic organ in the country,
                        thus exhorts its party to appreciate the duties of the present and not stand
                        blindly in the way of enlightened progress. It tays [sic]:</p>
                    <p>"One reason why the thoughts of a party should be turned into this channel is
                        that it involves questions which cannot grow obsolete with the lapse of
                        time, while some of the issues in the late election may. Before another
                        Presidential Election the Abolition question, for example, will probably be in such a state that past ideas will not
                            apply. As the problem advances toward its
                            predetermined solution, we shall see public opinion more and more
                        disposed to acquiesce in the manifest tendency of
                        events. Before the expiration of its new lease of power the
                        Republican party will have secured a constitutional amendment for the entire
                        extirpation of Slavery in the United States. If the South should, meanwhile,
                        gain its independence, Slavery can no longer be a question of Federal
                        politics; but if we disarm Southern resistance, the anti-Slavery amendment
                        will have been put in force and have done its work before the Democratic
                        party can be in power. Why should the party bind itself
                            to a dead corpse?</p>
                    <p>"Unless the Democratic party is blind enough to run the hazard of
                        disintegration, it must distinguish between questions
                            virtually settled and questions that still remain open. It must
                        so far keep pace with events as to accept their logic. Public opinion has no
                        efficiency without political combination; but for masses large enough to
                        form a majority to act in concert, thought must be left free on all
                        questions save those which rank as living vital issues. The number who
                        opposes the Abolition of Slavery (now a minority) is not
                            likely to grow larger, but to grow less, with the progress of
                        time. Every Democrat can, of course, hold whatever opinion he chooses on
                        that subject. Such opinions are no longer of the slightest political
                        consequence. Individual Democrats will think what they please; but the
                        subject must be dismissed from the range of topics on which the party is expected to have distinctive views.
                        There is no conceivable position on the Slavery question on which the Democratic party can plant itself and become a
                        majority. Its antecedents and associations, as well as its respect
                        for the Constitution as it stands, found it to become an Abolition party;
                        the progress of events and the tendency of public opinion, as well as the
                        Constitution in the form into which it is certain to be
                            amended, forbid it to commit itself to the fortune of a moribund
                            institution ."</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the foregoing extract from the World, the Tribune pertinently says:</p>
                    <p>"Whatever may be said of the morality or chivalry of the above extract, its
                        sagacity is undeniable. Slavery is in the article of death; it would be
                        rather a good joke if the rebels should get rid of it before we do; but they
                        are very likely to do it. And, once fairly coffined, it will have a smaller
                        and dryer-eyed following of mourners than any illustrious criminal who has
                        preceded it on the way to the house appointed for all the living. Thousands
                        shallowly presume that the South is a unit in fanatical devotion to its
                        giant cause; when, to say nothing of the negroes, there never was a time
                        when a very large proportion of the Southern whites, including their wisest
                        and best, did not feel and know that Slavery was their bane and curse. But
                        the slaveholders held the reins of power; they could and did smother
                        expression but not thought; so the car of Juggernaut rolled on, over
                        prostrate, crushed inwardly shuddering while volubly adoring multitudes.
                        Slavery once admitted to be dead, the secrets of that giant prison-house
                        will be revealed, and thousands will learn that those whom they have
                        regarded as idolaters of the Southern Moloch, were at heart its deadly foes
                        all along.</p>
                    <p>"No sane person ever can have believed Slavery in accord with the Golden
                        Rule, but millions have fancied it personally advantageous. Some derived a
                        pecuniary profit from their relation to it; others deemed it the ladder
                        whereon they climbed to social eminence. It was on this ground that the
                        Southern women became more fanatical in their devotion to it than their
                        husbands and brothers; women being, as a class, more aristocratic--that is,
                        placing a higher value on social distinction--than men. It is quite probable
                        that the sincerest and most persistent contemners of Emancipation will be
                        found among the white half-sisters of those whom it makes free. But, Slavery
                        once dead, the great bulk of our native-born doughfaces will protest that
                        they never believed in nor favored it--that they only stood up for the Union
                        and the Constitution. And so that we have Freedom, Union and Peace, we shall
                        not be inclined to controvert their assertions on a point which will have
                        become wholly immaterial."</p>
