<b>Gamblers And Their Panics</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The good people of Franklin county, who add steadily to their wealth by
                        honest industry and frugality, know but little of the millions of money
                        gambled upon the stock boards of the leading cities. With every revival of
                        business stock gambling becomes epidemic, until it involves an almost
                        incalculable amount of capital in the great whirlpool of speculation. It is
                        manifested at first only in limited circles; but it steadily seizes upon the
                        more substantial monied men in the cities and leading towns in the country,
                        until the great business operations of the cities become mere betting upon
                        the prices of stocks. All go into it, and yet all will admit, when their
                        sober senses are appealed to, that it is hazardous, and in the end
                        overwhelming ruin must come; but each hopes to get out in due time to leave
                        the fury of the storm fall upon their neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Any intelligent observer who scans the reports of stock sales in the city
                        journals, need not be told that almost every class of stocks are daily
                        gambled off at prices far, very far beyond their actual value. The stock of
                        the Bank of Chambersburg sells at about $70, solely because it is
                        intrinsically worth it. Every share sold is actually delivered and paid for,
                        and every share bought, is wanted by the purchaser because he has money to
                        invest, and he believes that he cannot invest it to better advantage. It
                        steadily pays ten per cent dividends out of actual profits, and has a
                        surplus of over $50,000. It is not difficult therefore to calculate its
                        value. But on the stock boards of the leading cities, Reading Railroad stock
                        fluctuates from $60 to $80, although it has never, at least within twenty
                        years, paid a cash dividend; has never earned actual cash profits, and in
                        ordinary business times, it cannot be expected to earn enough to pay a
                        dividend upon its immense capital. Philadelphia and Erie sells at $35 to
                        $40, when it cannot possibly pay a dividend of any kind within the next five
                        years. All manner of Oil, Gold, Silver, Copper and other mining stocks are
                        gotten up and bulled upon the market until they are pushed into the hands of
                        innocent victims, when they naturally enough explode and the loss falls upon
                        the verdant ones who were Jeremy Diddled out of their money by dazzling
                        promises of rapid fortune.</p>
                    <p>The "bulls" are those who are interested in inflating prices. They have
                        everything at stake in advancing the value of the stocks they are operating
                        in. The "bears" are interested in reducing prices, and go in to prostrate
                        them when a chance offers, and make their money by "selling short." Some
                        operators are conspicuous as "bulls" and others as "bears;" but most of
                        stock gamblers operate for a fall or for a rise in the market, just as seems
                        most promising. When the country is prosperous, capital abundant seeking
                        investment, the "bulls" reap their harvest; but when the army is successful,
                        European crops reported as promising, or any other causes transpire
                        calculated to reduce prices, the "bulls" are ever ready to throw themselves
                        into the breach and "corner" the unfortunate until the very last attainable
                        dollar is wrung from them.</p>
                    <p>All such operations are very properly called gambling, because they are not
                            bona fide business transactions. Sales of
                        millions of stock are reported daily, while in fact not one-twentieth part
                        of the transactions reported are actual sales. Hundreds of thousands of gold
                        are reported daily as sold and bought, while perhaps not one of the sales
                        are actual purchases embracing delivery of the gold and payment therefor.
                        The sales are simply the hazard of the gambler upon the price of gold the
                        next hour, the next day or the next week; and when the time is up, the
                        difference in price is paid or received, and the transaction is closed. The
                        same men might with equal honesty, in a moral point of view, stake their
                        money upon the turn of a card at fare, or the thimble-rigger's little joker,
                        for it is but a hazard to win or lose, with this difference in favor of
                        gambling at cards--that it wrongs none but the victim and those dependent
                        upon him, while stock gambling, by its wanton inflation of prices, has made
                        the whole Nation pay tribute to its madness. When stocks are rising and
                        money abundant, the stock gambling fraternity combine their skill to make
                        the rise as rapid and high as possible; and by just such gigantic gambling
                        have prices of everything, including even the necessaries of life, been
                        advanced far beyond what they should be to-day. The actual demand for gold
                        would not make it worth over 30 per cent. premium were it bought and sold
                        only when absolutely wanted; but as it is confessedly the standard of all
                        values, and as its rise in the market produces a corresponding rise in
                        prices generally, it is borne upward by all manner of speculative
                        combinations, and imme[n]se nominal sales are made without one dollar of the
                        precious metal changing hands at all. Thus--John Smith sells John Jones
                        $10,000 of gold, and the sale is reported as that amount of gold sold, say
                        at $1.70, with perhaps the addition of "b 20 days"--which means "buyer
                        twenty days;" that Mr. Jones can call upon Mr. Smith--not for the gold, but
                        for the difference in the price at any time in twenty days; or if it is not
                        called for in the time specified, at the expiration of the twenty days the
                        parties are bound to settle, and if gold is $1.71, Jones pockets his $100,
                        or if it is $1.69, he pays Smith $100 and the matter is closed. The plain
                        meaning of the transaction is that Jones wagers Smith that within twenty
                        days gold will be worth over $1.70, while Smith makes his money on the
                        hazard that it will fall below that figure. Perhaps neither has a dollar in
                        gold, or it may be that both together are not worth $10,000; but they simply
                        put up the "margin," which may be about 10 per cent., and thus on a capital
                        of $1,000 they gamble to the extent of $10,000. Of course Jones wants gold
                        up, so that the profit may be large as possible and he "bulls" the market;
                        predicts the failure of the army; the derangement of the currency; the
                        prostration of National credit; magnifies the rebel forces; declares foreign
                        intervention just at hand, and rejoices at copperhead riots and captures and
                        massacres like Fort Pillow. On the other hand, Smith "bears" at the boards,
                        and is intensely loyal; promises an easy victory for Grant and the capture
                        of Richmond within thirty days; and is ready to pronounce any man a traitor
                        who does not consider legal tenders as good as gold. And so goes stock
                        gambling to the extent of millions daily.</p>
                    <p>The end is ruin, inevitable and terrible in its completeness and scope, for
                        the higher the inflation the lower the revulsion when the crash comes. All
                        know it; but all hope to be out in time; but the gambler's infatuation is
                        usually stronger than this judgment, and those who acquire wealth by the
                        fickle smile of fortune, are, in the main, those who lose it by her sudden
                        and relentless frown. Occasionally there are mutterings of the distant
                        storm, and one weak man gives over; he knocks down a dozen in his full, and
                        they in turn, between short accounts and panic, send thrice their number to
                        the wall. Thus, on Monday of last week, speculation was on a rampage; gold
                        was up to 78 per cent. premium, and operators confidently counted on sending
                        it up to 100 before thirty days. But Secretary Chase wants money, he must
                        have it, and the sale of ten-forties does not supply him. He goes to New
                        York, induces the Banks to take ten millions in two days, and, it is said,
                        that he sold some thirteen millions of gold. He did not gamble in the price
                        of coin but he sold to deliver, for he wanted the money. The result was that
                        he took from New York nearly thirty millions of currency in a few days. Of
                        course such a draft even upon New York, made the banks demand their call
                        loans which were out in every imaginable species of gambling, and hundreds
                        were caught "short" in cash; were compelled to dispose of their gambling
                        contracts to realize, and with Mr. Chase's gold thrown upon the market, and
                        the gathering up of currency to pay for it and the bonds sold, stocks
                        toppled down, and panic seized the whole brood of gamblers. On Tuesday of
                        last week the contracts on stocks and gold in the hands of gamblers
                        depreciated so that the loss, to the parties carrying them, on that day,
                        would have been over twenty-five millions. Several leading stock-gamblers
                        failed, or as the commercial phrase goes, gave notice that they could not
                        meet their engagements--that is pay the winnings to the parties playing
                        against them--and asked extensions. Weak and over-loaded operators went
                        under; but those who could possibly carry themselves over the panic did so
                        at every sacrifice, hoping for an early re-action. In gambler's panics, like
                        that of last week, the Banks are compelled to exhaust themselves to save the
                        gamblers, for their interests are so interwoven with their borrowers, that
                        they must save all that can be saved. The "bears" of course go in heavy in
                        such a crisis, and make all possible combinations to hammer down the prices
                        to the lowest point. When the "bulls" are "cornered" and must "sell short,"
                        they stand aside and decline to buy, while the crippled "bulls" generally
                        can afford but little aid to the "lame ducks" of the flock; and so the
                        gamblers' panic is pressed mercilessly by systematic and skillful efforts
                        until the bottom is reached.</p>
                    <p>Any day in the early part of last week the leading brokers' offices were
                        crowded with jubilant "bears" who were struggling with all of a heartless
                        gambler's ferocity to make the little storm a deluge; and crippled "bulls"
                        were racked with intensest anxiety to save themselves from utter ruin. The
                        offices of Jay Cooke &amp; Co., E. W. Clark &amp; Co. and Drexel
                        &amp; Co., in Philadelphia, would have passed for densely crowded
                        lunatic asylums, with an assortment of the most frantic patients. Men would
                        rush in and out in as if possessed by forty fiends, and with distended eyes,
                        blanched cheeks and haggard faces, wearing every insignia of woe, they would
                        run from place to place to procure relief before the fatal hour when
                        accounts must be made up. In New York it was worse, if possible, and one
                        house went under with unadjusted liabilities of several millions, and was of
                        course followed by others. They were but scotched however--not killed. It
                        was but a gambler's panic--not a great revulsion brought about by legitimate
                        channels of trade, for with all the losses and failures and excitement, the
                        legitimate business never was more prosperous and solvent. And so it will be
                        again. The lesson of last week is already forgotten; the wounded are in
                        again to retrieve; the dead are entombed, and millions are gambled daily as
                        before. In the mean time honest industry is well requited; prosperity smiles
                        upon all legitimate branches of trade, and the thousand sinews of labor are
                        gathering rich harvests without feverish brains or fretted tempers; and the
                        people look with sublime indifference upon gamblers and gamblers'
                    panics.</p>

                    <p>We have already given a brief account of the inhuman brutality practised by
                        the rebels upon the troops of Fort Pillow after it had been surrendered; but
                        the details increase in horror as they are developed. The negro troops

                        and were overcome. A correspondent thus describes the scene after the rebels
                        got possession of the Fort:</p>
                    <p>After the rebels were in undisputed possession of the fort and the survivors
                        had surrendered, they commenced the indiscriminate butchery of all the
                        Federal soldiers. The colored soldiers threw down their guns and raised
                        their arms in token of surrender, but not the least attention was paid to
                        it. They continued to shoot down all they found. A number of them finding
                        the quarter was given, ran over the bluff to the river, and tried to conceal
                        themselves under the bank and in the bushes, were pursued by the rebel
                        savages, and implored them to spare their lives. Their appeals were made in
                        vain and they were all shot down in cold blood, and in full sight of the
                        gunboat. I passed up the bank of the river and counted fifty dead strewed
                        along. One had crawled into a hollow log and was killed it it [sic]; another
                        had got over the bank into the river, and got to a board that ran out into
                        the water. He lay on it on his face, with his feet in the water. He laid
                        there when exposed stark and still. Several had tried to hide in crevices
                        made by the falling bank, and could not be seen without difficulty but they
                        were singled out and killed. From the best information I could get the white
                        soldiers were, to a very considerable extent, treated in the same way. One
                        of the 13th Tennessee on board--D.W. Harrison--informs me that after the
                        surrender he was below the bluff, and one of the rebels presented a pistol
                        to shoot him. He told him he had surrendered and requested him not to fire.
                        He spared him and directed him to go up the bluff to the fort. Harrison
                        asked him to go before him, or he would be shot by others, but he told him
                        to go along. He started, and had not proceeded far before he met a rebel who
                        presented his pistol. Harrison begged him not to fire but paying no
                        attention to his request, he fired and shot him through the shoulder, and
                        another shot him in the leg. He full [sic], and while he lay unable to move,
                        another came along and was about to fire again, when Harrison told him he
                        was badly wounded twice, and implored not to fire. He asked Harrison if he
                        had any money. He said he had a little money and a watch. The rebel took
                        from him his watch and ninety dollars in money, and left him. Harrison is
                        probably fatally wounded. Several such cases have been related to me, and I
                        think, to a great extent, the whites and negroes were indiscriminately
                        murdered. The rebel Tennesseans have about the same bitterness against
                        Tennesseans in the Federal army, as against the negroes. I was told by a
                        rebel officer that Gen. Forrest shot one of his men and cut another with his
                        saber for shooting down prisoners. It may be so, but he is responsible for
                        the conduct of his men, and Gen. Chalmers stated publicly while on Platte
                        Valley, that though he did not encourage or countenance his men in shooting
                        down negro captives, yet that it was right and justifiable.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There were 411,613 mulatto slaves in the south in 1840, of whom 69,979 were
                        in Virginia; 43,281 in Kentucky, and 36,900 in Georgia. These numbers are
                        considerably beyond the legitimate proportion of those States. There were
                        also 176,739 free mulattoes in the United States in 1860, of whom 106,770
                        belonged to the south, and 69,969 to the free States. Of the free mulattoes
                        Virginia contained 23,485, which number, added to her slave mulattoes makes
                        a total of miscegenated population of 93,824. Her mulatto slaves alone
                        exceeded the total number of mulattoes in the free States.</p>
                    <p>The whole number of mulattoes, slave and free, in the Union, in 1860, was
                        588,352, of whom 69,969 belonged to the free States, and 518,383 to the
                        slave States--a number greater than the combined white population of
                        Arkansas, Delaware and Florida--greater than the white population of
                        Maryland--almost twice as great as that of South Carolina, and twice as
                        great as the combined populations of Delaware and Florida. The mulatto
                        population of Virginia alone exceeds the number of whites in Delaware or
                        Florida.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit of last week has an ungenerous assault
                        upon Judge Nill--ungenerous because it resorts to in[n]uendo to convey the
                        impression to its readers that prejudice control[l]ed the court in the
                        recent criminal trials. So grave an imputation should be made only when
                        clearly warranted by the wanton disregard of the claims of justice, and then
                        they should come with a gravity and manly distinctness which would appeal to
                        the calm judgment rather than the excited prejudices of the public.</p>
                    <p>We do not assume to defend Judge Nill, for the reason that we perceive
                        nothing wherein he needs vindication. That he may err in the discharge of
                        his responsible duties is not only possible, but highly probably, for the
                        purest and profoundest of jurists have yet to attain infallibility; but that
                        he is inflexible in his integrity, both personal and judicial, and aims at
                        the highest standard of impartial justice in his official acts, cannot be
                        doubted by dispassionate men who know him; and malice must be impotent to
                        assail one whose unsullied life, borne to nearly three-score years, affords
                        the best guarantee of his fidelity to justice. The unsustained record of
                        such a private life, needs no labored vindication when it comes in conflict
                        with partizan madness in the discharge of sacred official duties.</p>
                    <p>Judge Nill may or may not have erred in the criminal trials of our recent
                        court. We have yet to see evidence that he did; and doubt not that when
                        disapassionate [sic] judgment comes to examine his acts, the distortions and
                        quibbles which heated political malice have given birth to, will vanish from
                        view. But, whatever may be the individual opinions of men, who assume to
                        define the laws more wisely than the court, we do protest against a journal
                        that circulates widely throughout the county as the Spirit does, dragging the decisions of our tribunals of justice
                        into the mire of politics, and appealing to political prejudices to impair
                        the restraining power of the laws. No form of attack could so surely, and
                        imperceptibly on the part of the people appealed to destroy confidence in
                        courts of justice and to the same extent breed lawlessness, as unmanly
                        in[n]uendoes striking at the integrity of our judges. This journal has shown
                        its devotion to law over all political interests or political prejudices. It
                        has demanded inflexible obedience to the laws, and their impartial and stern
                        enforcement, regardless of political faith or condition in life; and if the
                        chief administrator of the law should fail to do his whole duty, we should
                        boldly condemn him as the chief of criminals.</p>
                    <p>The integrity of our courts is not to be trifled with in times like these,
                        save at fearful cost to the order and safety of society; and we feel assured
                        that the Spirit has not well weighed the natural
                        fruits of its imputations--so far as they may meet with like prejudices to
                        cherish them--or it would have spoken manfully for the vindication of the
                        laws, rather than grovel in the assaults usually employed against political
                        candidates in a partizan conflict. Its publishers have an equal interest
                        with every other citizen in the faithful maintenance of the laws, and its
                        sole safety is in the judicial tribunals of the land. Let it join all who
                        love order in sustaining the courts, and make common cause against crime,
                        instead of lavishing sympathy upon wrong doers because of the political
                        persuasion of criminals.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The times are prosperous. Money is abundant, and labor is well requited in
                        every channel of industry. Trade has an impetus hitherto unknown within the
                        experience of the present active men; and fortune seems to smile upon every
                        one whose hand is put forth to welcome her. Our farmers have had a
                        succession of bountiful harvests, and their products have commanded more
                        than remunerating prices.</p>
                    <p>The present is a good time to guard against future disaster. It is well for
                        all to pause at times and take their latitude, for prosperity is as
                        capricious as the morning mists, and may vanish when we least expect it. We
                        do not predict early or certain revulsion; but as surely as night succeeds
                        day, revulsion, more or less terrible in its power, must follow inflation;
                        and if we rush on as if rich harvests were to be perpetual, and as if money
                        were to be ever abundant, it needs no prophet to foretel[l] that disaster
                        will come with the first depression of the great business interests of the
                        county.</p>
                    <p>Let the thoughtful man compare the present with the habits and prudence of
                        our people five years ago. Then we shunned debt as the fruitful parent of
                        ruin--now every species of debt is regarded with singular indifference.
                        Counties, townships and boroughs do not hesitate to contract debts of
                        startling magnitude to pay bounties to volunteers. True, we are but doing
                        our duty to our government in exhausting our resources to sustain its
                        supreme and protecting power; but it should not for a moment be forgotten
                        that now is the time to pay!</p>
                    <p>Every district in Franklin county has contracted a large debt to fill its
                        quota of troops. We honor them for it; but the whole of these debts could be
                        paid just now without being seriously felt by the people, while if allowed
                        to remain unsettled under the mistaken notion that they can be better paid
                        in light instal[l]ments, they may entail a bitter legacy upon us in after
                        years. Suppose these debts should be to pay in the midst of revulsions such
                        as 1857 and 1860 witnessed; or with a deranged currency such as 1838-40
                        produced, would they not bring terror to every door? Bear in mind that
                        several thousand millions of National debt have been imposed upon us by
                        murderous treason, and it must be sustained and eventually paid. It will be
                        a heavy tax upon our resources and industry for generations to come; and it
                        is unwise to add to the necessary burdens, the demands which the present
                        times should provide for.</p>
                    <p>We would earnestly urge every district now loaded with bounty debt, to pay it
                        at once. It can be done without hardship upon any class of people at this
                        time; and every dictate of prudence points to the wisdom of employing the
                        superabundant resources of the country, to relieving existing embarrassments
                        as far as possible. It is the safe rule always to pay when able to do so;
                        and we submit to the people whether they can ever hope to be in a better
                        position to pay than just now? We hope, indeed, that the current year will
                        extinguish every such debt, and leave the people prepared for every
                        sacrifice the preservation of our sacred Nationality may impose upon them,
                        without being crippled by local obligations. Let every township, ward or
                        borough adopt the motto--"pay as you go."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have been kindly furnished by Capt. J.M. Brown with the following letter
                        from Rev. T.V. Moore. It will be seen that he confidently expected the
                        release of Messrs. Hamilton and Culbertson on parole; and the fact that they
                        were brought from Salisbury to Richmond a few weeks ago looks as if their
                        early release on parole is probable. Dr. Moore has been unremitting in his
                        attention to our citizen prisoners, and they all bear grateful testimony to
                        his kindness. We subjoin his letter:</p>
                    <p>Sparta, Ga., March 28, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir: Your letter of the 27th, and the check for $100, were delayed by my
                        absence on a trip for my health, which was seriously threatened. Both have
                        reached me here. On my return I will negotiate the draft, unless prevented
                        by a recent law forbidding all traffic in U.S. currency. I hope to do so
                        without violating this law. But even if I cannot, I will still supply these
                        gentlemen, to my last dollar, so that their friends may feel easy as far as
                        my efforts can make them. I tried to get Dr. H. and Mr. C. paroled before I
                        left and hope it may have been done by this time, and that they are now with
                        you. If so, give them my kind regards. Be assured that any thing I can do
                        for any of my former friends there, will be done with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>I am yours truly, T.V. Moore,</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. James M. Brown, Chambersburg, Pa.
                    </p>
