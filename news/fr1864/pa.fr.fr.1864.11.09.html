<b>The Struggle Ended</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository describes the struggle between the Democrats and the Union
                    parties in the 1864 elections. In the improbable case of Democratic victory in
                    the presidency, the paper pledges to support McClellan as long as he maintains
                    the unity of the United States and overthrows treason.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The great political struggle of 1864 belongs to history, and few there be who
                        do not rejoice that its passions and prejudices have fulfilled their
                        mission, or at least exhausted their efforts for evil. That their baneful
                        fruits must linger and survive the field of mad strife and phrenzied
                        political hatreds and hopes, is, we fear, but too true; but it is a welcome
                        hour to every faithful man that closes the contest and bids the conflicting
                        host to retire and yield the victory to those who have won it.</p>
                    <p>Never before have we struggled through a National contest with such a sense
                        of responsibility, and with such mingled hopes and fears, as in the one just
                        closed. We had no idols to consecrate with power; no shrine of personal
                        devotion that called out a Nation's overflowing love and enthusiasm, such as
                        wept in the train of the tall white plume of Harry Clary. Men and
                        men-worshippers were dwarfed in the colossal issues of the conflict, and
                        they faded into insignificance as a mighty Nationality struggled with deadly
                        treason in the field and subtle treachery at home, for its own life.
                        Candidates were but the representatives of ideas, around whom gathered their
                        supporters often with sullen, earnest, tireless effort rather than the
                        hearty shouts which have usually made the welkin ring in Presidential
                        contests.</p>
                    <p>Passion deepened into prejudice--prejudice into implacable hatred even of a
                        beneficent government; and there were thousands upon thousands who were
                        insensibly led, step by step, until they mourned our country's triumphs and
                        rejoiced at its misfortunes. Clouded by intensified political inclinations,
                        they forgot the holy duty of the citizen to law and order, and lawlessness
                        sprang million-tongued from one side of the contending lines, and spread the
                        seeds of anarchy among friend and foe. On the side of the Democratic party
                        there was an habitual teaching of disregard for law--a constant wearing out
                        of the sanctity with which all have been taught to regard it in better days;
                        and it culminated in thousands of skulking conscripts who, forgetful of
                        honor, shame and country, turn upon their own homes, upon their house-hold
                        gods and upon their Nationality, and peril the last hope of Free Government
                        by their perfidy. Equally, earnestly and persistently were the people taught
                        that our taxes are but needless oppression; that our debt but the fruits of
                        remorseless tyranny, and that the calls for troops to strengthen our brave
                        armies in the field, are but the steady strides of a grasping usurpation;
                        and resistance even to revolution was counseled, either in spirit or in
                        fact, until the last refuge of a free people--the majesty of law--was
                        threatened in the very house of its friends. Could such elements in a
                        National struggle fail to be fruitful or evil? Not alone within their own
                        chequered ranks did it lessen the sanctity for law; but its pestiferous
                        breath spread like a deadly miasma over friend and foe, and aimed at the
                        very vitals of the life of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>We write without knowledge as to the result of the great contest. We hope to
                        record in these columns the re-election of President Lincoln by a decisive
                        majority, but improbable as it is, a different result is remotely possible,
                        and we would have all men, of whatever political persuasion, prepare to
                        leave passion and lawlessness on the field so desperately contested, and
                        make common cause for the preservation of the government. If Gen. M'Clellan
                        is chosen President of the United States, he has a right to demand the
                        support and co-operation of every citizen in his effort to administer the
                        government. As its constitutional head, we should sustain him in all things
                        looking to the safety of our institutions. We should differ with him
                        doubtless in many of his measures and council against his policy; but
                        looking as we do to the majesty of law as the only safety to person,
                        property and our institutions, we should seek to strengthen rather than
                        weaken his power so long as he stood firmly for maintaining the unity of the
                        States and overthrowing treason. And equally sacred is the duty imposed upon
                        the opponents of Mr. Lincoln if he is our Chief Magistrate, chosen in
                        conformity with our laws. Mere political differences cannot justify an open,
                        desperate effort to defeat the measures of the government in a deadly
                        conflict with traitors. He who assumes that he is the best judge of what
                        measures the government should adopt to preserve it, and refuse assent or
                        support to any other, is himself either deceived or purposely faithless to
                        his country; and whatever may be the political affinities, of our chosen
                        rulers, let them be sustained with one voice until treason is overthrown,
                        and an honorable and enduring peace gained for ourselves and posterity. We
                        hope indeed that the torrent of partizan prejudice has spent its fury, and
                        that henceforth we shall make common cause to rescue the Republic from its
                        relentless foes, and give speedy and decisive triumph to Liberty and
                    Law!</p>

<b>Court Proceedings</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes the court proceedings beginning October 31. Judge King, with
                    associates Judges Carson and Paxton, sat on the bench. In Com. vs. J. Andrew for

                    prosecution, the court found the defendant not guilty and ordered Eberly to pay
                    2/3 of costs of prosecution and Andrews the remaining. In Com. vs. W. Williams
                    for larceny, the court ruled not guilty. In Com. vs. P. Troupman for throwing
                    stones, with J. Hadebaugh as the prosecutor, the court ruled not guilty for the

                    Yeager for assault and battery with J. Caseman as the prosecutor, the court
                    ruled not guilty and ordered each party to pay half the costs. In Com. vs. W.

                    age." The court sent Butler to the House of Refuge. In Com. vs. G. Smith for
                    horse stealing, with J. Kissecker as the prosecutor, the defendant pled guilty
