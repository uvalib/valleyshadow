                    colossal suicide."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We give in to-day's paper the letter of General M'Clellan formally accepting
                        the Chicago nomination for the Presidency. It is a virtual confession that
                        the declaration of principles adopted by the Democratic National Convention
                        is at variance with the interests of the government, and needs to be
                        modified, charitably explained, and elaborately apologized for, to rescue
                        him from open, undisguised complicity with the traitors in arms against the
                        Union. This is a most herculean task, and no sincere, earnest and honest
                        patriot would have attempted it; but Gen. M'Clellan has undertaken the
                        hopeless enterprise and has wasted every element of strength he possessed
                        with many loyal Democrats because of his presumed manliness and unfaltering
                        devotion to the government and its faithful soldiers and supporters.</p>
                    <p>The letter of Gen. M'Clellan will, when he shall have been rejected by a
                        loyal people by an overwhelming vote, stand out as the culminating point of
                        his sacrifice of all the qualities of a true soldier and zealous patriot at
                        the feet of a conclave of treacherous politicians. Their aim is well
                        understood. Traitor and loyalist alike read their platform and appreciate
                        their purposes; and Gen. M'Clellan, instead of spurning their treachery and
                        giving heart and hope to loyal men by manfully espousing the cause of the
                        imperiled Republic, tremblingly approaches the traitor's creed--sugar-coats
                        it with gentle apologies; dilutes it with a finely prepared imitation of
                        fidelity to our Nationality, and then swallows the dose down and seems to
                        congratulate himself that he has concealed the cloven foot of his friends
                        and exponents, and hopes to defraud a Nation, just about to triumph
                        decisively over relentless treason, into colossal suicide.</p>
                    <p>Gen. M'Clellan's letter is unworthy of either a soldier or a statesman. It
                        has neither the frankness of the one, nor the ingenuity of the other. It is
                        miserably jesuitical, serpentine and treacherous; and if inspired by the
                        genius of Treason itself, could not be more hollow, hypocritical and
                        deceptive in its aim. there is not a word in it that would offend the most
                        earnest devotee of Jeff. Davis. All his rethorical [sic] repetitions about
                        preserving the Union can bring no terror to traitors as long as he is bound
                        hand and foot by men who favor his election solely because they know that
                        his administration would bring no evil to the authors of this wicked,
                        desolating war. They know that Clement C. Vallandigham nominated him; they
                        know that the business of that Convention was arranged in council at Niagara
                        between the Thompsons, the Holcombs, the Sanders, and the Clays on the part
                        of Davis, and the Vallandighams, the Seymours, the Longs, the Biglers and
                        the Woods on the part of M'Clellan, and they have no fears for the cunning
                        sophistries which he has assumed to weave about their fabric of treason,
                        since it can accomplish nothing beyond deceieving [sic] honest men into the
                        embrace of their Country's foes. They know that with him on the ticket is
                        Geo. H. Pendleton, who, while M'Clellan was in the field, "<emph
                            rend="italic">thanked God that he had never voted or given a dollar in
                            support of the war, or in payment of Abolition soldiers!</emph>" and
                        well do they know that with the triumph of that party all vindication of the
                        majesty of the laws and all hopes of the stability of Republican government
                        must end. With an Executive to control the destinies of the Nation who
                        declares as an additional article of the Democratic faith, "that when any
                        one State is willing to return to the Union it should be received at once,
                        with a <emph rend="italic">full guarantee of all of its constitutional
                            rights</emph>," what has treason to fear? It is without penalty. It may
                        drench this fair land in fraternal blood at pleasure, and forfeit no rights;
                        suffer no punishment, and resume its place and honors in the family of
                        States whenever it grows weary of desolation and slaughter. Already treason
                        has sacrificed half a million lives, has shadowed the whole land in
                        mourning; has spread the dark pall of sorrow over almost every family
                        circle; has staggered us with debt all by a war the most causeless, the most
                        wicked in the history of crime; and yet the Democratic candidate for the
                        Presidency, lest his meaningless flourishes on the side of war should offend
                        some faithless man, hastens to declare that traitors must be welcomed to the
                        family fold, and the highest honors and prerogatives lavished upon them. And
                        this from one, too, under whose military lead, fully fifty thousand brave
                        soldiers found untimely graves as sacrifices to the fiendish ferocity of
                        traitors! Is there no avenging hand this side of the Eternal bar for such
                        wanton murder! Are there no violated laws--no sacred principle of order and
                        government to vindicate? Is the power of justice so paralyzed in this great
                        Republic that it can have no terrors in its sweep to palsy the arms of
                        future traitors? Alas! for the warrior of the Peninsula and of Antietam, for
                        what did he draw his sword--for what sacrifice thousands of brave men in
                        sanguinary war, if treason is no crime? It be a crime such as will justify
                        the terrible arbiter of the word, must it be crowned with honor in its dying
                        hours, and exalted to the highest trust of the Nation when it is wasted in
                        power, unable longer to glut its infernal appetites, and seeks to be rescued
                        from the damning history its crimsoned infamy merits? If so, then is treason
                        a virtue--then are its murderers heroes--its desolation records of national
                        prowess and heroism; and fidelity, patriotism, humanity and justice, are but
                        cunningly devised fiction and frauds upon mankind!</p>
                    <p>We pass hastily over Gen. M'Clellan's war upon himself. The weakness that
                        dwarfed him from the soldier and patriot to the awkward and mousing
                        politician, explains it all. The first to order and enforce arbitrary arrest
                        and summary punishment, he now, in obedience to his managers, pledges
                        himself to maintain the "rights of citizens" inviolate. "<emph rend="italic"
                            >See that none escape!</emph>" were his peremptory instructions to Gen.
                        Banks when he ordered the summary arrest and incarceration of the Maryland
                        legislature; but Vallandigham had not been schooled in Chattanooga and
                        Richmond, to teach Presidential candidates how to attempt to give a crowning
                        triumph to treason by systematic perfidy. The first to advise and enforce
                        the liberation of the slaves of rebels by military law, to weaken the
                        resources of the enemy, he now recites in faultless style the new lessons
                        given him which call for a "full guarantee" of "all constitutional rights"
                        to rebels whenever they will deign to accept them slaves and all! The first
                        to counsel war until the insurgents submit tot he authority of the
                        government, he now pours the oil of joy into the deadly wounds our brave
                        armies have given to treason, by demanding that they be indemnified for the
                        past, and honored and secured for the future, until it shall be their
                        pleasure to resort to rebellion, murder and free-booting again. The first to
                        demand a conscription of men to fill up the armies, he is now silent as the
                        grave as to the shattered ranks of war heroic and still unfaltering
                        soldiers, while every rioter who abstracts men from the field to preserve
                        order at home, is vociferous for the triumph of M'Clellan in November next.
                        Notwithstanding his rhetorical flourishes in favor of the preservation of
                        the Union, he well knows that there is not an out-right traitor, nor a
                        semi-traitor, nor a rebel sympathizer, nor a foe of the government of any
                        stamp or persuasion, who will not most enthusiastically vote for him; and
                        there is not a rebel in arms to-day from the arch-fiend who presides over
                        the withered waste of treason, down to the humblest of his satellites in
                        crime, who will not watch every pulsation of the North with ardent
                        aspirations for his success!</p>
                    <p>Such is the position of Gen. M'Clellan as voluntarily made for himself. When
                        the free people of the North forget the claims of their sacred Nationality;
                        when they cease to mourn their martyrs in the cause of Civil Liberty; when
                        they fail to rejoice at the triumph of the Union armies; when they accept
                        treason as a virtue--order and government as a crime--then, and not till
                        then, can Gen. Geo. B. M'Clellan be chosen their President!</p>

                    <p>It will be seen by reference to an advertisement in to-day's paper, that the
                        Commissioners under the act incorporating the Connellsville and Southern
                        Pennsylvania Railway company, will meet at Bedford on Friday the 14th day of
                        October next, to receive subscriptions to the capital stock of this
                        important enterprise.</p>
                    <p>We are assured that arrangements have been matured for the early location and
                        prompt completion of this vital link in our Southern railroad connections;
                        and the citizens of the Southern counties should take the liveliest interest
                        in facilitating its progress. It will, when made, give new life to the long
                        isolated border counties, and open new avenues for various articles largely
                        consumed by our people, which now cost enormously because of the immense
                        transportation tax added to the original value. The construction of a
                        Southern railroad will bring us into immediate communication with rich coal
                        fields and vast forests of lumber, and reduce the price of those commodities
                        fully one-third; and in addition it will give us a direct route west; build
                        up new towns along the line; start factories on our water powers; bring our
                        exhaustless beds of superior ore into use, and enhance the value of every
                        acre of land in Franklin and the adjoining counties westward.</p>
                    <p>To Chambersburg, the centre of the great wealth of the Cumberland Valley, now
                        in ruins, this movement is the boon of promise, the silver-lining to the
                        cloud that envelops our despoiled people. It will give a new impetus to our
                        town--will create new demands; will attract a large amount of capital to
                        improve our now waste but valuable lots, and will give employment and hope
                        to hundreds now on the brink of despair. With Chambersburg in communication
                        with the great West by direct railroad line, it must in a few years far
                        surpass its former wealth, enterprise and elegance; and we hope that every
                        citizen will give his best efforts to push forward the work.</p>

                    Connellsville and Southern Pennsylvania Railroad company on October 14. The
                    Repository reminds its readers of the benefits a railroad would bring to
                    Chambersburg, including reduced prices on coal and lumber and a direct route
                    west.</summary>

                    <p>On Wednesday last the sullen thunders of artillery reverberated through the
                        shattered walls of Chambersburg, and simultaneously with the report of the
                        first gun, the two remaining bells in town--on the German Rreformed [sic]
                        and Lutheran Churches--rang out their merry peals over the triumphs of the
                        Union arms in Atlanta and Mobile. The Flag of the Free was run up on the
                        large Union pole, and was seen streaming from various other parts of the
                        town. Loyal hearts were gladdened where rebel vandalism had done its worst
                        to waste and desolate, and with one accord, they gave thanks to the brave
                        men who are winning the only enduring and honorable Peace that can be made
                        with traitors, by destroying the armies of crime. There were a few sad
                        hearts in our midst--some who thought of Chicago--of the "failure" of the
                        war--of "immediate cessation of hostilities," and of the judgment of a loyal
                        people to come; but they mourned in silence.</p>
