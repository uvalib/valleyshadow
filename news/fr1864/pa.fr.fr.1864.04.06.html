<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that Col. Quay, the Military Secretary for Governor Curtin, found a

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that an increase in taxes is unnecessary. Instead, the authors

                    system "perfectly farcical" in that the property that escapes taxation is least
                    deserving of exemption. The authors favor taxing the actual capital, dividends,
                    and surplus funds of corporations and valuing land at its actual cash value.<br>

<b>Our Judicial Districts</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the 1851 legislature for its failure to reduce the number of
                    judicial districts. The Repository recommends reducing the number of districts
                    by a quarter, thereby keeping the best judges and lowering court costs.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If Gen. Grant does not defeat Lee and drive the rebels out of Virginia in
                        three months, or if he does not win in every move and every battle, he will
                        not be hooted down and disgraced. We know now by sad experience what war is
                        and what are the obstacles to be overcome in Virginia. From a calm and
                        soldierly article on the Army of the Potomac, in the Army and Navy Journal, we take some instructive hints as to the
                        difficulties of a campaign in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>On the right of our army are chains of mountains which enable the rebels to
                        conceal any flanking movement they may undertake, while the valleys afford
                        to them the means for an easy and uninterrupted passage to the Potomac above
                        Washington, and one almost entirely secure from attacks in their rear. On our front is a succession of rivers, presenting
                        great natural obstacles to our advance, and at the same time easily
                        defensible; to make flanking movements by ascending them is to open our rear
                        to attacks from Fredericksburg, and to cross below the rebel army, leaves
                        the railroad a prey to guerrillas. The country is, moreover, marked in every
                        direction by dense forests, rendering anything like a surprise in force
                        impracticable. A few rebel scouts may at all times easily detect and thwart
                        such a movement. Such are the natural features of the country.</p>
                    <p>It is a well known rule of military operations that a "base" should neither
                        be too extended nor too limited, and that it should be accessible by several
                        routes. The base of the Army of the Potomac is just the width of a railroad
                        track, and that railroad furnishes really the only practicable route of
                        communication. For every mile of advance beyond Fairfax Court House, 500 men
                        are required to protect the rear. The leaders of the rebels of course
                        understand all these circumstances, and are always ready to take advantage
                        of them. They are fully aware that they can hold in check, with
                        three-fourths of its force, the Army of the Potomac. Meantime, they pursue
                        the Fabian policy--the policy of Washington on the mountains of the Hudson
                        river. They are not foolish enough to stake everything on the risk of a
                        battle, except where invulnerably fortified. They will not attack, nor will
                        they accept a battle in the field. Their own rear needs no protection; they
                        have two railroad routes besides all the ordinary roads. Thus they have all
                        the advantage of position on their side.</p>
                    <p>But are we in view of these difficulties to expect nothing from the Army of
                        the Potomac? No, it may overcome them in two or three ways. First, with a
                        sufficient force to cover the flanks, it may compel the enemy to retreat and
                        Richmond to be abandoned. Second, it may be able to bring on an engagement,
                        which will prove decisive. Third, by cutting it loose from Washington, and
                        making it a moveable column, it may go at any time to the rear of the rebel
                        army and open a new base for itself on the Pamunky or York rivers, or by the
                        railroad from Fredericksburg. We risk nothing in saying that the army can at
                        any time go to Richmond, if relieved from the necessity of protecting its
                        rear. This could have been done last fall, when General Meade crossed the
                        Rapidan and was stopped by the rebel works on Mine Run. The army can
                        transport fifteen days subsistence and forage, and with this it can be moved
                        to Hanover Court House, where it can operate on a new base; or, if
                        successful in forcing the rebel lines, can even enter Richmond at once.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The collection of the National Income Tax naturally enough embar[r]asses our
                        people, as they have the whole routine of the business yet to learn.
                        Complicated as it may seem at first sight. However, it is simply enough when
                        once understood.</p>
                    <p>By the law every man is required to make true return to the Assessor of his
                        income--Bear in mind that it is the duty of the people to call with the Assessor
                        (N. P. Pearse, Esq. Chambersburg) and make their return; and it must be done
                            on or before the 1st of May. Persons
                        neglecting to do so will be called upon by the Assessor, and fifty per cent
                        added to the tax. A penalty of $500 is imposed for a false or fraudulent
                        return.</p>
                    <p>By applying to Mr. Pearce, he will furnish persons with blank papers by which
                        any one can readily make out his return without difficulty.</p>
                    <p>The Income Tax does not apply to very many of our people. Not one-fourth of
                        the citizens of Franklin county have a nett [sic] income of over $800; and
                        the Income Tax applies only to such as have a nett revenue exceeding that
                        sum.</p>
                    <p>In ascertaining the Income, the gross receipts are taken, and the gross
                        expenditures. In the expenditures which are to be deducted are embraced the
                        entire cost in carrying on business, including rent, clerk hire, insurance,
                        freight, fuel &amp;c.; the rent of the property occupied as a residence;
                        and all other taxes assessed and paid for the year 1862; amount actually
                        paid for repairs; interest on bonds or stock on which three per cent has
                        already been deducted, &amp;c. Farmers will deduct their hired labor,
                        with the cost of subsisting the same; the necessary repairs on the farm, and
                        the insurance and the interest on incumbrances on the farm.</p>
                    <p>After deducting all these expenses from the gross revenues, a tax of three
                        per cent, is imposed upon the income of each man after it reaches $600.
                        Persons whose nett income does not exceed that sum pay no tax, unless they
                        have silver ware or carriages, upon which a specific tax is imposed.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that with all the declamation of political demagogues against
                        National Taxes, none but men of large incomes pay any part of it. The men of
                        straightened or moderate circumstances escape entirely. It is necessary to
                        the support of our imperiled government, and it should be promptly and
                        cheerfully paid.</p>
