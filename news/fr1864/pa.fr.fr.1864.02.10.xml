            could not hold him, when he was arrested by the Provost Marshal on the charge of "aiding
            and abetting the enemy" during the rebel occupation of this place. He was subsequently
            delivered into the custody of Mr. Gordon, the prosecutor in our courts, and by him
            delivered to the Sheriff of Franklin county for trial at the next court. He was
            afterwards released on giving security in the sum of $4,000 for his appearance at the
            next term.</p>

            tearing down the bills of recruiting officers posted about town. These persons should
