<b>Important Laws</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports the passage of a bill which sets the procedures to enact the
                    amendment allowing suffrage to Pennsylvania soldiers. Soldiers would vote in
                    polling places set up at the quarters of the commanding officers. Soldiers
                    prevented from attending the election at the company poll would vote at any poll
                    most convenient. Soldiers unable to vote with a company would vote by proxy by
                    sending their ballots to an elector at home.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The adoption of the amendment to the constitution conferring the right of
                        s[u]ffrage upon our soldiers in the field, necessitated the enactment of a
                        bill with proper provisions to carry out this important and just feature of
                        our organic law. The legislature has passed a voluminous act providing in
                        detail for taking the soldiers' vote. It provides that all soldiers, who are
                        legal votes at home, shall vote, whether in the State or in the field, and
                        the right of suffrage shall not be effected by the soldier having been
                        credited to any locality, other than his actual residence. The polls shall
                        be opened in the day of election in each company composed wholly, or partly
                        of Pennsylvania soldiers, at the quarters of the company officer, and all
                        members of the company who are within one mile of the officer's quarters,
                        and not prevented by orders or the proximity of the enemy from attending,
                        shall vote at such poll, and at no other place. Soldiers detached, in
                        hospitals or otherwise unavoidably prevented from attending the election at
                        the company poll, shall vote at any other poll most convenient; and where
                        ten or more soldiers are detached they may open a poll of their own at such
                        place as they may select, and certify their returns. The polls shall be
                        opened not earlier than 7 A.M., and remain open at least three hours, and
                        may be kept open until 7 P.M., if the judges find it necessary to poll the
                        full vote. Before opening the poll, the electors present at each place of
                        voting shall elect viva voce three persons
                        present at the time as judges, and the judges shall select two clerks, who
                        shall constitute the election board, and shall be duly sworn to a faithful
                        discharge of their duties. All elections shall be by ballot, and when doubt
                        exists as to the right of a soldier to vote, the officers shall examine the
                        applicants under oath and determine the right. Separate poll books shall be
                        kept and returned for each county, and they shall name the company regiment
                        and place at which the election is held. Provisions in detail are given for
                        counting and preserving the ballots for each county, so that access can be
                        had to them in case of alleged fraud. Tally-lists shall also be kept for
                        each county.</p>
                    <p>After the votes are counted and the returns made out in conformity with law,
                        a poll-list, tally list and return of each city or county together with the
                        tickets, shall be sealed up and transmitted through the nearest post office
                        or express as soon as possible, to the Prothonotary of the proper county;
                        and the other poll-book, tally-list, returns &amp;c., shall be delivered
                        to the State Commissioner, if he shall call for them within ten days--if
                        not, they shall also be mailed or expressed to the Secretary of the
                        Commonwealth. The return judges of the several counties are required to meet
                        on the second Tuesday of November, to add the vote of the soldiers to the
                        proper returns of the counties, and certify the result in the usual manner
                        as ascertained by the united home and army vote. The Secretary of
                        Commonwealth is required to have an abundant copies of the law, together
                        with necessary portions of the general election laws of the State and all
                        the needed forms to be supplied to the army and the others holding the
                        elections in the field. The Governor is authorized to appoint competent
                        Commissioners not exceeding one for each Pennsylvania regiment, who shall be
                        sworn to discharge their duties faithfully and whose duty shall be to
                        deliver the necessary laws and blanks, and to receive the proper returns.
                        Such Commissioners shall be deemed in the military service, and may vote at
                        any one of the polls they attend. No election of soldiers shall be
                        invalidated by the failure of commissioners or other officers to supply the
                        forms or discharge their duties. When any number of soldiers less than ten
                        shall be members of companies of other States, or for any other legal cause
                        shall be separated from their commands and unable to attend the election at
                        the proper quarters, they may before the day of election deposit their
                        ballots in sealed envelopes, together with a statement of the name and
                        residence of the voter and send it to a qualified elector at home, who shall
                        cast such sealed ballot at home for the soldier, and it shall be opened by
                        the election officers when the returns are counted. The statement of the
                        soldier voting thus by proxy shall be certified to by his commanding
                        officer, some commissioned officer, or by some other creditable witness if
                        an officer is not accessible; and there shall also accompany such ballots an
                        affidavit of the voter stating that he is a qualified voter in the election
                        district in which he proposes to vote; that he has not sent a ballot to any
                        other person; that he will not attempt to vote at any other poll; that he is
                        not a deserter; has not been dismissed [from] the service, and stating also
                        where he is stationed. Officers of election refusing to receive such
                        ballots, when presented in proper form, shall be deemed guilty of
                        misdemeanor and punished by fine and imprisonment. The assessors are
                        required to assess a county tax of ten cents on each non commissioned
                        officer and private in the service, and such soldiers shall be exempt from
                        all other personal taxes while in service. The payment of such tax shall
                        entitle all soldiers, otherwise qualified to the right to vote.</p>
                    <p>The law is quite voluminous but in the main fair in its provisions, and leans
                        as strongly as possible in favor of the soldiers, so as to prevent him from
                        being defrauded out of his vote by legal quibbles. It was passed by the
                        Union men of the legislature--having been opposed by the Democratic
                        legislators because of its ample provisions for giving the right of voting
                        to our gallant soldiers in the field.</p>
                    <p>A supplemental bounty bill was passed at the extra session of the
                        legislature, which gives boroughs, wards and townships full authority to
                        levy bounty tax and collect the same when the county commissioners neglect
                        or refuse to do so. The districts may levy and collect the tax by their
                        authorities or board of election officers; but the bounty so collected shall
                        not exceed $300 for each recruit. The bill is also curative in its
                        provisions, and ratifies all loans created or taxes levied by the action of
                        the people of districts in any way that met the sanction of a majority of
                        the citizens. In such case the constituted authorities or board of election
                        officers are required to carry out in good faith the collection of such
                        taxes. It provides also that persons who have furnished substitutes credited
                        to the proper townships, the principals shall receive the bounty toward the
                        payment of his substitute. No tax exceeding two per cent of the last
                        adjusted valuation of property for county or State putposes [sic] shall be
                        levied in one year. A per capita or poll tax may
                        be levied by the commissioners, school directors, supervisors or road
                        commissioners, or the proper authorities, not exceeding $5 per head to be
                        applied to bounty purposes; but persons in service, or disabled in service
                        shall be exempt; and the property of widows and minor children, and widowed
                        mothers of soldiers who died in service, is exempt from all taxation under
                        this bill. The act was approved on the 25th of August, 1864.</p>

<b>Fill Up Our Brave Armies</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Loyal men! Atlanta, the last inland stronghold of Treason
                            in the Cotton States, has fallen! The victorious legions of the
                        heroic Sherman now rest in that stubbornly defended citadel of crime, after
                        a march and series of battles unexampled in the history of modern warfare.
                        Their noble sacrifices and brilliant achievements hurl back in confusion and
                        shame the driveling cowards who proclaim the war a "failure," and give
                        earnest promise of a speedy, honorable and enduring Peace.</p>
                    <p>But one vital point of Treason remains, and that
                        is wasting in strength under the tireless energy and unfaltering courage of
                        the great leader and soldier of the Army of the Potomac. They ask for one
                        hundred thousand men promptly to enable them to consummate their great work
                        and preserve to us and to posterity the blessings of Free Government.</p>
                    <p>Let their shattered ranks be filled, and filled at once. Let every district
                        waste not one day, nor one hour, until its quota is filled. Brave men are
                        not wanting to respond to the call if citizens but do their duty generously
                        in providing for the wants of themselves and their household gods. This is
                        the work of every patriot, of every christian, of every friend of humanity,
                        of order and of government: and let it be done with hearty, ceaseless energy
                        until it is completed; and our gallant armies, whose heroism and victories
                        stand unparalleled in history, will soon return to us honored, and honoring
                        a Nationality that has swept treason to perpetual infamy, and given to the
                        world a beneficent government, an enduring monument of Civil and Religious
                        Liberty!</p>
