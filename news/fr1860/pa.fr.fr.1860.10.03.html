<b>Gen. Foster On The Tariff</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gen. Foster responds to McClure's accusations of being a Free Trader, by
                    noting his support of protective policies in Congress, and noting that McClure
                    and other Republican candidates have, in the past, either voted or supported
                    candidates against a protective tariff.<br>

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>Col. McClure at a late meeting in Philadelphia, charged Gen. Foster, the
                    Democratic candidate for Governor, with being an out and out Free Trader,
                    unfriendly to the Tariff interests of this State. At a monster mass meeting held
                    in Philadelphia on Monday the 17th Gen. Foster made a great speech in which he
                    paid his respects to the Colonel, as follows:<br>

<b>Reply of Hon. A. K. McClure To Gen. Henry D. Foster</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>McClure reminds his audience that several of the Republican candidates
                    whose voting records Foster attacked, were Democrats at the time of those votes.
                    He also notes Foster's abandonment of the protective tariff, and Foster's long
                    time support of the Democratic party whose main plank is Free Trade, and thereby
                    McClure raises the question of whether Foster is to be trusted.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The leaders and press of the Locofoco party exhausted the vocabulary of the
                        epithets in their denunciations of the Representatives and Senators of the
                        Pennsylvania Legislature who had voted for the Sale of the Public Works.
                        Among others who came in for their full share of this slander and abuse was
                        our Representative, Col. A. K. McClure, and our then State Senator, Hon. G.
                        W. Brewer. The Democratic party is in a position now to do justice to these
                        much abused men--to retract what they have said in condemnation of their
                        vote for the sale of the Public Works--by voting on next Tuesday for Henry
                        D. Foster for Governor, who acted in concert with McClure and Brewer in
                        supporting the Bill authorizing their sale.</p>
                    <p>Will Judge Nill, Judge Kennedy, the Messrs. Orr, the Gilmores, the Sniders,
                        the Murpheys, the Johnstons, and the Besores, as well as others, now so
                        stultify themselves as to endorse the Sale of the Public Works by voting for
                        Foster? We will see. If they do, they were either very insincere and
                        dishonest in their opposition to the sale, or they are the most
                        inconsistant, [sic] unstable, unprincipled, dissembling set of demagogues
                        that are to be found. Now, gentlemen, take either horn of the dilema [sic]
                        you please.</p>
                    <p>If the sale of the Public Works was as injurious to the interests of
                        Pennsylvania as these gentlemen tried to make the people believe, how can
                        they now, consistently, vote for Foster, for
                        Governor, who was a leading spirit in every movement that looked to, and who
                        supported and VOTED FOR, their sale? Let the Democratic party and its
                        leaders be held to their true position--on this as well as every other
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The sale of these works was either right or it was
                            wrong. The Democratic leaders and party took
                        the latter position, and characterized the transaction as most flagitious--
                        as a direct robbery of the State--and the Senators and Representatives who
                        voted for it (among whom was Henry D. Foster,) as corrupt and faithless
                        public servants. Come, gentlemen Locofocos, if you wish to preserve the
                        consistency of your political record, and maintain a character among your
                        neighbors for honesty of purpose, truthfulness of statement and as sincere
                        well-wishers and promoters of the interests of the State, you must vote and
                        use your influence, on Tuesday next, against
                        Henry D. Foster, for Governor, or, by supporting him, give the LIE to all
                        your former statements relative to the sale of the Public Works. What do you
                        intend to do? You being honorable men, of course
                        you will vote against Foster; but if you will support him in the teeth of
                        all your former teachings and professions upon this subject, you will, of
                        course, as you are honorable men, make a clean
                        breast of it and take back the vile aspersions which you heaped upon the
                        name of Col. McClure and the Republican party for having disposed of what we
                        had conceived to be, the greatest curse with which the Tax-payers of
                        Pennsylvania were ever saddled.</p>

                    was accosted by a Democrat on the issue of his political fickleness. He
                    responded that if the Valley Spirit could change its opinions several times per

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A comparison of two speeches by Foster show that he claims two conflicting
                    stances as regarding the territories' right to decide the slavery issue. In

                    right to decide; in Philadelphia he stated that it was the Court's right to
                    decide--as was done in the Dred Scott decision.<br>
