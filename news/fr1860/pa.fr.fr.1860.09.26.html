<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We intimated in our last issue, that the Valley
                        Spirit and the "town clique," with which it co-operates, had treated
                        a gentleman of Fayetteville, who desired to be a candidate before the late
                        Democratic Nominating County Convention, in a very contemptuous and
                        overbearing manner. We could not refrain from noticing the fact, for the
                        reason that the gentleman who had been thus summarily choked off, had been a life-long member of the Democratic party.
                        Our remarks, it appears, fell under the eye of the gentleman to whom we
                        particularly alluded, and he has sent us the following communication:</p>
                    <p>Fayetteville, Sept. 21, 1860.</p>
                    <p>MESSRS EDITORS:--I observed in the Repository and
                            Transcript of the 19th inst., a notice of the hostility of the
                        Editors of the Valley Spirit towards "an humble
                        member of the Democratic party of Fayetteville, who aspired to fill one of
                        the Court House offices." I presume I am the individual alluded to, and in
                        order that you and the public may be made better acquainted with the facts,
                        and of the manner in which I was ruled out, permit me to make the following
                        statement:</p>
                    <p>Sometime about the 1st of May last, I gave a short advertisement to Mr. F.--
                        S-----, of your place, requesting him to hand it to the Editors of the Valley Spirit. The substance of that advertisement
                        was, that I was a candidate for the office of Register
                            and Recorder, subject to the decision of the Democratic
                        Convention. I looked for it carefully in the next issue of the paper, but
                        found it not. I wrote another of the same, about two weeks after, and gave
                        it to Mr. J.--- M----- to hand over to the Editors of the Spirit. He told me since that he positively gave it
                        to them. I then confidently expected to see my Card in that week's paper,
                        but found none. I then sent another through the Post office, and it was
                        treated as the others were. I then thought I would try them with a little
                        money, and sent them a silver dollar with Mr. J.--- B-----, of our village,
                        who was about visiting Chambersburg, begging them to insert my Card in their
                        paper as many times as a dollar would pay for. They took the money, and
                        after consulting awhile among themselves, returned it to Mr. B----, with the
                        remarks, that I should come in myself. I went to Chambersburg, but in reply
                        to my request that they should insert my advertisement, announcing myself as
                        a candidate, they told me that none of the County Candidates intended to
                        publish their intentions--all was to be left to the Delegates in Convention.
                        I then saw how the pot was boiling. On the day of the Convention I spoke to
                        several of the Delegates, but they appeared all to be committed, and there
                        was no chance for me. They said they had understood that the three
                        respectable gentlemen who now fill the Court House offices were to be
                        re-nominated for their present positions.</p>
                    <p>This is the manner in which equal rights are
                        extended to all by the worthy editors of the Valley
                            Spirit.</p>
                    <p>On the Sunday before the Delegates met in Convention, I was accosted in the
                        town of Fayetteville by two very respectable gentlemen from Chambersburg,
                        who wished to learn who the delegates from our place were. I informed the
                        inquirer. I also told him that I was a Candidate for Register and Recorder,
                        when he replied, "You are too late, the whole thing is
                            fixed--we intend to keep the same Officers in the Court House that are
                            in now." I replied by saying: "Then there is no use in holding a
                        Convention."</p>
                    <p>Such has been the wire-working of the "town clique." I have been as firm a
                        Democrat as any of the combined conspirators, and have done more labor and
                        spent more of my own money in behalf of the cause than any man in the
                        "clique," and had a right to expect better treatment of men professing to be
                        Democrats than that which I have received. All I asked was a fair hearing,
                        and, if I failed to obtain the nomination, well and good; but to be choked
                        off and trodden down in the manner I was, by the paper professing to be the
                        mouth-piece of the party, and by a few individuals who have set themselves
                        up as leaders, is a little more than my spirit can bear or than my
                        democratic teachings would warrant me to expect. But enough. I expect them
                        to be defeated, with all their intrigue.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c., <br>WILLIAM PIPER.</p>
                    <p>So much for the manner in which Mr. PIPER was treated by the Valley Spirit and the Democratic leaders of
                        Chambersburg. There is no denying the facts--there is the evidence from his
                        own pen; and if any one will undertake to say, that it is anything less than
                        mean and shabby treatment, such an one [sic], like the whipped cur, could
                        "lick the hand that scourged him." After this we trust the Spirit will cease its clamor about the Republican
                        Party of Franklin county being controlled by a "clique." The public will
                        hereafter know, that when it sets up such a howl, it is only done to screen
                        its own guilt--to cover the political trickery of its own "town clique"--and
                        to mislead the public mind from a scrutiny of its own debauchery.</p>
                    <p>But more: Mr. PIPER is not the only man who came under the political ban of
                        these Chambersburg Democratic leaders, who have constituted themselves the
                        managers, rulers, and dictators of the party throughout the county. A very
                        worthy and intelligent gentleman of Greencastle, of unimpeachable private
                        character and of undoubted Democratic antecedents, who, in 1857, was a
                        formidable candidate for the nomination of Prothonotary, and was beaten only
                        3 or 4 votes by his opponent, (Mr. Keyser, the present incumbent,) was most
                        grossly, cruelly bamboozeled [sic] also by this Democratic "town clique."</p>
                    <p>The gentleman to whom we refer, came to Chambersburg for the purpose of again
                        announcing himself as a candidate for the office of Prothonotary; but it
                        appears he came upon "a fool's errand," for he had not consulted the
                        "clique," which was a great breach of their assumed prerogative,--When his
                        intentions became known, he was immediately taken in charge by the gentleman
                        in authority, who at once put their wits to work to circumvent him, and get
                        him out of their way, so that he should not come in contact with their
                        already nominated County Ticket.</p>
                    <p>Every imaginable argument and inducement was held out to dissuade him from
                        his purpose, and he succumbed to their desceptive [sic] words--promises made
                        only to be broken, which he has since learned.--He was told that if he would
                        withhold his announcement for the office for which he desired a nomination,
                        they would place him in nomination for the Legislature.--The day for the
                        assembling of the Convention came, and with it this gentleman from
                        Greencastle, full of hope, confidently expecting to wear proudly the honors
                        to be conferred by his party. Well, he was placed in nomination, the
                        balloting commenced, and the anxious expectant awaited, not doubting that
                        the announcement would be, that Mr. FRANCIS NORTHCRAFT was the unanimous
                        nominee for the Democracy of Franklin county for the Legislature. But what
                        was the result? Why he failed to receive one single,
                            solitary, beggarly vote--the Delegate who nominated him did not
                        vote for him! Who, but the Democratic leaders of Chambersburg could treat
                        any member of its party in such a cruel, heartless manner! Things thus
                        assumed an uglier shape than the leaders had intended, and on second ballot
                        they allowed three Delegates to vote for Mr. N.,
                        and then he had his name withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>We submit to the candid reader, whether in view of the foregoing indisputable
                        facts, the masses of the Democratic party of Franklin are not led as sheep
                        to the shambles, by a few intriguing, selfish men of Chambersburg. The
                        County Ticket was matured by them before the Convention assembled, all it
                        had to do was to ratify the nominations already cut and dry. Is this not
                        so?--and has the same thing not been done by these same leaders of the
                        Democracy for the last ten years or more? The truth of the matter is simply
                        this--the bone and sinew of the Democratic party are used by their leaders
                        to vote but not think
                        and act for themselves; they use them as the
                        nigger-drivers of the South use their Slaves-- they must come when they are
                        called and go when they are bidden. It is to this deep depth of degredation
                        [sic] and humiliation that the great Democratic Party has at last fallen;
                        and strange to say, many otherwise high-spirited men--men of intelligence
                        and observation, still maintain their connection with it.</p>
