<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are glad to perceive that many of the newspapers along the great Central
                        Line of road from New York to the West, through the Central Jersey, Lehigh
                        Valley, East Pennsylvania, Lebanon Valley and Cumberland Valley roads, to
                        the Connellsville road and westward, are adopting measures to arouse the
                        feelings of the people upon this subject, and finally to reach the
                        capitalists of the great metropolis, to whom we must naturally look for the
                        material aid for the accomplishment of the work. We only wonder that the
                        judgment of the people of the great city has not before directed their
                        attention to this, as their true route to the Western trade, which she of
                        course desires. This route has the following characteristics, which mark it
                        as the best route for New York, viz:</p>
                    <p>it is 150 miles shorter than the routes through the State of New York.</p>
                    <p>It is 20 miles shorter than the present route from New York, through
                        Pittsburg.</p>
                    <p>It will involve the completion of the Pittsburg and Steubenville road, and
                        the Hempfield road to Wheeling, which will shorten the distance to St. Louis
                        some forty miles more.</p>
                    <p>It will furnish a road with half the grade of the Central Pennsylvania,
                        requiring no additional power to cross the Allegheny mountains.</p>
                    <p>It is through a country that will be far less obstructed by snow than the
                        roads through New York.</p>
                    <p>It will be through one of the finest agricultural districts that the sun
                        shines on, and will open some of the richest coal and iron regions in the
                        country, securing for the road a business equal to any, and to New York a
                        vast accession of trade.</p>
                    <p>It will give New York a road of her own through Pennsylvania, on which there
                        can be no discrimination in favor of any other city against New York, as is
                        now done on the Pennsylvania Central.</p>
                    <p>It will open a route to St. Louis so much shorter and better than any other,
                        that it will become the main stem of the Pacific railroad, when that road
                        shall be constructed, as it must be.</p>
                    <p>With this road constructed, New York can defy the power of the Grand Trunk
                        railroad through Canada, as it cannot divert her trade, although backed by
                        all the capital of England; but without it, her advantages are but slight.
                        We learn that there is a manifestation of interest in some quarters in New
                        York, but it requires concentration and vigorous action. Words will not do
                        much, though this road will require but little money to build and stock
                        it--not one- twentieth part as much as New York has spent upon her
                        circuitous lines.</p>
                    <p>Enterprise.</p>

                        German at the Chicago Convention:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hassaureck, of Ohio, said--Gentlemen of the Convention, I am not going to
                        detain you for any length in support of the motion now before the
                        Convention, but I am in favor, gentlemen, of the adoption of this
                        resolution, not because I am an adopted citizen but because I claim to be a
                        true American. [Cheers.] Gentlemen, I claim to be an American, although I
                        happened to be born on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. [Renewed
                        applause.] I hailed true Americanism before my foot ever stepped on American
                        Soil. [Applause.] I loved this country before my eyes had ever beheld its
                        hospitable soil. I had sworn allegiance to the spirit of its free
                        institutions years before I made the formal declaration of loyalty.
                        [Enthusiastic cheers.] Gentlemen I felt the spirit of true Americanism
                        thrill my heart when, as a boy in school, I first read of the heroic deeds
                        of the immortal. Washington. [Great and prolonged applause.] I heard true
                        Americanism when I first heard of the great Thomas Jefferson, who, upon the
                        altar of God, had sworn eternal hostility to tyranny in every form. [Renewed
                        applause.] Gentlemen, as one who has suffered the stings and oppressions of
                        despotism, I claim to be doubly capable of appreciating the blessings of
                        liberty. [Loud cheers.] Gentlemen, I have seen the nations of Europe
                        smarting under the arbitraty [sic] rule of despots, and I know what an
                        inestimable treasure, what an incalculable boon freedom is to man. It is,
                        therefore, one of the proudest moments of my life to avail myself of this
                        opportunity as one of the liberty-loving Germans of the free West, before
                        this vast assembly of so many of the best and true men of the nation, loudly
                        to proclaim my undying and unfaltering love and adherence to the principles
                        of true Americanism. [Great applause.] Gentlemen, if it is Americanism to
                        believe religiously to believe in those eternal truths announced in the
                        Declaration of Independence, that all men are born equal and, free, and
                        endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are
                        life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, I am proud to be an American.
                        [Applause.] If it is Americanism firmly to believe and warmly to cherish the
                        memory of the fathers of the Republic, to maintain the faith and perpetuate
                        the glorious inheritance which they have left to an admiring posterity, I
                        shall ever be an American [Loud cheers.] If it is Americanism, gentlemen, to
                        believe that Governments are instituted for the benefit of the governed, and
                        not for the benefit of the privileged few--if it is Americanism to believe
                        that this glorious federation of sovereign States has a higher object and a
                        nobler purpose than to be the mere means of fortifying, protecting and
                        propagating the institution of human servitude--if it is Americanism to
                        believe that these vast fertile Territories of the West are forever to
                        remain sacred, to remain as free homes for free labor and free men, I shall
                        live and die an American. [Tumultuous cheering.] Gentlemen, if it is
                        Americanism to believe that the American Constitution, as framed by the
                        Fathers, was designed as a bulwark of freedom, and intended to secure the
                        blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity, and that it does
                        not of its own force carry slavery into the Territories of the United States
                        but, on the contrary, means freedom and justice wherever it goes, I shall
                        ever claim to be an American. [Great applause.]</p>
                    <p>And, Mr. President, for this reason I am in favor of the adoption of the
                        resolution--not because I claim to be an adopted citizen; but because I
                        claim, and shall claim to the end, that I am an American--an American by
                        choice; not an American by birth, it is true, but an American from sentiment
                        and from principle. Gentlemen, I hope this resolution will pass without
                        objection from any side. There are more than 20,000 Republican German voters
                        in the State of Ohio alone; and they shall ever be cast in a solid phalanx
                        for the candidate who is to be nominated by this Convention. [Renewed
                        applause.]</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To the People of Pennsylvania:--We are about to
                        enter another great national struggle, the issue of which must tell
                        decisively for the weal or woe of our common country.</p>
                    <p>The so called democratic party has been in power for nearly eight years, and
                        the fruits of its policy are now felt in a prostrate industry, a paralyzed
                        commerce, a bankrupt treasury, and a large and steadily increasing national
                        debt.</p>
                    <p>The domestic peace and harmony that witnessed the restoration of the party
                        now in power, again in power, have been wantonly exchanged for sectional
                        discord and fraternal strife; and even the sacred landmarks of the
                        Constitution have been blotted out, in the systematic effort of the
                        government to spread the blight of slavery over free territory, in defiance
                        of the popular will.</p>
                    <p>Corruption has gained undisputed mastery in almost every department of power,
                        and stamped its fearful stain indellibly [sic] upon the government; and
                        shameless profligacy has given us national bankruptcy at home and national
                        dishonor abroad.</p>
                    <p>The time has come when a thorough reform is unmistakably demanded by the
                        people. In this great work, Pennsylvania must, as ever, be potential. Always
                        loyal in the last degree, to the maintenance of the national Union, and to
                        the compromises of the Constitution, and faithful to the supremacy of the
                        laws, her people have no warfare to wage upon the rights of sister States.
                        They will maintain these rights inviolate with the same fidelity that they
                        defend their own.</p>
                    <p>Our free labor is the basis of all our wealth our prosperity, our greatness.
                        It has trusted and appealed in vain to the party in power to protect it. Its
                        confidence has been ever betrayed, its interests ever sacrificed. Our untold
                        millions of slumbering wealth, and our unemployed and unrequited labor, and
                        swift witnesses to the suicidal policy that has impoverished us.</p>
                    <p>The studied purpose of the national administration has been to sectionalize
                        the government, and give boundless dominion to a system that has dishonored
                        and beggared free industry wherever its desolating step have gone.</p>
                    <p>Against this fatal sectionalism the friends of a diversified and prosperous
                        industry have protested without avail. Nothing but a radical change of
                        administration can give reasonable promises of respect for the great
                        industrial interests of our State, and redress from the endless train of
                        evils flowing from the faithlessness of the government.</p>
                    <p>The territories of the great west term with beauty and richness. There, with
                        free homes, our sturdy sons would rear new empires to pour forth their
                        boundless wealth, and add to the prosperity and true greatness of our
                        boasted Republic. They have escaped the withering blight of servile labor
                        thus far, only by defying the whole power of two democratic Administration,
                        and leaving a history crimsoned with the blood of our brethren.</p>
                    <p>Failing to subdue, even by force, the strong arms that are there scattering
                        the rich fruits of peaceful and enlightened industry, the Constitution
                        itself has been assailed, and its sacred aims preverted [sic], to
                        sectionalize the nation. The startling declaration is now made by the party
                        in power, through its official exponents, that the Constitution must defeat
                        the wise and beneficent purposes of its authors, and carry servile labor,
                        under its own broad shield, into every territory of the Union.</p>
                    <p>To restore the government to its original purity; to redeem it from its fatal
                        hostility to the interests of free labor; from the corruption, the
                        profligacy, and the sectionalism which have marked the party in power, are
                        the great purposes of the Peoples' organization in Pennsylvania. To this
                        patriotic end, we invoke the aid and co-operation of all who desire to join
                        in a common cause, to inaugurate a liberal, just, and faithful government.</p>
                    <p>Our standard-bearers fitly represent the vital issues involved in the
                        struggle. They command the unbounded confidence of friends and the respect
                        of foes. Even partisan malice is impotant [sic] to assail them. That Abraham
                        Lincoln, the nominee for President, is spotless in both public and private
                        life, and that he is "honest and capable" is confessed as with one voice, by
                        his countrymen. His well-earned national fame, the offspring of no
                        fortuitous circumstances, points to him as the "coming man" will administer
                        the government honestly, frugally and faithfully, and restore the Republic
                        to domestic tranquility, to prosperity and to honor. True to these great
                        measures of reform is Hannibal Hamlin, our candidate for Vice President, as
                        is shown by his long and consistent public career in the councils of the
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>Andrew G. Curtin, our nominee for Governor, has given a life-time of earnest,
                        untiring effort to the interests of free labor. He has advocated, in every
                        contest, with all his matchless power, the true principles of government, as
                        declared by the convention that has placed him before the people. Measured
                        by the highest standard, he is faithful and qualified. He will be in the
                        front of the battle, bearing our standard aloft, and defending our cause. We
                        have but to join him in his efforts with a zeal worthy of our principles,
                        and he will lead us to a decisive victory in October.</p>
                    <p>Whether our opponents will enter the contest united or divided, our duties
                        and dangers will be the same. In any event, the triumph of the Right will be
                        resisted with the spirit of desperation: Armed with all the power and
                        corrupt appliances of the government, they will leave no means untried, no
                        effort unemployed, to perpetuate their ascendancy. Although rent asunder
                        with intestine feuds, antagonized North and South by irreconcilable
                        differences of principle, and bleeding from wounds within their own
                        household--yet, there is one common bond of union when all else fails--that
                        is the cohesive power of public plunder."</p>
                    <p>Our cause is worthy of an earnest, united effort. Our languishing industry,
                        our homeless laborers, our bankrupt treasury, our national tranquility and
                        national honor demand it. With early, systematic and thorough organization,
                        by which the truth can be disseminated in every section of the State, we
                        cannot fail to triumph. Let the efforts of our friends be thus directed
                        without delay, and in whatever shape, and under whatever flag, our opponents
                        may determine to meet us, the voice of the Keystone State will give a
                        decisive victory to our case, alike in State and national struggles. A. K.

                    <p>We are pleased to learn that this old and deservedly popular Company, have
                        again gone into service. Owing to the inafficeincy [sic] of a part of their
                        apparatus, (and which has not yet been properly remedied,) the Company
                        labored under some disadvantage; and deeming it useless to spend herculean
                        efforts without witnessing corresponding results, the spirited young men
                        composing the Company became somewhat discouraged and disheartened, and, by
                        common consent, left the organization go, apparently, by the board. They
                        have now, however, gone into full operation again, and they are determined
                        to make the best use they can of the apparatus, and if they are prevented
                        from rendering such service as it would be their pride and pleasure to do,
                        they will operate the apparatus as to its utmost capacity and there rest
