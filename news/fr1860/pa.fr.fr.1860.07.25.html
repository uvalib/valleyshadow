                    Lincoln and Douglas--the Republicans make clear and emphasize the differences in
                    the platforms of the two parties. It is suggested that the Democrats are afraid
                    to do the same, because publishing the truth would make them look bad.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are many men in the United States, who, since the disbanding of the old
                        Whig party, do not claim to belong to any of the political organizations of
                        the day. Many of these, in 1856, were of the opinion that the Republican
                        party was sectional in its character, and, fearing the consequences of
                        arousing violent sectional feeling in the land--which they dreaded as the
                        result of the election of the gallant Col. Fremont--they believed their true
                        policy was to cast their votes for Millard Filmore, the American candidate
                        for the Presidency. Others, feeling that age and experience had done great
                        things for themselves, naturally supposed that the election of James
                        Buchanan, a man bordering upon three score years and ten, would be the best
                        possible way of allying public excitement, voted for and helped to elect the
                        present incumbent. They find, too late, that they have been deceived in this
                        expectation; that the man who could basely defame Henry Clay was not the man
                        in whom they should have placed any confidence; that he who could permit a
                        patriot, such as the sage of Ashland, to go down to the tomb with a calumny
                        of his own making upon an otherwise untarnished
                        reputation, should never have received their votes. They see this error, and
                        not being able to correct it do not desire to commit another blunder like
                        it. They are, therefore, seriously pondering over their proper course in
                        this campaign. The result is easily predicted, a second Henry Clay; another
                        old Whig is in the field. They see in honest ABRAHAM LINCOLN the embodiment
                        of all their old political principles, and they will rally as one man to his
                        support.</p>
                    <p>The meeting at Union Square, in the city of New York, a few evenings since,
                        which was addressed by the old Whig leader HORACE GREELEY, and by DANIEL
                        ULLMAN, ESQ., (one of the number who, like many others), supported Mr.
                        Fillmore, four years since,) was an assemblage of earnest-thinking men of
                        the old Whig like themselves, all their hearts can desire in a President,
                        and they are determined to vote for him.</p>
                    <p>The opinion of Senator Benjamin, that LINCOLN is infinitely more conservative
                        than DOUGLAS, and is greatly to be preferred by the thinking portion of
                        society, is fully concurred in by the old Whigs, and their power will be
                        felt on the right side during this very important campaign.</p>

<b>The Legislature</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A request that people continue the local tradition of sending capable and
                    successful representatives from this district to the State Legislature; James R.
                    Brewster and James C. Austin have done well, and it is wise to return such
                    experienced men rather than risk choosing green representatives.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. James R. Brewster, Mr. James C. Austin)</blockquote>
<b>He Is Welcome</b><br> (Column a)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An expression of delight as Hon. John Hickman offers to canvass for Lincoln
                    in the western states, and a call for others to do the same and make their mark
                    in aiding in this historically significant election.<br>

<b>A Dwarfed Giant</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Observation and excerpt of a Southern Democrat's comment on the general
                    opinion of Douglas by Southern Democrats---that he is currupt, even though he
                    helped them by repealing the Missouri compromise. If this is the case, that the
                    Southerners won't support him, and the Northern Democrats see him as a traitor
                    to Free Labor, then who will support him?<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Despotism</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Note of a Missouri newspaper was mobbed and the Editor, S. Harbaugh, forced
                    to leave the offices because he promoted Lincoln and Hamlin. Harbaugh is a
                    native of Waynesboro, Franklin county, and worked under Joseph Pritts for the
                    Franklin Repository and Transcript. Comment that this is how the Democrats in
                    the South operate--by mobbing anyone who dares support a Republican, and yet the
                    Democrats accuse the Republicans of sectionalism.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. S. Harbaugh, Mr. Joseph Pritts)</blockquote>
<b>Rather Sensible</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A complaint the Democrats are unwilling to stand up for the candidate Bell
                    during the popular election, although if the vote goes to the House, they would
                    urge his election there. And so the newspaper would rather vote for Lincoln,
                    rather than settle for one of the Democrat candidates over Bell.<br>

<b>Monsieur Tonson Come Again</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Atlanta Southern Confederacy, a paper supporting Douglas, urges that if
                    Lincoln wins, then the South should secede. Clearly Douglas has not been able to
                    quiet these suggestions among his own supporters. Also a mention that should the
                    South secede the Government will respond with hangings.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The evidence of a determination on the part of the Douglas men to vote for
                        Lincoln, says the Harrisburg Telegraph, and thus
                        kill two birds with one stone, are multiplying on every hand. This is the
                        case here and all over the country. Scores of men who have for years cited
                        with the Democratic party are daily ranging themselves under the banner of
                        Lincoln and Hamlin, determined to crush out the southern disunionists and
                        the northern traitors who fraternize with them. It is conceded, and justly
                        too, that every vote cast for Douglas in the Free States is a vote for
                        Breckenridge or old Joe Lane, just in the proportion that it is effective in
                        carrying the election into Congress. The honest supporters of Mr. Douglas
                        would a hundred times prefer the election of Lincoln to that of either
                        Breckinridge or old Joe Lane. This is the first bird to be killed, by all
                        manner of means. On the other hand, a large number of them are burning with
                        the desire to give a blow to the South in return for the dastardly treatment
                        they have received during the past three years, and particularly at the
                        Charleston and Baltimore Conventions. They see no other way half so
                        effectual in accomplishing their revenge, as voting Lincoln into the White
                        House. The country is swarming with this class of Douglas men, and among
                        them may be counted some of the most efficient politicians of that
                        persuasion.</p>
                    <p>The Douglas organs are laboring desperately to hold them back--for the
                        purpose, we suppose, of carrying the election into the House and insuring
                        the success of the "disunionists." as the term the supporters of
                        Breckinridge. But the stampede has commenced, and it cannot be stopped. We
                        have no doubt a large majority of Democratic politicians in the North are anxious for some kind of a compromise
                        which may possibly save the offices to themselves--but the people who want no offices, are in for the fight on
                        principle. The party has arrived at that perplexing fork in the road
                        described by the colored preacher, where "one leads to hell, and the other
                        to d--nation." If Douglas and Breckinridge are both withdrawn, Lincoln will
                        be elected. If both remain in the field he will be elected. If either of
                        them remain in the field Lincoln will be elected. But neither of them will
                        withdraw unless the other does, and Lincoln will be elected anyhow. That is
                        the whole mathematics of the campaign. Joint electoral tickets will not
                        avail the warring factions, because that sort of thing implies that one or
                        the other is to be cheated, and the people are bound not
                            to be cheated.</p>
                    <p>Turn it which way you will, Lincoln comes uppermost every time. If anybody
                        doubts it let him just hold his breath till the 6th day of November!</p>

                    <p>The Baltimore Patriot says: At the north the
                        watering places are rapidly filling up, and especially with southern
                        visitors. The twaddle, so much in vogue a few years ago, of southerners
                        shunning the northern States, and seeking only the rendezvous within their
                        own borders, has died out, notwithstanding the present "impending crisis" of
                        Messrs. Yancey &amp; Co. People of sense, both north and south, go just
                        exactly where their interest and inclination leads them. And in this they
                        follow that universal law and custom which binds everywhere alike. When
                        southern merchants want northern manufacturers, or southern planters seek
                        change and a colder climate, they will go north to find them, just as they
                        of the north seek health, or cotton or rice, or sugar in the southern
                        states.</p>
