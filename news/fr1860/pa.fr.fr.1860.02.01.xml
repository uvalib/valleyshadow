                    <p>It turns out in regard to Slavery in Nebraska, says the New York <emph
                            rend="italic">Tribune</emph>, as we had supposed. Governor Black, Mr.
                        Buchanan's appointee in that Territory, has coolly vetoed the bill passed by
                        the Legislature to abolish Slavery. In this veto we have fresh proof of all
                        the Republicans have alleged in regard to the determination of the
                        Democratic party not to allow the formation of Free States where they can
                        possibly prevent it, even though the settlers may ever so strongly desire to
                        prohibit Slavery. It was said by the Republicans repeatedly, in the last
                        Presidential campaign, that if Mr. Buchanan was elected, Kansas would be
                        made a Slave State if the Administration could make it so. The assertion was
                        always repelled as a slander on the fairness and impartiality of Mr.
                        Buchanan, who, it was declared, could never be guilty of such an outrage. We
                        all know how completely the Republican prediction was verified. Mr. Buchanan
                        and the Administration sought by the most outrages measures, to establish
                        Slavery in Kansas in the face of a popular majority of 10,000 against it. He
                        stood by the Lecompton Constitution to the last, and stands by it now.
                        Meantime Slavery exists in Kansas, and is only kept in order there by the
                        determined hostility of the Free-State men, and their unyielding purpose to
                        grind its head wherever it can be reached. In Nebraska, though so far North
                        as to make Slavery utterly unprofitable, and thence to render the effort to
                        exclude it comparatively easy, the same determined purpose is manifested by
                        the Administration and its friends. It even seems as if the Democratic party
                        were animated by an undying spite against Freedom. Otherwise, why should
                        they persist in trying to force Slavery upon communities situated in high
                        latitudes like Nebraska, where they know the sentiment of the people is
                        against it, and where they cannot hope to secure this permanent
                        establishment? It is only on this hypothesis that we can account for this
                        abortive veto of Governor Black and Mr. Buchanan. That veto cannot keep
                        Slavery in Nebraska for any length of time, and it is merely to insult and
                        incense the people of the Territory. Its only tendency is to aggravate and
                        embitter the controversy on that phase of the Slavery question opened by the
                        repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and further inflamed by the proceedings
                        of the Administration on the Lecompton Constitution. It is another evidence
                        that the Democratic party does not seek peace or harmony, but for some
                        purpose is determined to aggravate our political disorders to the utmost.
                        The Administration backs the Slave Power not only in those of its
                        aggressions which promise favorable results, but yields to its malignant
                        dictates where apparently it only seeks to humiliate those who oppose its
                        universal sway. </p>

                        mean by <emph rend="italic">an equal share?</emph></p>
                    <p>While the Missouri line was in existence -which the South, aided by their
                        whipt-spaniel, dough-face, locofoco allies from the North, abrogated- there
                        were added to the Union four Slave States, viz: Missouri, with an area of
                        65,037 square miles, Arkansas, with an area of 52,198 square miles, Florida,
                        with an area of 59,268 square miles, and Texas, with an area of 325, 520
                        square miles. Our Southern brethren getting, thereby, the enormous amount of
                        Territory comprising 502,023 square miles.</p>
                    <p>Under the operation of the Missouri compromise there were admitted into the
                        family of States four devoted to freedom, viz: Michigan, with an area of
                        56,243 square miles, Iowa, with an area of 50,914 square miles, Wisconsin,
                        with an area of 53,924 square miles, and California with an area of 188,982
                        square miles. Thus giving to Freedom, to Free White men and their families;
                        from every <emph rend="italic">section</emph> of the Union, and from every
                        land on earth; but 350,063 square miles of Territory -one hundred and fifty
                        one thousand, nine hundred and sixty square miles less than was devoted to
                        the blight of Slavery in the same period.</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">section</emph> of the Union which claims an <emph
                            rend="italic">equal share</emph> of the Territories -The South-
                        received, from the passage of the Missouri act till its repeal, under the
                        provisions of that law, more Territory by 47,679 square miles (more than
                        enough to form two states as large as New York and Rhode Island) than is
                        contained within the whole of the Free States, named, as follows: Maine, New
                        Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New
                        Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, and
                        Wisconsin, fifteen Free States -and yet the Slavery extentionists are not
                        satisfied.</p>
                    <p>During that same period the "<emph rend="italic">equal share</emph>" which
                        fell to the lot of the North, comprised within the limits of the four States
                        already mentioned, is actually less than the area of Eight Slave States viz:
                        North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
                        Tennessee, and Kentucky. These eight Slave States contain more Territory
                        than the North received while the Missouri restriction was upon our statute
                        books by a considerably greater amount than would make two states as large
                        as Rhode Island -and still their cry is, "give us more."</p>
                    <p>What is to be the basis of an "<emph rend="italic">equal share</emph>?" if
                        the share is to be apportioned to the relative numbers of those who are, and
                        those who are not, directly interested in slavery, then the owners of human
                        chattels should have received only about the one fortieth of the Territory
                        admitted into the confederacy of States during the existence of the Missouri
                        line. They (the slaveholders) constitute about one in forty of the white
                        population of the country; and should have received only one square mile to
                        thirty nine given to freedom, to do what they clamor so loudly for -deal out
                            <emph rend="italic">equal justice</emph>.</p>
                    <p>What arithmetic is used by the greedy hotspurs of Slavery, and their
                        moon-eyed Northern followers, which enables them, the one fortieth of the
                        population, to take 502,023 square miles of Territory, as their <emph
                            rend="italic">equal share</emph>; and give to the non-slaveholding
                        whites, the thirty nine fortieths of the people, but 350,063 square miles,
                        as their <emph rend="italic">equal share?</emph></p>
                    <p>The whole Territory, embraced within the eight States already alluded to,
                        which was taken into the Union, and dignified with State privileges, during
                        the existence of the time-honored Missouri compromise, amounts to the very
                        large quantity of 852,086 square miles. the proportion of this property,
                        according to <emph rend="italic">equality of sharing,</emph> which should
                        have fallen to Slavery would be 21,302 square miles; and all the rest
                        -830,784 square miles- justly belongs to the non-Slaveholding whites of the
                        land.--Instead of that disposition, however, the numerically insignificant
                        number of Slaveholders took the largest <emph rend="italic">share as their
                            equal right.</emph></p>
                    <p>The slave power -the one fortieth of the whites of the United States- have
                        also usurped about the seven eights of all the important offices under the
                        National Government since the formation of the Republic. Notwithstanding,
                        therefore, that they have thus been encroaching upon the rights of others
                        -taking almost all of the controlling offices and the largest <emph
                            rend="italic">share</emph> of the National domain- the North never
                        breathed a whisper against the Union; never uttered a threat about
                        destroying the fair fabric of American Nationality. All the foul, seething
                        sentences of disloyalty proceed from the ever grasping, never-satisfied
                        handful of tyrants who estimate the Union of the States at an infinitely
                        less value than their own hold upon power.</p>
                    <p>An <emph rend="italic">equal share</emph> of the offices, and the
                        Territories, would take from the minority a large amount of the places and
                        lands to which they now unrighteously lay claim. This is not the design of
                        the Republicans however. They simply say to these horseleaches give us an
                        interest in the common inheritance; the yet undivided, uninhabited
                        Territories, and the offices under Government; for the future, in proportion
                        to our numbers, and you can, without molestation, keep what lands you have,
                        and hold all the offices to which you are entitled. This is <emph
                            rend="italic">equal</emph>. This is fair. No person who desires exact
                        justice to all <emph rend="italic">sections</emph> can possibly object to
                        the position occupied by the majority of the people who have been for so
                        great a length of time, kept out of their <emph rend="italic">equal
                        share</emph> of rights, privileges, franchises and immunities under the

                    <p>--The sly little archer aimed one of his barbed arrows at the bosom of our
                        young friend, G.H. Mengel., Esq., the junior partner in the office of the
                            <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph>, and mercilessly pierced him
                        through the heart. Singular to relate, although he is <emph rend="italic"
                            >wounded</emph> for life, altogether disabled as a bachelor, he is or
                        was yesterday morning, when last we saw him, as brisk as a bee and as
                        sprightly as a lark. He was able to lead one of Chambersburg's fairest, best
                        young ladies up to the alter of old Hymen; where two willing hearts became
                        one. They are off now upon their bridal tour. Success to them. They have the
                        prayers and good wishes of this entire community for their future prosperity
                        and happy realization of all their fond anticipations.</p>
