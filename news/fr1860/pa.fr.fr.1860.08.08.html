<b>Douglas Deprecating Agitation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to Douglas' complaint that the slavery issue occupies too much
                    of Congress' time, instead of dealing with the Tariff, the Pacific Railroad, and
                    mail service. The Tribune reminds us that Douglas himself has constantly brought
                    up the slave issue--in 1854 he championed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,
                    and later the Kansas-Nebraska bill.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The spectacle says, the N.Y. Tribune, of Douglas
                        holding on by the balustrade of the Revere House, and bemoaning before a
                        Boston audience the agitation of the Slavery question in Congress, and the
                        consequent neglect of the material interests of the country, finds its only
                        parallel in Pecksniff, holding himself up by the bannister of Mrs. Todger's
                        third story, and, under the stimulating influence of Mrs. Todger's punch,
                        uttering moral precepts, in maudlin tones, for the instruction of Mrs.
                        Todger's young lodgers.</p>
                    <p>Everybody praises Mr. Douglas for his courage and energy. Few dispute his
                        rare powers as a debater. Some of his ardent admires have even ventured to
                        call him a statesman. But his blindest worshippers, when trying to invest
                        him with every virtue, never could find a man among them with effrontery
                        enough to call him modest. The salient feature of his character, standing
                        out beyond all others, and challenging the attention of everybody, is
                        audacity. For example: In every speech he has delivered during his present
                        stumping tour for the Presidency, he specifies, as the great grievance of
                        the times, the neglect by Congress of the material interests of the country,
                        in order that it may devote its energies to discussions upon the Negro
                        Question. In his Boston harangue, he says: "For the last few years, all the
                        time of Congress has been employed in the discussion of the Slavery
                        question, to the exclusion of important business affecting the whole
                        country;" and he waxes earnest and eloquen [sic] over the shameful disregard
                        by the National Legislature of the subjects of the Tariff, the Pacific
                        Railroad, the Mail service in the old States and across the continent, and
                        cognate matters.</p>
                    <p>True, most true Mr. Douglas! But where is the man to whom, more than any and
                        all others, the waste of time by Congress is due? Help us, Mr. Douglas, to
                        place our finger upon him, and we assure you the country will put in every
                        honest hand a whip to lash the rascal naked through the land.</p>
                    <p>When the Ethiopian changes his skin, and Mr. Garrison turns professional
                        Union-Saver, and Gerrit Smith advertises hounds to catch fugitive slaves and
                        Satan puts on a monk's cowl, then Stephen A. Douglas will witness
                        transformations of character and conduct as miraculous as his current
                        condemnation of Slavery agitation in Congress. Let us refresh his memory
                        with a bit of history which the country has not forgotten.</p>
                    <p>A controversy concerning Slavery, which had convulsed Congress and the
                        country for three or four years, terminated in the adoption of the
                        Compromise measures of 1850.--This result was not wholly satisfactory to the
                        extreme wing of either side of the combatants; yet, the thing being done
                        past help, there was a general acquiescence in or submission to this
                        disposition of the matter in issue. In 1852, both the Whig and Democratic
                        parties, with some dissenting voices, ratified the measures of 1850 in their
                        platforms, and agreed to abide by them. No man was more ostentatious in his
                        avowals of fidelity to "this final settlement" of the Slavery controversy
                        than Mr. Douglas. In the Senate, and before popular assemblies, he invoked
                        maledictions upon all who should attempt to disturb the repose of the
                        country by reopening the Slavery agitation, either in or out of Congress.</p>
                    <p>So much for Mr. Douglas's professions. Now for his practices. In the session
                        of 1854, when irritation growing out of the contests of 1850 had subsided,
                        Mr. Douglas startled the country by proposing to repeal the prohibitory
                        clause of the Missouri Compromise, and throw the vast regions lying north of
                        36° 30' open to Slavery. This venerable landmark, reared by conflicting
                        sections as a monument of the final adjustment of a struggle that had
                        imperilled the Union, was held as sacred as any compact of the Constitution.
                        Its proposed destruction immediately precipitated Congress and the people
                        upon a sea of agitation, seemingly without a bottom or a share. After a
                        conflict which has no parallel in our history, Mr. Douglas, spurred on by
                        the hope of outstripping all competitors for the favor of the Slavery
                        Extensionists, succeeded, by his tireless energy and force of will, in
                        prostrating this old landmark. And from that hour till now, Negro agitation
                        has been the ruling element of American politics. Mr. Douglas has always
                        boasted, and with entire truth, that this repeal was his own handiwork. No
                        other man in that fatal Congress had sufficient vigor, skill, and audacity,
                        to do the deed.</p>
                    <p>A conspiracy to plant Slavery in Kansas, by fraud and force, was partly the
                        moving cause, and partly the resulting consequence, of the repeal of the
                        Missouri Compromise. During the three years when the attempts of the
                        conspirators involved Kansas in civil war, of the many black and bloody
                        crimes perpetrated in their efforts to force slavery upon her people, none
                        were black and bloody enough to extort a rebuke or even a regret from Mr.
                        Douglas; but, on the contrary, he was the ablest champion in Congress, and
                        the loudest declaimer before the People, in behalf of this infernal scheme.
                        History will blush to record that the policy of Pierce and Atchison and
                        their myrmidons, which stuffed ballot boxes, forced election returns, drove
                        legal voters from the polls at the point of the bayonet, installed bogus
                        Legislatures under the protection of cannon, fired dwellings, outraged
                        female virtue, cut throats under cover of the night, shot men down on the
                        highways at noon-day, and, in a word, for nearly four years gave Kansas up
                        to anarchy, pillage, and butchery, because she would not accept Negro
                        Slavery, found its wiliest apologies and ablest vindication in the speeches
                        and reports of the man that now declaims in favor of "Non-intervention by
                        the Federal authorities in the Territories!" The Lecomption Constitution,
                        with the villainies that clustered around it, was the natural fruit of the
                        tree which Douglas planted in 1854, and assiduously cultivated throughout
                        the following three years. His political existence being then at hazard, he
                        feared to pluck and eat the fruit of his own doings. Like Danton, whom
                        Douglas resembles, he was about to be consumed by the fires of the
                        revolution which he had himself kindled; but, unlike Danton, he had neither
                        the courage nor the manliness to die like a martyr, and so he ran away like
                        a coward and has ever since been boasting like a braggart.</p>
                    <p>Now, does Mr. Douglas flatter himself that the people have forgotten this
                        damning record, because he finds it convenient to ignore its existance? Does
                        he fancy that they will withhold the retribution they have in store for the
                        author of this absorbing agitation in Congress, because it suits his
                        interests now to feign to lament over its consequences? We assure him that
                        he lowers himself in the public esteem by such canting and whining. In the
                        Kansas- Nebraska bill, he represented to the North the box of Pandora. Let
                        him not wonder nor wince when some of the serpents he then sent out return
                        to sting him. To descend nearer to the level of our theme, the actor who has
                        been recognized and applauded as a star of the first magnitude, in the
                        higher walks or tragedy, on the metropolitan boards, ought to be ashamed to
                        now go through the provinces playing the farce of "Agitation,"
                        "Sectionalism," "Disunion," and kindred roles,
                        along with such worn-out performers as the Brookses and the Hunts. When he
                        entered the Presidential ring, and made straight at the Champion of the
                        Negro Propaganda, hitting out right and left with might and main, he won the
                        plaudits of the masses. But now, when he skulks to his corner, and sits upon
                        the knee of his backer, and affects to deplore the "noise and confusion"
                        incident to the fight, and discourses upon the iniquities of the P.R., we
                        tell him he excites only contempt for his hypocrisy, and disgust at his
                        whimpering.</p>

                        institutions of learning of any kind--in a state of semi barbarians, so far
                        as regards the advancement of the manufactures and the mechanic arts- -yet,
                        with all these disadvantages, we repeat, the Southern States have dictated
                        the policy, both domestic and foreign, which has controlled the
                        administration of this Government for the last sixty years, with very slight
                        intermissions!</p>
                    <p>The reason of all this is:--A union of sentiment and a concert of action on
                        the part of the Oligarchy--the Slaveholders--who number, exclusive of minors
                        and females, say about 200,000 influential men out of the 7,000,000 of the
                        white population of the Fifteen Southern States. There are altogether some
                        400,000 Slaveholders in the South, who own from one slave up to one
                        thousand; but among these, it must be remember there are many females as
                        well as minors, and these exert no influence, politically, in their several
                        communities. Deducting these, and we would not have more than one-half, or,
                        as we before said, 200,000 influential persons left.</p>
                    <p>This insignificant number, devoting their time and attention exclusively to
                        politics, and possessing the principal part of the wealth of the South, are
                        thus armed with an overpowering influence, which is always directed to
                        secure the political promotion of those of their own class while the
                        non-slaveholders are kept in the back-ground or overshadowed by these lords-
                        of-the-lash. Their numbers being small and their interests identical, a
                        union of political effort is easily secured, and by a perseverance in this
                        course, they have secured and maintained their ascendancy in the control of
                        the General Government, aided, of course, by the divisions in the Free
                        States, which they have contributed to keep alive.</p>
                    <p>The so-called Democratic party of the Free States, heretofore, was the mere
                        beast of burden--the catspaw of the South. The fifteen Slave States, with
                        their sparse white populations, have thirty Senators; the eighteen Free
                        States, with their teeming millions of white Freemen, have thirty-six
                        Senators. But by their concerted action, which, we have referred to, aided
                        by such miserable dough-face leaders of the Northern Democracy as Bigler, of
                        Pa.; Pugh, of Ohio; Douglas, of Ill.; Rice, of Minn.; Fitch and Bright, of
                        Ind.; Gwinn, of Cal., and Thompson, of N.J., the South has managed to shape
                        the policy of our Government to suit its own particular section, regardless
                        of the interests of either section--nay more: by the aid of the Democratic
                        party of the North, the South has stricken down the North, paralyzed her
                        industry, and like Samson shorn of his locks, she is bound hand and foot,
                        and now lies powerless at the feet of these Southern Philistines. This has
                        been accomplished by a steady perseverance and concert of action, aided and
                        abetted by their Northern Democratic Deliah.</p>
                    <p>Northern Democratic Presidents, such as Pierce and Buchanan, prove more
                        serviceable, in the hands of Southern politicians, to advance their
                        ambitious and dangerous projects and their selfish schemes, then would men
                        from their own quarter. A Northern dough-face is
                        one the meanest creature that infest the Free States. They have proven to be
                        quite a injurious to the cause of Freedom and Free Labor in this country as
                        did the Tories to the cause of the Revolution--but the latter were overcome
                        and driven out, along with the common enemy, and, by persevering effort, the
                        former will be also.</p>
                    <p>The Free States are entitled to 183 votes in the Electoral College, while the
                        Southern States have but 120. To elect a President by the people, 152 votes
                        are necessary, so that the Free States can elect, and have 31 votes over. We
                        hold that it is the duty of the Free States to exert their influence in the
                        Government. Their power heretofore, has been wasted by division, and by
                        treacherous doughfaceism, whilst the South has been a unit on all questions
                        that have concerned its peculiar interests.</p>
                    <p>We should practice a little more after the example of our Southern brethren.
                        The people should study politics a little closer, and elect men to the
                        Presidency and to seats in Congress who would die rather than wantonly trade
                        off the cherished interests of their constituents. They have it now in their
                        power to elect "honest ABE LINCOLN," than whom a more worthy disciple of
                        HENRY CLAY cannot be found. In MR. LINCOLN we have a truly National man--one
                        who, while protecting the interests of Freedom and Free Labor, would also be
                        found defending the local interests if the South. We make no war upon the
                        "peculiar institution," so long as it is not sought to spread its baneful
                        influences beyond its present boundaries; but whilst we wage no war with it
                        where it is, we are opposed to its defenders dominating exclusive in the
                        Government. The Free States hereafter, owing to the interests involved,
                        should control the affairs of the partnership. We have permitted a
                        miserable, sectional minority too long to override and insult the majority;
                        and if it is permitted to continue, and if by our supineness we consent to
                        the declaration that, "Freedom is section and Slavery national," by allowing
                        the Republican party to be defeated, then we tacitly admit that the
                        interests of Slavery in this Republic are
                        paramount to those of Freedom.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday last a German was lodged in jail, charged with committing a
                        burglary at the residence of MR. JOHN HORN, near the Grindstone Hill Church,
                        in Guilford township. The circumstances, as we have learned them, are about
                        as follows: The door which was bolted, he forced open, and entered the house
                        with a large stone in his hand. Mrs. Horn was the only person in the house,
                        who of course was much alarmed by the violence of the intruder, and she
                        escaped from the Dwelling. Before he had time to pillage the house, he was
                        arrested by some young men of the neighborhood who happened to be passing at
                        the time.</p>
                    <p>These traveling vagrants are a great annoyance to our rural friends. They
                        never leave their homes without entertaining fears that their families will
                        be intruded upon and insulted by them in their absence; or in the absence of
                        the whole family, on their return they frequently find their premises
                        plundered.</p>
                    <p>A remedy for such evils is not so easily procured, unless the females of the

                        that they be furnished with a good Revolver, and when such a customer is
                        seen approaching, prepare to receive him. If he offers insult or injury, let
                        him or them be immediately and peremptorily ordered off; and if they refuse,
                        let the Revolver be presented by way of intimidation, and used if necessary.</p>
