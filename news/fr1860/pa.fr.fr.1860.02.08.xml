                <transcript>
                    <p>At length the discordant elements which for weeks have agitated the assembled
                        wisdom of the land, in the South wing of the capitol, at Washington, have
                        become calm and composed. The Republicans have elected a Speaker; the Union
                        still remains; the temple of liberty continues intact; the chivalrous sons
                        of thunder have not put into execution their treasonable threat -to tear
                        down the capitol "from turret to foundation stone" -and we are not likely to
                        have a civil war as the consequence of a Republican triumph; the majority
                        ruling.</p>
                    <p>We trust that no time will be consumed by gassy debaters with buncombe
                        speeches, before relief is given to languishing industry. The first subject
                        which should claim the attention of our lawmakers is the revision of the
                        Tariff. No measure is more needful. If the Protectionists of the House were
                        to adopt the act of 1842, which gave so much comfort eighteen years since,
                        and attach it to the first measure the Administration ask for -The Post
                        Office appropriation, for instance,- we could have the blessing of a wise
                        system of protection in less than a fortnight.</p>
                    <p>If the friends of Protection seize upon this favorable opportunity they my
                        accomplish the cherished object of their mission to the national capitol.
                        The Administration party played out their <emph rend="italic">role</emph> in
                        their silly attempt at <emph rend="italic">forcing</emph> the majority to
                        yield to the minority. They caused their own people, the contractors under
                        old Mr. Buchanan's administration, and the administration itself, in every
                        department, to become bankrupt. Consequently, they cannot afford to protract
                        the passage of an appropriation bill -having in it a set of Tariff sections.</p>
                    <p>Whenever, in the course of events, the Opposition to the Sham Democracy elect
                        a majority of Congressmen, the leeches, unwilling to let go their hold upon
                        the body politic, and the financial crib, struggle with shameful tenacity to
                        hold on to the public teats. Should they succeed by any of these disgraceful
                        operations there never would be any such thing as living with the cormorants
                        thereafter. Therefore it becomes the lovers of true, genuine, Jeffersonian
                        Democracy to prevent, by all honorable means, as the present majority have
                        done, the success of the schemes of the rule-or-ruin party.</p>
                    <p>The old adage, To the victors belong the spoils, is held to be good when the
                        Nigger Democracy carry the day at the polls.--They expect the Opposition to
                        stand back whenever they -the office-mongers- are triumphant. Knowing so
                        well how to claim what belongs to political success, it is but reasonable to
                        look for them to accord to others what they are so ready to demand. If the
                        ever-grasping, loaves-and-fishes-seeking party were as willing to give as to
                        take there never would be such deplorable scenes as have been witnessed in
                        the popular branch of Congress during the past two months.</p>
                    <p>They have, however, fought their last battle. Their doom is sealed. The fiat
                        has gone forth. The death-rattle is in the throat of the Nigger Democracy.
                        In their dying spasms they clutched at shadows. They succeeded in keeping
                        the House disorganized for eight weeks; but, after the present session, they
                        will scarcely ever be heard of again; they will not be possessed of
                        sufficient vitality to secure their recuperation. The blow which will be
                        dealt out to the administration of old Mr. Buchanan by the present Congress,
                        will forever prostrate all the energies of the party, once powerful for
                        harm, that placed the old imbecile at the helm of the ship of state.</p>
                    <p>The corruptions, frauds, peculations and profligacy which a Congressional
                        Investigating Committee will expose, to the astonished gaze of an indignant
                        people, as the means whereby the present polluted, abominable, national
                        administration man aged to squander the scores of millions of the people's
                        money, during times of peace, to buy partisan subserviency, and to
                        perpetuate slavery, will cause the honest, unsuspecting portion of the rank
                        and file, the hard-working white masses, of the once potent democracy to
                        flee from the cold, clamy embrace of the living political skeleton, which
                        holds the reins of power, like rats from a ship on fire.</p>
                    <p>Inspired with the vain desire to cover up the slimy tracks of the most
                        wicked, hurtful dynasty that ever attempted to rule a free people with a rod
                        of iron -the administration of James Buchanan- the servile followers of the
                        man in power debased themselves by stooping to means which they would have
                        scorned under different, and more favorable circumstances. We find them
                        alternating, in their votes for Speaker between a Nullifier and a Know
                        Nothing; the first class of who were once routed by the brave, fearless
                        Jackson -but, alas, no advocate of his doctrines dare hold up his head in
                        the present democratic political church. Jacksonism is below par, at
                        Washington, since the old Federalist, James Buchanan, has under taken to
                        teach his cringing followers lessons for them to obey. To abuse the
                        "intollerance of Know Nothingism," as the locofocos were always accustomed
                        to denounce the peculiar tenets of the American party, was, for a number of
                        years, the only stock in trade of the administration partisans. Now,
                        however, with the advice and encouragement of the chief foe to this
                        organization -ten cent jimmy- we find the most unsparing calumniators of the
                        doctrines of Americanism actually voting for one of that party for the third
                        office under the Government.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Four years, sometimes, produce strange developments. In every department of
                        life we may find startling changes in this period. Friends, between whom and
                        ourselves the warmest attachment existed, may, in the short season of four
                        years, become our most inveterate foes. Those for whom we may have been
                        willing to do anything in our power four years since, may, in that time, be
                        classed with our relentless, implacable enemies, and, thereby become the
                        very last for whose prosperity we are disposed to exert ourselves. When
                        these sudden, and unnatural changes, however, do occur there is, generally,
                        very good reasons therefore. We propose noticing one of these phenomena.</p>
                    <p>In the year 1856, there lived in Pennsylvania two remarkable personages. The
                        one old, cold, heartless, aspiring. The other young, warm-hearted,
                        admiring.--The first had managed, through mean adulation of greater ones
                        than himself, and by base partisan subserviency, to fill many prominent,
                        public, political positions. He was never extraordinarily qualified for
                        these different posts; but, no matter, his party -led for a number of years
                        by the gallant, fiery youth, before alluded to -bestowed the honors upon him
                        and he <emph rend="italic">meekly kneeled</emph> to received the proffered
                        marks of distinction, and, while bowed down, to do homage at the shrine of
                        party. His willing humiliation at the altar of party was mistaken, by the
                        single minded devotees of democracy, for genuine political piety -true
                        patriotism. But beneath the sheep's garb of democratic <emph rend="italic"
                            >professions</emph> there lurked the wolf of Federalism. Any person can
                        recognize, in the professedly democratic, though actually federal
                        politician, in the picture we have faintly drawn, the familiar features of
                        Pennsylvania's favorite son -<emph rend="italic">par excellence</emph>-
                        James Buchanan.</p>
                    <p>The other character with whom we have to do, believing, in his inmost heart,
                        that the man whom he was anxious to elevate, over all others in the land,
                        was all that his fondest wishes, and hopeful imagination painted him to be,
                        spared no efforts to bring about his dearest political desire -elect to the
                        Presidency James Buchanan. None need be told that the ardent, zealous friend
                        of the old celibate, (the old denizen of "Bachelor's Roost," -Wheatland-)
                        The sleepless guardian of the old reprobates political fame, was Col. John
                        W. Forney.</p>
                    <p>The friendship of Forney for Buchanan -equal to the affection of Jonathan for
                        David; but returned as was Sampson's love by Delilah- was the mainspring in
                        the great political machinery which was in motion at Cincinnati in June,
                        1856, which produced the nomination of Buchanan for highest office in the
                        gift of the American people. The platform the and there erected, at Forney's
                        instance, was the only one upon which the old man feeble could have been
                        elected. Getting his favorite upon the track, Forney put himself to work, as
                        one in earnest, to accomplish the great desire of many years of his life
                        -elect "old Buck" to the Presidency. No man in this, or any other State,
                        worked harder, few labored half as assiduously as did he, to place within
                        the old ingrate's reach the much coveted boon.</p>
                    <p>Through the eloquence of Forney's tongue, and the insidious appeals of his
                        pen, a large body of the people of the old Keystone were induced to vote for
                        one of their own citizens for that high office. He led them to believe that
                        the policy of the platform upon which Buchanan stood, and which he heartily
                        endorsed -even to the humiliating extent of losing his personal identity in
                        it -was the embodiment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence;
                        was the same as those which fired the blood and braced the nerves of our
                        Revolutionary sires, and that its success -permitting the people of a
                        Territory, like those of a State to make their own laws -was the best and
                        only practicable method of settling the vexed question of Slavery as
                        connected with our western territories.</p>
                    <p>The Republicans did not believe -although we do all now think that Forney was
                        sincere- that the Locofocos intended to give the citizens of any of the
                        territories a <emph rend="italic">fair</emph> chance; hence they favored the
                        doctrine of Congressional legislation to prevent the curse -Slavery-
                        extending one Rood beyond its present limits; not desiring to interfere with
                        it in the States.</p>
                    <p>The result has shown that we were right, and that Forney was deceived. Old
                        Mr. Buchanan was scarcely warm in the Presidential chair till he kicked down
                        the ladder by which he climbed into power. The gallant Col., feeling that
                        his own reputation, as well as that of Buchanan, and the good of the party,
                        were all imperiled by the old man's movements, did everything in his power
                        to prevent the old codger disgracing himself and those who voted for him.
                        All his importunities were disregarded, and he was threatened with being
                        driven from the Presidential mansion, as a <emph rend="italic"
                        >traitor</emph> -not to principle, certainly, but to men- and that he would
                        be ruled out of <emph rend="italic">the party</emph> if he did not consent
                        to debase himself in the same manner his chief had done. Forney's nature
                        rebelled. He wished to save his party <emph rend="italic">idol</emph>; but
                        would not at the expense of principle. </p>
                    <p>A fierce political warfare, thence, began between John W. Forney upon the one
                        hand, a private citizen of Pennsylvania -without power and with no official
                        patronage at his disposal- and the President of the United States, with all
                        his significant appliance, on the other hand. The contest was equally
                        balanced. The one had millions of money, the other had Gibraltar of
                        principle. The right succeeded; and now, after all that Buchanan could do to
                        humble, and degrade Forney, we find him elevated by the People's
                        representatives -many of them not of his own party- to a high and important

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Administration, says Forney's <emph rend="italic">Press</emph>, having
                        exhausted argument, and been foiled at every point by the sound logic of
                        such Representatives as Hickman and Haskin, at last falls back upon the
                            <emph rend="italic">ultima ration remug,</emph> and evinces, it would
                        appear, a determination to bring all questions to arbitrament on the plan of
                        the ancient and almost forgotten Roman gladiatorial arena. In this view,
                        late events and discussions upon the floor of the House of Representatives
                        compel us to the reflection that one ingredient of character is lacking in
                        those who speak for the North in that body. Heretofore, the people of the
                        free States, in their selection of legislators, have considered it primarily
                        necessary that their Representative should be learned in the Constitution
                        and the laws -that they should know well the interests of the whole Union,
                        and every section of it, and be ready to do even and exact justice to them
                        all; and that, above all, they should be pure in personal character, high in
                        gentlemanlike courtesy, and filled with profound devotion to the Union of
                        the States.--It is with reluctance we admit that these characteristics of
                        true statesmanship have become worthless and out of date, and that we must
                        mend our ways, else our Representatives will become mere manikins and
                        automata in the halls of the National Legislature. We must begin to take
                        lessons from the brute creation, and learn that mere muscle and pure
                        physical force, like those of the bull-dog, are far superior qualifications
                        in the statesmen of this day to the mental acquirements we have already
                        recited. We know that the student who has been brought up with a distaste
                        and horror of personal combat, and who comes from a people where such things
                        are looked upon as worthy of civil and criminal disabilities, is no match
                        for him whose life has been spent amid bloody brawls and deadly personal
                        recontres. The <emph rend="italic">habitue</emph> of pistol gallery from
                        early youth is certainly, in such contests, the superior of the man who has
                        been educated in the belief that personal combat was only worthy of the Dark
                        Ages.</p>
                    <p>And since the necessities of the times demand it, there seems to be but one
                        alternative left for the Northern consideration. We desire, therefore, to
                        propose an addition to the usual qualifications for a Northern
                        Representative. We suggest that the Northern States shall hereafter choose,
                        from those of their people whose habits and profession have placed them high
                        upon the roll of the "fancy," and so make them fit colleagues for those who
                        are sent there for the purpose of civilized legislation. It shall be the
                        duty of these new Representatives to hold themselves, on all occasions, in
                        readiness for combat, whether upon the floor of the House or upon the more
                        elevated stage of the duelling ground. New York, for want of a better, might
                        send "the Benicia Boy," now absent on a congenial mission in England, and
                        Pennsylvania, borrowing from the superfluity of New York, might send
                        Morrisey, or Mulligan, or any others of that gladiatorial <emph
                            rend="italic">corps</emph>, at this time so efficient in sustaining Mr.
                        Buchanan's Administration. It shall be the duty of these <emph rend="italic"
                            >gentlemen</emph> to fight on the slightest provocation, or, for want of
                        any, to create it -to fight either with the "daddles," or the "long bunch of
                        fives," wherein the danger would not extend beyond a bloody nose or a black
                        eye, or, if a more sanguinary result is demanded, with the sword, pistol, or
                        double-barreled gun, of course including the novel refinement of the navy
                        revolter. They shall be willing to "sink point" on the "first blood drawn,"
                        or to carry the matter <emph rend="italic">a l'outrance</emph>. If it be
                        objected that the gentlemen named have not the <emph rend="italic">sangre
                            azule</emph>, or are not of the pure human porcelain, then there are to
                        be found in all our fashionable clubs a number of young patricians, who
                        boast of their achievements in arms, and, discarding all knowledge of
                        American politics, are fond of criticising the action of our legislators.
                        From this variegated list may be selected candidates for Congress in the
                        respective districts upon the same platform. And, in addition to other
                        appropriations from the treasury vaults which this patriotic Administration
                        is asking, we suggest one for the construction of an arena, to adjoin the
                        Congressional burying-ground, a coliseum, upon the Roman model, which will
                        afford ample accommodation to the spectators who come to witness the doings
                        of our national rulers and agents. Members of Congress should have front
                        seats, and citizens, as in the galleries of the House of Representatives,
                        other seats, but not so far removed as to obstruct the view, nor so near as
                        to interfere with those more nearly interested than themselves. It should be
                        a standing order of the House that, a fight once agreed upon, the members
                        should instater adjourn to witness the exhibition.</p>
                    <p>Our glorious Republic has been an example for all the civilized nations of
                        the globe, and, in this suggested reform, we will, of course, be imitated by
                        England and by France. In these countries, (if not in the secession South,
                        at the instigation of the Administration, where the privilege has fallen
                        into disuse,) freedom of speech is allowed. In the French Senate and the
                        British Parliament, courtesy, and high breeding, and intellectual gifts,
                        stand first, but if the innovation indicated be made here with us, no doubt
                        Queen Victoria and Emperor Napoleon III will decree its establishment for
                        more vigorous and healthy legislation under their rule. It is true that only
                        lately France has terribly punished the unhappy lieutenant who was so
                        unlucky as to run Monsier de Pene through the body, because he had offended
                        in the discussion of a political question in his newspaper, and that England
                        has ever held the practice in such deep detestation, as to have met it with
                        such vigorous retribution, as to have driven it, disgraced, beyond the pale
                        of decent society. But we must hope that our bright example will persuade
                        these semi-barbarous nations to follow obediently in our wake.</p>
                    <p>Seriously, and <emph rend="italic">badinage</emph> apart, has it come to this
                        that the North is to be stigmatised by the South as wanting that element
                        which so commends the soldier and the gentleman?--Has there ever been a time
                        in the history of this country when the North showed that it lacked that
                        vulgar attribute of humanity, mere physical courage? "Go back to the first
                        gun that flashed at Lexington and Concord, and to the last sword that
                        gleamed at Chepultepec." Upon land and sea the North has signalized her
                        courage in defence of her rights and those of the country. From the day that
                        Warren fell at Bunker Hill to the hour which saw the lamented Lawrence go
                        down into the hospital of his ship bleeding from a mortal wound -from the
                        day that Hull and Bainbridge and Decatur hoisted the American flag
                        triumphant over the trailing British ensign -from the hour that Scott rode
                        victorious over hosts of discomfited Mexicans- from then, till now, the
                        North has never yet failed to give proof by her sailors and her soldiers of
                        as much desperate valor as was ever displayed by the fiercest Southern
                        Hotspur of them all.</p>
                    <p>We have no desire to remind the South of the devotion of Pennsylvania to the
                        Union; we have no wish to recall to her the fact that in this city the
                        Declaration of Independence was proclaimed, and the Constitution itself
                        constructed; nor yet to revive the recollections of the battles of the
                        Revolution fought in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. As Mr. Webster said
                        of Lexington and of Bunker Hill, in his defence of Massachusetts, against
                        Mr. Hayne -"the past, so far as these are concerned, is at least secure."
                        But we do desire to speak of the living present. In the Mexican war there
                        were more regiments <emph rend="italic">offered to defend the South, and
                            vindicate the honor of the country, </emph>in a battle fought for
                        Southern interests -growing out of the annexation of Texas to this Union-
                        more regiments offered by Pennsylvania, and refused by the Federal
                        Government, than were offered by all the Southern States put together. Not
                        this alone; but the glorious "Old Dominion" herself, through some of her
                        bravest sons was not ashamed to come to Pennsylvania, and to eke out her
                        feeble numbers with volunteers from the Keystone State. The names of
                        Patterson, Cadwalader, Wynkooop, Bowman of Luzerne, Black, Hambright,
                        Roberts, Wunder, Bachman, Robert K. Scott, Charles J. Biddle, and thousands
                        of others, now sleeping under the sods of the valley, are the assurances
                        that Pennsylvania needs no vindication, either in the patriotism of her
                        people or in her physical courage; and if we desire to cross the Delaware
                        and to go into our sister State, New Jersey, we might recall to the
                        recollection of the South Robert F. Stockton, another Northern man, whose
                        courage has been signalized on both continents, and who is, today, a strong
                        symphathiser with the Northern sentiment against the secessionists of the
                        South.</p>
                    <p>But we forbear. God grant that the day may never come when these memorable
                        qualities (now slumbering and latent) preserved in history, and admitted by
                        all candid men, must be employed for the purpose of putting down that foul
                        spirit of disunion, which, for the first time in our annals, is being
                        deliberately encouraged by a Federal Administration, and is running
                        resistlessly riot in the councils of the Federal Government?</p>
