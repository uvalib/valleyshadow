<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A person should scarcely be astonished at anything to be met with in the
                        world of politics; yet there are occurrences which, notwithstanding our
                        constant expectations for something calculated to startle the staid, fill us
                        with surprise.</p>
                    <p>The Spirit of last week contains some beautiful
                        specimens of ground and lofty tumbling. The burthen of its song seems to be
                        a desire to harmonize the two wings of its party, and, in the same article,
                        uses the most insulting language toward some of the best men, in its party,
                        to be found in this community. It has a strange
                        notion of harmony.</p>
                    <p>The editorials in the last Spirit remind us very
                        much of a story we once heard, and which, for its special benefit, we will
                        relate:</p>
                    <p>Two old neighbors, deacons in the same church, once had a difference of
                        opinion about the color of a chameleon, which one of them had seen upon a
                        piece of board painted red, and the other had seen upon a block of wood
                        painted green. The little animal, as every person knows, or should know, has
                        the power of changing its color to suit circumstances--very much like the
                        political chameleon, STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS, about whom the two wings of the
                        Nigger Democracy are now disputing--and each one of the deacons contended
                        that it was the color it had assumed when he saw it. From words they came to
                        blows; but, some of their friends being at hand, they were parted before
                        either had seriously injured the other. The difficulty, however did not end
                        there.</p>
                    <p>About midnight, soon after the fight, Deacon A. awoke from an uneasy sleep
                        and, after pondering the matter for some time, came to the conclusion that
                        the only thing which could disturb his slumbers was his quarrel with Deacon
                        B; consequently he resolved upon having a reconciliation with his
                        adversary--late his warmest personal friend. No sooner had he formed his
                        resolve that he set about putting its accomplishments into execution. He
                        rose from his bed, put on his clothes and went the house of Deacon B. After
                        some little time he succeeded in arousing his neighbor. Deacon B. put his
                        head out of the window when Deacon A. said to him: "My dear old friend why
                        should we be at enmity; I cannot rest till all is as it used to be." This
                        appeal at once softened the heart of Deacon B., who hastened to dress
                        himself and admit his brother in the church into his house.</p>
                    <p>No sooner had the old men met and shaken hands than Deacon A. commenced
                        relating all about his own uneasiness of mind while tossing about upon a
                        sleepless couch, and determination to be good friends with his life-long
                        neighbor at all risks and at all hazards ending by saying: "Dear brother B.
                        do not be so obstinate, only say the chameleon was red, as you know it was, and the trouble will all be over."</p>
                    <p>Thus it is with the Spirit; it counsels harmony
                        and peace--only it undertakes to dictate terms. It says to the Douglasites
                        we ought to be friends, and if you go for the Cresson ticket (which is an
                        anti-Douglas arrangement,) all will be well, and we will be good friends
                        again. But at the same time it lets loose its billingsgate upon the best men
                        in the ranks of Locofocoism in this place. This is, really a strange style
                        of harmony.</p>

<b>"Disreputable"</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticism for Locofoco Senators of Southern states that are quoted as
                    belittling, criminalizing poor white people; the Repository editors also defend
                    the publishment of a Republican paper.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It seems natural for aristocratic Locofocos to hate poor white men; their
                        love for "Sambo" being so great that it overrides all their sympathies for
                        the poor and unfortunate of their own race, causing them to look down upon
                        honest industry, if white men are engaged therein, and are benefitted
                        thereby.</p>
                    <p>A Locofoco United States Senator--WIGFALL, of Texas--impudently, and without
                        rebuke from his brother Locofoco Senators, dared to call poor white men
                        "criminals," for being poor.</p>
                    <p>Another of the same stripe of Politicians--Senator HAMMOND, of South
                        Carolina,--called Northern working men "mud sills," and no Northern Locofoco
                        Senator called him to order; nor does any one of their papers rebuke him.</p>
                    <p>Senator GREEN, of Missouri, another leader of that party, says of a poor
                        white man that he is nothing but one of the "lazaroni."</p>
                    <p>One of the Locofoco candidates for Vice President, HERSHEL V. JOHNSON, said
                        that the "normal condition of poor men without regard to
                            color, is Slavery." "That capital should own, rather
                        than hire, its labor."</p>
                    <p>DELUSION SMITH, late Locofoco Senator from Oregon, a colleague of the other
                        Locofoco candidate for Vice President, in a recent speech in Oregon City,
                        said:</p>
                    <p>"I WOULD RATHER BE A DECENT MAN'S NIGGER AT THE SOUTH, THAN A POOR WHITE
                        LABORER AT THE NORTH."</p>
                    <p>And, last and least, we have the Editor of the
                        Douglas Journal of this place, The Times, (The
                            Spirit calls it by the significant name of
                        "The Shetter Weed") calling the occupation of publishing a Republican
                        newspaper "disreputable:" and, doubtless, it
                        expects a large portion of its patronage to come from Republicans.</p>
                    <p>What is it that makes the publishing of a Republican paper "disreputable?" Is
                        it because white men are engaged in all such enterprises? It is a part of
                        the general system of denouncing labor, and those
                        whose hands are accustomed to toil, which Locofoco orators so glibly sneer
                        at, which causes these kid-glove gentlemen to turn up their noses at honest
                        mechanical industry? or, is it because Republican
                            newspapers, which, after all, seems to be the "disreputable" business, urged the passage of a Homestead Bill,
                        which provides Free Homes for poor white men; that they advocate the passage
                        of a Tariff, that protects the labor of free whites in America against
                        ruinous competition in other lands; that they are in favor of keeping
                        negroes out of our smiling Territories, and filing them up with industrious,
                        poor whites; that they are doing all in their power to carry out the objects
                        of the framers of our Government, that these haters of Republicanism,
                        (which, in plain English, means haters of a Republican form of government)
                        and advocates of aristocracy all agree in decrying every kind of labor but
                        that done by slaves?</p>

                    <p>On Saturday last a portion of this spirited company of Republicans received
                        their uniforms, consisting of a black glazed cap and cape, and a neat,
                        convenient torch--a swinging lamp, on a pole about six feet long.</p>
                    <p>The Association met at the Hotel of Mr. P. Harlacher, on West Market street,
                        and held an election for officers to fill the unfilled offices, which
                        resulted in the election of Capt. P. B. Housum, as Captain; H. C. Fortescue
                        as First Lieutenant, G. H. Merklein as Second Lieutenant, K. Shannon Taylor
                        as Third Lieutenant, and Dr. Jacob S. H. R. Maurer as Fourth Lieutenant.</p>
                    <p>After the election, the Association formed in procession, under the command
                        of the newly elected officers, and preceded by the Band, marched through the
                        principal streets of the town--those in uniform making quite an attractive
                        display. We expect to be able to turn out about an hundred in uniform on
                        Monday evening next, on the occasion of the meeting to listen to the speech
                        of Morton M'Michael, Esq., of Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>The Association met again, at the Hotel of Mr. John Riley, also on West
                        Market street, on Monday evening of this week. One of the Vice Presidents,
                        Mr. Jacob N. Snider, having been elected, at a former meeting, one of the
                        Executive Committee, resigned his post of Vice President. An election was
                        immediately entered into, which resulted in the unanimous election of Mr.
                        John G. A. Dennerline as a Vice President of the Association. The
                        Association then adjourned to meet at the call of the Executive
