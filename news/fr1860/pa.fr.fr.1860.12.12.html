<b>The President's Message</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>President Buchanan discusses the various reasons that, combined together,
                    are the impetus for secession. He blames the North for its continuous
                    aggressions against the South's right to slavery, he denies that the recent
                    Presidential election is a valid excuse (though perhaps Lincoln's history of
                    anti-slavery actions does), and he points out that while the Constitution has no
                    provision for Secession, it also has no provision for the President or Congress
                    to coerce a state into submission. He discusses the status of Foreign relations,
                    the peaceful 'resolutions' of problems in Kansas and Utah, and he justifies the
                    expenditures of his administration. He also asks, due to the present state of
                    the Treasury, that Congress to rework the Tariff.<br>
