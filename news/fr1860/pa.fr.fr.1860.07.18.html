<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It must be gratifying, says the New York Tribune,
                        to the conservative to perceive that though divided and excited with regard
                        to practical measures, the American People are heartily agreed to abstract,
                        underlying principle of Equal Rights in the Federal Territories, organized
                        or unorganized. Republicans, Douglas Democrats, Beckinridge Democrats, alike
                        affirm and insist on this principle as the true solution of our great
                        controversy--they differ only but widely as to the true exposition and
                        application of that principle--as follows:</p>
                    <p>I. The Republicans affirm and maintain the natural, inalienable, equal right
                        of every rational adult human being now or hereafter residing in the
                        Territories to the full possession, disposition, and enjoyment of his own
                        faculties, energies, and capabilities, with the full and fair product
                        resulting from their employment. An individual may indeed forfeit this right
                        by crime, or by insisting on the employment of his powers in some manner
                        inconsistent with the public weal; but his right to use his own God-given
                        powers for his own benefit and that of those dependent on and dear to him is
                        natural, primary intrinsic, self-evident and only to be vitiated or
                        suspended by some culpable and malevolent action on his part whereby the
                        public weal is assailed or endangered. Such is the Republican conception of
                        "Equal Rights" in the "Territories."</p>
                    <p>II. The Douglas Democratic idea is that of the Equal
                            Right of Slavery with Free Labor in any and every Territory. This
                        idea denies that Slavery is a natural or moral wrong--denies that Man has a
                        natural moral right to the direction of his own energies, the products of
                        his own industry, and maintains that the ownership of his own limbs and
                        faculties by the laborer or by a master is a question of political economy
                        and social expediency to be determined by considerations of climate, soil,
                        products, &amp;c. In a temperate mainly Graingrowing region, Douglasism
                        intimates that Slavery will not usually be found profitable, therefore will
                        not be established or not be maintained; while in a tropical or
                        semi-tropical Cotton, Rice and sugar-growing district, enslaved negro labor
                        will usually be found most profitable, if not indispensable; therefore will
                        be prefered [sic]. But, in any and every case, the People--that is, the
                        resident white male adults--must of right decide to have or not to have
                        Slavery, and the votes of a majority of their number must determine the
                        issue. If a Territory, when it comes to form a State Constitution, shall
                        have five thousand male adults, of whom four thousand are negroes and but
                        one thousand whites, and the whites along are to have a voice in determining
                        the future condition of Labor in that community; and if five hundred and
                        fifty of these vote to have Slavery to four hundred and fifty against it,
                        the votes of these five hundred and fifty overbear those of the four hundred
                        and fifty opposed, with the unexpected but notorious choice of the four
                        thousand Blacks, making that a Slave State. And this according to Mr.
                        Douglas, is "Popular Sovereignty."</p>
                    <p>So much is clear; but when we ask Mr. Douglas and his supporters, "What shall
                        be the status of a Territory with regard to
                        Slavery prior to such decision of the question by
                        its people?" the answer elicited is vague or equivocal. At first the Douglas
                        canvassers maintained with us that there can be no legal
                            Slavery in any country or district until it has been established or
                            authorized there by some positive law--hence that every man
                        residing in a Territory must own himself until some valid law of that
                        Territory or of Congress shall have constituted him the property of another.
                        Under the view, it was stoutly and not unplausibly argued that the
                        Kansas-Nebraska bill was an Anti-Slavery measure at least, not a Pro-Slavery
                        one. But Mr. Douglas and his disciples have been gradually driven from this
                        ground, and now say that the status of the negro
                        in any Territory is a question to be settled by the Federal Courts
                        ultimately by the United States Supreme Court. In other words, the mainly
                        slaveholding Judges who made the Dred Scott Decision are to decide all
                        questions respecting Slavery in the Territories. How they will decide this
                        one, we need go no further than to the Dred Scott case to learn. Practically
                        therefore, though indirectly and ambiguously, Mr. Douglas's platform
                        cencedes [sic] the Territories en masse to
                        Slavery.</p>
                    <p>III. Mr. Breckinridge's creed attains the same end by a far simpler and
                        directer method. His doctrine affirms the Equal Rights
                            of the States and their citizens in the Territories- -that is,
                        the equal right of any and every slaveholder to migrate thither with his
                        human chattels and demand of the Federal and local authorities to protect
                        him in their use and enjoyment with that of any Northern citizen to remove
                        thither with his horses, oxen, hogs, plows, and wagon, and demand protection
                        in their use and enjoyment. Mr. Breckinridge wants no special law for the
                        protection of property in slaves; but he demands protection for that
                        property under the general laws for the protection of property in slaves;
                        but he demands protection for that property under the general laws which
                        secure to every man his own and, if the Territorial authorities should
                        neglect or refuse to afford this, he looks to the Federal Government to
                        supply the deficiency.</p>
                    <p>--Such, according to our understanding of the manifestoes of the rival
                        parties and candidates, are their relative positions; and they seem to us to
                        preclude the idea of coalition electoral tickets supported by any two of
                        them. The Breckinridge and Douglas parties are as clearly if not as widely
                        antagonist as the Douglas and Lincoln; and the triumph of either is the
                        defeat of both the others. Ultimately, the Douglas position must be
                        abandoned for that of one of the other parties as our "Softs" have receded
                        from the position so stoutly maintained by them in 1848 to the present
                        Douglas platform. Their leading organs--The Albany
                            Atlas, for example--were just as positive then that they would
                        never surrender their "corner-stone" platform as they now are that they will
                        never take their next plunge into the abyss of Slavery Protection. Their
                        present half way house, however will not outlast the pending struggle; and,
                        long prior to 1864 we shall see them stoutly maintaining the doctrine how
                        enunciated by Breckinridge as Simon Pure, unadulterated, anti-sectional
                        Democracy.</p>

                    <p>In endeavoring to take the census for the government, the marshals
                        occasionally meet with such difficulties as well nigh to deprive them of
                        their own senses. The following took place in Canal street New Orleans:</p>
                    <p>"Who is the head of this family?"</p>
                    <p>"That depends on circumstances. If before 11 o'clock, its me husband--if
                        after 11 its meself."</p>
                    <p>"How so?"</p>
                    <p>"Because after 11 he's as drunk as a piper, and unable to take care of
                        himself, let alone the family."</p>

                    <p>"Och thin he ailin entirely. He has rheumaties worse than owld Donnelly, who

                    <p>"Divil a man more miserable. He said if I did not give him a promise within

                    <p>"What was he at the time your of marriage, a widower or batchelor?"</p>
                    <p>"A which? A widower, did you say? Ah now go wid your nonsense. Isn't the

<b>The Necessary Consequence</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Democrats' repeal of the Tariff of 1842, which they originally
                    supported, has greatly harmed the industry and the people of the North.
                    Buchanan's veto of the Homestead Act prevents poor whites from making their own
                    living out in the territories. This article argues that the purpose of these
                    Democrats' actions is to supplant free white labor with slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Costly Effort</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The observation that the repeal of the Missouri Act cost the Democratic
                    Party more than money in bribes; it also lost the support of people who could no
                    longer belong to a party preferring slavery to free labor.<br>

<b>Financiering</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When Buchanan's administration began, the treasury had twenty million
                    dollars, and three years later it is in debt nearly seventy million. The
                    secretary of Treasury, Howell Cobb made a mistake when he rejected the idea of
                    increasing duty rates. Along with the general population, the Democrats' Free
                    trade policy has also damaged the banking industry--who are victims of the
                    business crisis of 1857, not the cause.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mention of the change in command at the Valley Spirit newspaper, and that
                    the new editor, Mr. Ripper, who replace John M. Cooper, has a group of

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the withdrawal of Mr. John M. Cooper from the editorship of the Valley Spirit, that paper has been under the
                        management of the softest set of fledglings that ever undertook to conduct
                        the editorial columns of a political or literary journal. It is amusing to
                        see brother Ripper spread his wings over his brood of young bantlings--it
                        is, perhaps, well to say that the old rooster takes the bantums in charge
                        because their mothers do not know they are out--and, as each one attempts to
                        crow, to see how he patronizes their every effort is certainly refreshing.
                        He cocks his head approvingly to one side as each smart sound proceeds from the tender brood, and, catching upon the
                        discordant notes, he runs around the political walk, with head erect, wings
                        spread, eyes sparkling and gets the approbation of the
                        knowing-ones--remarking the while "pretty good considering, ain't it, hey?" If these boys keep on crowing and
                        strutting they will be able--after a great while--to creep out from under
                        brother Ripper's wings and let the world see who they
                            are. Their wisdom is now astonishing--themselves.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This excellent institution for young ladies, situated in this place, under
                        the management of the Rev. Henry Reeves, Principal, is one of the best
                        conducted and, deservedly, popular schools in the country. The great care
                        taken of the young ladies placed in this establishment, mentally, morally,
                        and religeously [sic], gives it high character with parents and guardians
                        having daughters and wards to educate. A girl is as safe in Rosedale
                        Seminary as she could possibly be in all the time in the immediate presence
                        of her own parents.</p>
                    <p>The exercises connected with the recent examination of the pupils were highly
                        creditable to all who were interested in teaching the girls placed in the
                        Seminary--the Rev. Mr. Reeves and his able, accomplished assistants. The
                        character of the examination satisfied all present that the scholars fully
                        understood the various branches they have studied--a very important
                        consideration; for far too frequently examinations do not show the actual
                        proficiancy [sic] of the pupils.</p>
                    <p>The spacious Hall was crowded on Wednesday evening by an intelligent,
                        appreciating audience, who came together to witness the performances of the
                        graduating class. The young ladies composing this class acquitted themselves
                        so nobly that we are almost afraid to trust ourselves at noticing them. If
                        we were to utter all we think, they would, if such things could effect them,
                        become the vainest creatures in the world. They deserve all, and more than
                        we can say for them:</p>
                    <p>However much praise we feel like bestowing upon the bevy of beauties who
                        there took their leave of school-girl days and crossed the threshold of
                        womanhood, there is much credit due to their Preceptors, the Rev. Mr. Reeves
                        and his assistants, for the ceaseless toil, constant application and
                        watchfulness necessary for the work, and which was freely given, to enable
                        them to succeed in development the latent genius which was so gracefully
                        exhibited to the admiring gaze of those who were so fortunate as to gain
                        admission into the over-flowing audience chamber of Franklin Hall.</p>
                    <p>We give below the names of the young ladies who graduates where they reside
                        and, and the subject of their several compositions--all of which were read
                        in very sweet, winning voices by their fair authors:</p>
                    <p>SALUTARY, "Pearl Divers"--By Miss Mary E. Depue,
                        of Belvidere, New Jersey.</p>

                        B. Emmit, of Fayetteville, Pa.</p>
                    <p>"The Record of Memory Imperishable"--By Miss Mary
                        E. Kell, of Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
                    <p>"Progress"--By Miss Mattie E. Walker, of
                        Mercersburg, Pa.</p>
                    <p>VALEDICTORY, "The Rubicons in Life"--By Miss Eliza
                        Tolbert, of Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
                    <p>The modest manner in which these pretty girls discharged the duty assigned
                        them showed that, although their efforts were of a high order, they will
                        never quit their own sphere to contest with the sterner sex their right to
                        occupy positions in the pulpit or the forum-- women's rights will never
                        carry these fair ones, however talented, or eloquent, into the arena of
                        political discussions or theological disquisitions. They are all too
                        sensible, their education has been too practical and useful, for that.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday evening the Hall was crowded with the elite of the town to listen
                        to the closing exercises, the Musical Soiree. The programme for this
                        evening's entertainment embraced the performance of some very excellent
                        pieces of music; the audience pronounced the exhibition fully up to the
                        bills--the highest praise the Music class (who, with their teacher,
                        performed) could possibly expect. Entire satisfaction marked every face. All
                        were delighted.</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg does, and justly, appreciate the efforts of Mr. Reeves in
                        building up a first class female Seminary here. The school is well sustained
                        by our citizens, and many from abroad are sending the young ladies in their
                        charge to this excellent institution of learning.</p>
                    <p>The next Session will commence on Wednesday, the 12th of September, 1860. All
                        who desire to have their daughters enjoy the benefits of this good school
                        will do well to make application in time. The location is fronting upon Main
                        street, but the building is distant therefrom some eighty yards, all of
                        which intervening space is full of shade trees, flower-beds and pretty
                        walks, affording the most delightful promenades, where the young ladies are
                        permitted to take exercise--in company with their lady-teachers, and are
                        never disturbed by intruders. Taken altogether there is no more healthy,
                        romantic or desirable situation to be found than Rosedale Seminary.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing was prepared for an earlier edition of our paper, but, with
                        several other articles, was unavoidably crowded out.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We suppose our country never produced a heavier wheat crop than that just
                        harvested; and, as a general thing, it is of superior quality, gathered in
                        the very best condition. We are sorry that the produce of this year will not
                        be embraced in the returns of the Census takers, we are confident it would
                        place Franklin nearer the top of the pile as a wheat-producing county, than
                        she now occupies, although her present position is a proud one. According to
                        the Census of 1850, there was but six Counties in the United States that
                        produced more Wheat than our own county of Franklin. The following are the
                        Counties that surpassed ours, and the number of bushels each produced:</p>
                    <p>Monroe county, N.Y. 1,1441,653 bush.</p>
                    <p>Livingston co., N.Y. 1,111,986 bush.</p>
                    <p>Ontario co., N.Y. 929,342 bush.</p>
                    <p>Niagara co., N.Y. 917,739 bush.</p>
                    <p>Orleans co., N.Y. 854,676 bush.</p>
                    <p>Lancaster co., Pa. 1,365,111 bush.</p>
                    <p>Franklin co., Pa. 937,062 bush.</p>
                    <p>Washington county, Md., comes next to Franklin, she having produced,
                        according to the same returns, 809,093 bushes. This we presume is owing to
                        her position--her contiguity to free soil and good company.</p>
                    <p>If it could be ascertained, it would be found that the Wheat crop of
                        Franklin, the present harvest, would fall very little, if any, short of
                        875,000 bushels.</p>
                    <p>Our Hay crop was also excellent and secured in good condition.</p>
                    <p>A better crop of Oats was never gathered in the county than that which is now
                        clearly ready for harvesting.</p>
                    <p>The Corn, so far, bids fair. It is too early, however, to say anything about
                        it. If a drought does not prevail--if the season should prove
                        propitious--according to present appearance, and judging from the breadth
                        planted, the Corn crop will be large.</p>
                    <p>The Potatoes, so far, are also turning out well in every locality. The early
                        Potatoes that are brought to market are of good quality, and the yield, we
                        understand, is abundant. The trust the later varieties will turn out equally
                        good.</p>

                        domestic comforts and conveniences that would result therefrom, as well as
                        the great security to property from fire, that would thus be attained, would
                        more than counterbalance the evils of an increased taxation. Property would
                        not only be more secure from fire, but it would be enhanced in value.</p>
                    <p>If the present movement should result, however, in the accomplishment of the
                        project, contrary to our expectation, we would remark, that the cheapest
                        Water Works they can construct would prove to be the most costly in the end.
                        They should be constructed so as to obviate the use of machinery or a costly
                        superintendance. If water can be procured from the Mountain Springs
                        heretofore spoken of, it would be the most costly, but it would be self-
                        supplying, consequently cheeper [sic] in the end--and then Chambersburg
                        could boast of having the best water in the country.</p>
                    <p>Water Works</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to public notice, a meeting of the citizens of the Borough of
                        Chambersburg, convened in the Court House, on the evening of the 12th ins.,
                        for the purpose of adopting measures to ascertain the probable cost of
                        erecting Water Works for the use of said borough.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Col. F. S. Stumbaugh, WM. HEYSER, Sr., Esq., was called to the
                        Chair, and on motion of Hon. Wilson Reilly, J. W. FLETCHER was chosen
                        Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The object of the meeting have been stated by the chair, the following
                        resolutions, offered by Col. F. S. Stumbaugh, were adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting, it
                        is indispensably necessary that the Borough of Chambersburg have Water Works
                        erected to supply the same with water sufficient for all purposes.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting, the
                        works should be erected by the Borough Authorities.</p>
                    <p>The following resolution, offered by the Hon. Wilson Reilly, was also
                        adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the Burgess and Town Council of the
                        Borough of Chambersburg, be requested to have made an estimate of the
                        probable cost of erecting Water Works for the use of said Borough; and that
                        as soon as said estimate is prepared, it be submitted to a meeting of the
                        citizens, to be convened at the Court House, on notice given by the Chairman
                        of this meeting, to take such action thereon as they may deem proper.</p>
                    <p>WM. HEYSER, Pres't.</p>
                    <p>J. W. FLETCHER, Sec'y.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The history of the famous fight, now going on in the ranks of the Democracy,
                        says the Harrisburg Telegraph, will serve to show
                        that on the part of the leaders of both wings there is little, if any
                        difference in principle, and that whatever does exist between them, could
                        easily be compromised, were it not for the personal dispute. One interest has invested largely in Mr. Douglas;
                        another was as deeply interested in his defeat. A bull and bear controversy
                        was the result--one side taking popular sovereignty as its watchword, and
                        the other certain inferences of their own, drawn from the Dred Scott
                        decision. The masses of their supporters are doubtless more sincere; but
                        this very earnestness is an additional barrier in the way of reconciliation.
                        At the late Baltimore Convention a resolution was adopted by the Douglas
                        delegates, pledging adherence to all decisions made by the Supreme Court on
                        the subject of slavery in the territories. Why they should have singled out
                        that solitary application of the judicial exercise is a mystery. Why confine
                        their loyalty to forthcoming decisions, to the single question of slave? Why
                        not pledge themselves in advance to every doctrine enunciated by Judge Taney
                        and his associates? Mr. Douglas hastens to declare his acquiescence in this
                        resolution, calling special attention to it. Is it not then still more
                        evident that he is ready to abandon his independent course of 1858, as soon
                        as it becomes expedient so to do? At the same time the succeeders who
                        nominated Messrs. Breckinridge and Lane, appear to have forgotten their
                        disunion doctrines so openly avowed six months ago. They now represent
                        themselves as the most loyal men to the Union and the Constitution. Only in
                        case of "a certain contingency" (i.e., not having everything their own way,)
                        would they consent to a destruction of the one or the other. The two
                        divisions would thus appear to be almost a unit in point of docrine [sic],
                        and about as much alike as their respective conventions were termed by a
                        Baltimore paper, one being the "Democratic National" Convention. When the
                        secret history of this feud shall have been written, it will be seen that it
                        originated altogether on personal grounds and that the special demonstration
                        for popular sovereignty, made in 1857 and 1858, was nothing but a spider's
                        web for catching silly voters.</p>
