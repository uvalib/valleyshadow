<b>Hon. A. K. McClure And The United States Senatorship</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter to the editors from 'A Working Man,' suggesting that A. K. McClure
                    is the suitable successor to Hon. Beef Bigler, whose term expires March 4th,
                    1861.<br>(Names in announcement:  Alexander K. McClure)</blockquote>
<b>Speech Hon. Thaddeus Stevens</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Stevens begins his speech with the argument that tariffs are the normal,
                    intelligent means of protection for a country's (especially a young one's)
                    economy. He examines the four Presidential candidates' records on support for a
                    tariff--that Douglas and Breckinridge are against it, and that Bell is such a
                    good man and an enemy of Democrats and so he should join forces with the
                    Republicans. Stevens then discusses the slave issue, Douglas' stance on it,and
                    Judge Taney's misinterpretation of the Constitution.<br>

                    who want to spread slavery into all parts of the country; and the Republicans
                    who want to protect the South's institution of slavery, but prevent it from

<b>Sound And Fury</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An argument that the disunionists of the South are actually few in number,

<b>The War Of The Bills</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A battle between the editors (both named 'Bill') of two opposing Democratic
                    newspapers, in which 'Gimlet-Bill,' the editor of the Spirit, apparently won,
                    and 'Bunty Bill' has cast his support to Douglas.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some months since, a company of Chambersburg Douglas men purchased the
                        good-will and fixtures of a printing office in this place and started a
                        paper advocating the exclusive claims of the "little giant" for the
                        Presidency. Is Editor, Bunty Bill, pulled off his coat, rolled up his sleves
                        [sic] and pitched fiercely into Gimlet-nose Bill, the puke that scribbles
                        for the Spirit, the other organ of the Nigger
                        Democracy of this County. The puke returned blow for blow; the war grew
                        fierce; the puke became braver and more defiant as the battle progressed;
                        Bunty Bill, at first so courageous, soon began to show the white feather;
                        Gimlet- nose Bill discovered his advantage and gave the challanger [sic]
                        several home-thrusts, which, together with the fizzling of its
                            leaders--the bold, brave, straight-out Douglas
                        men-- who assembled, in Philadelphia, a few days since, caused Bunty
                        Bill to strike his colors, and this week we are to have him supporting the
                        same electoral ticket which his foe has all the time advocated, and next
                        week we may expect to see him on his back begging for quarter from the puke,
                        whom he at first affected to despise. He who fights and runs away, may live
                        to fight some other day--a great while after the first fight, however.</p>
                    <p>How will Gimlet-nose Bill act toward his fallen foe, Bunty Bill, now that the
                        latter has surrendered? Will he permit him to return to the fold of the
                        faithful? Will he allow him to be placed among the notables, who figure in
                        capitals, in the Spirit, as supporters of
                        Breckinridge and Lane? Or, as a punishment for joining those who dared to
                        have an opinion of their own, when Southern dictators willed otherwise, will
                        he and they be kept out in the cold when Breckinridge
                            becomes President. We trust that peace and harmony may be
                        restored between these two bloody belligerents before
                            the inauguration of Breckinridge. Bunty Bill admits, virtually,
                        that Douglas has no chance, and, since Foster carried Pennsylvania, so
                        gallantly, he too must be calculating upon the election of Breckinridge,
                        else why support men on his electoral ticket who say: "That under no
                        circumstances will they vote for Douglas?"</p>
                    <p>The battle between the Bills, though fierce, was short. Douglas spent all his
                        money, many thousands dollars, carrying his election to the Senate, in
                        1858--which was accomplished, in defiance of the popular will, by the manner
                        in which the State of Illinois is distracted--and the friends of
                        Breckinridge and Lane hold the offices, and wield the patronage of the
                        Government, and as the Nigger Democracy are very fond of "spondulics," and
                        have none of their own, the Douglas boys are trying to get hold of the
                        government udder; but Gimlet-nose Bill will make Bunty Bill suck the hind
                        teat. Nevertheless Gimlet-nose Bill had better keep a sharp look out; for
                        old Mr. Buchanan, the present, and the last locofoco, dispenser of Federal
                        bounty, is proverbial for rewarding his enemies and neglecting those who
                        were his warmest friends.</p>
                    <p>If there is any private understanding between you, boys, keep it to
                        yourselves; for "Andy can't keep a secret." There
                        is no use fighting any longer. The deed is done. The fiat has gone forth.
                        The hand-writing is on the wall. Your corrupt party is doomed to
                        destruction--even "Rankin's prayers" cannot save it.</p>
