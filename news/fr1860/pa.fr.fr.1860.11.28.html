<blockquote>
<b>Pennsylvania And The South</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors discuss one of the South's pretexts for secession--
                    nullification of the fugitive slave law, and they point out that Ohio is the
                    only border state that stands guilty of passing liberty laws that nullify the
                    F.S. law. The editors emphasis the unreasonable expectation of Southerners
                    (while in Pennsylvania) to be exempt from Pennsylvania's laws pertaining to
                    slavery when Pa.'s own citizens are required to comply.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Important From Springfield, Ill.</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Description of a celebration of the Republican victory, and a speech by
                    Senator Trumball, in which he argues that the disunionists were just looking for
                    some pretence for breaking up the Union, that they urge quick action before
                    anyone comes to his senses.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Southern Secession Movement</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Articles from three separate Southern papers--Fredericksburg (Va.)
                    Recorder, Charlottesville (Va.) Review, and the Memphis Enquirer--all urging
                    Southern states to stay in the Union for different reasons--a Democrat Congress,
                    a simple demand for peace, and the question of whether secession could last any
                    length of time.<br>

<blockquote>
<b>The Future Of The North And South</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors suggest that one reason for the disunionists' cry of 'now or
                    never' stems from the present Census' results which will probably reduce the
                    number of electoral votes of Southern states, and increase the number in
                    Northern states and territories-soon-to-be-states.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Declaration Of Independence</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A humorous imitation of the declaration sent by South Carolina to the
                    President. The imitation is done by Luzerne County of Pennsylvania, giving its
                    reasons for why it wants to separate from the rest of the state.<br>

<b>To The Republicans Of Maryland</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An exhortation from Republican Electoral candidates of Maryland to their
                    fellow Republicans in Maryland to stick to the ideals of the Republican party,
                    and to choose to stay part of Lincoln's Union.<br>

<blockquote>
<b>Cupidity</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to the South's accusation that the North is responsible in part
                    for the existence of slavery in the South. The editors argue that slavery no
                    longer exists in most Northern states, not due to Federal Gov't interference,
                    but because each state decided to outlaw it.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Congress</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A reminder to Congress that in their last session they should not waste
                    time on discussing secession, but instead to work on issues such as the building
                    of the Railroad, admission of Kansas, and revision of the Tariff.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Mr. Secretary Cobb Not So Bad Once As He Now Is</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reference to a speech by Secretary Cobb (presently a disunionist) in 1851,
                    in which he argued that any state that seceded would soon return to the Union
                    when it found how difficult existence outside of the Union was.<br>
