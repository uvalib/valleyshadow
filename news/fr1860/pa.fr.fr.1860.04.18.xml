                <excerpt>"Yet when these false-hearted sycophants are put to the test, we find all
                    their professions of friendship for the adopted citizens as hollow and insincere
                    as are the professions of that mongrel party with regard to a Tariff, and every
                    other important measure presented to the people."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The adopted citizens have heretofore been led to believe that their only
                        friends, the people who were willing to grant them the largest privileges,
                        were to be found in the ranks of the so- called democratic party. The
                        naturalized voters have been persuaded into the belief that no other than
                        the Locofoco party could save them from being deprived of their acquired
                        rights. They have been told, and they have believed the story, that the
                        American party was based upon principles so hostile to all <emph
                            rend="italic">foreigners</emph>--meaning, thereby, all adopted
                        citizens--that if that party were to be successful at any election, every
                        right, civil, religious and political, would be taken from their naturalized
                        voters--their disfranchisement would most certainly follow the consummation
                        of so dire an event</p>
                    <p>From the amount of holy horror which the locofoco party has been in the habit
                        of manifesting at the thought of the success of a pure, unadulterated Know
                        Nothing candidate for a high office, we have been justified in supposing
                        that no locofoco would ever vote for a <emph rend="italic">"Nix
                        Wisser"</emph> for any post of honor, profit or trust--who was regularly
                        nominated as such. Yet when these false-hearted sycophants are put to the
                        test, we find all their professions of friendship for the adopted citizens
                        as hollow and insincere as are the professions of that mongrel party with
                        regard to a Tariff, and every other important measure presented to the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday last, the bill for the admission of Kansas into the Union, as a
                        State, passed the lower House of Congress by an overwhelming vote. It then
                        went to the Senate--a locofoco body--where it is likely to receive its
                        death-blow, <emph rend="italic">because the Southern Locofocos</emph> (who
                        now constitute the chief power of that party,) <emph rend="italic">object to
                            the clause allowing</emph> FOREIGNERS TO VOTE.</p>
                    <p>In the recent contest in Rhode Island, the Know Nothing party nominated a
                        ticket, from Governor down, and the Locofocos met in State Convention, a
                        short time thereafter, and <emph rend="italic">adopted the Know Nothing
                            ticket.</emph> They then dispersed and their whole party went to work
                        for the "Nix Wisser" ticket with as much zeal as they could have exhibited
                        toward one of their own forming. The consequence was that the Know Nothing
                        candidate, (MR. SPRAGUE,) was elected, and all the Locofoco papers in the
                        land--including the <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit,</emph> of
                        Chambersburg--are loud in their exultations at the result. The <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> is so much rejoiced at the success of Know
                        Nothings that they have a large picture in their paper at the end of the
                        article announcing the victory of the American ticket. We want the adopted
                        citizens to look at that picture and remember the cause which prompts the
                            <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> to hoist it over the Rhode Island
                        election returns--<emph rend="italic">the triumph of the "Nix
                        Wissers."</emph></p>

                <summary>Editorial views Democratic support of Know Nothing candidate in Rhode
                    Island as evidence that the party's leadership and direction is firmly in

                    is no longer representative of their concerns and by extension that the
                    Republican Party is more responsive to them.</summary>

                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt>"This Homestead bill has every principle of sound public policy to
                    recommend it, but it has fallen under the ban of democratic nullifiers and
                    disunionists, and that is sufficient to condemn it unheard in court circles."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>There is no prospect that the Homestead Bill of the House, which gives 160
                        acres to every settler, can be carried. That of the Senate, which confines
                        the grants of 160 acres to heads of families and citizens, will pass the
                        Senate mainly by Northern votes, the two Senators from Tennessee being the
                        only democrats south of the line who will venture to approve what has been
                        deprecated as a "Republican scheme."--An intimation has been given from the
                        White House that a veto is ready to be applied to this measure upon the
                        ground that it will affect the revenues from the public lands. That reason
                        has about as much force and propriety as Mr. Polk's veto of the French
                        Spoilation bill, when Mr. Buchanan was his Secretary of State. There is some
                        consolation in knowing that in ten months more the country will be relieved
                        of a despotic rule, which threatens the veto whenever a popular right is to
                        be vindicated, as in the case of Kansas during the last Congress, or a
                        measure is proposed which most directly addresses the popular sympathies.
                        This Homestead bill has every principle of sound public policy to recommend
                        it, but it has fallen under the ban of democratic nullifiers and
                        disunionists, and that is sufficient to condemn it unheard in court
                    circles.</p>
