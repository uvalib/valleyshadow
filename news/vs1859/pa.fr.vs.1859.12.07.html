<b>Admiration for Old Brown</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Complains that Republican papers, including the Transcript, are giving
                    Brown favorable coverage, and don't understand that the entire incident is a
                    result of misguided Republican principles. The Spirit is especially upset by the
                    endorsements of Brown's "Speech from the Scaffold."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Republican journals in this State, and many of them elsewhere, pretend
                        not to approve of old Brown's armed invasion of Virginia for the purpose of
                        murdering slaveholders and liberating their slaves. The Transcript of the 23d ult. had the modesty to say that "the
                        worst enemies the South now has in this country--not even excepting the
                        handful of abolitionists scattered over the land--are those self-styled
                        Democratic papers and office hunting patriots who are endeavoring to create
                        an impression that the recent rebellion at Harper's Ferry is a result of
                        Republican doctrine on the question of slavery, and that the scheme was
                        aided and abetted by republican leaders." The proof is too strong to admit
                        of contradiction, that Republican leaders contributed to Brown's Harper's
                        Ferry enterprise, as they had before contributed to keep him at his bloody
                        work in Kansas. And since his arrest and conviction, not only has the bloody
                        murderer been soothed by individual expression of sympathy and regard, but
                        in New England public meetings, presided over by very prominent Republicans,
                        have endorsed the murderer's conduct and taken measures to provide for his
                        family as a special mark of their admiration for the man. At one of these
                        meetings, held in the city of Boston and presided over by the author of the
                        resolution adopted by the late Republican State Convention of Massachusetts,
                        the shocking declaration was made by one of the speakers, that the hanging
                        of Brown "would make the gallows as glorious as the
                            cross." Thus it will be seen that in the very heart of New
                        England, the stronghold of Republicanism, a Republican speaker, addressing a
                        Republican meeting, put JOHN BROWN the murderer on a level with JESUS CHRIST
                        the Saviour of mankind.</p>
                    <p>But we need not go to Boston for evidence of Republican sympathy for the old
                        scoundrel who has just expiated his unparalleled crimes on the gallows. The
                            Transcript of the date we have already named
                        is brim-ful of admiration for BROWN. It has borrowed an editorial from the
                        New York Independent entitled "JOHN BROWN'S
                        Speech from the Scaffold," and printed it in the shape of original matter
                        under an editorial head on its first page. This article is full of insult to
                        Virginia, full of malice to the South, and full of admiration for the
                        condemned murderer. The Transcript has no fear
                        that "JOHN BROWN will make any concession or retraction," or "do anything
                        but vindicate the principle upon which he has acted, and condemn to the last
                        the system of slavery which he aimed to overthrow."--We presume he has died
                        just as the Transcript hoped he would die, and
                        just as the impenitent thief died. Criminals who reach BROWN'S degree of
                        guilt seldom confess their crimes on the scaffold. It will not surprise us
                        to hear that BROWN swung off with the lie on his lips that he told at his
                        trial, that while he meant to free slaves, he did not mean to murder their
                        master--a falsehood refuted by the murderous preparations he had made.</p>
                    <p>Such is the Transcript's admiration for BROWN,
                        that it endorses his "Speech from the Scaffold" without waiting to see what
                        he says. Cordially approving what he has done in the way of robbery and
                        murder, it is willing to take his dying speech upon trust--to endorse it
                        before its delivery. It says--"The speech he will utter
                            from the scaffold will become historical--taking rank with those dying
                            words of patriots, heroes and martyrs, which have become the watchwords
                            of after-generations in the great conflicts and triumphs of freedom and
                            truth."  And for fear the "cowardice" of the people of Virginia
                        might lead them not to "suffer BROWN to speak at all before the fatal noose
                        is tied," the Transcript advises him "to deposit
                        his last testimony in writing with some trusty friend who will see that it
                        reaches the public eye." It would hardly be so extremely anxious to secure
                        his dying speech as a "watchword for after-generations," if it did not
                        approve of the robberies, murders and treason he has committed.</p>
                    <p>It is possible the whole Republican party of Franklin county will recognize
                        as their organ a paper which thus openly expresses its approval of the
                        invasion of a neighboring State and the murder of peaceable citizens? Are
                        the Republicans of Franklin county in favor of extending an invitation to
                        another gang of scoundrels to come to Chambersburg with boxes of rifles and
                        pikes, and here organize and arrange for an attack on Harper's Ferry,
                        Hagerstown or some other point South of the Pennsylvania line? It is time
                        for peaceably-disposed and law-abiding Republicans-- and we presume there
                        are a few of this sort in our county--to reflect whether it is not their
                        solemn duty to abandon a party whose organ eulogizes as a "patriot, hero and
                        martyr," a scoundrel whose only claim to admiration is that he stole upon
                        their neighbors at the dead hour of mid-night and killed them without the
                        smallest provocation. If it is right for the people of Franklin county to
                        countenance assaults upon Hagerstown, it would also be right for the people
                        of Washington county to countenance assaults upon Chambersburg. All who do
                        not want to involve us in war with our neighbors across the line, must
                        assist to put down such crazy and malignant Republicanism as the Transcript has run into. The citizens of Franklin
                        county who will concur with the Transcript in
                        calling JOHN BROWN a "patriot, hero and martyr," because he went to Harper's
                        Ferry to steal slaves and murder their masters, would have nothing to
                        complain of if a band of Marylanders or Virginians were to come over here to
                        steal his horses and cattle--still less if the people of Washington county
                        were to seize and hold his team if he sent it to Hagerstown or Williamsport
                        with a load of flour or grain. If our people want it to come to this, let
                        them sustain the Transcript in pronouncing the
                        liar, thief, traitor and murderer BROWN a "patriot, hero and martyr."</p>

                    <p>We have no fault to find with the general course of remark indulged in by the
                        Richmond Enquirer in relation to the Harper's
                        Ferry murderers, but we do not like its reference to Pennsylvania in its
                        issue of the 25th instant. After stating what has been done (and very
                        properly done, in our opinion,) by Gov. Wise for the security of the
                        citizens of Virginia, the Enquirer asks--"What
                        have the Governors of Pennsylvania and Ohio done to protect a sister State
                        from the lawlessness of their own people?" We would like the Enquirer to tell us what act of lawlessness the
                        people of Pennsylvania have been guilty of. There was no citizen of our
                        State in the band of assassins that murdered peaceable citizens at Harper's
                        Ferry. It is true that some of the gang tarried in our town awhile, but they
                        were strangers whose character and business were unknown to our citizens,
                        and we are in no way responsible for their acts. If their designs had been
                        known here, the United States marines would never have had to take the
                        National Armory from them at Harper's Ferry. Chambersburg would have taken
                        care of them without the aid of the General Government.</p>
                    <p>As for the letters received by Gov. Wise from various places in Pennsylvania,
                        warning him of the formation of large parties for the purpose of rescuing
                        Brown and his fellow-murderers, they are not worth the Governors' attention
                        for a moment. Their writers are either knaves or fools. They are attempting
                        to impose upon Gov. Wise, or else they themselves have been imposed upon.
                        There is not one sane man in all this whole commonwealth whom any offer of
                        reward could induce to join a party to rescue Brown--not that there are not
                        enough of Black Republicans who would like to see Brown liberated, but
                        because there is not one who would risk his own neck in a foolhardy attempt
                        to save old Ossawatomie's.</p>
                    <p>Let Virginia proceed to string up Brown and all of his party who are now
                        under sentence of death. They ought to be strung up, and if they are not
                        rescued till citizens of Pennsylvania do it, the day of their rescue will be
                        too distant to do them much good in this world. It would be perfectly safe
                        to guarantee to Virginia ten thousand Pennsylvanian defenders to one
                        Pennsylvanian assailant on the day on which she will execute just vengeance
                        on the murderers of her citizens.</p>

<b>The Execution</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A description of John Brown's execution.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The prisoner was brought out of jail at 11 o'clock. Before leaving he bade
                        adieu to all his fellow prisoners, and was very affectionate to all except
                        Cook. He charged Cook with having deceived and misled him in relation to the
                        support he was to receive from the slaves. He was led to believe that they
                        were ripe for insurrection, and had found that his representations were
                        false. Cook denied the charge and made but little reply.</p>
                    <p>The prisoner then told the sheriff that he was ready. His arms were then
                        pinioned, and with a black slouch hat and the same clothes he wore during
                        the trial proceeded to the door apparently calm and cheerful. As he came
                        outside the companies of infantry and one troop with Gen. Taliaffero and the
                        entire staff were deploying in front of the jail, whilst an open wagon with
                        a pine box in which was a fine oak coffin was waiting for him. He looked
                        around and spoke to several persons he recognized, and walking down the step
                        was assisted to the wagon and took his seat on the coffin box along with the
                        jailor, Mr. Avis. He looked with interest on the fine military display, but
                        made no remarks. The wagon moved off flanked with two files of riflemen in
                        close order. On reaching the field, the military had already full
                        possession, pickets were stationed and the citizens kept back at the point
                        of the bayonet, from taking any position except that assigned them, nearly a
                        quarter of a mile from the scaffold. Through the determined persistence of
                        Dr. Rawlings, of Frank Leslie's, the order for
                        excluding the press was partially rescinded, and they were assigned a
                        position near the General's staff.</p>
                    <p>The prisoner walked up the steps firmly and was the first man on the gallows.
                        Messrs. [illegible] and Campbell stood by his side, and after shaking hands
                        and bidding an affectionate adieu, thanked them for their kindness, put the
                        cap over his face and the rope around his neck--Mr. Avis asked him to step
                        forward on the trap. He replied "You must lead me, I cannot see."</p>
                    <p>The rope was then adjusted and the military order given. The soldiers marched
                        and counter marched and took a position as if the enemy was in sight and
                        nearly ten minutes was thus occupied. The prisoner remained standing, and
                        Mr. Avis asked if he was not tired. Brown replied, "No--not tired, but don't
                        keep me waiting longer than is necessary."</p>
                    <p>He was swung off at 15 minutes after 11 o'clock. There was a slight grasping
                        of the hands and twitching of the muscles and then all was quiet. The body
                        was several times examined, and the pulse did not cease beating until after
                        35 minutes. It was then cut down and placed in the coffin and conveyed,

                        the Ferry by a special train at 4 o'clock. The whole arrangements [sic] were
                        carried out with precision and military strictness that was most annoying.</p>
                    <p>The general conviction everywhere entertained was that the excitement

                    <p>Charlestown, Dec. 2--The reporter of the Associated Press telegraphed,
                        yesterday, to Gov. Wise, for permission to attend the execution. The reply
                        was that the Governor declined to accede to the request. No facilities will
                        be extended to reporters.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday was passed quietly, with the exception of a great military bustle
                        on the reception of Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Brown was escorted over from Harper's
                        Ferry at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and the entire military force was
                        brought out to make a demonstration. She was received with full military
                        honors, but her companions were not allowed to accompany her from Harper's
                        Ferry.</p>
                    <p>After remaining four hours with her husband, Mrs. Brown was escorted back to
                        Harper's Ferry at 9 o'clock, last night, where she will await the reception
                        of her husband's body.</p>
                    <p>No one will be allowed to be near enough to the place of execution to hear
                        any remarks that may be made by Brown.</p>
                    <p>Harper's Ferry, Dec. 2--John Brown was hung at quarter past eleven o'clock,
                        this morning.</p>
                    <p>The military assembled at 9 o'clock, and were posted on the field leading to
                        the place of execution, and also at various points, as laid down in the
                        general orders.</p>
                    <p>Everything was conducted under the strictest military discipline, as if the
                        town was in a state of siege.</p>
                    <p>Mounted scouts were stationed in the woods to the left of the scaffold, and
                        picket guards were stationed out towards the Shenandoah Mountains, in the
                        rear.</p>
                    <p>The military on the field formed two hollow squares. Within the inner one was
                        the scaffold, and between the inner and outer lines citizens were
                        admitted--no one being allowed outside of the lines except the mounted
                        guards.</p>
                    <p>At eleven o'clock the prisoner was brought out of the jail, accompanied by
                        Sheriff Campbell and Assistants and Capt. Avis, the jailor. A small wagon,
                        containing a white pine coffin, was driven up, on which they took a seat.</p>
                    <p>Six companies of infantry, a rifle company, a company of horse, and the
                        general and his staff, (numbering 25 officers,) headed the procession and
                        marched towards the place of execution.</p>
                    <p>Brown was accompanied by no minister, and desired no religious ceremonies
                        either in the jail or on the scaffold. He looked calmly around on the
                        people, and was fully possessed during the trying occasion. He mounted the
                        scaffold with a firm step. His arms were pinioned by the Sheriff. He bid
                        farewell to Capt. Avis and Sheriff Campbell. At a quarter past eleven
                        o'clock the drop of the scaffold was pulled, and after a few slight
                        struggles John Brown yielded up his spirit.</p>
                    <p>The body was placed in a coffin, and is now on its way to Harper's Ferry, to
                        be delivered to the wife, under a strong military escort.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--As an evidence of the prosperity of our town real estate has advanced in
                        value within a few ears, far beyond the figures which property holders ever
                        expected to realize. Capitalists hereabouts are now more eager to buy than
                        to sell property, and seem to consider real estate the best paying
                        investment for their money. We give a few instances which strikingly
                        illustrate the upward tendency in price that property has recently taken in
                        this place;</p>
                    <p>The "White Swan Hotel," purchased a few years ago by John W. Taylor for $2,
                        200 changed hands a few days ago for $8, 500.</p>
                    <p>The late residence of Judge Thompson, on Main Street, was recently sold to H.
                        M. White, Esq., for $9, 675. A few years ago, it would have been difficult
                        to have obtained for it $6, 000.</p>
                    <p>The dwelling house and store room of the late Geo. S. Eyster was sold, a
                        short time ago, for $10, 950. This property we consider still cheap at that
                        price, though it is a considerable advance on the estimate we heard the
                        owner place on it but only a very few years ago.</p>
                    <p>One of the Arcade Buildings was sold at private sale, a few weeks ago, for
                        $1, 150. It was put up at public sale four years ago and a bid of only $900
                        could be obtained.</p>

                    <p>--The laboring hands employed on the Franklin Railroad have been on strike
                        for several days in consequence of a reduction of then cents a day on their
                        wages.-- They formerly received $1 a day and it is proposed to cut their
                        wages down to 90 cents on account of the shortness of the days at this
                        season of the year. The hands demand their old wages and refuse to go to
                        work unless they receive it. We hope the matter may be speedily arranged and
