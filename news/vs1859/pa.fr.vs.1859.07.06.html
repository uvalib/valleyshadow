                    <p>--The Eighty-Third Anniversary of our National Independence passed off, in
                        this place, very quietly, and without any demonstration of a general
                        character.</p>
                    <p>The Sunday Schools, with the exception of the Lutheran and Presbyterian, had
                        their usual pic-nics, and the small fry their accustomed amount of
                        jolification.</p>
                    <p>The German Reformed School celebrated in Lehmans Woods and under the
                        excellent arrangement of their Committee, of which Mr. Mathew Gillan was
                        chairman, every thing was done up in admirable style. The Declaration of
                        Independence was read by Wm. Heyser Esq., and eloquent and patriotic
                        addresses delivered by Chas. G. Fisher, Geo. Stenger and Rev. Bauseman. At
                        this celebration all passed off very pleasantly and the children seemed to
                        enjoy themselves in a happy and delightful manner.</p>
                    <p>The Methodist School held their jolification in Shetters Woods, where they
                        passed the day in pleasant and agreeable festivity. This celebration was
                        largely attended by the children of other schools and by our citizens old
                        and young generally. The Declaration was read in a very happy manner by Clay
                        McCauley, and Hon. Wilson Reilly, I. H. McCauley and W. S. Everett Esqrs.
                        made respectively, very able and appropriate addresses, which were well
                        received and added much to the pleasures of the occasion.</p>
                    <p>Our Band spent the day, by invitation, at Caledonia Springs, and had a gay
                        old time of it all round.</p>
                    <p>Our fine military company were out in full feather and done up some excellent
                        firing. We never saw them look, march, or drill, better.</p>
                    <p>In the evening we had Fire works and a Balloon ascension in the Diamond.</p>
                    <p>We believe the day passed off to the satisfaction of all concerned and
                        without an accident or unpleasant occurrence to mar it's enjoyment.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--On Saturday morning last the pupils, in the advanced classes, attached to
                        the to the Female Seminary of the Rev. Mr. Reeves, of this place, were
                        permitted through the kindness of Mr. Dull, the gentlemanly Superintendent
                        of the Franklin Railroad, to take a jaunt, of about six miles, in a
                        passenger car, over the finished portion of the road. The car was generously
                        tendered for the occasion by Col. O. N. Lull of the Cumberland Valley Road,
                        and the whole train under charge of that able and careful engineer Mr. Jacob
                        Switzer. We would like to say something in praise of the pro tem "conductor" of the train--the Ajax of the Transcript--but then our vocabulary of eulogistic
                        terms is not ample enough to reach him.--Let expressive silence &amp;c.
                        We, through his munificence, occupied the distinguished and pecuniary
                        comfortable position of a "dead head."</p>
                    <p>The scholars, with Mr. Reeves and his assistant teachers, left the cars at
                        Heagy's woods, a spot admirably adapted for rural enjoyment, where they
                        spent the day very pleasantly in rambling through the groves, partaking of
                        the good things provided for the occasion, games, speeches &amp;c. In
                        the evening they returned to town by a car specially sent out to convey them
                        home, all expressing themselves highly delighted with their excursion, and
                        no doubt much benefited by the agreeable recreation. We were much pleased
                        with the lady-like deportment of the pupils under care of Mr. Reeves. There
                        were no romps or tom boys in the crowd which speaks well for the discipline
                        introduced in this institution. We are gratified to announce the fact that
                        this school is now in a most flourishing condition, and that under the
                        excellent management of its present accomplished and gentlemanly Principal
                        it has attained a degree of popularity and prosperity which is spoken of by
                        all in terms of merited and high commendation.</p>
