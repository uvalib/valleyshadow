                        showed the lecturer to be well posted by experience on the ways and means by
                        which a practical education may be obtained. The subject of Vocal Music was
                        presented by J. Mac. Thomson. On Friday evening, the subject of Arithmetic

                        and as a means of such improvement, we believe that every teacher who
                        possibly can, should attend the Normal School at Chambersburg, to commence
                        about the first April next.</p>

                    <p><lb/>Mr. P. M. SHOEMAKER:--<emph rend="italic">Dear Sir:</emph> I am sorry to
                        inform you that by the sudden illness of my father, I am forced to be absent
                        from your meeting. How much I wish to be present you may imagine, as this is
                        the first meeting for the improvement of teachers that I have been absent
                        from since I commenced teaching in 1854; but my duty as a son to a kind
                        parent, must forego the pleasure I had anticipated at your meeting. All I
                        am, is owing to my attending the different kinds of educational meetings.</p>
                    <p><lb/>Respectfully yours,</p>

                    <p>--The Committee appointed by the Hook and Ladder Company, to purchase an
                        apparatus, visited Philadelphia last week and succeeded in purchasing the
                        "PROTECTION" apparatus of that city, on very reasonable terms. This
                        apparatus is one of the very best, and the latest style the city affords.
                        Our community will see the necessity of contributing liberally towards this
                        enterprise. The Committee have advanced their own funds and paid for the
                        apparatus, as it could only be purchased for cash. The money already
                        subscribed must be immediately collected, and the following named persons
                        are authorized to take it up as well as to solicit further aid:--James King,
                        J. P. Culbertson, J. S. Nixon, Samuel Reed, and Thomas Grier. The apparatus
                        will be ready to be delivered in this place about the 22 inst., and we
                        understand the "Hope" and "Friendship" intend giving it a handsome
                        reception.</p>
