<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We have purposely refrained from burdening our columns with details of the
                        evidence in the Fry divorce case, now before our Legislature for its
                        consideration and adjustment. As public Journalists we cannot believe
                        otherwise than that the morals of a community are corrupted by the
                        publication of such testimony; and further, we did not for a moment suppose
                        that any one in this community felt any direct
                        interest in this matter, whatever they might feel, in an indirect
                        way, by being opposed to the principle of granting a divorce on such a
                        shallow pretext as the one presented in this case.</p>
                    <p>It seems, however, we are to be made a party in this affair--willing or not
                        willing--The Transcript has proclaimed itself the
                        patron and protector of this wanton wife--the appellant in this case--and in
                        its zeal in her cause would render the marriage rites a rope of sand to be
                        broken by every wanton caprice or lascivious desire; and thus sap the very
                        foundation of civilized society--weaken the force of the Christian
                        religion-- annihilate every principle of morality, and substitute in their
                        place the most shameless licentiousness, and the most frightful corruption
                        and degeneracy of morals. In the face of such an enormity it would be a
                        dereliction of duty in us to remain silent. The welfare of the community,
                        and every obligation man is under to his fellow men, and his God, commands
                        us to speak out in words of warning to the people to rebuke this highhanded
                        attempt to palliate and justify such a monster wrong.</p>
                    <p>Our Representatives at Harrisburg are exhorted to "do
                            justice to their constituency by vindicating the cause of this unhappy
                            wife."--Leaving out the villainy embodied in this entreaty, the
                        request is certainly a very modest one considering the source from whence it
                        comes. We are only surprised that nothing more has been asked of the
                        "gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives"--a small bonus, for
                        instance, for the privilege of acting on the convenient suggestion! Mr.
                        Grigg, the father of the "unhappy wife"--a plethoric old gentleman who
                        stands depletion remarkably well--will, no doubt, see the . . .[text
                        missing] . . . his friends in the Legislature against [word missing] damages
                        for infringement of copyright, on the latest plan proposed for "doing justice to a constituency!" But seriously; we
                        think we know the gentlemen who represent the 'constituency' hereabouts,
                        well enough to venture the prediction that their "clear heads and generous
                        hearts" will spurn this vile proposition and its author, as they would an
                        unclean thing.--Whatever estimate others may place upon their pliability to
                        such an infamous scheme we can not allow the thought to enter our mind that
                        the demoralizing atmosphere of Harrisburg has so corrupted their hearts as
                        to permit them to trample upon the sanctity of marriage, and give their
                        sanction to Free Loveism in its most odious sense. Let them return to their
                        constituents with their skirts reeking in a pollution of that sort and they
                        will find that instead of being placed "as watchmen on the ramparts of
                        public safety" they will be considered as "dead dogs in the ditch."</p>
                    <p>With the peculiar views of the Transcript we
                        desire to have as little to do as possible, and were we not aware of the
                        motive that prompted the Artful Dodger to give them publicity we would pass
                        them over in silence as the vagaries of a diseased imagination. We will here
                        present them to our readers that they may judge them for themselves, merely
                        promising that it must be a bad cause, indeed, that requires such an
                        advocacy:</p>
                    <p>"Take either of the causes for which a diverse may be granted by a Court, and
                        analyze it. Adultery, for instance. This is admitted, by all, to be the
                        highest crime against the marital relation. Why is it any more heinous than
                        either of the other causes? It produces unhappiness. Yes, that is the
                        secret; it does produce unhappiness. So does desertion produce unhappiness;
                        so does the conviction of a husband or wife of an infamous crime and
                        incarceration in a prison, produce, to their partner, unhappiness; so does
                        cruelty produce unhappiness. Now is the unhappiness produced by the latter
                        any the less intolerable because the victim cannot prove the body of the
                        offense to the satisfaction of a Court and Jury. We infer, therefore, that
                        the pith of all the legal causes of divorce, is
                        that they each are fruitful causes of unhappiness."</p>
                    <p>We would charitably believe that these views were penned without due
                        reflection as to their pernicious effect upon society. But we can find no
                        ground for even that poor presumption to rest upon. They seem to have been
                        deliberatively put forth to accommodate a selfish purpose regardless alike
                        of moral principle or public decency. Let us "analyze" them: Any cause which
                        produces unhappiness in married life is as valid a claim for a divorce as
                        Adultery! In this view of the case, Adultery is either a very trifling
                        offence, or every petty squabble between man and wife is equal to the crime
                        of Adultery! The Transcript can take either horn
                        of the dilemma and it will find itself as fatally gored by the one as by the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Let us acquaint our readers with the leading features in this case. It is the
                        old story in a new dress. A gentleman in Philadelphia marries the spoiled
                        child of wealthy parents--reputed the richest in that city. He is a man of
                        business, and a man of sense--he marries the young lady in good faith and
                        hopes to find in her an affectionate and intelligent companion through life.
                        He is deceived--wofully deceived--she turns out to be a fool and a flirt, if
                        not something worse, and in the first month after marriage meets her
                        "affinity," in the person of a young Cadet, with whom she becomes
                        desperately enamored and engages in a most scandalous and disgusting
                        flirtation. Opens up a correspondence with her paramour and in letters
                        filled with adulterous propositions lavishes upon him the most fulsome and
                        mawkish epithets of endearment. Her husband begs, pleads, entreats,
                        remonstrates, threatens--but all to no purpose, she is determined to have
                        her "affair" out--her pappy's wealth can screen her from scandal and buy her
                        a divorce. She fabricates a story of her husband's cruelty and spreads it
                        before the Legislature praying to be set free from the trammels of
                        matrimony. If her divorce is granted it is because her story is believed. In
                        the light she represents her husband he is not willing to stand before the
                        world, and he, therefore, resists the petition as every man entertaining a
                        spark of self-respect or having any regard for his reputation, would do.</p>
                    <p>We conclude our remarks on this subject, for the present, with an extract
                        from a letter of this profligate wife, written under her husband's roof, to
                        her gallant young Cadet, at West Point:</p>
                    <p>"MY DEAREST:</p>
                    <p>"Now let me tell you what I purpose doing. I have about $900 in ready money
                        with me, which will last for some time. My plan is to try and get a
                        situation as a servant in some family in Philadelphia, or with some one who
                        is going away as child nurse, maid, or anything of the kind, with a
                        disguised name, of course, and I can easily get clothes that will be proper,
                        and that no one will know me in. Then I thought of renting a room here, or
                        in New York, and living where no one can find me. My last one is to take my
                        clothes and go home; but then I am afraid of Mr. Fry's coming for me, as he
                        says he has full authority over me. I will go by your advice, whatever it
                        is; but you must not ask me to stay here. When you leave West Point, let me
                        live in the same town with you, if it is as a comman servant. Let me be near
                        you, and I shall be happy, for I cannot live without you. I read your letter
                        over and over; but do not talk of a soldier's grave, for if you die, what
                        have I to live for? I think the future looks brighter, if I can ever get
                        away without being discovered. Can you not invent some plan? I think I would
                        rather go to New York as I would feel nearer to you, and then I would be
                        safer than here. I feel now, able to go through anything, for all my love is
                        centered upon you, though perhaps, I ought not to say it. If you write,
                        direct to some friend whom you can depend on, and get them to put it into
                        the dispatch; then it is safe. Direct it in a different hand from the other
                        one. There is nothing in the world I would not do for you, even to death. If
                        you think it is better for me to go home, of course I will go, but I think
                        it will be useless, as I will not be free if I go there. Forgive this long
                        letter, but I feel that I can tell you everything. Mr. Fry asked me to tell
                        him who I gave that daguerreotype to, but I would not tell him one word. I
                        shall commence to morrow to gather my things together, and make up some
                        common clothes, so if your advice is to leave, I can go immediately. Direct
                        to Mrs. Fry, 1,817 Walnut street. Every feeling I
                        have is centered in you. I must stop writing, as I think I have taxed your
                        patience sufficiently. Don't send any letter to any one, unless you are sure
                        of their being silent on the subject.</p>
                    <p>"Yours, most affec'y.<br>EMILE."</p>
