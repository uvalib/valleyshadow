<b>Forney's Press on Personalities</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Valley Spirit is now fighting with the Philadelphia Press, because of the
                    Press's "outburst of virtuous indignation at the personalities of the Valley
                    Spirit." All stems from Spirit's attacks on McClure. Spirit calls the Press a
                    "Black Republican dung-spreader" and a "reeking pest-house of personal
                    defamation-a filthy sewer of stinking slander."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> This gentleman of color paid our town a visit, on Saturday last, to brighten
                        the prospects of his Republican friends which are now so hopelessly in the
                            dark. There is no calling in question the
                        extraordinary ability of Mr. Douglass as an Orator. He is an elegant and
                        powerful speaker, and possesses a clear well modulated voice, and a style of
                        elocution unaffected and impressive. His discourse was well received by a
                        large and attentive auditory, and with occasional demonstrations of applause
                        from those who seemed disposed to favor his peculiar doctrine. His aim is to
                        place the negro on an equality with the white man--to have him eat at the
                        same table, sit in the same pew, and vote at the same ballot box. He would
                        appear to forget altogether that the Creator Himself has made a distinction
                        when he established the great and immovable barrier of color between the
                        races. Mr. Douglas certainly does not benefit his cause by opening his vials
                        of wrath on religion, or by representing our leading divines as monsters of
                        inhumanity. They certainly are as capable of knowing what is right and what
                        is wrong as he is, and may be supposed to be as honest in their views. We
                        are constrained to say that that portion of his discourse deserved the
                        pointed rebuke of the whole community.</p>
