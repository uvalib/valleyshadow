                    <p>--On Wednesday last a son of Mr. Leonard Nave, aged about twelve years, was
                        drowned while bathing in the dam at Nickle's Mill, in Culbertsons Row, in
                        this county.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Charles Allison, of this place, met with a sudden death, on Wednesday
                        last, by being thrown from a mule. He was engaged in driving a team of mules
                        belonging to Mr. Jacob Heyser, when the accident occurred which deprived him
                        of his life almost instantly. He leaves a wife and several children to mourn
                        his loss.-- The deceased was a member of "Chambersburg Lodge," I. O. O. F.
                        His funeral was attended, on Thursday last, by the members of the order and
                        a large number of citizens generally.</p>
                    <p>Capt. James McCartney, of Carlisle, while returning from the Fireman's Parade
                        at Shippensburg, on Thursday evening last, was killed in attempting to get
                        on the cars while in motion, on the Cumberland Valley Rail Road, at
                        Newville. The accident was caused by Mr. Cartney's own imprudence.</p>
                    <p>A young man named Wm. Bittinger, an apprentice to Mr. David Croft,
                        Blacksmith, of this place, was found dead, and his body shockingly mangled,
                        on the Cumberland Valley Rail Road, a few miles from town, on Friday morning
                        last. He had attended the Fireman's Parade at Shippensburg, and on returning
                        home, on the 7 o'clock cars, lost his hat. He left the trail at Scotland to
                        search for his hat. The train passed on without him, and the next morning
                        his body was discovered on the track by the freight train going east and
                        brought back to town. The inquest held on the body, decided that his death
                        was occasioned by the ll o'clock train of cars passing over him while either
                        sitting or lying on the track. The management of the road is fully
                        exonerated from all blame.</p>
