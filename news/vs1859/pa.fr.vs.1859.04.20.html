<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--On Saturday last, as Mr. Samuel Barnhart, of this place, was driving his
                        six horse road team over the bridge at the "Narrows," a short distance below
                        town, the flooring and supporting timbers of the bridge, gave way, and the
                        wagon and four of the horses attached to it, dropped through into the stream
                        beneath! The depth of the water underneath the bridg, is estimated to have
                        been from twelve ot fifteen feet. The wagon was loadened, principally, with
                        flour, the weight of the whole load being about 100 cwt. A Considerable
                        quantity of the flour was lost and some of the remainder damaged so as to
                        render its sale of no advantage to the owner. The four horses that went
                        through the bridge with the wagon, were saved, which seems miraculous,
                        indeed, when we think of the height they fell (some 25 feet) and the danger
                        of the entanglement in the harness and wagon gears, in the deep water into
                        which they were plunged. Mr. Barnhart's own escape is a matter to be
                        wondered at. Just as the timbers began to crack and sink beneath his team,
                        he stepped from the portion of the bridge that went down. He had been
                        walking with the two front horses (which escaped by the breaking of the
                        coupling chain) and thus was saved from the perilous fall which otherwise
                        would have awaited him. Take it all in all, this accident was most
                        extraordinary.</p>

<b>An Unworthy Hero</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Takes issue with favorable press that allged Fugitive slave Dan Webster has
                    been receiving in Philadelphia. Accuses Webster of bigamy, possible perjury.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--It appears that Dan Webster, the alleged fugitive slave, who was carried
                        about Philadelphia like a conquering hero by the negroes and abolitionists
                        of that staid city, after his discharge from custody, is no better than he
                        should be--in short, a very unworthy object of the sympathy of moral and
                        law-loving people, white or colored. The North
                        American lets us into a little secret connected with Dan's domestic
                        life, which wonderfully detracts from the romance with which his over-
                        zealous friends surrounded him:</p>
                    <p>"A fact has transpired in relation to Daniel which, if before made public,
                        would have somewhat lessened the sympathy felt for him. It is that, when he
                        absconded or escaped from Virginia, he left behind him a wife to whom he was
                        married by a minister of the Gospel. As he was married to another female in
                        Harrisburg, it follows that Daniel was guilty of bigamy. Had he been
                        remanded by the Commissioner, Mr. Brewster's intent was to have given,
                        towards purchasing his freedom, the fee received from the claimants, and a
                        hundred dollars in addition. We understand that one of the colored witnesses
                        has since acknowledged that he knew, at the time he swore to the contrary,
                        that Daniel was an escaped slave, and that the District Attorney is now
                        considering whether or not to cause his arrest on a charge of perjury."</p>

                    <p>--The trials before Court last week were generally of a very unimportant
                        character. Negro fights and petty assault and battery cases, made up the
                        bulk of the business. The Judge was "down upon" the nuisance, but Grand

                        indited as a nuisance. We think it would not be difficult to make out as

                        about town, regularly take possession of our Court House each session to
                        have their drunken fights fought over again and fixed up according to law! How ridiculous. Now, in the name of the people
                        of this county, we call upon his Honor Judge Kimmel to put a stop to this
                        wasteful expenditure of the time and money of its citizens, or make a public
                        example of those who encourage this very low

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR:--Much has been said during the past winter in regard to relaying
                        and putting into running order the long neglected "Franklin Railroad."
                        Scarcely a number of your excellent and widely circulated paper has appeared
                        but what contained an article or short notice in regard to it, either for
                        meetings of the citizens, or stockholder, or from agents for materials for
                        its reconstruction. This is as it should be; and too much praise cannot well
                        be bestowed upon the citizens of Greencastle and vicinity, and the north and
                        south western portions of the county for the indefatigable seal and
                        commendable liberality displayed by them. The road had been sold, and the
                        subject of refitting it several times agitated; but has as often failed. At
                        present, it is to be hoped that we shall soon have it as a "reality." The
                        road evidently must and will be a decided advantage to the citizens residing
                        between Chambersburg and Hagerstown. We wish them a hearty success, and to
                        the present stockholders a profitable investment.</p>
                    <p>The design of this communication is to call the attention of the present
                        owners of the said road to the deep cut where their road crosses the public
                        road leading from Chambersburg to Waynesboro'. It must be self evident to
                        even a casual observer (for it takes no eagle eye to discern it) that,
                        crossing the F. R. R., at this point is fraught with imminent danger to the
                        traveler when once the "Iron Horse" is put on the track. There is a vast
                        amount of travel done on this road second to no similar road in the County.
                        It is the only highway leading from the southern part of our County, so
                        densely populated as the Townships of Washington, Quincy, &amp;c., to
                        our County seat--the place for the shipment of their produce for the Eastern
                        markets. Now we do think, in all candor, that the F. R. R. at this point
                            should be bridged. All persons in the least
                        acquainted with said place, do admit that a bridge at this point is of
                        indisputable necessity. The cut is so deep, that
                        persons coming from Chambersburg are unable to
                        see a train of Cars coming in, and persons coming
                            towards Chambersburg are unable to see a
                        train of Cars coming out. And so steep that when
                        once in the cut with a team of Horses, or Carriage, escape is utterly
                        impossible. The cut is sufficiently deep, (14 or 16 feet from where the
                        original bed of the Waynesboro' Road crossed the hill) when bridged to be
                        high enough to enable a flue of a first class Locomotive to pass through.</p>
                    <p>Then the people crossing would be up 14 or 16 feet instead of in a narrow
                        cut, only 10 or 12 feet wide, and on the track.</p>
                    <p>The truth of the matter is it should have been attended to in Jasper E.
                        Brady's time, when Robert Yates was the original contractor for the
                        construction of this part of the road, and when
                            shinplasters were as plenty as the leaves of Autumn. At that time
                        it would have cost the original Company but a mere trifle, before digging
                        the deep narrow ravine through which the people are now compelled to travel.</p>
                    <p>Much has been done by high authority to prevent railroad catastrophies. We
                        would merely, through the medium of your paper, suggest to the present owners of the F. R. R. to examine this
                        point--give us a bridge and thereby protect the traveling public from
                        meeting with a terrible Railroad accident and, as all must admit, save the
                        destruction of human life. This seems to be an imperative duty.</p>
