                    <p>STAUNTON, October 7th, 1868.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">To the Augusta Central Bible Society:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>Your Executive Committee, in compliance with the Constitution of our Society,
                        beg leave to make the following brief report:</p>
                    <p>Immediately after their appointment at your meeting in March last, the
                        Executive Committee had a meeting and took such initiatory steps as they
                        deemed best calculated most speedily to accomplish the objects of your
                        Society -- to wit: The supplying of every family within the bounds of the
                        County, with the Word of God. At our first and subsequent meetings, as fast
                        as we could procure their names, we appointed "District managers" for the
                        different congregations in the county, and by written and printed circulars
                        solicited their co-operation and assistance. We immediately advertised for
                        two suitable persons to act as colporteurs. None such offered their services
                        to your Committee until June last, when we employed Wm. A Pearson and F.
                        Swope, two young brethren, who are studying for the ministry, and who had
                        just returned home to spend their vacations. These young brethren entered
                        upon their labors the first of July. -- They were supplied with Bibles,
                        parts of the Bible and Testaments, and were given written instructions by
                        your Committee for their guidance. They were instructed among other things
                        to visit <emph rend="italic">every</emph> family in their respective
                        districts, and in addition to sending to any who might wish to buy, to
                        supply by sale or gift <emph rend="italic">every</emph> family who was
                        without the Word of God, either a Bible, parts of the Bible or the New
                        Testament as each in his discretion might think best, if any member in such
                        a family could read, or manifested a wish to have the Scriptures that they
                        might have them read for them. Each was directed, if possible, to complete
                        the canvass of his district, and to make monthly and quarterly reports to
                        your committee. We agreed to pay each thirty dollars per month, and his
                        actual traveling expenses, and $5 per month for his means of travel. Mr.
                        Swope was in our employ during June and August, but during part of his time
                        he was sick and charged for only 37 days of labor, and canvassed perhaps
                        about half of his district. Mr. Pearson's bond for us during July, August,
                        and September -- charging for 79 days of labor, and reports about
                        three-fourth of his district canvassed. These young men resigned their
                        positions that they might return to their studies, and, hearing of no
                        suitable person whose services could be secured at once, your Committee
                        deemed it best to leave that to the Committee now to be appointed by your
                        body.</p>
                    <p>The reports of these Colporteurs, herewith submitted, will give the details.
                        It is deemed sufficient for present purposes to state, that they show that
                        these Colporteurs</p>
                    <p>Received by contributions...........$13.95</p>

                    <p>THE FINANCES</p>
                    <p>Soon after your last meeting Mr. Cowan</p>
                    <p>as Depositor for the Va. Bible Society</p>
                    <p>turned over to us in books 84 volumes,</p>
                    <p>worth..................................$33.05</p>
                    <p>The Treasurer's report herewith submit-</p>
                    <p>ed, shows that we realized from cash</p>
                    <p>collections, and subscriptions obtained,</p>
                    <p>at your last meeting, and in a few days</p>
                    <p>thereafter, from the Staunton Congre-</p>

                    <p>From the Secretary's report, it appears</p>
                    <p>that we have from time to time order-</p>
                    <p>ed from the Va. Bible Society books</p>
                    <p>to the value of............................305.30<lb/></p>
                    <p>So that we owe them a balance of ..............30.20</p>
                    <p>This is reduced by the books furnished</p>
                    <p>Augusta Church, for which they paid</p>

                    <p>Leaving a surplus in the Treasurer's hand</p>
                    <p>after paying this debt, the sum of..........19.70</p>
                    <p>Mr. Swope, one of the Colporteurs, was</p>
                    <p>paid, with the proceeds of his cash</p>
                    <p>sales and contributions, obtained by</p>
                    <p>him from individuals for our Society</p>
                    <p>amounting in the aggregate to................45.50</p>
                    <p>No Final settlement has yet been made</p>
                    <p>with Mr. Pearson, but he received</p>
                    <p>from these sources the sum of................89.07</p>
                    <p>Which it is believed will just about cover</p>
                    <p>his account, and hence no other no-</p>
                    <p>tice is taken of these items.</p>
                    <p>Our accounts with the American Bible</p>
                    <p>Society have been settled and paid off.</p>
                    <p>All this has been done at a net cost to</p>
                    <p>the Society of..............................91.36</p>
                    <p>ASSETS ON HANDS,</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowan, who has very kindly assisted us,</p>
                    <p>and acted as our depositary, re-</p>
                    <p>ports to us now on hand, belonging to</p>
                    <p>our Society, in Bibles, parts of Bi-</p>

                    <p>In his hands, cash on account of sales...........2.91</p>
                    <p>Which together with the balance of...............19.70</p>
                    <p>in the hands of the Treasurer after pay-</p>
                    <p>ing the Va. Bible Society the balance</p>
                    <p>due them, shows we now have in books</p>
                    <p>and cash....................................291.89</p>
                    <p>Due on unpaid subscriptions....................62.75</p>
                    <p>We take great pleasure in informing the</p>
                    <p>Society that the Virginia Bible Society</p>
                    <p>has kindly made us two donations of</p>
                    <p>Books, amounting in the aggregate to</p>
                    <p>425 volumes, worth.........................95.00</p>
                    <p>But we regret to have to state, that though we have, through our Secretary,
                        (who has given much time and labor to this object) written to, and by the
                        kind assistance of a member of our Committee, connected with the press of
                        this city, sent printed circulars to the pastors of, and the district
                        managers in the various county congregations, asking their co-operation and
                        aid, very little has been obtained from them. The amount obtained, from
                        churches and individuals outside the congregations of Staunton is $13.75.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Your committee think they have done (often at inconvenience
                        and sacrifice to some of them) what they could, to create an interest in,
                        and promote the objects of the Society, engaged, as it is, in so good and
                        great a work. If your body in its wisdom, or our successors, by their zeal
                        can devise some means by which they can enlist the <emph rend="italic"
                            >active</emph> sympathy, and reach the pockets of the country Churches
                        in our county, in a work so fraught with the greatest good to our fellow men
                        and Society, the objects for which we organized can soon be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>All of which is respectfully submitted,</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Tuesday last, the 14th inst., State elections were held in Pennsylvania,
                        Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska. These elections did not result as we
                        desired or expected. We desired that they would result in the success of the
                        Democrats, and we expected that such would be the case in Indiana by a
                        handsome majority, and in Pennsylvania and Nebraska by small majorities. We
                        did not expect Ohio and Iowa to vote as we desired, though we supposed that
                        there was a probability that the Radical majority in Ohio would be small.
                        The first reports of the results of these elections greatly exaggerated the
                        Radical majorities. The majority in Pennsylvania is about 10,000 instead of
                        18,000; in Ohio, about 15,000 instead of 25,000; in Indiana about 1,000
                        instead of 7,000, with similar reductions in Nebraska and Iowa. The official
                        returns may reduce these majorities even more.</p>
                    <p>Whilst these results are unwelcome and are greatly to be deplored by those
                        who are laboring to rescue the reins from the hands of the Radicals who are
                        recklessly driving the chariot of State to inevitable destruction, yet they
                        are not such as should induce despair, or cause the Democrats to relax for a
                        moment their earnest efforts to effect the patriotic purpose they are
                        laboring to accomplish. All is not lost which is in danger. The more
                        imminent the danger, the more reason for increased efforts to effect a
                        rescue. It is not the timid, but the bold hand which,</p>
                    <p>"From the nettle, danger,<lb/> Plucks the flower, safely."</p>
                    <p>Should the Democrats waver, doubt, hesitate, despond, victory will certainly
                        perch upon the standards of the Radicals in the November election, but if
                        they will, --as they certainly should do -- gird up their loins for more
                        vigorous efforts, take counsel from Hope, perfect the organization of their
                        legions, march with regular confident tread, meet the foe with steady eye
                        and unblenching cheek, pour in volleys of ballots from the rising of the sun
                        till the going down thereof on the day of election, and victory may slight
                        upon the Democratic standard. This course may lead to success--any other, we
                        fear, to certain defeat. We are not of those who believe that the recent
                        State elections presage inevitable defeat to the Democratic party. They only
                        show that the chances are unfavorable, and that greater efforts are needed
                        to ensure success.</p>
                    <p>The result of State elections do not indicate certainly the result in the
                        Presidential election, for there are many questions of local character, and
                        personal friendships, prejudices, &amp;c. which influence many to vote
                        with one party in the State elections who will vote with the other in the
                        Presidential election. As the Charlestown <emph rend="italic">Free
                        Press</emph> very wisely suggests, "It must also be remembered that some of
                        the States recently electing their officers have, but a short time since,
                        repudiated the leading and darling measure of the Radical party -- negro
                        suffrage -- a question which was studiously avoided throughout the ardent
                        and exciting canvass closed on Tuesday last. The full <emph rend="italic"
                            >onus</emph> and odium of that obnoxious project must, however, be borne
                        in the Presidential election; and we will be much mistaken in the good sense
                        and patriotism (if indeed there is such a thing left) of the people of the
                        United States, if they can be induced to <sic>indorse</sic> a policy which
                        must necessarily and inevitably consign one half, and that the fairest
                        portion, of the country to the dominion of ignorant, uneducated, and misled
                        race, in whose footsteps, all history has attested have followed sterility
                        and barbarism.</p>
                    <p>When a question of such magnitude as is forced upon the decision of a nation,
                        we cannot resign the hope that whatever may be the force of party ties or
                        the despotism of party prejudices, they will turn from it in disgust and
                        alarm and with Lear exclaim,</p>
                    <p>"O, that way madness lies; let me shun that."</p>
                    <p>In our opinion, the results of the late elections do not furnish so much
                        reason for discouragement as the fact that such leading and influential
                        journals as the <emph rend="italic">National Intelligencer, New York
                        World,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Balt. Gazette</emph>, recommend a
                        change of the ticket at this late stage in the campaign, which is like
                        changing commanders on the eve of a battle upon the result of which the
                        destiny of a nation is suspended.</p>

                    <p>The negro is beginning to find out that he is merely a political tool. All
                        work and no pay is not exactly the programme he was led to expect when
                        emancipated from old master. First he looked for "forty acres and a mule;"
                        that delusion has passed away. His Radical friends persuaded him that they
                        had something better, the ballot. Yes, the ballot; the all powerful ballot!
                        With that he could protect, elevate, enrich himself; he would be on equality
                        with old master, "as good as anybody." This, too, he begins to find, and is
                        destined to discover more fully, to be a delusion. His white allies will
                        reap the benefit, while he is to do the work at the polls, and bear the
                        odium of opposition to the interests of his old and tried friends. Let the
                        true men of Virginia do all in their power to enlighten the negroes, let
                        them understand that their interest is identified with the interest of the
                        conservative, respectable class of the community, and not long will they
                        remain dupes of self-seeking adventurers and soulless demagogues. -- <emph

                    </p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN: -- I have the pleasure to acknowledge, on behalf of the "Augusta
                        County Fair," the donation of your Reaper, known as "McCormick's Self-Raker
                        for 1868."</p>
                    <p>It is no disparagement to the many liberal donations made to our Fair, to say
                        that this gift from you affords us a higher gratification than any we have
                        received.</p>
                    <p>We claim both the Reaper and its Inventor as natives of Augusta county. Our
                        people have followed with kindly interest the progress of both to reputation
                        and to fortune, and we felt a special county pride when at the French
                        Exposition of 1867, they alone commanded the combined honors of the "Grand
                        Prize," and the "Cross of the Legion of Honor."</p>
                    <p>It is a striking fact that the successful Inventor, after an absence of near
                        thirty years, should send his perfected Invention as a token of remembrance
                        of his early home and his early friends to grace the first Industrial Fair
                        of Augusta County.</p>
                    <p>I am gentlemen with high respect,</p>
                    <p>Yours truly,</p>
                    <p>JOHN B. BALDWIN,</p>
