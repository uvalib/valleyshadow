<b>The Stay Law</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Willoughby Newton
                                                  writes a letter
                                                  to the
                                                  Spectator,
                                                  speaking
                                                  against the
                                                  repeal of the
                                                  stay law.
                                                  Newton argues
                                                  that debts
                                                  would be paid
                                                  in a timely
                                                  fashion if
                                                  debtors were
                                                  protected, but
                                                  the repeal of
                                                  the stay law
                                                  will interfere
                                                  with this by
                                                  pushing
                                                  creditors to
                                                  collect on the
                                                  debts before
                                                  they can be
                                                  paid. Newton
                                                  also predicts
                                                  that the courts
                                                  will intercede
                                                  to protect
                                                  debtors.<br>
