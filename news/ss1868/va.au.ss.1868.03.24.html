<b>Prepare for the Contest</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>

                    state constitutional Convention in Richmond. Warns that a failure to vote

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The sweeping clause adopted by the Black and Tan Convention, now assembled
                        in Richmond, by which Fifty Thousand of the best
                        men in Virginia are to be disfranchised, is an act of such Radical villainy
                        that it will make the blood mantle to the cheek of every lover of
                        constitututional liberty and of his native land. The object is so
                        transparent that none can fail to see that it is to substitute the negro for
                        the white man and place Virginia - the land of  and Henry and Madison
                        -under negro dominion the white men of Virginia submit to 
                        submit? The Constitution may be forced  even after they have expressed
                        their  tion  of its provisions, as in Alabama;
                        but the time will come when the people will assert their
                        rights - the bayonet cannot rule for ever. Anywhere, we would remind our
                        readers that notwithstanding the disfranchising clause there are white
                        voters enough in the State to defeat the Constitution, if they are only true
                        to themselves and their race. Thank God -- not the Convention - this
                        wholesale disfranchisement cannot affect the vote against the Constitution, because all who are properly
                        Registered can vote either for or against the iniquitous, unjust, and tyrannical
                        instrument. There is no mistake about this - let the white people take
                        courage, gird on their armor, and prepare for the contest. The Constitution
                        will soon be presented for your acceptance or rejection - the issue involved
                        is momentous - whether you are to be freemen or slaves; whether your sons
                        are to be ground under the iron heel of despotism and the negro substituted
                        in his stead, or whether they are to remain free.</p>
                    <p>People of Virginia - if you wish to preserve your liberty and transmit the
                        inestimable right to your children, you must rise in your might and teach
                        the despicable tyrants at Richmond that all their efforts to yankeedoodleize
                        Virginia are in vain - that come weal or woe the white race must rule.
                        Organize, then, organize - all is not lost - and by vigorous, determined,
                        and united action you may postpone the day of your enthralment and
                        ultimately wrest from tyrants who would trample upon you the rights they
                        have usurped.</p>
                    <p>Congress has passed a law of grave import - they have authorized the State
                        Convention to provide for the elections of members of Congress as well as
                        all State officers at the time the vote is taken upon the question of
                        ratifying the Constitution. None but the very best men should be presented
                        for any office, either State or National; and as the Convention cannot
                        determine who is to vote on the Constitution, it follows that you must
                        defeat the one and elect the other. This is the last chance you will be
                        offered, and if you prefer negro magistrates, negro tax collectors and so
                        on, stay at home, gentlemen, and you will have fastened the shackles upon
                        yourselves and your children which naught but blood can unloose. This is no
                        idle vaporing - the disfranchisement of 50,000 white voters as effectually
                        enslaves your children as if the deed were already done. You can prevent it
                        --- will you do it? -- Roanoke Times</p>

                    <p>We cannot picture to ourselves, the results which will accrue if the Radical
                        party of Virginia gets possession of the State. No fancy-- not that of an
                        Opium Eater in the horrors of his derangement, can paint for us the
                        realities of Africanization. The dissolution of all social order follows,
                        fraud, theft, wrong, oppression, outrage, violence, chaos, all follow; but
                        there is one consequence which our people may well consider in advance.</p>
                    <p>It addresses itself to the poor men more directly than any others, and
                        involves the future of their children. Let it be borne in mind, let it be
                        pondered over, let it be discussed, let it be proclaimed from the house
                        tops, that the whole system of education in the South is to be remodeled,
                        and the principle of "equality" introduced. Look at the effects of this. It
                        means that the poor man's child - boy or girl - shall sit down cheek by jowl
                        with the depraved and abandoned.</p>
                    <p>It means that this attendance upon schools, which will be taught by

                        under the supervision of a black police.</p>
                    <p>This is a grim picture, but it is one upon which the people of Georgia, and
                        Louisiana, and North Carolina, look as far as the law goes; it is one of
                        which we have been duly warned by the report of the committee on education
                        in the Richmond Convention, and it behooves us all to study this question in
                        all its bearings in time to avert so great a calamity</p>
                    <p>Who would submit to it? How would we resist? The plain path to escape this
                        awful degradation which would dishonor us through the corruption of our

                    <p>If Virginia shall be carried back into the Union by means of white
                        disfranchisement and negro enfranchisement, it will not be the restoration
                        of Virginia to the Union, but the exclusion of the whites, who made Virginia
                        what she was, and the admission of her negro population. It was not the mere
                        land and water that made Virginia a State, and entered into the compact that
                        created the Union. These were inanimate things that could not consent to
                        anything. It was the white men, women, and children that made the
                        Commonwealth, and the negroes were their property, sold to them as such by
                        the New England slave traders. -They no more formed a constituent part of
                        the State than did the horses and cattle that were owned by their masters.
                        These slaves, who were not recognized as citizens either by the constitution
                        of the State or the constitution of the United States, are now made voters,
                        and by their votes the process of reconstruction and restoration is to be
                        perfected against the wishes and the suffrage of the whites, who alone were
                        the citizens and who constituted the State. We, therefore, say it will not
                        be Virginia that will be restored to the Union when the blacks of Virginia
                        are admitted. It will be another and different community, which should be
                        named New Africa and not Virginia.</p>
                    <p>There is a vague idea in the Northern mind that the restoration of the
                        Southern States to the Union can by some sort of juggling process be made to
                        go hand in hand with the destruction of the rights of Southern whites. The
                        groundless fear, that should the Southern States be restored upon the old
                        white basis, the whites will endeavor by some sort of combination to take
                        their revenge upon the North, is at the bottom of this project. Having
                        gotten us down and trampled upon, they are afraid to let us get upon our
                        feet again. Their consciences tell them that they have acted ungenerously
                        towards us, and this sense of guilt makes them timorous. They tremble when
                        they discern that "manhood in our look which murder cannot kill." They
                        mistake our natural efforts to arise from the earth and escape from our
                        restraints and burdens for indications of hostility to them, and so place
                        our negroes over us to hold us down, and reward them for doing so by
                        bestowing upon them the franchise which we inherited from our ancestors.
                        This is Northern courage and magnanimity - this is Northern justice towards
                        a people whose fathers fought for seven long years side by side with their
                        fathers to establish American independence; to a State which gave them a
                        Washington, a Jefferson, a Marshall, and a long line of sages and heroes,

                    <p> If the people of the Southern States appear to concern themselves unduly
                        about political affairs, the fault, if fault there be, is chargeable to the
                        Radicals in Congress. The universal desire among the whites of the South is
                        to go to work and make crops that will pay debts and taxes, and yield a
                        support for their families. -The reconstruction acts, and the military
                        orders in pursuance of them, require elections to be held with a view to
                        reorganization and restoration, and suffrage is accorded to the whites. If
                        they refuse to vote they will be accused of sullenness, if they vote for
                        negro supremacy, they will disgrace themselves, and the only conscientious
                        votes they cast are against negroes, mean whites and Africanization. They
                        feel that if the constitutions which are being framed shall be ratified,
                        they will be at the mercy of a race without education, property or sympathy,
                        and that they will be degraded and ruined. If they did not, when required to
                        register and vote, use all possible instrumentalities to defeat such
                        constitutions, they would be false to every instinct of their nature. The
                        struggle into which they have been precipitated. will, is not against

                        anxiously  and to the Union. It is simply against macy that
                        their efforts are directed, and these efforts they have a right to make by
                        virtue of the reconstruction laws which confer suffrage upon them.</p>
                    <p> We repeat - the Southern people have been forced into
                        this contest against their wishes, and can only act as they are acting. But
                        for the negroism with which they are threatened they would be . They
                        might vote if any other issue were presented, simply to show that they are
                        not sullen and  toward the Government, but beyond voting they would
                        not desire to go. Their wish is that the white people of the North, and not
                        the negroes of the South, shall prescribe the relations they are to hold to

                        to place Virginians under Radical and negro rule. For five months it was the
                        only journal in the State which openly and boldly opposed the nefarious

                        the error into which they had fallen, had changed position and earnestly
                        called upon the voters to vote against the Convention. But it was too late.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is not impossible that the Constitution, which the Convention at Richmond
                        is now devising, will be imposed upon us. Believing that such a State
                        government would prove in the highest degree injurious to the whole people,
                        black as well as white, I earnestly hope that a majority of the voters will
                        cast their ballots against it; but still a lawless Congress may compell us
                        to submit to it. Better that by far than for us voluntarily to assume the
                        yoke - better be killed than commit suicide!</p>
                    <p> One of the greatest evils we shall experience under the new order of things,
                        will be an enormous increase of taxation. Augusta county will have to raise
                        probably $40,000 annually for the support of free schools; for she will have
                        not only to pay for the education of her own people, but also, to contribute
                        to the support of schools in the poorer counties of the State. Look at West
                        Virginia where a similar system is in operation. I am credibly informed that
                        a gentleman there whose tax ticket, in 1860, was $30, had to pay, in 1840,
                        the sum of $400. - Such is the grinding despotism with which we are
                        threatened. Surely every man who owns property, or who
                            ever hopes to own any, should arouse himself and use every
                        legitimate means to defeat the iniquitous project.</p>
                    <p>What course, however, does common prudence dictate to use under the existing
                        circumstances, in regard to the management of our financial affairs?
                        Obviously, that persons in debt should strain every nerve, by the sale of
                        property and otherwise, to get out of debt before the evil day comes; that
                        no new debts should be contracted; that no man buy what he has not the money
                        in hand to pay for. This is no time for us to assume unnecessary pecuniary
                        obligations.</p>
                    <p>Yet, just at this time, it is proposed that Augusta county shall subscribe
                        $300,000 for constructing a railroad from Covington to the Ohio River, the
                        town of Staunton to be liable for one-sixth of the sum, or $50,000: It is
                        alleged, to be sure, that the railroad stocks or bonds will pay eight per
                        cent. on the investment. If so, why could not the sharp eyed capitalists of
                        New York, London and Paris see it? The work was offered to them for months,
                        and with millions of money seeking investment, they declined to embark in
                        the enterprise. Thereupon our impoverished communities are called upon to
                        take it up as an inviting speculation! It is going to enhance the value of
                        our property. Suppose it does - the poor man who has only a house to shelter
                        him, and which he does not wish to sell, will find little consolation in the
                        past that the value of his property is doubled when the only effect of it is
                        to double the amount of his annual taxes. A beautiful financial scheme,
                        truly, to increase a man's wealth by increasing his burdens and expenditures
                        which bring in no return -- to enlarge the value of land by charging it with
                        a large annuity! Who will buy property subject to such burdens, except at a
                        discount?</p>
                    <p>But Augusta county will furnish supplies to the hands constructing a
                        railroad, and this will be a source of great wealth to our farmers, Indeed!
                        Where then are the rich agricultural counties of Monroe, Greenbrier,
                        &amp;c. I believe they are somewhat nearer the line of railroad than
                        Augusta, and it will be a marvel if they do not furnish all the flour, corn,
                        oats, and meat that will be required.</p>
                    <p>As a property-holder to a small extent, but one whose business cannot
                        possibly be advanced by the proposed railroad, I protest against the whole
                        scheme as flagrantly unjust. Let gentlemen who regard the scheme as so
                        inviting, subscribe individually for stock, and mortgage their own hands for
                        the amount of their subscription. They will thus prove their sincerity, and
                        put in their own pockets the rich dividends of which they speak so
                        confidently. Especially, let them not denounce "negro suffrage" in one
                        breath, and in the next, even before the Convention has done its work, in
                        their hot haste to introduce the new regime, hiss on a wild horde of
                        ignorant voters to overwhelm the property of the county with a large
                        additional burden of debt and taxation. CITIZEN.</p>
