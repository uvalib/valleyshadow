<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Lynchburg News writes in favor of the rejection of the proposed state
                    Constitution despite the election of Grant. The editor explains that the

                    against it.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Whenever the Constitution adopted by the Scalawag Convention shall be
                        submitted to the voters of this State for ratification or rejection, it
                        should be opposed with the same united and determined purpose which was
                        exhibit some time since when it was thought it would be submitted to the
                        voters of the State. It would be as fatal to our interest and as violative
                        of our rights now as then. In the language of the Lynchburg News, we should not lose sight of the important fact
                        that the "Radical party cannot, according to the terms of their own act,
                        inflict this Constitution upon us, but by our own consent. It must be
                        submitted to a vote of the people, and if rejected by them, is consigned to
                        the "tomb of the Capulets," and some other device will have to be contrived
                        ere Virginia can be made to pass under Radical, or rather under negro rule.</p>
                    <p>We are aware that some of our journals are advising that we shall incorporate
                        the principle of negro suffrage upon the Alexandria Constitution, and
                        signify our willingness to accept that as the
                        basis of our reconstruction. But quo modo! how
                        can such a device be carried out? No man, nor any body of men, have
                        authority under any existing law, order, or ordinance, to enter into such
                        arrangement, -- the acts of Congress have prescribed certain formulae,
                        according to which the excluded States must be readmitted. The calling of a
                        convention by the vote of the people, black as well as white, the framing by
                        this body of a constitution for the State, the reference of this
                        constitution to the people of the State for ratification or rejection --
                        these are the various steps which must be taken,
                        according to the existing laws, ere the State can be admitted into the fold
                        of the Union. Should the people refuse to ratify the proposed constitution,
                        it is rejected, and the whole work of constitution making must be begun
                            de novo. But some disposition must be made of
                        the constitution proposed, ere another can be substituted for it. -- It
                        cannot be quietly ignored, nor can its defeat be assumed, so as to clear the
                        way for another.</p>
                    <p>Now, if these facts be admitted, we must also admit, the probability that
                        Congress will at its next session make provision for a vote of the people on
                        the constitution proposed last winter. Of this vote thirty days notice at least, must be given, so that the people
                        cannot be called to pass upon the question before some time in January next.
                        But we hold it to be the bounden duty of every white man in Virginia, we
                        care not to what political party he belongs, to vote against that constitution, whenever he is permitted to do
                        so. Its adoption will involve Unionist and Secessionist, Republican and
                        Democrat, in one common ruin. Shall we cease our hostility to this measure
                        because, forsooth, Grant has been elected President. Will his elevation to
                        the White House mitigate the horrors of negro supremacy, of mixed schools,
                        of negro juries, and of negro officers? If self interest, and
                        self-preservation last summer demanded the rejection of the instrument,
                        surely they appeal to us just as forcibly now -- and if we succeeded last
                        summer in uniting all good citizens in hostility to it, certainly similar
                        results can be obtained by like efforts this winter.</p>
                    <p>For ourselves, we do not despair of the State -- we believe that the people
                        can defeat the odious Underwood constitution, and we believe they will defeat it, whenever it may be submitted to
                        them, and that too without any reference to who may be the incumbent of the
                        Presidential chair. This being done, it will then be time enough to debate
                        whether it is best to adopt the Alexandria Constitution with negro suffrage,
                        or to await in self poised and calm determination, the development of the
                        subsequent acts in the Drama of Radical Reconstruction."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Lynchburg News says that there never was a
                        time in our history when a "leap in the dark" would have been likely to
                        result so injuriously and fatally as now; and we repeat, that our every
                        movement should be as watchfully and deliberately made, as if we walked amid
                        snares and traps that were thickly concealed to destroy us. Our people
                        should, therefore, be guarded and prudent in every expression they venture
                        in regard to public affairs -- not that they have not the free right of
                        thought and speech, but because they can hardly judge what is best and
                        wisest to be done, until the immediate occasion arises to exact their
                        decision and demand their course of behavior. -- "Sufficient for the day is
                        the evil thereof." -- We can at least be bold and outspoken in this resolve,
                        to maintain at all hazards and at every cost the honor and interests of our
                        dearly loved mother Virginia. But for the rest, while the difficulties of
                        the times and of our own condition, gather and darken with every moment, we
                        should practise prudence and presence of mind. He
                        is the truest and bravest patriot who retains it through all the sore trials
                        and ordeals through which we may be required to pass; and doubtless our
                        temper will be sharply exercised, and our hearts subjected to trials yet
                        unexperienced by the future that now lies immediately before us. But if we
                        would serve our State and promote our own best interest, we must watch and
                        consider every movement we make, and be guided in all things by calm and
                        mature reflection. Presence of mind is the great
                        desideratum; and the best service we can render, under contingencies that
                        may possibly arise, is expressed in the noble verse of Milton,</p>
                    <p>"They also serve who only stand and wait!",</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> LEXINGTON, VA., 17 Dec. 1868<br>My Dear Colonel:</p>
                    <p>I am glad to learn from your letter of the 15th, that the prospect for the
                        early construction of the Rail Road from Harrisonburg to Salem, is so
                        favorable. It is a work of great importance to the fertile regions through
                        which it will pass. Besides enabling the farmers to send to market their
                        staple crops with greater ease and profit, it will render valuable many
                        products of the farm, orchard and garden, which now, for want of proper
                        facilities, cannot reach a market, and in addition will greatly enhance the
                        value of the farm itself. It will also open the rich mining interests of the
                        upper part of the Valley, and will afford an avenue by which capital and
                        labour may be introduced for the development of manufactures. The almost
                        unanimous vote of Rockbridge county, to subscribe four hundred thousand
                        dollars to the road, proves its importance in the eyes of its citizens. If
                        the rich county of Augusta will give an equal sum, and the counties of
                        Roanoke and Botetourt each half that amount, it ought to insure the early
                        construction of the road. Rail Roads have become essential to the growth and
                        prosperity of a country. Any section beyond their reach and influence is
                        looked upon as cut off from the rest of the community. They are as necessary
                        now as common roads were a generation ago.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the advantages which will flow from this Railroad, when
                        completed, will more than compensate our people for all the money they may
                        spend in its construction, and will justify its energetic prosecution in the
                        face of all the difficulties by which we are surrounded. The greater our
                        difficulties, the greater the necessity for continued effort to overcome
                        them. They are not insurmountable and will surely yield before prudence and
                        energy.</p>
                    <p>With my earnest wishes for the speedy completion of the road.</p>
                    <p>I am, very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>and truly yours,</p>
