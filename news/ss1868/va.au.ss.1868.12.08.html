<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from A. H. H. Stuart discusses the advantages of the Chesapeake
                    and Ohio R. R., and asks for government funding to complete the Road.<br>(Names in announcement:  A. H. H. Stuart)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The National Intelligencer of the 2nd inst.
                        contains a long and able letter from Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, setting forth
                        generally the manifold advantages of the Chesapeake and Ohio R. R., and
                            specially the importance of its speedy construction to the
                        city of Washington. Senator Sherman having declared recently that, unless
                        proper railway communications be speedily furnished between Washington city
                        and the Western States, measures will be adopted, within five years, to
                        remove the seat of Government to some more accessible point. Mr. Stuart
                        shows that the completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio R. R., with its
                        connections, would furnish the railway communications necessary to render
                        Washington accessible from all parts of the country, and remove all fear of
                        the removal of the seat of Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart's letter concludes as follows:</p>
                    <p>"The only remaining point to be considered is, how can these lines of
                        communication be secured? In my opinion, it would be but fair for the
                        National Government, in view of the national importance of the Chesapeake
                        and Ohio road, to extend to it substantial assistance. This can be done
                        simply by a loan of its credit. The Chesapeake and Ohio road has already
                        expended some six or eight millions of dollars in the prosecution of the
                        work. If the United States Government will now endorse its bonds to the
                        extent of ten millions of dollars, payable in thirty years, and take a
                        mortgage on the whole work to indemnify itself, the whole road can at once
                        be put under contract and completed within two years. The only difficulty
                        will be in regard to the payment of interest on the bonds while the work is
                        in progress. -- After the work is done there can be no doubt of the ability
                        of the company to pay the interest, and ultimately redeem the principal. --
                        Here the city of Washington might render efficient service, by assuming or
                        guaranteeing the interest for three years, by which time it is to be
                        presumed the road will be in active and successful operation.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>ALEX. H. H. STUART.</p>

<b>The Sharks Gathering</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Lynchburg Virginian hopes that Gen. Stoneman will extend the stay law
                    beyond the 1st of January. If this does not happen, creditors and speculators

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The hope that Gen. Stoneman does not design to extend the stay-law beyond the
                        1st of January, is already causing the sharks and the blood-suckers to
                        prepare to pounce down on their prey as soon as the law expires. The
                        Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Gazette
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"It is understood here that General Grant will not authorize any extension of
                        the Virginia stay-laws, and consequently hundreds of the best farms in that
                        State will soon be offered for sale under the hammer. In view of this
                        result, it is rumored that an association will be formed, with a large cash
                        capital, for the purpose of buying up these farms for speculation, as they
                        will no doubt be sold at a great sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>The expiration of this law will turn loose upon our devoted people hordes of
                        greedy cormorants, and we shudder as we contemplate the wide spread misery
                        that will surely come upon us. Gen. Stoneman has generally managed the
                        affairs of this district in a wise and commendable manner, and it will be
                        deeply regretted should he lend himself to the schemes of those who are
                        seeking to bring irretrievable ruin upon our people. That the General will
                        yet disappoint them of their prey is the earnest and heart-felt wish of
                        every humane and right-thinking man in the State. -- Lynch. Virginian.</p>

                    <p>MR. EDITOR: -- In view of the short time in which our county can act out the sentiments of an unquestioned majority
                        of our people, in favor of the extension of the stay law, I urge the
                        necessity of the County Court appointing two intelligent and discreet
                        citizens a committee to wait on Gen. Stoneman and urge him to continue it in
                        existence. Not only ours but the salvation of our State depends on it. No
                        time is to be lost. A gentleman writing to a citizen of this county says
                        "get your newspaper to say that unless a large majority of the counties do
                        as Bedford, Nelson, Fauquier, and other counties have done, appoint
                        committees at once to wait on Gen. Stoneman, he
                        will not interfere. He will pay no attention to the private letters sent
                        him. All the Courts must act and that very promptly."</p>
                    <p>Now let me urge our County Court at the next term to act efficiently in this
                        matter. Some member of the bar, or citizen can be found who will urge it
                        upon their attention. No time is to be lost. A CITIZEN.</p>

<b>Two Dwellings and Cabinet Shop Burnt</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The dwelling and cabinet shop of Robert Johnson burned. The dwelling of P.
                    Byron Hoge also caught fire. Mr. D. A. Kayser's residence was saved by the fire
                    company. Mr. Johnson sustained $3000 in damage; Mr. Hoge $4000. Neither had
                    insurance. "The unfortunate sufferers, by this fire, have the sincere sympathies
                    of this whole community. As Mr. Johnson is an old man and lost nearly all he
                    possessed, the citizens of this place immediately subscribed sums of money in
                    proportion to their respective abilities to enable him to re-build his house."<br>(Names in announcement:  Robert Johnson,  P. Byron Hoge,  D. A. Kayser)</blockquote>
