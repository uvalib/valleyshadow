                <transcript>
                    <p>Occasionally you hear some poor, timid, whining wretch suggest, "if we do not
                        take this, they may put something worse" on us.--Well--let them put
                        "something worse" on us!</p>
                    <p>What else can they put on us? They can put us to the sword, and is that any
                        worse? It is <emph rend="italic">better</emph> if we should have to <emph
                            rend="italic">continue</emph> any long time under such a state of things
                        that will exist when the proposed Constitution goes into operation.</p>
                    <p>"Something worse." Here is a State in which the Whites number 740,000, and
                        the Blacks some 520,000. The whites outnumber the blacks more than 200,000.
                        Now let us see how the State is to be governed under this "Constitution." It
                        would be bad enough if the Blacks constituted only a <emph rend="italic"
                            >potential element</emph> in the government of the State. But let us see
                        how things are "fixed" under this "Constitution" --which, we are told,
                        "might" be "worse."</p>
                    <p>First, the Negroes have a majority of <emph rend="italic">twenty-one</emph>
                        in the Legislature. This in a State where the whites are to the blacks as 7
                        to 5. They have the Legislature by an irresistible majority to begin with.
                        They can pass what laws they please. They can tax at pleasure. Of some three
                        millions to be raised under the Constitution by taxation, it is estimated
                        that about $40,000 will come out of the negroes.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, they have allowed all negroes to vote, even paupers. They have
                        disfranchised some 15,000 white votes. All negroes are eligible to office.
                        There is no qualification whatever.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, the counties are cut up into Townships, and the Townships into Road
                        and School districts. With two exceptions, all county officers of every sort
                        (some two hundred, perhaps, in Albemarle) are to be elected by popular vote.
                        The negroes would have about <emph rend="italic">two thirds</emph> of these
                        officers. In Louisa, they would have <emph rend="italic">all</emph>. In
                        Buckingham, across the river, they would have all. In Orange, they would
                        have all. On the Southside of the James River, in nearly every county, they
                        would have all. As they would lay the taxes in the Legislature, so they
                        would lay the taxes in the counties where they ruled. They would build
                        school-houses and poor-houses to be paid for by the whites. We should have
                        negro sheriffs, negro constables, negro magistrates, negro supervisors,
                        negro assessors, negro collectors, negro school trustees, negro overseers of
                        the poor, negro overseers of the roads -- in the towns, negro mayors, negro
                        councilmen, negro sergeants, negro policemen.</p>
                    <p>Just here: at present a proportion of <emph rend="italic">white</emph>
                        scallawags will get office; but when they have made a sure thing of it, do
                        you suppose they are going to bother themselves with mean white folks? Do
                        you suppose that the negroes are going to vote for a white man to represent
                        them, when they know that they can safely elect a negro? The Legislature of
                        South Carolina just elected stands 64 whites to 92 blacks.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly: They thus have the Legislature, and a majority of the counties and
                        towns -- and we have not yet come to the <emph rend="italic">Test
                        Oath</emph>. By this oath out of the 2700 white males in this county, twenty
                        one years of age, 2690 are excluded from office. Thus the whites, at one
                        sweep, are pushed out of the government altogether -- and we are governed
                            <emph rend="italic">entirely</emph> by the negroes. We can vote, but we
                        must vote for a negro: <emph rend="italic">so</emph> that in reality, we can
                        neither hold office nor vote, because there is no voting unless there is
                        some choice.</p>
                    <p>"Afraid of something worse?" You mean hound, what could be worse? If the
                        Federal Government proposes to cut away the tail of your cat, and to remove
                        the seat of your breeches, and to make you pass through life in these
                        accoutrements -- would you "accept" it for fear they might put something
                        "worse" on you?</p>
                    <p>We have said nothing of "mixed schools." They are going to have schools, and
                        a plenty of them, and you are going to be made to pay for them, if your
                        property does not lose all value. With twenty-one majority in the
                        Legislature and the whole matter remitted by the Constitution to the
                        Legislature, what is to prevent them from having mixed schools? Perhaps they
                        wouldn't put mixed schools on you? You admit you are <emph rend="italic">at
                            their mercy</emph> -- the tender mercies of Lewis Lindsay and Bayne and
                        Peter Jones with all the power in their hands.</p>
                    <p>But if we do not adopt the Constitution, "Congress will put it on us." Then,
                        let Congress do the foul deed. Are you going to jump into the well of a
                        privy, because if you don't jump there freely, somebody may throw you in?</p>
                    <p>You do not know that Congress will put the instrument on us. The State, if
                        admitted into the Union, might, and could, vote for the Democratic candidate
                        for the Presidency. Will Congress help it to do so?</p>
                    <p>Again, if we ratify such a Constitution, will the Northern people help us to
                        get rid of it? -- Will they not say -- "Oh, they voted for it -- it can't be
                        so bad!" -- <emph rend="italic">Charlottesville Chronicle.</emph></p>

                    would vote for the state constitution because they fear that Congress will
                    simply impose a worse alternative. Claims that the Convention has already
                    produced the worst possible constitution, because it will lead to universal
                    suffrage, improper county elections, and mixed schooling.</summary>

                <head>Grant's Letter of Acceptance</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We publish on the first page, as a part of the history of the times, the
                        letters of acceptance of Gen. Grant and Mr. Colfax. Those who expected much
                        from Grant will be disappointed, for he has furnished another illustration
                        of the mountain's laboring and bringing forth a mouse. He is a small man
                        intellectually, and but small things should be expected of him.</p>
                    <p>As the Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">News</emph> says, "Gen. Grant is
                        unwilling to declare his opinion as to any of the vexed questions which
                        disturb and divide the public mind. He appears without any policy and
                        platform of principles. He openly avows that he has no principles and does
                        not recognize any great principles of right, in themselves immutable and
                        immortal. According to Grant, the fickle voice of the people alone regulates
                        government policy, dictates to the administration and expounds the law. And,
                        with a degree of shameless subserviency, utterly unparalleled, Gen. Grant
                        offers to be the mere tool of the party in power, to execute their behests,
                        without remonstrance, and to oppose no policy of his own against "the will
                        of the people." It is this mere brainless automaton who aspires to the chair
                        once occupied and adorned by Washington, Madison and Jackson -- by the great
                        statesman and patriots of the better days of the Republic, when public men
                        led and controlled public sentiment, and did not blindly follow in its wake.</p>
                    <p>The negroes will not fail to remark that the chosen champion of the Radical
                        party ignores them wholly in his formal declaration of principles. There is
                        not the slightest allusion to negro suffrage, negro equality or rights in
                        the whole of the letter. While he avows his adhesion to the platform of the
                        Chicago Convention, and praises the harmony and patriotism of its
                        proceedings, the wrongs and claims of the African race are not even most
                        distantly and casually referred to. It thus appears plainly and palpably
                        that the Republican party <emph rend="italic">has dropped the negro,</emph>
                        and prudently retired from the advanced position it recently occupied in
                        regard to negro equality. It is necessary negroes should be permitted to
                        vote in the South, to overcome the solid opposition of the Southern whites
                        to the Radical programme. It is conceded to the negro here, not as a right
                        that belongs to him, but because of the requirements of party interests. In
                        the North, among his pretended friends, he does not exercise the suffrage;
                        and Gen. Grant, as the selected leader of the Radical party, endorses the
                        platform which recognizes and approves his continued disfranchisement.</p>
                    <p>Grant's simplicity and ignorance are so broadly displayed in this letter,
                        that all intelligent Radicals, if any such there be, must doubtless be
                        ashamed of their leader and representative man. A few more confessions of
                        servility and exposures of stupidity will disgust this whole country with
                        Radicalism and its chief exponent. If the Conservative opposition will only
                        select an acceptable and strong candidate to confront Grant, there can be no
                        doubt of the result. The American people are hardly ready to stupefy
                        themselves by electing to the highest office of the nation a man who is
                        wholly ignorant of the constitution and the primary principles of republican
                        government.</p>

                    <p>In discussing this question, the Lynchburg <emph rend="italic"
                        >Virginian</emph> says with truth that "no person who voted during the war
                        for municipal or county officers, for members of the State legislature, or
                        for Congress, to do what it was well known they were all pledged to do, and
                        did actually do, in the interests of the rebellion, can say that they did
                        not "countenance" the rebellion, and gave "no aid and comfort," and did not
                        "keep an appearance" of sympathy (which the word <emph rend="italic"
                            >countenance</emph> signifies) with rebellion. Voting was a voluntary
                        act, purely. No man was compelled to vote during the war, any more than one
                        is compelled to vote now. A man may not have fought; he may not have given a
                        dollar except in taxes; he may have held no office; but if he voted for
                        those who did vote supplies for our armies, in any of the offices above
                        named -- thus exercising the authority delegated to them by the individual
                        voters -- he cannot say, "I did nothing for the war." The plea is untenable;
                        it is false. He did enough to implicate him in the guilt of his agents, and
                        cannot take the test oath. If one authorizes or instructs an agent to do for
                        him what he cannot well do himself, he is responsible, in law, for the acts
                        of his agent. This is a clear and indisputable proposition of law, and is
                        received as such the world over.</p>
                    <p>If it be urged, as we have heard alleged in extenuation of such acts, that it
                        was necessary to vote to keep organized governments in the South, we answer
                        that, the governments organized here during the war are denounced in the
                        test oath as "<emph rend="italic">pretended</emph> governments," "pretended
                        authority, hostile and inimical to the United States." They certainly were
                        "hostile and inimical to the United States" during the period named, and all
                        who voted to <emph rend="italic">constitute</emph> and sustain them are in
                        the same category. This excuse will not even palliate the offence of voting;
                        for, if all who now allege that they had no sympathy with the rebellion and
                        "did nothing," had refrained from voting, there would have been enough to
                        vote for all the candidates for office, and the same number elected to keep
                        the wheels of government in motion. We would have had a government if none
                        had such had voted for agents to carry it on. This pretext, therefore,
                        cannot avail.</p>
                    <p>We remark, in conclusion, that our object is to enlighten, not to persecute.
                        We wish to preserve a healthy public sentiment among Virginians, and to keep
                        them from doing that which will be a reproach to them and their children,
                        and sink their manhood in the estimation of the better men with whom we were
                        lately engaged in deadly strife. We have conversed with Federal officers,
                        men who fought gallantly on their side during the war, who have admitted
                        that, had they lived South, they would, in all probability, have espoused
                        our side of the question. They have, at the same time, evinced a feeling of
                        contempt for the men who were willing to swear, or had sworn, that,
                        virtually, they had no sympathy with their own section during the terrible
                        ordeal through which it passed. If they could really say so, they ought to
                        be ashamed to avow it.</p>
                    <p>We will trust that the great body of the Virginia people will prove that they
                        deserve the respect, at least, of the gallant men who fought us during the
                        four years of war, and that they will not meanly give the lie to General
                        Schofield's declaration, made in the late convention, to the effect that
                        respectable, capable men enough could not be found in Virginia to carry on
                        the government under this odious and infamous test oath. We are jealous for
                        the honor of Virginia, since that is all that is left us now, and we implore
                        our fellow citizens not to seal their own degradation and cut themselves off
                        from the sympathies and respect of those whose good opinion is worth
                        infinitely more than the paltry baubles or emoluments of office.</p>
