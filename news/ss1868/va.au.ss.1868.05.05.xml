                    <p>The Charlottesville <emph rend="italic">Chronicle</emph>, speaking of the
                        infamous Constitution, (which we publish on the outside this week) adopted
                        by the carpet-baggers and negroes, at Richmond very truthfully remarks that
                        "the inmates of a Lunatic Aylum in the time of the French Revolution would
                        have laughed in derision at such a burlesque on the Revolutionary
                        Philosophy. Radicalism stands aghast at it. Hunnicutt is dumbfoundered. All
                        the white radicals but Porter and Hine have the black vomit, which is just
                        what might have been expected when they took the yellow fever.</p>
                    <p>The thing is coal black. It is an Ebony Constitution, with an Iron-clad Oath,
                        foul with an adulterated Repudiation, which has the stink without the
                        fertilizing properties of the genuine article. It is not Jamaica, but
                        Hayti--and Hayti with the felon's ethics as the fundamental law.</p>
                    <p>If you were to take out the oath, it would leave the State at the mercy of
                        the negroes.--If you take out the oath, they have the Legislature by a
                        majority of twenty-one on joint ballot. If you take out the oath, you have
                        all the whites disfranchised who are disfranchised by the Constitutional
                        Amendment, and all who have been militia officers in addition. If you take
                        out the oath, you have a burdensome system of public free schools from which
                        the negro Legislature may, and probably would, exclude the whites, by
                        requiring the white and black children to attend the same schools. If you
                        take out the oath, you have a militia in which the blacks and the whites are
                        to be brought together on terms of equality. If you take out the oath, you
                        have all your hotels and public conveyances thrown open to the negroes on
                        equal terms with the whites. If you take out the oath, you have all county
                        officers (some two hundred in Albemarle) elected by popular vote; and a
                        large majority of the counties east of the Ridge entirely in the hands of
                        the negroes. If you take out the oath, you have the best of the white
                        citizens incapacitated to sit as jurors, and every negro in the Commonwealth
                        qualified to serve in that character. It is negro supremacy <emph
                            rend="italic">without the oath</emph>. With it, it is unmitigated
                        nonsense.</p>
                    <p>What <emph rend="italic">white</emph> man will be neutral towards such a
                        piece of diabolism? Will <emph rend="italic">any</emph> white man vote for
                        it--except Porter and Hine and White (lucus a non lucendo.)? Is Mr. Thompson
                        going to vote for the Constitution? He said when he came back from the
                        Convention, the white people would then know that they had misjudged him,
                        and would welcome him as a sort of Saviour. Will anybody--any white body--in
                        Albemarle vote for this Constitution? Is thy servant a dog that he should do
                        this thing?</p>
                    <p>Or will there be some man who will sell his birthright for a mess of pottage?
                        who will bite at the homestead worm? Poor fool, swallow that hook, and you
                        will land in the frying pan.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We have already expressed the opinion in these columns that this is a time
                        for plain language, and open, bold conduct. No man should be able to plead
                        the excuse for remissness that he did not appreciate the issue or undertand
                        what it was his duty to do. The character of those who will vote for, or
                        abstain from voting against, the ratification of the infamous Constitution
                        should be held up to the scorn of an indignant and outraged people. With the
                        Petersburg <emph rend="italic">Index</emph>, "we take it for granted that
                        every man in Virginia, white or black, native or emigrant, who has the
                        interest of the State at heart, sympathises with us in the great object
                        which we wish to attain--that is, the restoration of this State to the Union
                        which our fathers founded, with all its constitutional rights <sic>in
                        tact</sic>, and with the power to regulate the question of franchise within
                        its own borders.</p>
                    <p>If there were not a negro in the State, it would still be a matter of vital
                        importance to control the right of suffrage, free from Federal interference.
                        Otherwise, all municipal independence is but a mockery and a farce.</p>
                    <p>Congress has created a horde of pauper negro electors, who, instigated and
                        led by unprincipled interlopers, are now endeavoring to foist upon Virginia
                        a Constitution which wrests from the hands of the tax-payers and
                        property-holders of the State all control over its government and
                        legislation. A Constitution which if adopted will fasten upon Virginia a
                        burden intolerable and too heavy to be borne, and taint her whole social,
                        moral and political life with incurable leprosy.</p>
                    <p>We would be recreant to our trust, if we did not treat the aiders and
                        abettors of this infamous plot as public enemies.</p>
                    <p>Those who would have us adopt our style to the tone of an appeal to gentlemen
                        and honest men, should remember that argument and entreaty to the native
                        traitors and foreign scallawags, who infest the State, are as completely
                        thrown away as a flea bite upon the hide of a rhinoceros.</p>
                    <p>They are determined upon our ruin, if they can effect it. They are even now
                        aiming a deadly blow at us.</p>
                    <p>We do not intend to mollify Radical wrath, or propitiate Republican patronage
                        by a base surrender or compromise of the cause of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>We will cling to her in her fallen fortunes with the love of love. We will
                        turn upon her enemies with the hate of hate.</p>
                    <p>We are <emph rend="italic">not</emph> careful in this matter.</p>
                    <p>There are crises in human affairs, when whosoever would save his life, shall
                        lose it. Some awful moment to which heaven has joined great issues, for good
                        or for evil, when the cunning expediency of the fox is a poor substitute for
                        the courage of the "Lion of the tribe of Juda, beleaguered by the hounds of
                        hell."</p>
                    <p>We are here to speak for the proud, pure women of Virginia, who would make
                        her the ideal of a perfect State, where every man is brave, and every woman
                        is virtuous.</p>
                    <p>We are here to speak for the fatherless and the widow, who have been
                        bequeathed to our care--who have waited long for the footstep of the
                        unreturning brave, which tarry, and do not come.</p>
                    <p>We speak for Virginia. Her cause is our cause. Her people our people and her
                        GOD our GOD.</p>
                    <p>She struggles with the storms of fate amid the yeast of waters. We will rise
                        with her bright on the crest of the wave, or sink with her dark in the
                        trough of the sea.</p>
                    <p>Not a line have we written in her cause which, dying, we would wish to blot,
                        for it is the cause of Truth, and we will plead it in the clarion voice of
                        Liberty, or be silent forever.</p>
                    <p>It is a cause which will survive the mutability of passing events, and among
                        the pleasant memories of our past, will be the recollection that we helped
                        to gibbet upon the scaffold of a common infamy, the knaves who assailed, and
                        the dastards who deserted it."</p>
                    <p>The New York <emph rend="italic">Times</emph>, a leading Republican paper,
                        takes it for granted that the infamous Constitution submitted by the mongrel
                        Convention in this State will be defeated. It thinks that it ought to be
                        rejected. It is, says the <emph rend="italic">Times</emph>, "insulting to
                        the white population." It is designed "as a means of keeping the State
                        forever in negro hands." Now, what would the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Times</emph>, or thousands of other decent Republicans to say nothing of
                        the millions of Conservatives North--think of us if we should ratify this
                        villainous scheme to bring "degradation and bondage on the white citizens of
                        Virginia?" What would the world think of us?--and what would we think of
                        ourselves?--These are the questions for us to ask ourselves, regardless of
                        all others. Let us not be content with anything short of the most
                        overwhelming majority against this "covenant with death and agreement with
                        hell."</p>
                    <p>THE declared purpose of the suffrage section of the proposed Constitution is
                        to ensure for the negro party a "good working majority."--White people of
                        Virginia, strike a blow to avert such a destructive fate by VOTING AGAINST
                        THE CONSTITUTION.</p>

                    <p>On Sunday morning at the ghostly hour of one a party of ten or twelve young
                        men, mounted on horses and wearing the habiliaments of the mysterious K.K.
                        Klan, were attacked in front of the Episcopal church by a regularly armed
                        and organized band of negroes, numbering about forty. The fight was lively
                        for probably a quarter of an hour, when the K.K.K.'s, overcome by numbers,
                        abandoned the field to the darkies, who raised a wild shout of victory and
                        examined the ground to pick up the killed and wounded. To their utter
                        surprise nobody was hurt, notwithstanding a score of well-aimed muskets and
                        pistols were shot at the ghostly disturbers of their peace. One of the K's
                        was cut off from his confreres, but by superior horsemanship and cool
                        courage he managed to get off untouched--clearly proving that he was
                        ball-proof.</p>
                    <p>The young ladies of the Wesleyan Institute were, of course, in a state of
                        hight consternation. They need not have been, for it is our belief that if
                        they had turned out <emph rend="italic">en masse</emph> with scissors and
                        bodkins they could have dispersed the whole gang of rioters. Seriously, we
                        ask, will our citizens allow such disgraceful scenes to take place in our
                        midst? Night patrols should be organized to regulate affairs and quiet the
                        nerves of the timid. The signs of the times require that we should be on our
                        gaurd. Where were our police officers?</p>

                    <p>The Conservative Convention which assembled last winter in Richmond, says the
                        Norfolk <emph rend="italic">Virginian</emph>, appointed an Executive
                        Committee, which is charged with the duty of marshaling the forces of the
                        White Man's Party, and conducting the campaign against the adoption of the
                        negro Constitution, and the establishment of negro supremacy in Virginia.
                        One of the most important duties devolved upon the Executive Committee will
                        be the nomination of an able and popular State ticket, upon which the votes
                        of the Conservative party may be concentrated in the coming election. The
                        time has arrived for the nomination of such a ticket, and we hope the
                        members of the Executive Committee will be convened for the performance of
                        that duty without further delay. The negro Convention is about to adjourn,
                        and the proposed Constitution, the infamous work of their hands, will soon
                        be promulgated. Are we prepared for action? Are our forces consolidaated,
                        and ready to move at a moment's warning?--We take it for granted, that the
                        county and district superintendents--the chiefs of fifty and leaders of ten,
                        have already caused every man within their jurisdiction to be enroled, ready
                        for registration, and voting when the time arrives. This being done, we want
                        a leader worthy to represent our cause--a chieftain in whose hands the
                        banner of the White Man's party may be placed. We want no truckling,
                        time-serving place-hunter, but a <emph rend="italic">Representative</emph>
                        man, of the Old Dominion, thoroughly imbued with Virginia sentiments and
                        feelings. We want a man who enjoys the confidence and respect of our
                        people--one whose sympathies harmonize with theirs, and who is bound to them
                        by the ties of a common suffering in the past and a common hope in the
                        future. If the Executive Committee will nominate such a man for Governor,
                        the people of Virginia will delight to honor him.--They will rally to his
                        standard from the seaboard to the mountains, and elect him triumphantly. He
                        may not be permitted to qualify, because he cannot subscribe to the odious
                        test oath; but the responsibility will be upon the Radical Congress and not
                        upon us. If he is not inaugurated, military government will be continued
                        over us, and that is infinitely preferable to negro rule. At all events,
                        whether he is inaugurated or not, we will be spared the shame and
                        humiliation of voting for a man to be Chief Magistrate of the State, whose
                        only recommendation is that in our greatest struggle for independence, all
                        his sympathies were antagonisitic to those of his own people and
                    kindred.</p>

                    <p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> says: "We beg that every
                        decent white man in Virginia will help Cuffee to force the black mixture of
                        social equality down the throats of the carpet-baggers. Let them be driven
                        into the embraces of the negro. They should everywhere be placed under the
                        ban, excluded from the society of the whites whom they have betrayed, and
                        forced to live with the negroes. What right has a filthy carpet-bagger, who
                        believes that a negro is his social and political equal, to pollute the
                        house of a decent white man with his presence? We should treat these
                        political out-laws as the lepers are treated in the East, and spurn them as
                        unclean and contaminating. The negroes have informed these demoralized
                        incendiaries that they must treat them as social equals, and the negroes are
                        right. Let them dwell in sweet harmony and brotherly love until long and
                        intimiate association gives to the world a mongrel race, which shall blend
                        the rare qualities of the carpet-bagger and his negro brother."</p>
                    <p>The Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph> adds: "This is correct
                        advice. Every man with a white skin who has thrown himself into the
                        political embrace of the negro, should be discountenanced by the white
                        people of the South, and made to live and die on that side of the line. They
                        are a disgrace to their race, and we should always prefer negroes to
                    them."</p>
