<b>The Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial in favor of the construction of the Valley Railroad, despite the
                    heavy cost involved.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The estimated cost to build the Valley Rail-road from Harrisonburg to Salem
                        is about $4,000,000. The State of Va., no longer subscribes its three fifths
                        of the cost out of the State at large, hence the whole amount must be raised
                        by the people directly interested, viz.: the
                        three counties along the road. The population to Augusta would be about
                        $1,500,000. And yet only the upper end of this county is particularly
                        interested, and that end is reported to be opposed to county subscriptions
                        to Railroads.</p>
                    <p>Will Baltimore build it? The city already has, through the Orange Road, a
                        railroad route into the Valley via Lynchburg to
                        Salem, also via Blue Ridge Tunnel to Staunton,
                            via Manassas Gap to Strasburg and to
                        Harrisonburg and via Harper's Ferry to
                        Winchester. Thus grasping the whole Valley with
                        iron fingers.-- The expenditure of $4,000,000 more will give her no
                        compensating additional advantage, unless it should become necessary to
                        secure her a continuous route, throughout the Valley, complete to Salem.</p>
                    <p>But the law as it now stands forbids the commencement of the Valley road to
                            Salem until the Chesapeake and Ohio Road is
                        finished.-- Hence Baltimore could not build the
                        Valley Road even if she was thereby to get any advantage for her outlay. And
                        we are told that unless Augusta votes her proportion of the subscription to
                        the Chesapeake and Ohio Road, it will not soon -- if ever -- be "finished."</p>
                    <p>WHEN the Central line is complete to the Ohio
                        River, and is pouring its teeming tide of freight and travel in its
                        hundred trains a day across this Valley, then
                        Baltimore may well afford to extend Manassas as far as Staunton to tap the
                        rich stream, and thence onward as she may by law then do, to Salem.</p>
                    <p>Thus when Augusta votes her subscription, and
                        secures the amount needed to make sure the building of the road to the Ohio,
                        at once will there arise an occasion for Baltimore to move promptly to
                        secure herself the advantages of the Valley connection. And not until then.
                        It will be the live coal on the terrapin's back. And thus only, it seems to
                        us, can the present generation hope to realize the long cherished dream of
                        the "Valley Railroad."</p>

<b>A Railroad Tax</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes the cost of freight to Richmond as a tax on farmers selling their
                    products in that city, and argues in favor of the subscription to the Central
                    railroad, which will involve the construction of a short track to Richmond.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The farmer in Henrico receives for his crop in Richmond precisely the same
                        price that the Augusta farmer receives for the same articles; but the
                        Augusta farmer has had to pay the railroad its freight charges to place his
                        crop along side the Henrico farmer, who pays no such charge -- thus the
                        amount of this charge represents a tax upon the one farmer, and a gain to
                        the other, and the Augusta farmer will find it to his interest to reduce
                        these freight charges in every possible way in order to relieve his products
                        of this tax.</p>
                    <p>Now this tax is exactly proportioned to the distance on the railroad
                        transporting to market, the charges being so much by the mile. If then the
                        Central Railroad is shortened 31 miles -- as is proposed by building the
                        "short track" to Richmond, this tax is reduced nearly one-fourth on all the
                        produce sent from Augusta; and also in like ratio on all merchandise
                        &amp;c., transported into Augusta and purchased by consumers here.</p>
                    <p>The total of freight, received at and sent from
                        the seven depots in Augusta, in 1867, was, in round numbers, 55,000 tons --
                        at the usual charges per mile of freights, the saving of 31 miles on this
                        tonnage would save, in one year, to the county
                        $65,100.00! Of course this total tonnage for 1867 was not all through freights, but it illustrates the argument.
                        The annual report does not give the details to enable the writer to
                        calculate exactly. The tax then for transporting this Augusta freight of
                        1867 over 31 miles of unnecessary length of road was $65,100.00 for that
                        single year!</p>
                    <p>The total number of passengers going from, and also arriving at these seven
                        Augusta depots, in 1867, is reported at, in round numbers 33,000; at the
                        usual passenger fare the saving of the 31 miles each way would amount to
                        $92,070.00! If then the travel and tonnage of Augusta in 1867 had moved over
                        the whole line to Richmond and back, it would have been saved by the short
                        track an otherwise unnecessary tax of $157,170.00 for that single year!</p>
                    <p>The condition of the subscription by Richmond and other counties, is that the
                        short track shall be built promptly. If Augusta
                        votes her $300,000 in 1868 -- it is estimated that the tax thereon she may
                        have to levy payable January 1870, will be $6,000.00 -- doubling the next
                        year and so on for four years.</p>
                    <p>Now the seven Depots in Augusta sent through to
                        Richmond, in 1867, 28,325 barrels of flour and 20,410 bushels of wheat: the
                        saving of the charge on the unnecessary 31 miles around my Gordonsville on
                        the wheat crop of 1867, would have paid the county tax
                            for the first year's subscription, and the saving on the rye,
                        oats, hay, and even the 1,000,000 pounds of bacon and butter sent that year
                        from the seven depots would have paid it over and over again, and would have
                        put the Augusta farmer on a more equal chance with the Henrico man for
                        profit on his produce.</p>
                    <p>If then Augusta by voting the subscription secures the saving of freight
                        charges on 31 miles to market -- she will while the tax is being levied
                        actually more than pay it off each year, by this saving, and have it as
                        clear profit ever afterwards.</p>
                    <p>If Augusta fails to vote the sum asked of her, the Chesapeake railroad falls
                        through -- the Central Railroad cannot afford to build the short track to
                        carry off only the Valley freights, which it now carries on its single track
                        and makes greater profit because carrying it the 31 miles; hence it is not
                        in the interest of the Central to build the short track until the road is extended to the Ohio, when, and when only, it will be necessary and to the company's
                        interest to build a second track from the Valley and this by the short route
                        to Richmond.</p>

<b>Work to be Done</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An editorial encouraging white employers to refuse employment to members of

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It has been capable of demonstration from the commencement of our
                        "reconstruction troubles" that we have been harassed and injured, political
                        and socially, more by the nefarious influences of the secret societies
                        instituted among the negroes by Radical emissaries than by all other means
                        put together. -- Under one name or another, but generally under the name of
                        the "Union League," the negroes have been segregated into organized bodies,
                        whose subject was avowedly to control their votes, but whose practices and
                        teachings have produced numberless crimes and corruptions among this
                        ignorant people. Now, when there is a gangrene upon the physical body, a
                        wise physician will allow its excision. These secret leagues are a gangrene
                        upon the body of the community, and they ought to be exterminated. Perhaps
                        not one white man in a thousand will dissent from this opinion because all
                        have suffered by their existence in various ways -- mainly domestic. The
                        remedy is found in the same relation in which the greatest evil has been
                        done -- domestic. The lull in the political contest in Virginia reduces all
                        our questions for the time to the domestic area, and it is upon that field
                        that we may now fight with the certainty of success. Nothing is simpler than
                        for the people of Virginia distinctly to announce to their laborers and
                        domestics that they must either quit the "league" or they shall receive
                        employment no longer than their present contracts last. Arguments are not
                        needed to convince that this is the most effective way to break up these
                        infamous workshops of Radical malignity. The safety of the State demands
                        that the means be applied. -- EN &amp; EX.</p>
                    <p>We read appeals to the young men of Virginia, as to their duties. in the
                        present condition of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The best of all advice
                        is, what we have re-iterated, for years -- go to
                        work: every one to go to work to earn, by labor, a support.</p>
                    <p>Professions, and situations, and occupations, resorted to, in the expectation
                        that they will produce an "easy living," are not now what are desirable, or
                        what will realize that expectation. They are, for the most part, filled to
                        overflowing -- and additions, except in extreme cases, rarely meet with
                        success. But hands are wanted for the plow, the loom, and the anvil -- for
                        mechanical trades -- for labor in the field and in the workshop.</p>
                    <p>The middle and even the aged, generally, in our State, have set a commendable
                        example to our young men. They have not become disheartened or dispirited,
                        nor have they sunk under the cares and responsibilities of dependent and
                        helpless families. When the crash came they rose from the ruins as quietly
                        as they could, and went to work! That was their example.</p>
                    <p>Nor have they relinquished their exertions because their patience has been
                        tried since the war, and because the return of prosperity has been delayed
                        -- or even because the success they had hoped for has not followed their
                        honorable efforts. They bide their time yet, full of faith and hope. So let
                        the young men act. Let them remember that work, always honorable, and always
                        to be respected, is now doubly to be respected and honored. To be a good
                        mechanic, or a good manufacturer, or a good farmer, now -- is to have in
                        one's hands the assurance of a support, at least, with every prospect of
                        future prosperity, if not wealth. These are the men who are to build up
                        their own fortunes, and the fortunes of the State. -- Alex. Gazette</p>
