<b>Address of the Conservative Members of the Late State Convention to the People
                    of Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Conservative representatives to the state Constitutional Convention
                    criticize the Convention, and the constitution it has produced. Their criticisms
                    focus on questions of suffrage and representation, though taxation, education,
                    and debt law are also mentioned.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the election conducted in October last by Major-General Schofield and his
                        officers the undersigned were chosen by the Conservative voters in their
                        respective districts, members of the State Convention ordered by Congress,
                        for the purpose of framing a new Constitution for the State of Virginia.
                        Moved by their considerations which induced their constituents to
                        participate in the election, they took their seats in the convention which
                        assembled in Richmond on the third day of December, animated by a sincere
                        desire to contribute all in their power to the restoration of Virginia to
                        her place in the Union upon the basis of the Federal constitution and a fair
                        recognition of the results of the late civil war.</p>
                    <p>Conscious by their numerical weakness, but sustained by clear convictions of
                        duty and by the concurring judgment of eminent and enlightened citizens in
                        all parts of the State, they continued to labor during the session of the
                        convention to secure a constitution calculated to protect the rights and
                        interests of all classes of the community, to harmonize upon a basis,
                        discriminating and just, the conflicting elements of society, and to confirm
                        in a manner satisfactory to the Federal authorities the expressed sentiment
                        of the country in favor of a perpetual and indissoluble Union.</p>
                    <p>The convention having completed its work, and propounded a constitution
                        adverse in its whole spirit to the procurement of these ends, and defeating
                        by its extreme provisions the objects contemplated by even the stringent
                        program prescribed by Congress, the undersigned deem it appropriate to lay
                        before the people of Virginia a brief account of this instrument, and the
                        thorough subversion of all existing relations which it will effect in our
                        society.</p>
                    <p>The convention consisted of one hundred and five members, of whom some
                        thirty-five were Conservatives, some sixty-five were Radicals, and the
                        remainder doubtful. The Radicals were composed of twenty four negroes,
                        fourteen native-born white Virginians, thirteen New Yorkers, one
                        Pennsylvanian, one member from Ohio, one from Maine, one from Vermont, one
                        from Connecticut, one from South Carolina, one from Maryland, one from the
                        District of Columbia, two from England, one from Ireland, one from Nova
                        Scotia, and one from Canada. Of the fourteen white Virginians belonging to
                        this party, some had voted for secession, others had been in Confederate
                        service, others are old men whose sons had been in the Confederate army;
                        hardly one has a Union record. A large proportion of the Northern men and
                        the foreigners were drifted here in some non-combatant capacity by the war.</p>
                    <p>The convention organized by electing a New Yorker president. A native of
                        Maryland was elected secretary. A Marylander was elected sergeant-at-arms.
                        An Irishman, resident in Baltimore, was elected stenographer. The assistant
                        clerk was from New Jersey. Two negroes were appointed door-keepers. A
                        clergyman from Illinois was appointed chaplain.-- Even the boys appointed as
                        pages, with one exception, were negroes, or the sons of Northern men or
                        foreigners, while the clerks of the twenty standing committees, with two or
                        three exceptions, were also Northern men or negroes.</p>
                    <p>For nearly five months we have patiently sat in the convention listening to
                        encomiums upon the negro race, to wholesale denunciations against the whites
                        of the South, to propositions and speeches levelled against property, and
                        addressed to the cupidity of enfranchised slaves suddenly invested with the
                        controlling power in the State. It was our aim to secure a good
                        constitution, and to this end we labored through the better part of the
                        session until we relinquished the effort in despair of getting anything that
                        was even tolerable. It gradually became obvious to both sides of the house
                        that the more violent elements in the Radical party had obtained the mastery
                        over those who were inclined to more moderate measures. This was
                        accomplished in the caucuses which sat almost as regularly as the
                        convention, and what was determined on there was pushed through under a call
                        for the previous question by the united party in the convention.</p>
                    <p>It was the subject of remark among us during the progress of the convention
                        that the negroes grew more and more intractable. The reported debates of the
                        convention will show how active they gradually became in the proceedings of
                        the body -- although, in this connection, it is proner to observe that a
                        correct idea of the speeches and conduct of the negroes is only to be
                        obtained by reading the press reports of Richmond newspapers. The decorous
                        harangues in the official reports of the convention were invented by the
                        stenographer.</p>
                    <p>Another matter which attracted our attention was the utter disrespect with
                        which the Northern leaders in the body paid to all that had heretofore been
                        distinctive in the fundamental law of the State. They have by no means
                        contented themselves with securing to the negroes the control of the future
                        legislation of the State, but in a wanton and reckless spirit, overthrew
                        whatever had been consecrated under all previous constitutions in the
                        affections of the people, or whatever such men as Madison, and Marshall, and
                        Leigh, had deemed of prize importance in laying the foundations of our
                        social organization. Ruthless innovation was indulged in where there was no
                        object to subserve, and the ploughshare was driven over the monuments of the
                        past in the temper of confident and irresponsible power, and with the
                        rudeness and heartlessness of a barbarous conquest.</p>
                    <p>SUFFRAGE.</p>
                    <p>We will attempt now very briefly, as we have proposed, to explain what will
                        be the operation of the new constitution if it shall become the law of the
                        State. The pivot of the system to be inaugurated is, of course, negro
                        suffrage. -- The instrument submitted provides for this on the widest basis.
                        There is universal negro suffrage, without limitations, except that the
                        party shall be a male, of sound mind, twenty-one years of age, who has not
                        been convicted of crime, and resided twelve months in the State and three
                        months in the county where he proposes to vote. We could not secure any
                        educational or property qualifications whatever, not even the pre-payment of
                        taxes; not even the prepayment of the one dollar poll tax. We could not even
                        persuade them to exclude paupers. But this universal suffrage was confined
                        to the negroes; all whites who ever held any office whatever under the
                        Federal Government, or any civil or military office in the State, including
                        the large list of county and municipal officers, and who afterwards
                        participated in the "rebellion," are excluded not only from office, but from
                        the exclusive franchise. The object of this was to secure, as Mr. Botts
                        expressed it in an address he made to the Radical members of the convention,
                        a "good working majority" in the State, and to give a decided preponderance
                        to the negroes in the Legislature, as well as in the county organization.</p>
                    <p>COUNTY AND TOWN ORGANIZATION.</p>
                    <p>The article adopted by the convention on county and town organization
                        fearfully intensifies the practical operation of this universal negro, and
                        restricted white suffrage. The counties are all divided into townships, the
                        smallest to contain at least three. For each county there is to be one
                        county judge, one sheriff, one attorney for the commonwealth, one clerk, one
                        county treasurer, one superintendent of the poor, one superintendent of
                        schools. In each township in the county there are to be one supervisor, one
                        township clerk, one assessor, one collector, one commissioner of roads, one
                        overseer of the poor, three justices of the peace, three constables. The
                        townships are further sub-divided into school districts and road districts,
                        and in each school district and each road district there are to be one
                        school trustee and one overseer of roads. All these officials, excepting the
                        county judge and the superintendent of schools, are to be elected by the
                        people. The smaller counties will have about sixty of these petty officers;
                        the larger, about two hundred.</p>
                    <p>In a large majority of the counties east of the Blue Ridge -- had the
                        convention stopped at this point, which they by no means did -- all of these
                        officers would be negroes, or depraved whites under the control of negroes.
                        In Nottoway county (in 1860) there were 2,270 white persons and 6,566
                        negroes. Imagine the condition of the whites in the county under such a
                        system. A negro sheriff, a negro attorney for the commonwealth, a negro
                        superintendent of the poor, negro supervisors, negro assessors, negro
                        collectors, negro school trustees, negro constables, negro township clerks,
                        negro overseers of the roads, negro magistrates.</p>
                    <p>In Halifax county, by the census of 1860, the population stood 11,000 whites
                        to 15,000 blacks; in Prince George there were 2,918 whites to 5,492 blacks;
                        in Prince Edward there were 4,038 whites to 7,816 blacks; in Powhatan there
                        were 2,589 whites to 5,812 blacks; in Orange there were 4,407 whites to
                        7,951 blacks; in Mecklenburg there were 6,777 whites to 13,319 blacks; in
                        Lunenburg, 4,447 whites to 7,537 blacks; in Louisa 6,166 whites to 10,532
                        blacks; in King William, 2,589 whites to 5,940 blacks; in Greensville, 1,973
                        whites to 4,401 blacks; in Goochland, 3,814 whites to 6,482 blacks; in
                        Essex, 3,295 whites to 7,174 blacks; in Dinwiddie, 4,649 whites to 7,271
                        blacks; in Cumberland, 2,946 whites to 7,015 blacks; in Charlotte, 4,981
                        whites to 9,488 blacks; in Caroline, 6,950 whites to 11,515 blacks; in
                        Buckingham, 6,041 whites to 9,171 blacks; in Brunswick, 4,993 whites to
                        9,818 blacks; in Amelia, 2,894 whites to 7,859 blacks, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>TEST OATH</p>
                    <p>It was thought an extreme pleasure to emancipate, in an instant, 4,000,000 of
                        negroes. It was done at a moment when the North was reckless of the
                        consequences upon the social organization of the South; and with manly
                        fortitude it was submitted to by the South, and an honest disposition
                        cherished to make the best of it. Then came the Freedmen's Bureau and civil
                        right's bill. Soon after, the idea of qualified negro suffrage was
                        cautiously broached at the North. Then, in March, 1867, with little note of
                        preparation, the Congress of the United States issued the edict of universal
                        negro suffrage. It absolutely appalled every heart in the South.</p>
                    <p>The formula in which this bold and unprecedented measure was defended at the
                        North was "Universal Amnesty and Universal Suffrage."</p>
                    <p>The convention of Virginia have given us the universal negro suffrage without
                        the amnesty. They stopped not at negro suffrage; they have made negroes, and
                        all negroes, eligible to office, and required neither property nor
                        intelligence qualification of the incumbent. Any male 21 years old (the
                        Governor must be a little older) can hold office. The convention did not
                        stop here. They then excluded from the ballot and from office not only all
                        whites proscribed from office by the constitutional amendment, but they
                        added to that long list. Then upon this they engrafted their county and town
                        organization, providing for the election of all local officers (with two
                        exceptions) by the people; while by the apportionment of representation they
                        have provided for a negro majority in both branches of the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>Had the convention stopped here, it would only have been negro supremacy. But
                        it remained to give the finishing touch to this almost incredible
                        revolution. They determined to shut the whites altogether from all offices
                        in the State. Accordingly, they have incorporated in the constitution the
                        famous "iron clad" oath, by which all persons, before entering upon the
                        discharge of the duties of any office, are required to swear as follows:</p>
                    <p>"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never voluntarily borne arms
                        against the United States since I have been a citizen thereof; that I have
                        voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel, or encouragement to persons
                        engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I have never sought nor accepted,
                        nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office whatever, under any
                        authority, or pretended authority, in hostility to the United States; that I
                        have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government, authority,
                        power, or constitution within the United States, hostile or inimical
                        thereto. And I do further swear (or affirm) that to the best of my knowledge
                        and ability, I will support the Constitution of the United States against
                        all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith, and
                        allegiance to the same, that I will take this obligation freely, without any
                        mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and
                        faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.
                        So help me God."</p>
                    <p>This applies to all officers, county, municipal and State. It reaches from
                        the Governor to the overseer of a road or the trustees of a public school;
                        and includes members of the General Assembly and any future constitutional
                        convention.</p>
                    <p>It is well known that there is not one white man in a thousand in the State
                        that can take this oath. It gives the State absolutely to the negroes. The
                        theory of Congress was to give protection to the negro by giving him the
                        ballot; by disfranchising a large number of whites, by making all negroes
                        eligible to office; by electing all county and township offices by the
                        people; by gerrymandering the State, with reference to representation in the
                        Legislature; the negroes would have gone so far beyond this as to have been
                        the controlling power in the State. They would, as we have said, have gotten
                        possession of the State Government and of the local administration in a
                        large majority of the counties east of the Blue Ridge; they would have
                        dominated. But this matter of the test oath has swept away all opposition.
                        They will now fill every place; they will now hold every office. The
                        exceptions will be too rare to deserve attention. We have negro rule, and
                            unmitigated negro rule.</p>
                    <p>A black attorney for the Commonwealth will send up his witnesses to a mixed
                        grand jury, who will send back their indictments to be tried by a mixed
                        petit jury. A black sheriff, or his black deputy, will take the white and
                        black jury in charge, to eat at a common table and sleep in the same
                        chamber. A black treasurer will have the custody of the taxes levied in the
                        county. A black superintendent of the POOR (?) will dole out the charities
                        of the public to the white paupers in the county poor-house. A black trustee
                        will visit and make laws for the village schools. Black supervisors will fix
                        the amount of the county levy, which will be assessed by a black assessor,
                        and gathered in by a black collector. A black commissioner will lay off the
                        public roads. A black magistrate will dispense justice; a black constable
                        will preserve order; a black clerk will keep the records of the township.</p>
                    <p>The Governor and his aids will be black after the first term. The
                        Lieutenant-Governor will be black. The Secretary of the Commonwealth will be
                        black. The Board of Public Works will be black. The militia officers will be
                        black. The Legislature will be black; we shall have black representatives in
                        Congress. The visitors of the University will be black. The State proxies
                        will be black.</p>
                    <p>BASIS OF REPRESENTATION AND APPORTIONMENT</p>
                    <p>In furtherance of their plan of entrenching themselves in power in every
                        possible manner, the negroes deemed it worth while to take even another
                        precaution. As negroes only (or incomers from the North) are eligible to the
                        Legislature, it might have appeared unnecessary to tamper with the
                        apportionment of representation for the Legislature. But as the whites
                        (excluding the disfranchised class) are allowed to vote, it might have
                        resulted that the whites might have sent a majority of negroes to the
                        Legislature under white influence. For this, whites (excluding the
                        disfranchised) have a majority in the State of some 35,000 votes.
                        Accordingly by the article in the constitution entitled "Basis of
                        Representation and Apportionment," the State has been gerry-mandered, and
                        the blacks will have a majority of twenty-one on joint ballot in the two
                        Houses of the General Assembly. The majority of the committee on this
                        subject were radicals, and they brought in a report which gave their party
                        about nine on joint ballot in the Legislature. This was partly effected by
                        adopting the registration of 1867 as the basis of representation and
                        apportionment. The committee declined to adopt as the basis the census
                        returns of 1860, or to correct the registration lists by these census
                        returns; although it was well known that a large number of white persons had
                        neglected to register at the late registration.</p>
                    <p>But the party leaders in the convention were not satisfied with the majority
                        thus secured. -- They sanctioned the general principles on which the report
                        was based, which were (as regards the House of Delegates) these: That as far
                        as practicable each county should have a separate delegate; that there
                        should be one delegate for each 1,800 registered voters, and where the
                        fraction over, in a county, exceeded 900 voters, to give another delegate;
                        and to every county in which the number of voters was between 900 and 1,800,
                        a delegate each."</p>
                    <p>The report, in the main, was adopted by the convention. Had it been adopted
                        without modification, the negroes would have had a majority of about six in
                        the House of Delegates.-- The convention, however, desired a more decided
                        preponderance, and they increased their majority in the House of Delegates
                        by the following flagrant outrage, without any precedent in all our past
                        history. Chesterfield county had 3,889 registered voters, and was, under the
                        rule adopted, entitled to two delegates; Powhatan, adjoining, had 1,624
                        voters, and was entitled to one delegate. The report accordingly gave two
                        delegates to Chesterfield and one to Powhatan. But Chesterfield was a
                        doubtful county, while the black voters heavily preponderated in Powhatan.
                        The convention accordingly threw the two counties together and gave them
                        three delegates, thus securing certainly three negro delegates. But they
                        wanted still more. Accordingly, they threw Richmond city and Henrico county
                        together, on the motion of Judge Underwood. Richmond city had 11,666
                        registered voters, and the report assigned it six delegates. Henrico had
                        3,108 voters, and was assigned two delegates. It was concluded from the
                        result of the registration had last month in Richmond that the whites could
                        carry this city. But there was a negro majority of 650 in Henrico. The
                        convention therefore again wantonly departed from the report and all
                        precedent, threw Richmond city and Henrico together, and gave them, thus
                        united, eight delegates. Thus, as is calculated, a change of sixteen votes
                        is effected in the House of Delegates. In the same manner, Richmond city,
                        which by itself would be entitled to two senators, with a fraction to spare,
                        is thrown with Henrico, and the two combined to elect three (black)
                        senators. [This last, however, had been the work of the committee.]</p>
                    <p>TAXATION</p>
                    <p>The only part in the administration of the government which has been almost
                        exclusively assigned to the whites is the payment of the taxes. The
                        convention reportedly avowed that it was their purpose to lay the burden of
                        taxation on property. In conformity with this idea, naturally pleasing to
                        the negroes, the constitution prohibits the Legislature from imposing a poll
                        tax exceeding one dollar on each head; and prohibits any county poll tax
                        exceeding fifty cents; and requires that the whole of the State poll tax
                        shall be applied to the support of the common schools to be established.</p>
                    <p>The Conservative members made a strenuous effort to make the amount of the
                        poll tax always dependent on the amount of the property tax, so they should
                        rise and fall together. A proposition was offered that the poll tax should
                        be equal to the tax on five hundred dollars of property; it was voted down.
                        A proposition was then offered that the poll tax should be equal to the tax
                        on three hundred dollars property; it was also voted down. A proposition was
                        then offered to make the poll tax equal to the tax on two hundred dollars of
                        property; this was also rejected.</p>
                    <p>Nineteen twentieths of the taxes raised will be derived from the property
                        tax, which, of course, will fall almost exclusively on the whites; and by
                        returns in the Auditor's office it appears that last year only one negro in
                        four paid the poll tax required of him, which was sixty cents. So that the
                        poll tax will also fall chiefly on the whites. The entire poll tax, State
                        and county, paid by the negroes, will be about $40,000. A proposition was
                        offered in the convention that the poll tax paid by the whites should be
                        appropriated to the education of white children, and that paid by the blacks
                        appropriated for the benefit of their children. It was rejected by a strict
                        party vote.</p>
                    <p>The novelty of investing the non-taxpayers with the power to impose all taxes
                        assumes a startling importance in view of the expensive character of the new
                        government. Our Federal, State, and county taxes are heavy now; but the
                        State and county taxation under the proposed constitution will be probably
                        quadrupled. The common schools alone, to be supported by State and county
                        taxation, will require two or three times the amount now levied for all
                        State and county purposes. Apart from the salaries for teachers, the
                        construction of school-houses will constitute a very serious item. In West
                        Virginia, a school house is required to be erected from every twenty-five
                        children, and in the county of Pendleton they are let out to contracts at
                        from $250 to $350 each.</p>
                    <p>The negroes will also make ample provision for houses of refuge, and other
                        charitable institutions, which they can enjoy without any of the anxieties
                        which will trouble those who have to pay for them.</p>
                    <p>Besides this, the swarm of officers in the townships and counties will
                        necessitate a heavy annual taxation to maintain the land, and, it is safe to
                        conjecture, that under the strange system which is proposed, the collectors
                        and treasurers will not always account faithfully for the public moneys.</p>
                    <p>FREE SCHOOLS.</p>
                    <p>For the support of the free schools provided for by this constitution the
                        Legislature (under negro control) is authorized to lay a tax as high as one
                        half of one per centum on all real and personal property, and the county or
                        any school district may raise the same amount in addition. The State
                        capitation tax is also to be applied for the support of the public schools.
                        The present literary fund of the State, the proceeds of all public lands
                        donated by Congress for the public school purpose, of all escheated
                        property, of all waste and unappropriated lands, of forfeitures to the
                        State, and all fines for offenses against the State, and sums as the General
                        Assembly may appropriate, are to constitute a permanent literary fund, and
                        the interest thereon to be also devoted to the support of the school system.
                        -- How large will be the sum realized from these various sources may be
                        estimated. Yet the children of the property owners who will support these
                        schools can never enjoy the benefits of them, because it is clear that under
                        the proposed government they would be forced to associate in the schools
                        with the children of the negroes.</p>
                    <p>An effort was made in the Committee of Education, and afterwards on two
                            several occasions in the convention, to procure a declaration
                        that separate public schools be provided for the white and black children.
                        It was voted down in every case. The negroes desired mixed schools, and
                        their white associates feared to offend them.</p>
                    <p>The question was subsequently brought up in another form by a proposition
                        authored by Thomas Bayne (negro) requiring mixed schools, and a substitute
                        (to the effect) offered by Mr. Porter, of Chesterfield. It led to a most
                        angry discussion between the Radical members, the negroes manifesting the
                        most determined purpose to insist on mixed schools, and threatening to vote
                        against the constitution unless it provided for them. The day was consumed
                        in debate, and, as usual, a Radical caucus took the matter in hand in the
                        evening. The next day the original proposition and the substitute, by the
                        aid of the Conservative vote, were rejected, all of the negro members with
                        six or eight exceptions, voting for them. The result of these various votes
                        was that the whole subject of separate or mixed schools is remitted to the
                        Legislature. They feared to provide for mixed schools in the constitution,
                        because they calculated that it might lead to the rejection of it by the
                        people. They have left the Legislature to deal with the matter. We have
                        shown that in this body the negroes will have a majority of twenty-one, and
                        it was clearly shown in the convention, by their fierce and violent
                        speeches, and by their votes, that they will insist upon this point.</p>
                    <p>HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION</p>
                    <p>The action of the convention on another subject deserves a hurried notice.
                        Conscious of the infamous character of their constitution, and wishing to
                        catch the few whites who might be willing to degrade themselves to save
                        their property, they have put in the constitution a homestead provision,
                        which professedly exempts $2,000 of property from all liability for
                        debt.--They then, in the same article, proceeded to repeal the existing stay
                        law, and to prohibit the Legislature from hereafter enacting any stay law.
                        Here is the practical effect of this shameful and deceitful provision: All
                        stay laws are abrogated, the officers of the law are turned loose on the
                        debtors, and the debtor has nothing but this sham of a homestead to fall
                        back upon. The homestead provision, in so far as it refers to past debts,
                        will be at once set aside by the courts as contrary to the Constitution of
                        the United States, which in terms prohibits the State from passing any law
                        impairing the settlement of contracts. We do not hesitate to say that if the
                        article had been drawn by a register in bankruptcy, anxious to secure an
                        increase of his business and his fees; he could not have succeeded better in
                        the accomplishment of his purpose. The stay law removed, the creditor will
                        come down on the debtor, the debtor will either go into bankruptcy and claim
                        the benefit of the homestead exemption, or refuse to do so, relying on the
                        validity of this provision. If he goes into bankruptcy, the registrar will
                        tell him that any such repudiation of debts is obviously unconstitutional,
                        and that he will not respect it. If he should respect it, the matter will be
                        taken to the courts, and the provision set aside.</p>
                    <p>If the unhappy and deceived debtor refuses to go into bankruptcy, his
                        creditors will sue him, obtain judgments, and then enforce their liens thus
                        acquired through a court of equity. The constitutional question will be
                        raised, and can only be decided in one way, and that (as we have said) will
                        be against this provision. The Federal courts have decided this matter
                        already time and again. So that this insidious article, while professing to
                        be a measure of the relief to the debtor, is really designed to suffocate
                        him. It is doubly damned -- in that, as the act of the convention, that body
                        has boldly taken issue with the eighth commandment, while at the same time
                        those who passed it knew that any one who attempts to avail himself of its
                        provisions will be miserably cozened and disappointed. Of course the
                        creditor element in the State will be exasperated at the attempt to
                        circumvent it, and there will be nothing to stand between it and the
                        relentless collection of its debts. Thus will be brought about what the
                        negroes and the white adventurers so ardently desire -- the practical
                        confiscation of the landed estates in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If the Convention had really desired to relieve the debtor class in the
                        State, they would have adopted a stay law providing for the gradual
                        settlement of debts by annual installments until the whole was extinguished.
                        This would have satisfied the creditor, would have been sustained by public
                        sentiment, and would have enabled at least many debtors to discharge their
                        liabilities in an honest manner.</p>
                    <p>MILITIA.</p>
                    <p>This constitution further provides for a militia to be composed of all male
                        citizens of Virginia over twenty-one years of age. This, of course, means
                        citizens as defined in the constitution -- without distinction of race or
                        color. -- We need not comment on the results of such an admixture in such a
                        capacity upon terms of perfect equality in the ranks, and the right to
                        official positions.</p>
                    <p>JURIES.</p>
                    <p>It further provides that all those who are made voters shall have the right
                        to sit on juries, and none others. Many of the best and most intelligent
                        white citizens of the State are thus rendered incompetent to sit on juries,
                        while all male negroes who are twenty-one years of age (not idiots, or
                        lunatics, or convicted of crime,) have a perfect right to do so without
                        regard to qualifications.</p>
                    <p>PUBLIC COVENANTS.</p>
                    <p>One of the provisions of the constitution guarantees to all men "equal civil
                        and political rights and public priveleges." The immediate design of this
                        was to secure the negroes free access to all hotels, railroad cars, and
                        other public places. It is probable that it may be claimed under it that a
                        negro child cannot be excluded from any of the public schools, and that the
                        Legislature cannot require each and every one of these schools to be open to
                        all without distinction of color.</p>
                    <p>CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.</p>
                    <p>The State is divided into eight congressional districts, and it is claimed
                        that it will be entitled to a ninth representative. Of the eight districts
                        the negroes have five, the whites three. The ninth member is to be elected
                        by the State at large.</p>
                    <p>THE BALLOT.</p>
                    <p>We have not space to more than refer to the abolition of the valued and
                        time-honored system of viva voce voting in
                        Virginia, and the substitution for it of the secret ballot, which was ever
                        peculiarly repugnant to the frank and manly genius of the people of this
                        State.</p>
                    <p>CONCLUSION.</p>
                    <p>Such is the constitution submitted to you, fellow citizens, for your
                        ratification; and such the instrument bitterly denominated a measure of
                        reconstruction and of restoration to the Union. The constitution of Georgia,
                        which happens to be before us -- objectionable as it is to Southern people
                        -- provides for universal negro suffrage, but it differs from the
                        constitution offered to the people of Virginia in several important
                        respects. Not one human being is disfranchised; not one questionable oath is
                        required; the existing county organization of the State was left untouched;
                        no person is allowed to vote until he shall have paid all the taxes assessed
                        against him; and the General Assembly is required to provide by law for the
                        selection of "upright and intelligent" persons to serve as jurors.</p>
                    <p>It is the opinion of the Conservative members of the convention that the
                        white people of Virginia should act in this matter without divisions. We
                        contemplate the fact of the entire black population consolidated against us,
                        enrolled in one compact, oath-bound organization, acting with the precision
                        and discipline of an army.-- By the apportionment of representation in the
                        convention they were entitled to a majority in that body, which was
                        increased by the inactivity of the whites, who were heartless and
                        dispirited. This majority has framed a negro constitution, contrived to
                        secure and perpetuate, not only their ascendancy, but their absolute control
                        of the State. For they aim at perpetuating their power. Avowing the most
                        radical and extreme opinions with regard to the rights of the people, and
                        the right of the majority of the people, of whatever race or color, to rule,
                        they have not only, by disfranchisement and test oaths, attempted to stifle
                        the white majority and the voice of all the whites in this State, but they
                        put in their constitution two provisions designed to keep power in their
                        hands. One of these is the test oath which is required of all members
                        elected to any future constitutional convention; the other is a provision
                        that no amendment or revision of the constitution shall be made which shall
                        deny or in any way impair the right of suffrage, or any civil or political
                        right as conferred by this constitution, except for clauses which apply
                        equally to all persons and classes without distinction. They deny the right
                        of the people to change their constitution, and are legislating for
                        posterity to the remotest generation.</p>
                    <p>The whites are absolutely goaded to exertion, and have no choice but to arise
                        and defend their existence as a race. The only question is as to the method
                        of making this opposition. It appears to us, and such is certainly the
                        opinion of nine-tenths of the white people in the State, that our true
                        course lies in a positive rejection of the constitution submitted. Such
                        being the case, if there are a few who have preferred a mere passive
                        resistance, we trust that, for the sake of unanimity, they will lend their
                        hearty co-operation to the plan which has been resolved upon. It is only by
                        concerted and united action that full expression can be given to the
                        sentiments of the white people, while the absence of a few thousand voters
                        from the polls might give some color to the averment that a portion of the
                        whites were favorable to the constitution. It is therefore the deliberate
                        judgment of those who unite in this paper that it should be regarded as
                        settled that all who propose to act with the white man's party in Virginia
                        shall register and vote, and that no one should feel at liberty, whatever
                        his private opinion as to the propriety of some other course, to break those
                        ranks which should neither waver nor present a gap in this great emergency.</p>
                    <p>It has been said that Congress, if we defeat it, will put this constitution
                        upon us. Then let Congress be the author of this great wrong; and let not
                        Virginia, under the menace of violence, weakly be tempted to offer no
                        resistance to her ravisher. The adoption of the constitution by the people
                        of the State and the imposition of it on them by the Republican party of the
                        North are two very different things, and may be followed by very different
                        results. An acquiescence on our part to negro suffrage is surely not the way
                        to arouse the Northern mind against it. Nor does it seem to us possible that
                        so monstrous a government can ever be effectually fastened on us if the
                        white people of the State will maintain a firm, determined, and unfaltering
                        attitude.</p>
                    <p>It is proper, however, to remark that it is by no means certain, nor do we
                        think it is probable, that Congress will impose this constitution on us if
                        we shall reject it. The instrument is very different in its character than
                        that contemplated by the acts of Congress. These did not profess more than
                        the purpose to provide for protection of the negro; but the constitution
                        framed leaves it necessary to provide for the protection of the white man.
                        It has been suggested that the political party in possession of the Federal
                        Government, preparatory to the Presidential election, are anxious to have
                        the Southern States in the Union; but were it admissible to entertain the
                        hypothesis that party considerations would influence Congress on this
                        matter, Virginia might well be an exception to the Southern States in
                        general, as her vote would probably be cast against the party in question in
                        the Presidential election, and indeed, must be, if the whites will only take
                        care to register, as we can command a white majority of thirty-five
                        thousand.</p>
                    <p>It is our duty, then to act together; to avoid all divisions; to disregard
                        all cavilling objections; and to vote down the proposed constitution.-- To
                        say of such a constitution that it would be insupportable is language too
                        feeble. To say (if it could be maintained twenty years) that it would lead
                        to absolute social death is too obvious to need establishment. It is an
                        inundation, a cataclysm, whose black billows would submerge, even in a short
                        time, every moment of civilization, and leave the white race in hopeless
                        degradation. Judge Snead, of Accomac -- one of the ablest of his party, a
                        consistent Union man during the war, elected to the Convention as a Radical,
                        and acting with his party for three months of the session of the body -- was
                        compelled, at the last moment, to declare that the constitution established
                        negro supremacy, and that, although in favor of negro suffrage, he had no
                        alternative left but to vote against it at the polls. It is a strange
                        spectacle that a large portion of the American people, however embittered by
                        the antagonisms of civil war, should be willing to see members of the same
                        family pass, even temporarily, under such a yoke. It is one of the
                        noticeable incidents of the age that, in what claims to be the most
                        enlightened country of Christendom, a frenzy like this crusade for negro
                        suffrage -- so resembling the delirium of the French revolution -- should
                        take possession of the public mind. To us at the South, the absolute
                        indifference with which the people of the North contemplate the application
                        now being made of this system at the South is a matter of astonishment.</p>
                    <p>That the negroes of the South can establish themselves in any permanent
                        supremacy over the whites we do not, however, accept for a moment. If it
                        shall be the pleasure of Congress, if it has the power to do, to put upon us
                        a constitution which they have invited us freely to pass upon -- a
                        constitution giving the negroes tenfold the power they have in Jamaica -- we
                        shall interpret it as the decree of God for a sharp and decisive settlement
                        of the controversy between the white and black races on this continent. It
                        will fearfully embarrass, but it will not destroy, the white race of the
                        South. The white race of the South cannot be destroyed. -- When the negroes
                        are put over us, then, at least, we shall put forth our strength. We shall
                        offer such inducements to white immigration that these sparsely settled
                        States must rapidly fill up. The negro will be overwhelmed with numbers, and
                        it will be too late to make any terms. It is perfectly evident that
                        Providence designs the territory of the United States as a theatre of a
                        great white empire, whose power and whose civilization shall exert a
                        controlling influence in the history of the future. -- That the three or
                        four millions of blacks here can interpose any barrier to the realization of
                        this destiny is plainly chimerical. The only question is, shall the changes
                        which impend in the South be gradual or violent? With peace between the
                        races, the whites of the South might be saved from much that awaits them
                        under the Radical program; and the blacks, while remitted to their proper
                        position in society, would be saved from rapid extinction as a race. The
                        settled and determinate antagonism of the races (which will be inaugurated
                        at once by such a constitution as this) precipitates immediately the
                        beginning of the end. Virginia, racked to the utmost capacity of its
                        endurance, will be the first to throw to the surface the disease which has
                        so long preyed upon her vitals, and though for some years the pitiable
                        victim of a disgusting eruption, will ultimately be restored to health, to
                        vigor, and untainted blood.</p>
                    <p>In protesting against the establishment of negro supremacy we plead for both
                        races; for the whites, that they may be spared, depressed as they now are,
                        the utter prostration of further violent changes in their social system; for
                        the blacks, that, in the name of humanity, they shall be allowed a fair
                        opportunity to save, or least to delay, the doom of their race.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, making no hypocritical professions, we affirm in sincerity and
                        in truth that the people of this State desire to be restored to the Union,
                        and cherish no purpose of disloyalty to the Government; that they long for
                        the reestablishment of kindly relations between all the sections of the
                        country; and that they entertain no feelings or purposes than those of
                        kindness and benevolence toward the negroes.</p>
                    <p>The negroes behaved well during the war; and we can trace all of the disorder
                        and criminal misconduct into which they have fallen since to the pernicious
                        teachings of those white adventurers who are using this ignorant and
                        credulous race for their own selfish and rapacious purposes. If let alone to
                        deal with the negro, the whites of Virginia would honestly endeavor to
                        afford the amplest protection to his rights of person and property, and to
                        make every provision for his intellectual and moral culture.--But where it
                        is proposed -- for the palpably base purpose of aggrandizing a party -- to
                        deliver over the property, the social order, the liberties of the whites, to
                        the vindictive and licentious rule of the negro, every instinct of duty,
                        every movement that can animate a man to exertion, calls
                        upon the white people of Virginia to repudiate and resist such unparalleled
                        oppression.</p>
                    <p>Every Northern State which has voted on the subject since the close of the
                        war has rejected negro suffrage. Ohio, on a direct issue, no later than last
                        fall, did so by a majority exceeding fifty thousand. Kansas, Minnesota, and
                        Connecticut had previously done the same thing. -- The late Constitutional
                        Convention of New York deliberately recoiled from deciding the question. And
                        Michigan, hitherto so overwhelmingly Republican, has just voted down her new
                        constitution by a majority of thirty thousand, because it admitted the negro
                        to the polls. The census showed that there were only some 35,000 negroes in
                        Ohio in 1860. There could have been only about 7,000 negro voters in that
                        State had they been enfranchised, (this in a community where the white vote
                        is nearly 500,000) an inappreciable influence. In Michigan, there are only
                        about 500 male negroes twenty-one years of age. The white voters number more
                        than 165,000. And yet this State, where a Republican Governor was elected in
                        1866 by a majority of 20,038, refuses by some 30,000
                        majority to let 500 negroes vote.</p>
                    <p>The proposition in Virginia is to let 100,000 vote, to make them all eligible
                        to office, to give them a majority of twenty-one on joint ballot on the
                        Legislature, to give them the local control in the counties and towns, to
                        exclude a large number of the whites from the polls, to render nine hundred
                        and ninety-nine white men in every thousand ineligible to the Legislature,
                        or any State or county office, and to lay the taxes (it may be so stated)
                        exclusively on the whites? Is it necessary to say more? Can injustice ever
                        take any grosser shape than that? Was ever a people summoned to resistance
                        by so peremptory a call?</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to realize the situation which we have reached in the South.
                        The mind is stupefied at the initiation of negro domination. It is a waking
                        nightmare, whose horrible shadow cannot be pierced by the struggling
                        faculties -- a spell that neither the senses nor the reason can dissolve.
                        The only escape from such a fate is that which the stout and the resolute
                        always discover from the storms and floods of an unpropitious fortune.
                        Resolved to swim, they breast the tempestuous waves with heroic hearts and
                        sinewy arms, unterrified and undiscouraged, confident, that, if but true to
                        themselves, they were born not to be drowned. In such a spirit, should the
                        white people of Virginia buffet with the rude surges that break over them in
                        this moment of adversity; in such a spirit should they beat down the heaving
                        bosom of the dark flood in which they struggle; in such a spirit should they
                        wrestle with the swift and swollen current of this revolutionary period,
                        which has submerged all the ancient landmarks, has subverted the foundations
                        of the Federal Government, has swept away the sentiment of constitutional
                        liberty at the North, and is now raging like a howling waste of waters over
                        the lately fair and lovely vistas of the South.</p>

                    <p>The issue in this canvass is not whether the negro shall be the equal of the white man in the government, but
                        whether the negro shall be the superior of the
                        white man, for if the constitution be ratified, not only the best portion of
                        the whites will be disfranchised whilst every male negro twenty-one years
                        old will be enfranchised, but the whites will be, almost to a man,
                        disqualified from holding office, whilst nearly every negro will be
                        qualified, under the constitution, to do so. The necessary result will be
                        that the government will be almost exclusively in the hands of the
                        negroes--they will hold the offices of every character in every county in
                        the State. In the language of the Charlottesville Chronicle "if this does not draw the line finally between the
                        races in Virginia, we do not know how lines are drawn. The whole history of
                        the Convention, the conduct of the negroes with reference to mixed public
                        schools, the attempt to exclude the whites altogether from the government,
                        all show that there is no compromise, and can be no compromise, on this
                        question of races. We have got to meet the issue, whether we want to meet it
                        or not. We are pushed against the wall, and must
                        resist.</p>
                    <p>The end of it all is obvious to any one who will look. This thing means that
                        there is not to be any half-way settlement of this question. The negroes
                        have burned their ships behind them. It is victory or ruin - and it will be
                        the latter, whether they are victorious or not. Do the negroes suppose that
                        the white people are going to submit to this sort of spirit? Do they think
                        that our strength is altogether gone? -- Why, we are now waked up, and we
                        are going to rule this State.</p>
                    <p>We have done coquetting with the negro. There is no use in saying one word
                        more. Both sides stripped for the fight. The plank is too narrow to hold us
                        both -- one must get off.</p>

                    <p>There is not a single redeeming feature in the proposed Constitution. Its
                        object is white degradation and negro elevation, and every word and line is
                        so written as to facilitate that purpose. White men of Virginia, VOTE IT
                        DOWN!</p>
                    <p>This is what honest Republicans think of the proposed Constitution. Judge
                        Snead, of Accomac, declares "IF THE INFAMOUS PROVISION IS SUPPORTED BY THE
                        PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA, I WILL MOVE TO SOME MORE HONEST STATE." And again: "I
                        predict that the Constitution will be defeated--AS IT DESERVES TO BE--by an
                        immense majority." Mr. Allan, Radical delegate from Prince Edward, declares:
                        "Never will I consent to such an imposition as this law," which excludes
                        EVERY TRUE VIRGINIAN from office in his own State."</p>
                    <p>The proposed Constitution would send negro and white children to the same
                        schools. What do the poor white people of Virginia, what do the working
                        classes think of that? Will they countenance such social ruin, by refusing
                        to VOTE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION?</p>
                    <p>Shall we accept confiscation under the garb of taxation? This is an issue
                        presented to the white people of Virginia. Will they have their lands
                        plundered to support the extravagance of Radical and negro rule? If not,
                        VOTE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
                    <p>The white man who neglects to register and vote for his race will never cease
                        to regret it hereafter. Let not business nor pleasure, trouble or expense
                        prevent any Virginian from registering, or from VOTING AGAINST THE
                        CONSTITUTION.</p>

<b>The Homestead Exemption</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that the Homestead Exemption in the state constitution was designed
                    to secure the votes of the lower classes, but that the Exemption actually harms
                    these classes by making it difficult for them to purchase on credit, and is
                    unlikely to be upheld in Court.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The homestead exemption feature of the negro constitution was adopted, says
                        the Lynchburg News, with the avowed purpose of
                        securing white votes. This was the gilding used to conceal the black pill of
                        negro supremacy -- this the sugar which was to sweeten for white palates the
                        bitter draught. Surely no political organization that ever existed was more
                        unfortunate in its efforts to deceive. So far from being a recommendation,
                        this provision constitutes one of the most obnoxious provisions of this
                        odious constitution. Designed as a bid for the votes of the laboring
                        classes, it was argued that men of small means would swallow any
                        constitution which provided a homestead exempt from forced sale. But in the
                        form in which it was adopted, so far from befriending the laboring classes,
                        it actually discriminates against them  and in
                        favor of the man of means. All persons who own property of less value than
                        $2,000 are, by this feature, deprived of all credit. They cannot buy a pound
                        of coffee and sugar, a bushel of corn, nor a yard of calico, unless they pay
                        the cash. Enact such a law, and the poor man, who cultivates the ground, can
                        buy no necessaries for his family on the promise to pay "when his crop is
                        gathered," or "when he sells his tobacco." When he carries his horse to be
                        shod, his plough to be sharpened, or his wagon to be repaired, he will have
                        to carry his money in his hand, because nothing can be made out of him by
                        law. He does not own $2,000 worth of property, and consequently can get no
                        credit -- but the man of wealth can still enjoy the benefits of the credit
                        system.</p>
                    <p>This argument is so unanswerable and so plain, that he who runs may read. The
                        "laboring classes" will never consent to ratify a constitution which so far
                        from placing them on an equal footing with others, actually discriminates
                        against them.</p>
                    <p>We have alluded only to the practical effect of the measure assuming that it
                        would be carried into effect. But the truth is, that it is in direct
                        conflict with the constitution of the United States, and would not stand an
                        hour before any court in christendom. That portion of the law which makes it
                        applicable to debts previously contracted, is ex post
                            facto in its operation, and also "impairs the obligation of
                        private contracts" and in each particular, therefore, is a violation of "the
                        supreme law of the land." -- The framers of this section must certainly have
                        been fools themselves, or supposed that all the people were, or they would
                        not have attempted, by so transparent a ruse, to program and mislead them.
                        Knowing the great destitution and pecuniary distress in the State, they
                        imagined, we suppose, that the people would jump at anything that which
                        promised even a slight measure of relief. But the black-skinned and
                        black-hearted Mongrels who devised the scheme were too stupid to understand,
                        or too degraded to appreciate the instincts of Virginians, when they
                        supposed that negro supremacy could be made more acceptable by the passage
                        of a law which is certain to be set aside by the courts, and which, if
                        constitutional, would only add to the miseries of the poor, by inflicting a
                        fatal stab on their credit. Of all the miserably abortive measures of
                        "so-called" RELIEF this is the most puerile and impotent.</p>

                    <p>We call upon every white man, every true Virginian in this State to bestir
                        himself. Let all who can register be sure to do so when the opportunity
                        shall again be offered. But, above all, let the work of organization proceed
                        now. Committees should be at work. The names of all unregistered white
                        voters should be canvassed, and every proper effort be made to induce them
                        to do their duty in this regard. The people should be enlightened, and
                        efforts should be made to send newspapers and documents into those sections
                        of the State that are comparatively isolated, where the people have not had
                        opportunities to get information of the infamous doings of this Convention
                        and its sponsor, the Radical party. No stone should be left unturned; no
                        effort spared to arouse the people against an instrument that would be as
                        degrading to our State in the last degree. Better military government -- a
                        government of force, to be kept over us forever, than that Virginians should
                        seem to acquiesce in the shame and iniquity that have been prepared for them
                        by those claiming to be a Convention of our people. We should under no
                        circumstances whatever, agree to accept universal negro suffrage -- which
                        Northern States, with comparatively few negroes, reject with disdain -- and
                        must, therefore, vote down the constitution that proposes it. Let every
                        Conservative go to work at once. -- Lynchburg

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On yesterday, Monday, (Court-day), at a meeting in the Court-house, on motion
                        of Col. Bolivar Christian, Col. Geo. Baylor was called to the chair. On
                        motion of Maj. Marshall Hanger, Col. Bolivar Christian was appointed
                        Secretary, and on motion of Col. B. Christian, the Editors of the Staunton
                        papers were appointed Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                    <p>Col. Baldwin took the stand and delivered a systematic, methodical, and able
                        address. He spoke for two-hours and twenty minutes, and was listened to
                        throughout that time, by the large audience, with deep interest and fixed
                        attention. No crisis was ever so dangerous and threatening, and none ever
                        called for more determined thought and intelligent action. It was a time to
                        speak forth the words of truth and soberness. He showed that Congress had no
                        right to require the States to hold Conventions to adopt Constitutions -- no
                        more than a New York mob would have, and that if there were no other
                        objections to the adoption of the Constitution than the character of its
                        origin, that it would still be the duty of the people to vote against it, to
                        enter their protest against such usurpation of power and such violation of
                        their States rights. The pretense of guaranteeing a Republican form of
                        Government and requiring negro suffrage to effect it, was false and
                        hypocritical. They admitted West Virginia, when it recognized slavery and
                        restricted suffrage.</p>
                    <p>The Constitutional amendment also recognizes restricted suffrage. The
                        Northern States reject negro suffrage, though it would not effect the
                        elections there practically. The rights of the people are not forfeited,
                        because offenses cannot work forfeiture till offenders be tried and
                        convicted, and sentence pronounced upon them. The people have been pardoned,
                        and those pardoned cannot be prosecuted. The rights of the State cannot be
                        forfeited when its citizens have been pardoned, for they constitute the
                        State. The Constitution is infamous in design, and infamous in detail. It
                        provides not negro equality, but negro domination. If the people adopt, or allow the Constitution to be
                        adopted, it will lead inevitably to negro domination.</p>
                    <p>He would not insult the negro by comparing him to the white miscreant who
                        would use the negro, as the monkey used the cat, to subserve his own selfish
                        purposes. He thought it was the duty of the whites to deal frankly with the
                        negroes, and to let them know to what the adoption of the Constitution would
                        lead. The relation that existed between a kind master and a faithful servant
                        was the kindest which ever existed between the two races, and kinder than
                        any that will ever exist again. They Yankee freed them, because they were in
                        a tight place and needed their help, and not that they cared a fig for the
                        fate of the negro -- didn't care whether the negro got his brains knocked
                        out or not.</p>
                    <p>Under the Constitution, none but negroes and scallawags can hold office.
                        Taxation will be enormous, because the negroes who will vote the tax will
                        not have it to pay. Will be compelled to send children to mixed schools. The
                        militia will be mixed -- the negro always in the front rank.</p>
                    <p>The homestead is a worthless bribe that will never be paid -- an attempt to
                        buy white poor men without a consideration.</p>
                    <p>He closed by appealing to all who could do so to register and to vote, and to
                        vote down the Constitution. The man who can vote
                        and will not do so--stays away from the polls -- is more reprehensible than
                        the man who votes in favor of the Constitution, for to his treason he adds
                        cowardice.</p>
