<b>Grant and the President</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes General Grant's character on the basis of his failure to deal
                    with President Johnson fairly regarding Stanton and the War Department.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Baltimore Gazette says that "the
                        correspondence between the President and General Grant, which was laid
                        before Congress on Tuesday, confirms the view we took of General Grant's
                        conduct when he surrendered the War Department to Mr. Stanton. General
                        Grant's statement is vague and inconclusive, and is evidently the work of a
                        man who feels that he is in an awkward and not creditable position. He is,
                        moreover, flatly contradicted by the President and the members of the
                        Cabinet, and however much of a warrior and hero some people may at present
                        consider him, his personal character has never been so high as to make his
                        word of any special weight in the estimation of the country. But the case is
                        one that admits of no explanation which relieves General Grant from the
                        charge of having been guilty of the grossest perfidy. He was placed by the
                        President on the list of his official and confidential advisers, and he was
                        bound by every obligation that controls men of ordinary integrity to leave
                        no room for any misunderstanding in regards to his intention in case Mr.
                        Stanton should attempt to resume his place in the War Department. The
                        subject has been deliberately discussed several times, and therefore General
                        Grant was not taken by surprise. He had informed the President that he would
                        pursue a very different course from the one which he subsequently did adopt,
                        and it was thus made the more incumbent on him to give Mr. Johnson the most
                        explicit and detailed statement of his change of purpose. No amount of
                        shuffling and no amount of denial will suffice to clear General Grant's
                        reputation. That he is thoroughly allied with the Radical party is a
                        confessed fact and it is now perfectly clear that in the interests of that
                        party he has dealt treacherously with the President. His flourish about his
                        "personal honor and character" comes with a singularly bad grace from a man
                        in the position in which General Grant has placed himself -- a position, we
                        may add, in which it is scarcely possible for a frank and upright man to
                        have gotten by any sort of accident."</p>

<b>Convention in the South</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A dramatic attack on the Constitutional State Conventions as terrible
                    instruments working towards an unjust end.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In speaking of the outrage imposed upon the Southern States by the Radicals
                        through the instrumentality of Constitutional State Conventions, so called,
                        the Enquirer and Examiner asks:</p>
                    <p>Will the patience of the Northern people allow this monstrosity much longer?
                        It is not merely an absurdity. It is not merely a disgust. It is a terror.
                        It is that most diabolical of plots and of dramas -- a frightful tragedy in
                        the garb of a farce. It is the dagger of the assassin with the disguise of
                        harlequin and the gibberish of the idiot. It is the dance of the Ethiopians
                        over the dust of Washington. It is the humiliation of the Caucasian by the
                        African -- the exaltation of barbarism and fetishism over civilization and
                        christianity. It gives to republican forms their deadliest blow, by making
                        them supremely contemptible. Shall a proceeding at once so fatal in its
                        character and so loathsome in its details, at once a great crime, a great
                        peril, and a great indecency, continue to offend and disgust the world? Is
                        it necessary that the worst of ends should be pursued by the worst of means?
                        Can despotism devise no more decent formula for its dirty ends? For shame that the people of the North should so long
                        have tolerated the brutal exhibition! If they are utterly oblivious to every
                        political principle they have ever professed; -- if they are utterly
                        insensible to every pledge of honor they have ever made; -- if they, indeed,
                        desire to pour only vitriol in the Southern wounds, and educate Southern
                        hearts to the very gall of hate under a sense of enormous and perfidious
                        wrong, -- at least let them put away the pitiable monstrosity of negro
                        constitutional conventions as the instruments of their malignity. They have
                        abundance of as despicable stuff as tyrants were ever made of, -- let them
                        send the negro behind the scenes, and fly their Popes and Sheridans and
                        Meades and other like tigercats, directly at our throats.</p>

                    <p>The reiterated and continued statement of the Radical leaders, that the
                        people of the Southern States are hostile to "the Government," is to be
                        explained, says the Alex. Gazette, by
                        recollecting that the long possession of power in the hands of these
                        leaders, and their complete control of the administration of affairs for
                        seven years, have induced them to assume that they are the "government," and they, therefore, expect and require
                        fealty and allegiance to their faction, just as if it were an organized
                        institution, recognized by the Constitution. The Southern people are, and acknowledge themselves to be, in
                        opposition to the political sentiments, purposes, policy, and designs of the
                            Radical leaders -- as are a large and
                        respectable portion of the Northern people. Thus far they go -- and no
                        farther. This opposition is reasonable, legitimate, legal, constitutional.
                        It is not, and cannot be prohibited except by brute force or the excercise
                        of illegal military authority. It is, simply, the excercise of what is left
                        of the right of speech, of the liberty of the press, of the privelege of
                        forming an opinion and expressing it, with regard to public matters. It is
                            no hostility to "the government" -- no breach
                        of faith -- no severance of allegiance. Those who represent it otherwise, do
                        so for purposes of wrong, oppression, and tyranny.</p>

                        it has ever before been guilty of. It is evident, too, that they will
                        require in the next Presidential election, the electoral vote of the South,
                        to ensure the success of their candidate. They will, therefore, hesitate at
                        nothing in their effort to effect the reconstruction of the Southern States
                        at once. They have no time to lose, for the day is not far distant when the
                        final decisive struggle for power will have to be made. Their political
                        machines, the mongrel Conventions of the South, will be required to complete
                        the framing of Constitutions for the States at a very early day, and as
                        little time as possible will be given before the question will be submitted
                        to the people.</p>
                    <p>The question of the ratification of the Constitution will be sprung upon us
                        so suddenly that we will not have time to arouse the people to the necessity
                        of turning out en masse to save the State. In the
                        meantime while they are thus preparing for our total enslavement, we are
                        doing nothing. We are organizing, 'tis is true, but organizing to begin the
                        campaign when the Constitution is framed and
                        submitted to the people. This is the very worst policy conceivable. We
                        should begin the campaign at once. Every man who is Conservative, and who

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In speaking of the issue of veracity between the President and Grant, the

                        charges Grant with falsehood and treachery, and proves it upon him by the
                        testimony of four members of his cabinet; while Grant lamely attempts to
                        escape the odium by appealing to the public in behalf of his reputation as a
                        soldier and a gentleman! Most lame and impudent dodge! He betrayed the
                        President in order to subserve the revolutionary designs of Stanton and

                        country, Grant has gone up as the most "like a skyrocket and come down like
                        a stick." He has neither the brains of a smart man nor the principles of a
                        correct one; and the laurels he won in the field by extraordinary numbers,

                        previously mentioned the fact that several tires for the wheels of

                        effectual and more enduring. Of cast-steel his monument should be made. His

<b>Issue in the Presidential Campaign</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Presents the coming Presidential campaign as a choice between revolutionary
                    tyranny and republican government.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Let us see, what is the true and great issue to be decided in the
                        Presidential campaign which, as has been said, is now opening in two of the
                        New England States. It is whether the glorious republican government which
                        was handed down to us by the fathers, and which has made us a mighty,
                        prosperous, and happy people, shall be subverted by the radical
                        revolutionary party now in power or be preserved by a repudiation of that
                        party at the polls. -- It is whether a military dictatorship -- the
                        assumption of despotic power by one branch of the government and the virtual
                        abolition of the other -- and the creation of a negro barbarian balance of
                        political power in the republic are to take the place of constitutional law
                        and those wise checks and balances between the different departments which
                        the constitution established, or whether the best government ever devised is
                        to be perpetuated. Our radical Congress is fast destroying the constitution
                        and the government, both in theory and in practice, for no other object than
                        to perpetuate power in the hands of the radical party. The Jacobins of the
                        French Revolution were not more reckless or ambitious. All the clap-trap
                        about the poor negro, universal liberty and equality, with all the
                        declaration about loyalty, rebels, and so forth, reminds us of the cry of
                        liberty, equality and fraternity and the loud mouthed talk of tyranny by the
                        French Jacobins at the time they were trampling every vestige of liberty
                        under foot and deluging the country with blood. The issue is between this
                        party and the conservative party. It matters little what the conservatives
                        be called, democrats or anything else, the issue is the same, and is all
                        important. The name is nothing, the cause everything. If the people decide
                        in the New Hampshire and Connecticut election, then -- as would be the case,
                        probably, in the Presidential election afterwards -- against the radical
                        revolutionists our constitutional republic will be established; but if,
                        unfortunately, they should not so decide, we shall march rapidly on to
                        despotism, corruption, and to another form of government. Such is the issue
                        now before the country, and a more important one never arose in the United
                        States.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that agriculture offers the best returns to labor and capital in
                    Virginia.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gloomy as are the prospects of all the departments of Southern industry,
                        agriculture still offers to every Virginian more assured prospects of fair
                        returns for labor employed and capital expended than anything else. -- While
                        our farmers may not since the close of the war have realized large profits,
                        yet their losses have been insignificant as compared with those of the
                        planters of the Cotton States. * * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>We sincerely hope that during the next two months every young man in Virginia
                        who does not see his way clearly to support in commerce or the professions,
                        will try his hand at farming. Half the best land in Virginia is lying idle
                        for want of hads to till it, and however unpropitious the seasons
                        may prove, the cultivation of corn, wheats, oats, and tobacco is sure to
                        yield a support to the industrious laborer. We do not mean that an incurably
                        lazy white man, whose "farming" consists of hiring a worthless negro or two,
                        whom he overlooks by sitting on a stump with an umbrella over his head is
                        likely to succeed. God forbid that such a cumberer of the earth should
                        demoralize the youth of the South by succeeding at anything -- for his
                        example would be a bad one.</p>
                    <p>But, looking to the cheapness of lands in Virginia, and to their fertility,
                        and the great ease with which they are cultivated, and to their
                        accessibility to the very best markets for grain, the industrious farmer is
                        sure to do better for the present than the struggling merchant or the
                        unemployed professional man. There can be no real prosperity in Virginia as
                        long as agriculture anguishes. Enquirer</p>
