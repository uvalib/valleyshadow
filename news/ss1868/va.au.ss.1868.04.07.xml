                    <p>MR. EDITOR--If there be anything in dreams--and we think they are
                        ominous--Staunton may now look out for those mysterious people that have
                        caused so much excitement and alarm all over the country. Last night about
                        the "<emph rend="italic">small hours</emph>" of the morning, we were aroused
                        by our better half shaking us, and making what in the world was the matter;
                        for, said she, you snore loud enough to wake all in the house, and a good
                        many outsider. She said we seemed to snore--as near as she could make out
                        "K-l-u-K-l-u-x-K-l-a-n." We then told her we had had a very remarkable
                        dream, which we herewith give you: We dreamed that we were on Chestnut
                        Ridge, and after walking about a good while over the hill, we sat down near
                        the top to rest. Presently we heard a rumbling noise, like that made by the
                        playing of ten pins. After a little that stopped, and then a door opened up
                        out of the side of the hill. At the upper side of the hill stood a large
                        chestnut tree, on the body of which about fifteen feet from the gound, there
                        suddenly appeared three large K's, brilliantly lighted up, as we supposed
                        with gas. After a little, a great crowd of men came marching out of the
                        door, three abreast, and singing as they came. We tried our best to find out
                        the words of the song, but could not get near enough without their
                        discovering us, which we would not have had them do for any consideration;
                        so all that we could make of their singing, was what appeared to us to be
                        chorus, which was--"<emph rend="italic">Bill Brown-low, down
                            below!</emph>"--"<emph rend="italic">Old Ben Wade, cover him up with a
                            spade!</emph>" How many there were, we are not able to say precisely,
                        but think there could not have been less than three hundred. Each one wore
                        over his shoulders a <emph rend="italic">Kalico</emph> sash of a flaming red
                        color, and carried in his hand a banner, on which was--what we supposed to
                        be--various mottoes and devices in characters which we did not
                        understand.--We were very much surprised to see in the procession, some ten
                        or twelve gentlemen of color, four of whom had poles across their shoulders,
                        to which was swung by ropes an old bureau, turned upside down, and several
                        knobs knocked off.</p>
                    <p>We saw one man in the crowd that very much resembled Gen. Early; he was about
                        the same make--not strikingly handsome--full six feet high, and certainly
                        had on old Jubal's clothes; and we thought we heard the name of Mosby
                        called, but never having seen the General, we can't say whether he was there
                        or not.</p>
                    <p>The procession moved off in an Easterly direction, and just then--being waked
                        up, we cannot tell you anything more about it.</p>

                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Baltimore <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> says that the annals of
                        Congress, the papers on file in the Departments, and the columns of its own
                        journals, will bear us out in asserting that the Republican party has been
                        one of treachery and deceit form the beginning. Its power has been built up
                        on falsehood. Its first gigantic falsehood was that the war waged against
                        the South was for the restoration of the Union and for no other purpose. Its
                        latest is, that the privilege of the ballot "is essential to the protection
                        of the negro against the wiles of the most wicked institution that God ever
                        afflicted a man with, or that even could exist through the invention of
                        human ingenuity." For six years it has been building up its power--not by
                        argument, not by reason, but by a succession of fraudulent pretences, by an
                        organized system of terrorism, and by an unscrupulous resort to that <emph
                            rend="italic">ultima ratio regum</emph>, the free use of the sword. Its
                        ruling principle throughout has been a lust of power. Lies, rapine and
                        murder have been its instruments; "loyalty" its catchword, and corruption
                        its binding force. It has worked on the credulity of some, the cupidity of
                        others. Known dishonesty was no bar to official preferment, for Radicalism
                        purified the knave and sanctified the hypocrite. Beyond a few sincere
                        fanatics there is not a man of the party who cares for the blacks, except as
                        political puppets that can be made to respond as their unscrupulous white
                        managers choose to pull the wires. "It is not intelligence we want, but
                        numbers," said a well known politician, and in this bold avowal may be found
                        the key note of all the peans sung or chanted by Radical orators and Radical
                        journalists in praise of the negro. "If," says the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune</emph>, "the negro is not fit to vote, he is not fit to be
                        free, and the only choice of the American people is this--suffrage for both
                        races, or servitude for one." So, in happy accordance with this view of the
                        political equality of the two races, the Radicals have decreed that the
                        blacks of the South shall be permitted to vote, and that the whites shall be
                        disfranchised.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Norfolk Virginian</emph> says that "the immaculate
                        patriots now occupying the Capitol, and engaged in framing the Organic Law
                        for the people of Virginia have made wonderful discoveries in the Science of
                        Government. The time was when our Constitution Makers, the Madisons,
                        Marshals and Tazewells, who once adorned the seats now desecrated by the
                        Bowdens, the Porters and the Baynes, had some little regard for the
                        distinctions of <emph rend="italic">meum</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                        >tuum</emph>, and were sufficiently old fashioned to believe that those who
                        wielded the power of taxation should have a <emph rend="italic">property
                            stake</emph> in the community, and that those who imposed the burdens of
                        government should at least participate in bearing them.</p>
                    <p>It seems, however, that the notion of our fathers has become an obsolete idea
                        in this age of Radical progress and Africanization. The Solons at Richmond,
                        owning no property themselves, have no regard for the rights of property
                        belonging to others, except such as the Highway Robber feels when he calls
                        upon his victim to 'stand and deliver.' They are not content with
                        disfranchising all the white citizens of Virginia, who are excluded from
                        voting under the Reconstruction acts of Congress <emph rend="italic"
                            >so-called</emph>. They are not content with prescribing to all
                        office-holders, an oath which requires them to swear that in a gigantic
                        struggle of four years duration, which involved everything worth living for,
                        they gave no aid and felt no sympathy with their State or their kindred. But
                        it is gravely proposed to the people of Virginia, the land owners and
                        property holders of the State, to confer, by their votes, the right of
                        suffrage on all the adult male negroes now here, or who, emigrating here
                        from other States, shall reside six months, excepting only idiots, lunatics,
                        felons and not excepting paupers. Was ever such a proposition submitted to
                        any people before? Do the Bowdens, Porters, Baynes, <emph rend="italic">ed
                            id omne genus</emph> take us to be dogs, and expect us, spaniel-like, to
                        lick the hand that smites us? Are they not satisfied with subjecting all the
                        intellect and public virtue of the State--all the talent and all the
                        decency, to the rude and ruthless dominion of the ignorant, the depraved and
                        corrupt? Shall our oppressed and poverty stricken people be <sic>re
                        required</sic>, by their own votes, to surrender the little remnant of their
                        property to the keeping of lazy, thriftless, black paupers? When a
                        proposition was submitted in the Constitutional Convention, <emph
                            rend="italic">so called</emph> to require the voter to pay his taxes
                        before he could exercise the privilege, it was indignantly denounced by a
                        sable orator, upon the ground that such a provision would virtually
                        disfranchise a large majority of the blacks in the State. We have the
                        authority of this bright and shining light for saying that the adoption of
                        the proposed Constitution will subject the property-holders of the State to
                        the irresponsible rule of ignorant paupers.--The official returns from a
                        number of counties, indifferently selected from the several sections of the
                        State, will enable us to form a fair estimate of the <emph rend="italic"
                            >property stake</emph> which the negroes have in the community.</p>
                    <p>The returns made for the year 1866 from the counties of Augusta, Rockbridge,
                        Albemarle, Louisa, Prince George, Sussex, Elizabeth City, York, Prince
                        William, Loudon, Botetourt, Washington, Wythe, Halifax and Henry show that
                        the entire tax assessed on the property of negroes in those fifteen counties
                        was $139.09, that the poll tax assessed upon them when added to this
                        property tax made an aggregate of $4,503.96, of which $3,051.71 was not
                        collectable and returned delinquent. In view of these palpable facts, how
                        can our people hesitate as to the path of duty and of safety? We admonish
                        them by all the sacred memories of the past, and all the priceless interest
                        of the present, and all the fond hopes of the future, that the time has come
                        for <emph rend="italic">action</emph>, if they would save themselves and
                        their State from the most monstrous political outrage ever perpetrated upon
                        any people."</p>

                        Conservative speakers should be upon the stump. Their voices should be heard
                        in thunder tones in every neighborhood. It is absolutely necessary that the

                        obliterate. For example, all the chicken hearted and white livered men will

                        in making a fight' and this class can only be moved by the pressure of
                        public opinion. We <emph rend="italic">know</emph> that dangerous influences
                        are at work, and we say to our local managers that they cannot take the

                    <p>That this mysterious organization exists in our midst there can be but little
                        doubt. It is said that there was a truly ghostly gathering of unknown beings
                        in the cemetery on Thursday night last, and that very strange noises were
                        heard. A number of our citizens have received curious circulars directed in
                        characters of blood.</p>
                    <p>On Friday, we found the following lying on the desk of our office:</p>
                    <p>K. K. K.</p>
                    <p>Gather, come gather where the graveyard yawns,</p>
                    <p>At the hour when the moon is in her horns;</p>
                    <p>When the wary world sleeps and the owlet screams</p>
                    <p>And the blood-red light of our lantern streams</p>
                    <p>The mystic tie is in the firm grip</p>
                    <p>Of our bony hands! and never a lip</p>
                    <p>Shall utter a sound that revealeth to men</p>
                    <p>Of our secret doings--or where and when</p>
                    <p>The dead speak not--but the graveyard moans,</p>
                    <p>And there is a shaking among the dry bones;</p>
                    <p>The hour is nigh when clouds shall weep blood,</p>
                    <p>And a howl will be heard o'er the land and flood;</p>
                    <p>Take heed then, ye knaves, for lo! it is written</p>
                    <p>In the fullness of time the strong shall be smitten.</p>
