                <summary>The paper praises Grant for the terms of surrender he offered Lee at
                    Appomattox, and hopes that is an indication of his stance toward the Confederate
                    people. "No man knows better than he does, that Gen. Lee would never have
                    surrendered his sword, if it had been understood that the people whom he
                    represented were to be subjected to African domination."</summary>

                    <p>The Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">Virginian</emph> is gratified to observe,
                        even among those who opposed the election of Gen. Grant, -- chiefly on
                        account of his surroundings, -- a very general expression in favor of giving
                        him a fair trial. This feeling, we hope, will animate every citizen of the
                        republic -- all who sincerely desire the restoration of a real, abiding
                        peace, with the enjoyment of former happiness and prosperity. Rarely has any
                        incumbent of the Presidential office had higher incentives before him to
                        pursue a kind and conciliatory course -one calculated to bind the whole
                        people in the bonds of fraternal union. If Gen. Taylor could say that he had
                        "no friends to reward and no enemies to punish," his successor, like
                        himself, coming from the ranks of the nation's defenders, and in no wise
                        involved in the meshes of partisan policies, can well afford to discard
                        party, and know only his whole country. If he shall do this, he will receive
                        the earnest support of men who care no thing for office, and desire only to
                        be protected in all their laudable undertakings. The South will, in that
                        event, sustain him as cordially as the North or West, and we may once more
                        witness an "era of good feeling."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The people of Augusta are a live people. -- They are a sagacious people. In
                        most things they understand their interests, and they lack neither the
                        liberality nor public spirit to pursue them with intelligent energy. But
                        upon one point, it must be admitted, they have not shown their usual good
                        sense. They have not given sufficient attention to the leading thoroughfare
                        extending from Staunton to remote parts of the county.</p>
                    <p>Good roads add greatly to the value of the real estate adjacent to, or near
                        them. If any one doubts this, he has only to look to the lands along, and
                        near to the Valley turnpike. These lands are worth from $50 to $100 per
                        acre, while lands quite as good, remote from good roads, will not bring half
                        those prices. With good roads, farmers can haul twice as much to and from
                        market as they can over bad ones, and with much less injury to their horses,
                        gear, and wagons. They can make their trips in much shorter times, and they
                        can haul over a McAdam road when they can not over a common road. In this
                        way farmers can employ their teams and wagons on good roads when they would
                        otherwise be idle.</p>
                    <p>With solid paved roads, farmers can get to Church regularly, and their
                        families can visit among their friends, and go to town, when otherwise they
                        would be kept at home by the impassable condition of the roads. It is
                        hazarding little to say that a good McAdam road leading from Staunton to any
                        part of the county will add from $10 to $20 per acre to the value of all
                        lands bordering on, or near to it. This enhancement will be greatly more
                        than sufficient to pay the cost of the road.</p>
                    <p>Good roads promote intercourse and trade of all kinds. Give us good roads
                        from remote parts of the county, and you will soon see what an impetus it
                        will give to the prosperity of the town. It brings the people nearer, in
                        time, to town and enables them to do, in one day, and in one trip, what now
                        requires two.</p>
                    <p>Let our people ponder this matter, and take steps to remedy the evils under
                        which they now labor.</p>
                    <p>"Rome was not built in a day," neither can all the roads we want, be made at
                        once. But let us make a beginning. Let us turn the matter over in our minds,
                        and see what can be done, and how, and when, it can be done.</p>
                    <p>Our present road system is a very bad one. Roads which ought to be laid out
                        for the public benefit, are made subordinate to the interests and often to
                        the whims, of individuals.</p>
                    <p>A man takes it into his head that he wants the road on his line, or changed
                        so as to throw one of his fields on the side next to his house, and
                        forthwith he gets up a petition -- has it referred to his friend, the road
                        commissioners, who knows little and cares less about the public convenience.
                        The petitioner and commissioner ride over and view the proposed change,
                        return to the petitioner's house to dinner -- take a drink -- talk it over
                        at the dinner table, and, in due time, the report comes in, and is
                        confirmed, and in a few weeks the neighbors find the old road fenced up, and
                        themselves turned round Robin Hood's barn!</p>
                    <p>This is all wrong. Nobody has any security how long a road is to remain where
                        it now is. People can't buy a farm with any assurance that the old highway,
                        which may have been an inducement to them to buy, may remain where it is.</p>
                    <p>Roads should be permanent things. They should be located on the best and
                        shortest routes, and when made, no changes should be allowed except on three
                        months' notice to the public, so that everybody could be heard, and the
                        subject fully canvassed and understood.</p>
                    <p>Competent engineers -- men skilled in their profession -- should be employed
                        to locate the great thoroughfare, and then they should be permanently
                        located and permanently constructed.</p>
                    <p>We now have the Greenville, the Middlebrook, the Parkersburg, the Jennings
                        Gap, the Springhill and the Valley Turnpike, well located. The Greenville,
                        the Parkersburg and the Valley are turnpikes and beyond the control of the
                        county. The Waynesborough road is badly located, in may respects, but still
                        it may do. But all the other main roads are abominably laid out. Take for
                        example the road to Mount Meridian and to Sherando. -- They are both steep
                        and circuitous. And so it is with many other roads of great importance.</p>
                    <p>The first step towards improvement is for the County Court to determine what
                        roads need material changes, and then to select competent engineers to
                        locate them. Mr. Pratt, the engineer who laid off the Fair Grounds, and who
                        has taken up his abode in Augusta, is a skillful practical engineer. So are
                        Major Hotchkiss and Mr. E. M. Taylor. Why cannot these gentlemen be selected
                        by the Court to make a general reconnoisance of the County, with a view to
                        advise the Court what changes of roads are necessary for the public
                        interests? When their report comes in, the Court can decide intelligently
                        what to do.</p>
                    <p>When a system has been agreed on, let the town and county unite in carrying
                        it into effect. The town can McAdamize each road a mile out of town, and
                        there the county authorities can take it up, and extend the mettling two or
                        three miles each year, until they secure good roads to every neighborhood.
                        When people look at the matter in a proper light, they will enter, with
                        spirit, into it. They will not only claim no damages, but aid in the
                        construction. Who will be willing to continue plunging, winter after winter
                        and spring after spring, along our bottomless mud roads, when he sees a
                        reasonable prospect of having a solid McAdam road on which he can drive 6 or
                        8 miles per hour at all seasons, and haul 24 barrels of flour instead of 5!</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped our people will take this subject into serious
                        consideration. The object of this article is to invite inquiry -- to
                        stimulate the practical business men of our county to lay hold of the
                        subject. Some may say our suggestions are crude. Granted! Now let other men
                        more competent to deal with the subject come forward, and give us wiser and
                        more maturely considered plans. We want action -- wise action -- energetic
                        action. We are tired of inactivity. Let us show there is life in the old
                        land yet. PROGRESS.</p>
