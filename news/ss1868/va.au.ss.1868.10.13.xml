                <transcript>
                    <p>A few weeks ago, we offered some suggestions in reference to the great
                        importance of having good county roads, and expressed the opinion that the
                        present system of calling out the farmers and others several times in the
                        year to work a day or two on the roads would not secure such roads as are
                        needed. The fact that the views expressed in this article have been endorsed
                        by journals in all portions of the State shows that that mode is radically
                        wrong, and that it is attended with similar bad results in all parts of the
                        State. As a consequence, the county roads in every county in the State are
                        in a bad condition, the value of lands in them thereby greatly depreciated.
                        As we said before, we repeat that no investment of a similar amount would
                        pay so well as that invested in the improvement of the county roads, which
                        should be put in good condition and kept so by having a few workmen
                        constantly upon them. This is so evident that any argument in support of it
                        seems to be wholly unnecessary. We will mention one fact -- and it is well
                        known that a fact is worth a ship load of arguments -- which we have learned
                        since the other article upon the subject was published. A worthy and
                        intelligent citizen of this county, the owner of very valuable property,
                        told us that a Northern man wished to purchase his farm and mill. He was
                        pleased with the property, wished <sic>too</sic> purchase it, and did not
                        think the price to much. But after examining the roads leading from that
                        property to Staunton and other points, he declined to offer more than a sum
                        $5,000 less than the owner asked for it, and that much less than he would
                        have given had the roads from that property been good. The amount that this
                        worthy citizen thus lost in consequence of these bad roads would, if
                        judiciously expended, put a number of the county roads in good order. This
                        case not only illustrates, but establishes the truth of the proposition we
                        maintain, to wit: That bad roads greatly depreciate the value of lands and
                        other property, and that the best investment which our farmers could make
                        would be that of a sufficient sum, obtained by a small tax upon each, to put
                        and keep in good condition all the county roads.</p>
                    <p>We again call upon our intelligent farmers -- and no county has more of them
                        than Augusta -- to reflect some upon this subject and to give expression to
                        their views through our columns.</p>

                <summary>The Spectator again argues that investment in the improvement of Augusta's
                    county roads would be wise, and claims that the poor quality of roads dissuaded
                    a Northern man from buying property in Augusta.</summary>

                    <p>The infamous carpet baggers who have infested the South since the war, have
                            <sic>practised</sic> deception upon the poor deluded negroes by
                        promising them that they would be given by the Radicals forty acres of land.
                        The Conservatives made them no such deceptive promises. They are the only
                        true friends of the negro and do more for him than they promise. It is
                        certainly in the interest of the negro to act with and to keep upon friendly
                        terms with the great body of the whites of the South. In illustration of
                        this fact we will state that the Conservatives of Marion, South Carolina,
                        have purchased and presented to each of the fifteen negroes who had the
                        courage to go to the polls and vote with and for their old masters, with the
                        title deeds to forty acres of good land near that town.</p>

                    to the Freedmen without delivering on that promise. At the same time,
                    Conservatives have often donated land to the Freedmen.</summary>

                    <p>The Radicals, says the Charlottesville <emph rend="italic">Chronicle</emph>,
                        exempt the rich people of New England from their share in the burdens of
                        taxation, and destroy the ability of the South to pay their former
                        proportion by unjust legislation. They keep up the army and the Freedman's
                        Bureau, at the South, so as to make that section a source of expense, when
                        it would, under more favorable circumstances, be a fruitful source of
                        income. The country wants peace and an economical administration, and unless
                        it gets these, a financial crash must follow, which will prostrate the
                        business of the whole country.</p>
                    <p>There is an evident necessity for a change. -- If Seymour is elected, we know
                        that we will have it; if Grant is elected, we have no reason to suppose that
                        affairs will not run on in their old channel, and if they do, bankruptcy and
                        ruin must follow. We believe that the people of the North see these things
                        and will act on them, unless the Radicals succeed in blinding their eyes
                        upon the facts of the case, by exciting a furor against the South, which
                        they are now using every effort to do. Their papers are filled with false
                        statements of Southern outrages, to draw off attention from their own
                        extravagance and fraud. The Democrats should be untiring in their efforts to
                        expose the falseness of the one and the extent of the other.</p>

                        "hauling up" at any town or "burg" half so lively or cheerful as Staunton.
                        There's a business like air and go aheadativeness about the town and its
                        inhabitants, that is truly refreshing to witness, these dull, stagnant
                        times. Its march of improvement is onward; streets "reconstructed," new
                        buildings going up, property increasing in value, the enterprise and spirit
                        of her merchants and public men, its fine quiet location, free from any
                        disturbing elements -- its fine healthy situation, in a cultivated and
                        refined selection, accessibility of the town, &amp;c. render this "city

                    <p>Great preparations are being made for the Augusta Agricultural fair, which is
                        to be held here, commencing October 27th, and continuing for three
                        consecutive days. The fair grounds are beautifully and eligibly located,
                        half a mile from town, and W. A. Pratt, Esq. is putting everything into
                        thorough order for the anticipated "big show" of the season. The great
                        productive Valley of Virginia -- rich in minerals, fruitful in stock, and
                        blessed with a race of noble men and fair and virtuous women, whose price is
                        above rubies -- will swell the exhibition into one of undue dimensions, and
                        the fair will be one worth seeing and to be talked about for years to come.

                        Since the withdrawal of Federal troops from this place, and the
