                    <p>Our Fair may now be regarded as <unclear>a</unclear> fact accomplished -- an
                        established Institution.</p>
                    <p>The Fair Grounds, which have been bought and paid for, contain over twenty
                        acres of land lying within three quarters of a mile of the Court House from
                        which they are reached by a road of singular beauty following the course of
                        Lewis' Creek and passing in full view of the beautiful grounds of the
                        Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. The shape of the grounds is
                        so admirably suited to the purposes of the Fair to make us wonder why they
                        have not always been so used, and yet it would be difficult to find anywhere
                        a prettier landscape than is presented by the little Valley nestling among
                        the surrounding hills.</p>
                    <p>It would be unreasonable to expect the fitting up of such an establishment to
                        be complete in all its parts in time for the first Fair -- but we are
                        assured that under the energetic and efficient direction of Mr. Wm. A Pratt,
                        such progress has already been made as to render it certain that the
                        beautiful trotting course will be ready and that sufficient buildings will
                        be provided for the comfortable accommodation of Exhibitors and Visitors. To
                        develop fully the great beauty of the place and to fit it thoroughly and
                        permanently as Fair Ground, Park and Pleasure Grounds is a work which
                        requires time and taste and money.</p>
                    <p>We are gratified to learn that already over Fifteen Thousand Dollars have
                        been raised by subscription among our people for this excellent purpose, and
                        we doubt not that Augusta county will be found both able and willing to
                        provide whatever sum may be found necessary for a work which seems to have
                        taken a strong hold upon popular favor.</p>
                    <p>The first Fair takes place on the 27th, 28th, and 29th of this month, and
                        from all parts of the county we hear notes of busy preparation. The Premium
                        lists and Programme which have been published present an attractive Bill of
                        Fare, and we have no doubt that the entertainment will fully equal the
                        public expectation.</p>
                    <p>We have reason to expect fine displays of Implements and machinery from
                        Richmond and Baltimore, and a number of herds of fine Stock have been
                        promised from different parts of the State. <emph rend="italic">If our own
                            county people will only determine to bring to the Fair the best they
                            have, and at all events to bring something,</emph> we will have an
                        exhibition worth seeing.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to see that the Directors of the Fair are disposed to regard
                        money premiums as of subordinate importance and value. We only wish they
                        would abolish them altogether and let the people compete for the
                        gratification of success, and the reputation due to merit.</p>
                    <p>The address of Commodore Maury is a great feature in the programme. He has
                        more reputation as a man of Science, the world over, than any man in
                        America, and he is now devoting his great talents to the industrial and
                        material development of Virginia. A talk from him will be worth hearing.</p>
                    <p>We hope to see at the Fair the greatest turn out of the people of Augusta
                        county that has ever been known. If the men and women and children of Old
                        Augusta meet together in mass, it will be a sight which of itself will
                        attract thousands from abroad, who wish to see the sturdy yeomanry, who in
                        war or in peace are earnest in purpose, and steady in action.</p>

                    <p>THE VALLEY PRODUCE TRADE. -- To one who was familiar with the business
                        transacted at the depot at Staunton, in produce trade, months ago, and who
                        has had his attention directed to the amount shipped from that point the
                        present fall, it is very clear that the penetration of the lower Valley by
                        the Manassas Gap Railroad, has had a very deleterious effect upon the trade
                        of the "City of the Hills." -- Since the cars have been running to Mt.
                        Jackson, nearly all the produce of Rockingham and most of that of Northern
                        and Western Augusta has been transported to that point. When the road shall
                        have been completed to Harrisonburg, the effect will be more marked upon the
                        business of Staunton. Already it is in contemplation by several of the
                        business men of that place to remove to Harrisonburg, which is destined to
                        be the great business centre of the Valley.</p>
