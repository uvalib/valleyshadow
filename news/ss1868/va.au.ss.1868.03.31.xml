                    <p>As the Convention is drawing to a close, much interest is being felt with
                        reference to the provisions of the Constitution soon to be submitted to the
                        people of the State. It will not be satisfactory to give fragmentary parts,
                        imperfectly reported by the Richmond papers, but we will await the
                        conclusion of the performance, and submit the whole. Enough has been
                        accomplished to foreshadow its real features, which are sufficient to rouse
                        the people to efforts to accomplish its defeat. Radical changes are proposed
                        for the government and control of our country affairs -- new features which
                        reflect the views of the Northern element which has crept into the
                        convention, which propose to abolish our county system and adopt the
                        Township mode of county government of some of the Northern States.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the clause disfranchising a large portion of the white population,
                        and enfranchising the negroes, sufficient changes are proposed to defeat the
                        constitution before the people. The old systems of courts and county
                        organizations, which have so long answered the ends of justice, and supplied
                        the wants of our people, will not, in obedience to the orders of government,
                        imported by the few itinerant yankee adventurers who accidently got into the
                        convention.</p>
                    <p>A few white voters may be found, sufficiently fanatical to endorse these
                        innovations, if they can, by it, fasten upon our people the curse of negro
                        suffrage and negro political equality -- but the thinking men of the
                        Republican or Radical party, whose reasons are not entirely swayed by
                        feelings of revenge and hatred to the white race of Virginia, who think
                        proper to differ with them, will refuse to make the sacrifice. Apart from
                        the odious features of negro suffrage and negro admissibility to juries, the
                        magisterial offices, and the legislature of the State, there will be found
                        enough in this new Constitution -- a cross of the yankee and the negro -- to
                        disgust all honorable and high minded Virginians. And when you add to these
                        objectionable features, the deep disgrace and injustice of attempting to
                        lower the standard of the white man to the negro, (as it is a moral and
                        intellectual impossibility to elevate him to the Anglo-Saxon,) by decreeing
                        as this constitution will, if adopted, that all the leading statesmen, and a
                        great body of the intelligent and refined portion of the white population
                        shall be disfranchised, to give the negroes sufficient power to place
                        themselves, or their white tools and sycophants in control, very many who
                        have been classed with Republicans and Radicals will spurn the wicked
                        alliance and stand up in defence of their race and the honor of the State.
                        This crusade against the intelligence and power of the State, as represented
                        in our white population, is arousing the feelings of the people, and their
                        determination is rapidly assuming such organized forms as will utterly
                        defeat this constitutional scheme of oppression and wrong. The people are
                        becoming aware to their condition and the dangers which threaten them, and
                        if we do not mistake the signs of the times, thousands who sided with the
                        radical faction will vote to defeat the radical constitution.</p>
                    <p>Each county and precinct should prepare for the contest -- each individual
                        should feel the voice of his State upon him to put forth all his efforts to
                        save his people -- to save his family, and the fate of his posterity from
                        the withering mortification and disgrace which this party is preparing to
                        force upon us. These issues are big with consequences personal to each of
                        us, and demand that we should at once prepare to defeat the attempts to
                        crush the spirit, manhood, and intelligence of the people.</p>
                    <p>Are we doing our duty? Are we organized in this county? Have the precinct
                        committees attended to the duties committed to their care? Are you
                        impressing upon the people the importance of the election soon to be ordered
                        by the <unclear>power</unclear> that rules us? This contest, in magnitude
                        and importance, is far above a mere political or partisan conflict. The
                        issue is <emph rend="italic">shall the white or negro race rule this
                        State</emph>. Deny this as they may, this is the grave and stubborn fact
                        which confronts us. That party or faction has no material strength but for
                        the negro -- <emph rend="italic">it rests mainly upon their votes for its
                            success</emph> and must and will yield and bend to the will of that race
                        if it get the power. The negro, through their agency, will as effectually
                        control the State as if they held the offices. Let them, by your neglect or
                        indifference, adopt the proposed question, and then your leading men -- your
                        men of intelligence, experience in business, those to whom you look for
                        counsel, will be thrown aside to give the negro and his political associates
                        the offices and posts of trust to rule and govern you. Are you ready and
                        willing for this?</p>

                    <p>The importance of a thorough organization of all the force which is to oppose
                        the triumph of Radicalism in the impending struggle in this State cannot be
                        overestimated.</p>
                    <p>The first thing, of course, to be done, is to see that every white man who is
                        entitled to register should do so, at the next registration, which is to
                        occur before the vote of the State upon the adoption or rejection of its new
                        Constitution, takes place.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of Virginia's citizens, for one reason or another, refused or
                        neglected to register preparatory to the election of delegates to the
                        Constitutional Convention.</p>
                    <p>The result of their negligence was that the Convention fell into the hands of
                        the State's worst enemies. Fortunately, there is yet time to repair their
                        error -- there is yet a place left for repentance -- and if they would
                        redeem their birthright, let them not be again guilty of the folly -- we had
                        almost said crime -- of failing to qualify themselves to vote on the
                        question of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>The results of the last registration in Richmond shows that we have the game
                        in our own hands, and can only lose it by our folly and inefficiency.</p>
                    <p>At the last election in Richmond the majority of blacks was reduced from 900
                        to 30. A similar result will attend the next registration over the whole
                        State if we exert ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The vote for State officers and members of Congress will occur at the same
                        time that the vote upon the Constitution is taken -- and in our opinion it
                        is advisable in order to perfect and <emph rend="italic">mobilize</emph> our
                        organization -- to give it vitality, energy, and enthusiasm, that the
                        nominations for these various offices should be made as early as
                        practicable.</p>
                    <p>Every district, county, and town in the State should be thoroughly canvassed,
                        and this will only be done effectually by candidates. -- <emph rend="italic"

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> says that any man can be relieved of
                        all disabilities in a little while who will pledge himself to give his
                        "influence and vote" to <emph rend="italic">curtailing the rights of his
                            white fellow-citizens and to enlarging and multiplying those of the
                            blacks.</emph> Indeed, had the people of the South, immediately after
                        the war, joined the Radical party, negroes would not have been made voters.
                        This was apparent at the time: but the Southern whites were not made of such
                        stuff as that.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising that there should be some who are ready to sell
                        themselves for office. -- When the greed for that seizes a man it gnaws like
                        the undying worm; and men will sell peace, honor, kin, family, and even
                        country, to appease it. It is a glory of the South that so few have thus
                        bartered the most precious jewels in this world for a thing so base.</p>
                    <p>There are no truer people in God's world than the Southern in all their
                        pledges and promises. The country can boast of none more faithful to the
                        Constitution and laws. But to gain that peace, that order, that personal
                        liberty and rights, which are denied them, they will not sell themselves.</p>
                    <p>It is for such as would continue the prostration of these people --- for such
                        as would shave down the rights of Southern white men and transfer the ruling
                        power to ignorant negroes and depraved interloping whites -- to pay the
                        price exacted by the Congressional Algerines for ransom. Such men may take
                        their way -- verily they have their reward.</p>

                    <p>When every thing around looks dark and lowering, says the Charlottesville
                            <emph rend="italic">Chronicle</emph>, it is refreshing to be able to
                        point to even one little ray of hope. We must carry the State and defeat the
                        Negro Constitution, or Virginia will not be a place, fit for a white man to
                        live in.</p>
                    <p>This is what we want, so that the Northern people who now control our
                        destinies more than we do ourselves, may be aroused to the iniquity of negro
                        domination at the South -- and may learn to understand that it is fatal to
                        their interests as it is to ours. To do this the white men must be aroused,
                        that no means may be omitted by which one vote may be gained, in behalf of
                        white rule, or one prevented on the side of negro-radicals. That they are
                        aroused in Richmond is proved by the result of the recent registration. If
                        similar exertions are made throughout the State, we are safe. The Radicals
                        themselves think that the probabilities of success are on our side. Surely
                        there is enough to stimulate every man to do his duty, and enough
                        encouragement to make every one work with a cheerful spirit. Let the
                        captains of fifties, and of tens, do their duty. -- Let all others urge them
                        forward and aid them in their endeavors -- and we will be able to look
                        forward hopefully to a time when Virginians will be as free as of yore --
                        and not down-trodden outcasts, at the mercy of their former slaves. -- Read
                        what the <emph rend="italic">Norfolk Virginian</emph> says of the result in
                        Richmond:</p>
                    <p>"The white man's battle flag was driven back in Richmond at the previous
                        registration, but it has now gone forward, and is planted far in advance of
                        its former position. At the former registration the negro majority in our
                        State capital was 961, and it is now only thirty-six? The returns show an
                        increase of 1,511 white votes, and 586 of blacks. There is both cheer and
                        warning for us in this. It shows that the reserve strength of the State is
                        coming up -- Blucher and his 30,000 to turn the tide -- and we feel very
                        confident that in every town and county, every mountain, valley, and lowland
                        plain, the white men of the State will come forward to defend by the only
                        means left to them -- the ballot -- the last shadow of liberty that remains
                        to us. Viewed in this respect, the picture is cheering, and we hail our
                        brethren of Richmond with a heart full of honest satisfaction at the
                    result.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The intrepid valor which flamed in the van of the old Army of Northern
                        Virginia for four long years, and which piled so many battlefields with dead
                        invaders, and hurled so many mighty Federal armies, broken and utterly
                        demoralized, from our soil, still animates the heroic white men of Virginia.
                        The standing menace of the bayonet has alone prevented them from teaching
                        the infamous herd at the Capitol that the rule of the negro and of the
                        bummers of Butler is impossible in a State where centuries of greatness
                        attest to the virtues of the white race. And the fact must be kept before
                        these vile miscreants that the moment the protection of the soldier is
                        withdrawn, the white men of Virginia will teach them that this is not a
                        State where the negro can rule, as in Hayti or Dahomey.</p>
                    <p>We shall dishonor the memory of our dead heroes, we shall be unworthy of the
                        fame of our forefathers, we shall merit the scorn of our noble women, and
                        deserved to be hanged in chains by posterity, if we do not keep the fact
                        before the Radical rascals at the Capitol, that their work will be trampled
                        under foot the minute it is deprived of the protection of the soldier.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">The first and most important duty of every Virginian to
                            his race, State and section, at this time, is a determined resistance,
                            either passive or active, to every attempt of the "Convention" to have
                            its infamous ordinances obeyed, unless they are enforced by the
                        bayonet.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>The negro must be convinced that without the support of the soldier he shall
                        not disfranchise the white race. The squatters and bummers must be taught
                        that it is only safe for them to pillage in the rear of the Federal armies,
                        as they did when Lee and Jackson hunted them like hares.</p>
                    <p>Let the white men of Virginia bear in mid that their avowed enemies at the
                        Capitol have no other objects in view than our disfranchisement and
                        spoliation. They are just as intent upon our ruin as when they rummaged with
                        Butler and ran with Pope and McDowell. -- Pretending to represent our
                        people, their hostility is more implacable than was that of the soldiery who
                        laid waste to the State with fire and sword.</p>
                    <p>When the soldier, sated with slaughter, laid aside his arms and manifested a
                        noble sympathy with a brave, but unfortunate people, these wretches dashed
                        at the throats of disarmed warriors and sought to strip them of political
                        rights which they have given to their late slaves.</p>
                    <p>The first attempt of these men to compel voluntary obedience to negro rule,
                        will, no doubt, be in the shape of an ordnance taxing the objects of their
                        malice and hate. Having no property, and no interests in common with the
                        property holders of the State, it is idle to hope for an adjournment of the
                        "Convention" as long as they can wring money from their intended
                    victims.</p>
