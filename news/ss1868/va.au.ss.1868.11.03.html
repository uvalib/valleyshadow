                    <p>Who could witness the exercises of the Augusta County Fair held here on
                        Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday last, without predicting for this
                        organization a brilliant future? The thousands assembled, including the
                        solid experience of age, and the ardent ambition of youth, cannot fail to
                        give character to the institution throughout the Valley; while the display
                        of domestic manufactures, and of improved farming implements, could not fail
                        to impress all present with the conviction that our Virginia Farmers are on
                        the road to independence.</p>
                    <p>An old negro in Albemarle county, looking at a mowing machine at work in a
                        field of clover, is said to have exclaimed, "De white folks won't want us
                        darkeys presently. Dese machines gwine do every thing. Den what we darkeys
                        gwine do for a home, hey? Tell me dat. I tell you, dis nigger gwine to work
                        now, while he can get it." Had he been at this exhibition, he would have had
                        his apprehensions abundantly confirmed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Broaddus, Secretary for the Soldiers' Children, was present on Thursday.
                        Many contributed something to the noble work he is engaged in. But other
                        matters so occupied the immense crowd, that he could speak to only
                        comparatively a few. Would it not be well for all
                        who did not get a chance to contribute to this work, to send him a donation
                        by mail? -- The children are put into the schools most convenient to them,

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the Constitution is the basis of freedom and liberties in
                    America, and should be protected as such.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The rational freedom which was enjoyed in America prior to the war was
                        founded upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States. There
                        can never be a restoration of the liberties and franchise of the people, nor
                        can republican government be long maintained on the continent except upon
                        the basis of the Constitution of our fathers. This is a serious truth that
                        every American whether enfranchised or disfranchised, should seriously
                        reflect upon. If it is steadily kept in view, many a politician would save
                        himself from the disgrace of frequent tergiversations, which he must be ever
                        exhibiting if he persists in seeking safety in policy merely. Principles are
                        eternal. -- Truth is ever mighty. The Constitution is the only anchor upon
                        which we can hang a hope for American liberty.</p>
