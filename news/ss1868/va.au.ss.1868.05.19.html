<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The question, who is to be the Conservative candidate for the Presidency, is
                        beginning to occupy a large share of public attention. In view of recent
                        events, it has become a question of great political importance, and one, on
                        the wise determination of which the welfare of the country mainly depends.
                        It is now obvious, that if the Conservative party act wisely and
                        patriotically, discarding all mere personal preferences in the selection of
                        a candidate, and looking only to the choice of the man who combines the
                        largest elements of popularity, success must crown their efforts. But if, on
                        the other hand, they fall into contentions and strifes and bickerings, as to
                        who shall be their standard bearer, defeat, and four years more of
                        disastrous misrule, must be the consequences of their folly.</p>
                    <p>The great battle for the Constitution and free institutions is to be fought
                        in the North, and by the people of the North. The South is powerless, and
                        must continue to be so until she is restored to her rights in the Union. It
                        is therefore proper, that the North should have the right to determine who
                        shall be our candidate. They can judge better than the people of the South,
                        who is best calculated to ensure success in the North. The Southern
                        delegates to the Convention, should, therefore, say to their Northern
                        associates, "deliberate calmly, cautiously, and dispassionately -- make your
                        selection of a candidate, and we will cheerfully sustain him."</p>
                    <p>So far as the South is concerned, we wish it to be distinctly understood that
                        we have no preferences and no prejudices, in regard to men -- we will
                        sustain any sound Conservative man, whether he comes from the North, the
                        East, or the West. All we ask is, give us the man who is strong enough to
                        win. We go for success. -- What we desire above all things, is a release
                        from racial domination. The man who can most certainly accomplish that end,
                        is the man of our choice. We go for results -- we care not for the means, or
                        the men who are to achieve them. We will go for Pendleton, Hancock,
                        Doolittle, Seymour, Hendricks, or any other good man. We indulge in no
                        narrow sectional or personal jealousies. We seek to gratify no personal
                        partialities. Victory in the coming contest is our first object.</p>
                    <p>The signs of the times are all auspicious. -- They show that we can be
                        successful if we act wisely. And what a burning shame it would be, if we
                        were to hazard the result by petty squabbles about men! The issues are too
                        important for us to stop and quarrel about the merits of this or that
                        candidate. We should cultivate the broadest and most catholic spirit.
                        Everything for the cause -- nothing for men -- should be our motto. The
                        split in the Democratic party between the friends of Breckinridge and
                        Douglas, brought all the trouble on the country. Let us not repeat that
                        folly. Lincoln was a minority President. The combined votes of Douglass,
                        Breckinridge and Bell, exceeded those cast for Lincoln by nearly a million.
                        The Conservative vote now, if united, will outnumber the radical, by
                        probably more than a million.-- Shall we now by discords in our own ranks
                        allow Grant -- a minority candidate, to be elected? We trust not. When we
                        hear a conservative say, I will not support Pendleton, or Hancock, or
                        Seymour, or any other good man, we are disposed to set him down as a radical
                        ally. It matters not what his motives may be, or how much he may profess to
                        hate radicalism -- he is practically giving aid and comfort to the Radicals
                        and seeking to hold the South in subjection.--When New York men say they
                        will not support Pendleton, or Western men say that they will not sustain
                        Hancock or Seymour, what is it in effect, but saying they go for men and not
                        for principles -- for their favorites and not for the cause.</p>
                    <p>Let us then have no more of these idle declarations. Let us remember that the
                        constitution -- the cause of civil liberty -- the great interests of the
                        country are in peril. Let us remember that our first duty is to our country,
                        and our first obligation is to redeem it from tyranny and misrule. Every
                        feeling of personal partiality must be subordinated to this great end.
                        Redeem the country first, and then consult private inclinations afterwards.</p>
                    <p>We hope the Conservative Convention will come together in a spirit of mutual
                        concession and conciliation--comparing opinions honestly and fairly, with an
                        eye single to success. When victory is accomplished--when the conservative
                        party is established on a firm basis, it will be time enough to consult
                        personal preferences for men, and contend for particular lines of
                        administrative policy. Now, the question is, not how the government is to be
                        administered, but whether we are to have a government which is worth
                        preserving. We must rescue that from ruin, and settle other matters
                        afterwards. We care not what our candidate may think on this or that
                        question -- the great inquiry is, can he win the battle? Has he the capacity
                        to beat the radicals? In other words does he profess what John Randolph
                        called, "the turning out faculty?"</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our canvassers are at work with an energy which shows it will not be their
                        fault if the people do not appreciate the vital importance of the crisis.
                        The whole burden of the canvass for the common cause, should not be left to
                        fall upon the appointed "canvassers" alone. There are other gentlemen who
                        should share it with them, who have equal ability, time and means to devote
                        to it. So far Messrs. Peyton and Phillips have rendered efficient aid.</p>
                    <p>Let, too, the superintendents of districts, the chiefs of fifty, and the
                        leaders of ten, co-operate by urging the people to attend the meetings so as
                        to awaken a general interest. When the speakers go to the trouble and
                        expense necessary to get to distant points in the county, they deserve to be
                        welcomed and encouraged by good audiences.</p>
                    <p>The ladies, too, should attend. Heretofore there might have been objection to
                        ladies taking part in politics, because it tended to create controversies
                        and feelings between neighbors, when they were divided between opposing
                        political parties. But now all ladies are on the same side and can work
                        together in mutual sympathy for a cause in which they have the most vital
                        concern. If the ladies appreciate the dangers of the hour to themselves,
                        there will be few men who will dare to be laggards at this election.</p>
