                    <p>The following is a synopsis of the excellent speech delivered by Col. Baldwin
                        in the recent Conservative Convention which nominated the State ticket. Want
                        of space has prevented its publication in this paper heretofore. It will be
                        read with interest. He said:</p>
                    <p>Mr. President. -- I am well aware that I appear before this Convention under
                        very embarrassing and difficult circumstances. I should be more or less than
                        a man if I could be insensible to the manifestations of kindness and
                        confidence which I have received so frequently not only from here, but on
                        many occasions in my past life, from my friends and fellow citizens in
                        Virginia. I am, indeed, profoundly sensible of the kindness that has been
                        manifested towards me; but as my friends become more and more kind and
                        confident in me, I feel the duty of dealing with them fairly and honestly
                        increase until it becomes absolutely imperative. I feel myself under
                        obligations to return for this kindness and confidence perfect candor and
                        straight-forward integrity in dealing with them. When I was brought to the
                        notice of this Convention last night I stated at the first opportunity that
                        I was earnestly and honestly convinced that I was not the proper person for
                        this nomination. I said then what, upon more careful and calm consideration,
                        I am satisfied was true and correct, that I am not the man. There is no
                        nomination in this Commonwealth that could be bestowed upon me that I would
                        regard as a higher honor or a more flattering testimonial than the
                        nomination of this Convention. -- None whatever. And I beg to assure my
                        friends that nothing of disinclination for the labor, or the time, or the
                        sacrifices that might be necessary on the campaign mingles in this
                        conclusion to which I have arrived. I am willing to do and suffer anything
                        or everything in such a cause and at such a crisis. [Applause.] But I am
                        persuaded into absolute conviction that I am not the man for the occasion,
                        and I feel bound so to say to this body. In conveying to you the reasons
                        which have induced this conviction on my part, I hope the Convention will
                        indulge me while I make some remarks of a personal character. Whatever of
                        favor I may have gained from the people of Virginia I think is founded to
                        some extent upon some peculiarity of character, temper, and disposition on
                        my part, which while they gain me friends, occasionally leave behind me
                        enemies. I have been ever conscious that at every turn in the history of my
                        life I have been greatly indebted to the kindness and forbearance from
                        friends, who have overlooked faults and mistakes in my public career in the
                        confidence that I meant to do what was honest and right. I have received
                        this marked forbearance and high confidence from friends; but if I am put up
                        as the standard bearer of the Conservative party of Virginia I could not
                        expect such courtesy from our opponents; and every fault and every mistake
                        of my past course would be brought forward, not against me as an individual,
                        but against the party which put me in nomination, and would furnish a means
                        of diverting the attention of the people from the enormities and villainies
                        of the Constitution to the personal motives of the candidate. I have never
                        carefully preserved my record, but I feel convinced of the plain fact that
                        there may be that in it which though my friends would overlook, my enemies
                        would not. I say again, I don't believe I am the man. My friends from
                        Halifax (Mr. Edmunds) and from Pittsylvania (Mr. Sutherlin) have truly
                        presented the views with which I came to this Convention. I don't think that
                        we ought to recognize, as these gentlemen say, the idea of such a thing:
                        but, in the first place, a prudent regard for the exigencies which might
                        arise requires the selection of men who will be ready for any turn things
                        may take. We are going into a contest with a wily and unscrupulous foe.
                        Whatever we can do without a sacrifice of principle, that we are bound to do
                        in this emergency. Now, if there is a sacrifice in principle between the
                        selection of two persons, one who is eligible under the constitutional
                        amendment, and the other is not -- both true to their State -- I cannot see
                        it. I know of no sacrifice of principle in this. -- There would be a
                        sacrifice of self-respect and principle, however, in the selection of a man
                        who could take the <emph rend="italic">iron clad</emph> oath. I can readily
                        see a line of demarcation here. But as between two gentlemen, alike true
                        Virginians, who are with us in sentiment, feeling, opinions, and action --
                        between two such persons one of whom is disfranchised under the
                        constitutional amendment and the other is not. -- I say, I can see no line
                        which divides them. It is a mere question of expediency, involving no
                        sacrifice of principle in any shape that I can see. Now, take this case: I
                        am disfranchised. For what? Not because I held a position referred to by my
                        associate in that act (Mr. S. McD. Moore) in the Confederate Congress; not
                        because I commanded a regiment in the Confederate State army; but because,
                        some twenty-odd years ago, I was an alderman in the town of
                        Staunton.--[Laughter.] That is the ground of my disfranchisement. I could
                        point to men in Virginia who are not disfranchised who have committed higher
                        crimes and offenses than that of being an alderman of the town of
                        Staunton.--Take, for instance, my friend Colonel Withers, who has, I think,
                        committed several larger offenses than that; and General Walker also; yet
                        both these gentlemen, earnest as they are, determined as they are to make
                        resistance to any infringement upon the peace and honor of the State, it so
                        happens have not fallen within the prohibition of any amendment to the
                        Constitution gotten up on purely artificial principles. I see no principle
                        which divides or discriminates between them and me; but I do see expediency
                        in such discrimination. In Georgia, where a gentleman came forward who was
                        obnoxious to the Howard amendment, General Meade -- who, I suppose, is no
                        less respectable than General Schofield -- at once announced that he should
                        not run. Why not? Because he could not hold office if elected, and no votes
                        cast for him would be counted. What was the result? He had to withdraw from
                        the <unclear>contest</unclear>. Then came forward General Gordon, a man who
                        had been most conspicuous in the Confederate service -- a young officer who
                        had rendered gallant and distinguished services in the war. -- He came, and
                        was subjected to the same scrutiny, was found not to fall under any
                        constitutional amendment, and was allowed to run, and run he did. There is a
                        precedent. Suppose I was nominated -- accepted the nomination of the
                        Convention, and started upon my travels canvassing, and it was announced to
                        me that I was not a proper candidate, and I should receive from some
                        absolute Yankee soldier or official notice that if I undertook to run
                        General Schofield would have me locked up in the Libby. [Laughter.] I should
                        be placed under circumstances that would be somewhat awkward, and the
                        Convention would be placed in awkward circumstances, and the party also.</p>
                    <p>It would not do any good to say it was an outrage, because the fact that it
                        was an outrage would make no impression. All impressions from new outrages
                        have been exhausted. They have power, will, and purpose to insult and
                        outrage us in every way they can. This would be giving them a pretext not
                        for a new outrage, but for one already resorted to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Menefee -- Could you not say that you were not canvassing for office, but
                        against the Constitution?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin -- Yes: and if logic could avail anything against a Yankee, it
                        would do.-- [Laughter.] But we have been trying that long enough. Nothing
                        answers except power, numbers, and force [applause], or the motive of money.
                        [Laugher] As we have neither power, numbers, nor money, there is no use in
                        talking of argument. Suppose, then, that instead of nominating me you
                        nominate some other man. I say nothing of those now before this body. I
                        esteem both highly. Virginia is a large place, and I don't intend to discuss
                        whether either is the right man or not; but suppose you get a man who is not
                        obnoxious to the objection which applies to me, and yet could not take the
                        oath! It could not be said that he was disfranchised under the
                        reconstruction acts, because he is not. If it is said that he cannot take
                        the oath, he can reply that no obligation exists for doing so until elected,
                        and no man can whether he can or not, until that time comes. In that way
                        will be avoided any interference on the part of the military authority. --
                        There is the difficulty we avoid. It is true, the thing may turn out as my
                        friend from Halifax (Mr. Edmunds) says -- there may be a change of front, a
                        new shuffle and a new deal, and no doubt the cards will be "stocked"; but
                        the question will arise whether a man who is not disfranchised under the
                        constitutional amendment may be competent to hold office -- not merely
                        competent to run, but competent to hold office if elected. I would ask if
                        there is any deviation from principle in this matter? If, in electing a man,
                        you elect a true, honest, sound Virginian, I can see nothing degrading,
                        nothing unworthy, but everything discreet and politic in having regard to
                        this question. We must observe the fact that in this question there are
                        distinctions which will make one man available in all circumstances and
                        another man unavailable under all circumstances. -- These, gentlemen, are my
                        views, and I know they will meet the concurrence of Mr. Stuart, the
                        "brother-in-law," who has been spoken of here. I had determined at the
                        proper time to withdraw his name as well as mine, believing that neither of
                        us were suitable for candidates. To my friends who have shown their kind
                        feelings for me, I can only say again that this fact has but increased my
                        sense of the obligation imposed upon me to deal fairly and honestly with
                        this body; and entertaining these views, I must insist that my name be
                        withdrawn from the nomination. [Applause.]</p>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> is right in saying that it is all
                        important that the Conservative canvassers, candidates, presses, and party
                        appliances all should rather redouble instead of relaxing their efforts
                        during the next two months. The State can be saved, and will be, but it
                        cannot and will not be unless every man does his duty, and his whole duty.
                        Every single vote now registered should be brought out to the polls, and
                        when the registration lists are re-opened every name should be enrolled
                        which is not now enrolled, but is entitled to be. Our friends must remember
                        that we shall have to overcome not only the negro and scallawag vote really
                        and lawfully polled, but that our victory will have to be so decided and
                        overwhelming that we cannot possibly be cheated out of it in the count.
                        These are plain words, but the times demand plain speaking, and the
                        experience of our fellow citizens further South has shown that the
                        suspicions which our words imply are by no means groundless.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>DEAR SIRS -- I have just been reading your excellent paper of March 24th, and
                        how I wish that <emph rend="italic">every white man</emph> in the South
                        could have it to read, and would profit by the excellent advice which it
                        gives.</p>
                    <p>Some of my friends write me that they take no part in politics, but let
                        matters take their course. In return I write and tell them that, as long as
                        I can walk or speak, I intend to vote against the destroyers of our peace.
                        With you, I hope that every white man who has a spark of honor in him will
                        do his whole duty. I hope this Fall will dethrone the Rump from Vice
                        President to Poundmaster.</p>
                    <p>The political signs are bright for the Democracy of this State, and we hope
                        to prove it by a good round majority for Pendleton, or some other good
                        Democratic President.</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spectator</emph> has come regularly since my brother
                        subscribed for me. I am so thankful for it. It contains many things of great
                        interest to me. It comes as an old friend and feels a warm welcome. I have
                        been absent from Dear Old Virginia twelve years and five months, and know
                        well how to appreciate a paper which speaks as the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spectator</emph> does in favor of the South and against her oppressors.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be a blessing if "some chosen curse" &amp;c., would
                        "blast" the lives and souls of such old renegade bastards, as J. M. Botts,
                        and some others in the South. The old gray headed traitor, is lost to every
                        sense of honor.</p>
                    <p>Hoping your good paper may continue its good work, and that it may visit many
                        of its Old Virginia friends now in California, and that the people of the
                        South may soon shake off the tyrant's chains, and be again a happy people. I
                        close by wishing the <emph rend="italic">Spectator</emph> folk all the
                        happiness they may desire.</p>
                    <p> Yours truly,<lb/> C.C. PAULY</p>

                    <p>The exigency and peril of Virginia demand that her sons shall come to her
                        defence with all their might and with all their spirit. All that we hold
                        dear -- the honor and glory of the State -- the peace, order, and dignity of
                        society -- the public welfare and general prosperity of the community -- are
                        at stake. If for their preservation we cannot give our labor and means, then
                        are we unworthy of the blessings of freedom and good government. Men of
                        Virginia, to arms! To the rescue of your honored mother, whose
                        <sic>renown</sic> is unequaled on this continent! Vindicate your rights, and
                        your title to predominance in public affairs. To these objects, worthy of
                        the noblest exertions, give your hearts and hands with a devotion equal to
                        the exigency, and you will triumph. You will secure peace and prosperity to
                        yourselves, order and dignity to the State, and restore Virginia to her
                        proud eminence among the States of the Union. Fail in this, and public
                        dishonor, private misfortune, State decay, social humiliation and disgrace,
                        must ensue -- and the proud Commonwealth of the Ancient Dominion will
                        decline into insignificance, leaving no trace of her former glory! --<emph

                    tour of the state by invitation of the Executive Committee of the Virginia
                    Republican Party. In Staunton he debated A. H. H. Stuart, who the paper declares
                    the unquivocal victor. Ela "was a subject of amusement for the whites and of
                    mortification to the negroes, who felt ashamed of their Congressional Champion.
                    There were several negroes in the audience who could make better speeches and
                    speak better English." Stuart responded with an eloquent speech, "addressed
                    chiefly to the colored portion of the audience."</summary>

                    <p>Those efficient speakers who have been so industriously engaged for the past
                        several weeks in making Conservative speeches in nearly every part of this
                        county, report that the people are becoming properly impressed with the
                        imperative duty of rejecting the tax and negro Constitution. They report
                        that those white men who voted for the Convention will vote against the
                        Constitution, as they did not vote for the Convention to frame such an
                        abominable Constitution, and report also that some of the negroes are
                        beginning to appreciate the fact that they too should vote against the
                        Constitution. This good old county, we are assured, will acquit itself nobly
                        on the day of election. The offices of registration will be opened 14 days
                        before the election, when all who failed to register before should be sure
                        to register.</p>
