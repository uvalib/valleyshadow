                    <p>As the funds of the treasury are getting low, and the money appropriated for
                        the Convention approaches exhaustion, that delectable body is becoming quite
                        economical, and has entered upon retrenchment. It will be seen that the
                        services of the stenographer, and the clerks of committees have been
                        dispensed with. The stenographer, it seems, has already drawn from the
                        treasury the sum of $4,395.60. -- With the exception of repudiating
                        repudiation, that body has done but little, if anything, worthy of a word of
                        commendation. In reference to this unexpected action upon the subject of the
                        repudiation, the Lynchburg News says:</p>
                    <p>"Let no one hereafter assert that the Convention has done nothing -- let none
                        aver that all its deeds are evil. One oasis

                        the darkness of the Bones and Banjo Convention. We bow, with cap in hand, to
                        the wisdom, the reverence for the Constitution, and the regard for the
                        obligations of commercial and personal honor, which the vote indicates. Let

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A negro standing on the streets of Lynchburg bare-foot on one of the coldest
                        mornings of this Winter, in reply to the inquiry why he went bare-foot in
                        such cold weather, said : "Ise free now, and does jest as I d-----n please."
                        That's the kind of freedom that emancipation has conferred upon the poor
                        negro. He is free to starve, freeze, go naked, and die. This is the boon,
                        so-called, conferred upon the negroes of the South by the policy of the
                        Radicals of the North. They have no sympathy with the negroes in the
                        distress brought upon them by their policy. They witness their sufferings
                        without an emotion of pity. They say to them, "you are free, now root pig or
                        die" -- cherishing, doubtless, a secret wish that they would die. The sins
                        of the Radicals are great and numerous. They are piled up like Pelion upon

<b>President Johnson and Gen. Grant</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article asserting that General Grant is guilty of insubordination in his
                    dealings with Johnson.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We published last week an abstract of the correspondence between President
                        Johnson and Gen'l Grant which was called for by Congress and submitted
                        before the ink was dry upon Gen'l Grant's letter of Feb. 3rd - the object
                        being to get the correspondence before Congress and the country before the
                        President could reply to Gen'l Grant's most important letter.--This was a
                        scurry trick, and so transparent that the people cannot fail to see it. As
                        sure as there is virtue in the great mass of the people, it will have the
                        effect to injure Grant instead of the President. Grant has reason to
                        exclaim: "Save me from my friends!" The Radicals have effectually entrapped
                        Grant. No man of prominence ever before occupied a more embarrassing
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Since our last issue, the reply of the President to Grant's letter of the 3rd
                        inst., has been published, together with the letters of the five members of
                        the Cabinet who were present at the interview between Gen'l Grant and
                        President Johnson on the 14th ult., all of whom sustain the statements of
                        the President. As the New York World says, "it is
                        not easy to conceive of a position in which a man who values the good
                        opinion of the world would be placed, more mortifying to his pride of
                        character than that in which General Grant is placed by his correspondence.
                        In the first place, he was charged with violating an understanding between
                        himself and his superior officer. That this charge touched him to the quick
                        is proved by his emphatic, resentful denial, made in a form which conceded
                        that he was inexcusably culpable if the charge were well-founded.</p>
                    <p>In the next place, after General Grant's confession that he acted
                        dishonorably if the alleged facts were true, and after denying the facts in
                        such a way as to stake his veracity, their truth is established by a
                        concurring body of overwhelming testimony proving his own admission of them.
                        Probably no man was ever before placed in so unenviable a position. He is
                        self-condemned on the point of honor, and self-condemned on the point of
                        veracity. He stands exposed to the country, first, as admitting that he had
                        acted dishonorably if the facts were true, and then, as proved to have
                        admitted, in the presence of the Cabinet, the facts which he had the
                        effrontery to deny in the correspondence. The question of honor being too
                        plain for controversy, nothing remained but the question of fact; and in
                        sending his veracity to the rescue of his honor, he parted with both. On his
                        side there is nothing but his unsupported statement, contradicted by
                        intrinsic probabilities, contradicted by admissions made in his own letters,
                        and crushingly contradicted by the testimony of six gentleman as high in
                        position as himself. Such are the humiliating penalties General Grant has
                        incurred by walking in the crooked ways of politics and prevarication.
                        President Johnson's last letter is a document which General Grant's
                        reputation can ill afford to have pass into history."</p>
                    <p>We publish below the crushing reply of the President, and regret that we have
                        not the space to publish the letters of the five members of the Cabinet who
                        were present at the Cabinet meeting on the 14th ult., at which the
                        conversation between the President and Grant occurred, about which they are
                        at a positive and direct issue of veracity. As the Intelligencer says: "Four of the five who were there sustain the
                        statements of the President, point by point, and word for word; the fifth
                        (Seward) confirms all the President's statements; but with officious
                        kindness feebly attempts to suggest some sort of excuse for the probable or
                        possible misapprehension of the situation on the part of General Grant.
                        Their accumulated testimony justified the President in dismissing the
                        question of veracity with the simple presentation of this overwhelming
                        evidence. They fully sustain the President, and leave General Grant
                        convicted of the basest misrepresentations.</p>
                    <p>The letter of the President, however, proceeds to expose, in a scathing and
                        unanswerable manner, the arrant duplicity and inexcusable insubordination of
                        General Grant. 'Out of his own mouth he is condemned'</p>
                    <p>The insubordination of General Grant is plainly and strongly put by the
                        President. -- There is no escape from this charge. It is thrust home with
                        irresistible force."</p>

                        flunkeys to enforce his authority. We must resist, trample in the dust, and

                        resistance to negro domination, let the work be completed by the muskets of
