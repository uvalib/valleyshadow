<b>The Trouble at C[h]arleston</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Report of the proceedings at the Democratic Convention in Charleston, at
                    which the party split over the question of slavery in the Territories. Spectator
                    hopes that the difficulty of the question can be settled without disrupting the
                    Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This is said to be a world of troubles, and our Democratic friends have had
                        their full share of them at Charleston. After a career of unparalleled
                        success, the agitation of the slavery question, which, somehow or other, has
                        operated to their advantage heretofore, has at last divided the party, with
                        little prospect at present of a future re- union. We are not disposed to
                        make light of the occurrence. The disruption of a great party, which has
                        boasted of its unity and nationality, upon a sectional issue, is an event of
                        vast importance, and its effects, so far as relates to the perpetuity of the
                        Union, cannot now be predicted.</p>
                    <p> The Committee on the platform reported to the Convention certain
                        resolutions, as explanatory of the Cincinnati platform. The first resolution
                        denies "that Congress has any power to abolish slavery in the
                        Territories--or that a Territorial Legislature has any power to abolish
                        it--or to forbid the introduction of slaves within a Territory, or the right
                        to destroy or impair the right of property in slaves by any legislation
                        whatever." This much negatively, to which is added the third resolution,
                        which asserts that "it is the duty of the Federal Government to protect when
                        necessary the rights of persons and property on the high seas, in the Territories, or wherever else its
                        constitutional authority extends." A majority of the convention rejected
                        these resolutions, and thereupon a number of Southern delegates retired. The
                        Convention then re-affirmed the Cincinnati platform, without addition or
                        explanation on the subject of slavery, but subsequently adopted the
                        Tennessee resolution, endorsing the Dred Scott decision as "the correct
                        interpretation of the Constitution." </p>
                    <p>In opposition to the theory contended for by the Southern seceders is the
                        doctrine of Senator Douglas and his Northern friends. This affirms the right
                        of the Territorial Legislature to settle the question of slavery within the
                        bounds of the Territory, and denies that Congress has the power to interfere
                        either for or against the institution.</p>
                    <p>That a diversity of sentiment on the subject of slavery existed between the
                        Northern and Southern members of the Democratic and all other parties, has
                        been apparent for a long time; and the failure of the attempt at Charleston
                        conclusively proves the impossibility of embracing these different opinions
                        in one platform which shall admit of but one interpretation. Even the
                        Seceders at Charleston are not agreed among themselves. Gov. Winston, of
                        Alabama, protested against the resolutions adopted by their Convention,
                        because they do not contain a demand for a slave code for the Territories;
                        and Senator Bayard, of Delaware, actually seceded from the Seceders.</p>
                    <p>With such an irreconcilable difference of opinion, the question arises
                        whether there is no way of getting rid of the difficulty, or whether the
                        peace of the country and the Union itself must be sacrificed to abstract
                        theories. The only way we know of is to agree to disagree upon questions of
                        really no practical importance. If let alone, the question of slavery in the
                        Territories will settle itself to the satisfaction of all reasonable and
                        patriotic men in both sections of the Republic.</p>
