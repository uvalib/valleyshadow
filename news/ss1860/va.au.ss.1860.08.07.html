<b>Presentation of Banner and Picnic Near Brown's Spring</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Report of the two local military companies travelling to Fishersville to

                    Capt. Peck of the Cavalry, and Capt. Imboden. Lieut. James Bumgardner presented
                    the banner. Turner's Band provided entertainment. The storm that passed through
                    the county produced an early end to the proceedings. Capt. Peck, Dr. King and
                    Mr. Reed were struck by lightning, which marred the occasion, but it was
                    otherwise an entire success.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt.  Koiner, Capt.  Peck, Lieut. James Bumgardner, Capt.  Imboden, Capt.  Peck, Dr.  King, Mr.  Reed)</blockquote>
<b>Escapes from Drowning</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

<b>Busy Scene</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Street Commissioners are busy repairing the damage done by the storm,
                    making streets concave instead of convex so that water flows to the center of
                    the street rather than out to the pavement and onto building foundations.
                    Spectator hopes the street will be repaired in time for the Douglas Democrat
                    convention on August 16.<br>

                    All were stunned but none was seriously injured.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. Henry Peck, Dr.  King, Mr.  Reed)</blockquote>
<b>Abolition</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Author addresses his letter to N.K. Trout, Gen. Harman and Capt. Baylor,
                    arguing that citizens are always ready to rise up and oppose anyone suspected of
                    abolition sentiments, but that there are other types of people who harm the
                    institution of slavery even more than abolitionists but are never criticized. He
                    refers specifically both to those who nominally own blacks but who allow them to
                    act as freemen and hire themselves out and to those who allow their slaves to
                    live in separate houses and work for themselves. The author calls on public
                    officials to ferret out these cases and prosecute them for evading slave laws.<br>(Names in announcement:  N.K. Trout, Gen.  Harman, Capt.  Baylor)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To N.K. Trout, Mayor, and Gen. Harman and Capt. Baylor,
                            Commonwealth's Attornies [sic]--
                    </p>
                    <p>Nothing is more common than to hear our citizens declaim against the
                        abolitionists. If a stranger comes into our midst who is even suspected of
                        entertaining or inculcating abolition sentiments, the whole community is at
                        once and justly in an uproar. Yet we have among our own people two classes
                        of persons who do more harm to our slave population than all the
                        abolitionists of the North combined. I refer, 1st., to those who stand as
                        nominal masters for negroes, who are really free, and who are permitted to
                        hire themselves out, and go at large at pleasure. I have reason to believe
                        there are negroes in Staunton and in the country who are living, trading and
                        acting as free persons, who have bought and paid for their freedom, except a
                        nominal balance which is permitted to remain unpaid, merely as a device to
                        evade the laws.--These cases should be looked after. And 2nd, there is
                        another class, who permit their slaves to live in independent houses from
                        their owners, to keep house, work for themselves and pay to their owners a
                        portion of their earnings. This matter ought to be inquired into by our
                        Mayor and Commonwealth's Attornies [sic] and Grand Juries. If orders were
                        given to the public officer to ferret out all such cases and report them to
                        the proper authorities, a good service would be done to the public.</p>
