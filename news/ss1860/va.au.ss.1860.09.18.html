<b>Gentleman Swearers</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article laments the "degeneration" of society and the increase in swearing.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is not pleasant to admit that the world is getting worse instead of
                        better, or that any reprehensible habit is becoming more prevalent and
                        common. Especially in a Christian land, and under the influence of the purer
                        religion of which Americans are somewhat inclined to boast, one might look
                        for a higher style of morals and a more uniform outward regard for sacred
                        things. But the world's standard is lower than it used to be when men were
                        less enlightened. The catalogues of mortal sins and of venial offenses have
                        changed their proportions as we have grown in wisdom. So long as we desire
                        to retain a respectable social position, we are called upon to abstain from
                        murder, except it be done according to the code; and theft and lying are
                        acknowledged to offenses against society. -- The decalogue has dwindled down
                        to these narrow limits, and in the place of the comprehensive law that
                        applied to all relations and circumstances of life public opinion has
                        established another code, stringent enough, it may be, but which only
                        affects to regulate actions that have no moral quality whatever.</p>
                    <p>To discuss the subject of profane swearing, even upon this low ground, it
                        would be difficult to show how the practice is profitable to the swearer. If
                        is important that an excited individual should get off extra steam by the
                        agency of such safety valves, why would not some more innocent expletive
                        answer as well as an oath? Or if nothing else will do it in the moment of
                        strong excitement, how does it pay to toss about the Name that is above all
                        other names in ordinary conversation -- to play with the royal titles of the
                        King of Kings as though he were some idol divinity? If there is profit in
                        the practice, we have never been able to find it out.</p>
                    <p>There are great numbers of men in the world who are weak enough to abhor
                        profanity and to shun the society of the chivalrous gentlemen who cannot
                        utter a sentence without one or more blasphemies in it. If the influence of
                        these squeamish individuals should ever happen to be necessary to the
                        habitual swearer he tolerably certain to go without it. If the good opinion
                        if the moralist has any value it is great folly to throw it away for the
                        sake of momentary gratification. Very young men swear because they desire to
                        look manly and important, and in our day the quantity and quality of the
                        blasphemies are generally in inverse proportion to the swearer. There is
                        some show of reason about this, but the matured man must find a better
                        excuse. We wear beards now a days, and the hirsute adornments that Dame
                        Nature furnishes better prove our manhood than any quantity of flippant
                        appeals to the Deity can do.</p>
                    <p>The time was when one of the most infallible marks by which the gentleman was
                        distinguished from the blackguard was the total avoidance of profane
                        expressions on the jaws of the former. We know that swearing was a
                        fashionable vice with some of our ancestors. The Court of the first Charles
                        was a vast manufactory of blasphemies, and the gallant cavaliers of that day
                        swore by exact rule. But the tremendous fulminations which they had invented
                        in more peaceful times were of very little use at Marston Moor and Naseby.
                        And the descendants of the men who were victors in these battles settled in
                        America and brought with them a stricter code of morals, and the swearer was
                        tabooed upon principle. -- Whatever may be said about these rare old
                        worthies, they were certainly men of purer lives than their degenerate
                        successors are apt to believe, and the power of their example was felt
                        through one or two generations. A low fellow was expected to call down
                        curses upon his own head, and he was an outcast because he swore, but no
                        gentleman was guilty of a practice that was considered utterly degrading.</p>
                    <p>If there is no God of the Universe it is great nonsense to swear by Him, and
                        to lug in His name to strengthen an argument, or to polish a sentence. And
                        if there is -- One, holy and supreme, noting the
                        tail of a sparrow, and heeding the lightest words of man -- some better
                        football should be found than His reverend name. </p>
