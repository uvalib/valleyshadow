<b>We Work too Much and Play too Little</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes Americans' devotion to work at the complete expense of
                    recreation. Urges Americans to take more time in recreation for the benefit of
                    their health.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The intense devotion of Americans to"business" is proverbial. We are by far
                        the hardest working people in the world. Though compelled by no such
                        necessity as drives the inhabitants of the densely populated countries of
                        the old world to their daily tasks for their bread, nevertheless the
                        majority of us work more hours than they, with a more intense and perpetual
                        strain upon brain and muscles, and with fewer intermissions from labors, for
                        recreation and amusement. We are taught from childhood that work is the
                        "chief end of man." The "dignity of labor" is among the earliest lessons we
                        receive. With us, not merely is labor honorable, but most of us hold that it
                        is about the only thing that is so. Even wealth and rank, while they are
                        coveted and worshipped, borrow their respectability -- as we may see it we
                        will look a little below the surface of our social philosophy -- from the
                        idea that they are embodied expressions of labor. It is acquired rather than
                        inherited wealth, which confers honor among us. While me may envy, we have
                        at the same time a lurking contempt for the wearer of "ancestral purple and
                        linen," unless he forswears the immunity from toil which they confer and
                        becomes a worker.</p>
                    <p>Now all this would be very well, if our passion for labor, or rather ambition
                        to secure its rewards, did not convert us into slaves. It is quite right
                        that idleness should be disreputable, and industry held in high honor. But
                        it is not right to brand all recreation and amusement as idleness. It is bad
                        policy, as well as bad morality, to give all our time to work and none to
                        play. -- Both body and mind are injured, and life is shortened thereby. What
                        an army do we see in our streets of paralytics, dyspeptics, consumptives,
                        and other victims of disease -- men not yet passed middle age, who have
                        retired from active business with fortunes, only to drag out a few months or
                        years of miserable existence -- all capacity for enjoying the fruits of
                        their past toil destroyed by having made that toil a slavery. -- The sight
                        is a melancholy one. A few hours spent daily in recreation, with the burden
                        of business laid down and the mind unbent from its tension, would have
                        preserved to them their health, without diminishing their gains.</p>
                    <p>We are a race of dyspeptics. A man with a perfectly sound digestion is the
                        exception rather than the rule among us; and the principle reason is, that
                        we scarcely do anything but work and eat. Even sleeping is regarded as time
                        wasted -- "It is the early bird that catches the worm," and it is our motto
                        that the "worm" we must have.</p>
                    <p>Now we entirely reject this doctrine, that work is the "chief end of man."
                        Labor in and of itself has no "dignity." So far from it, it was imposed upon
                        the race originally as a penalty for sin. and the best that can be said of
                        it now is, that by a kind arrangement of Providence the penalty has been
                        softened down into a means of redeeming us from other and more destructive
                        consequences of the fall. By excess, it may be restored to all its
                        characteristics of a curse. -- When it breaks down bodily health, and dwarfs
                        the soul, instead of being dignified and honorable, it is vulgar and mean,
                        unless it be imposed by a necessary from which there is no escape without
                        guilt. Our first duty in this world is to grow a sound mind in a healthy
                        body, and this is our truest dignity. Whatever impedes these ends, whether
                        it be labour, "business," or anything thing else, should be condemned. --
                        Our highest obligation is to serve God. But who can serve him acceptably
                        with a softened brain or a crick in the back? We are condemned to love our
                        neighbor as ourselves. But with a "duodenum or an agitated pilorous," as
                        Sidney Smith describes a dyspepsis, we can love neither ourselves nor our
                        neighbor. Hence, sound bodily health is an indispensable condition, not
                        merely of intellectual growth and vigor, but as well as of the normal
                        harmony of the soul; just as indispensable conditions of sound bodily health
                        are diversity of employments, and an alternation of labour and recreation.</p>
                    <p>It is not necessary to urge our readers to be industrious. There is not the
                        slightest danger that they will not work hard enough. The danger is all on
                        the other side. There is far greater necessity to urge them to spend more
                        time in recreation, and we accordingly, seriously and earnestly do so. While
                        you are "diligent in business," do not consider "business" the "whole duty
                        of man." Look upon it rather as a necessity from which you have a perfect
                        right to escape if you can. Esteem innocent diversions, sports, amusements
                        and recreations as lawful, nay, as truly duties as hoeing potatoes or
                        selling tape. And by all means to it, whatever may be the fancied demands of
                        business, that you give to recreation all the time necessary to secure sound
                        health.</p>
