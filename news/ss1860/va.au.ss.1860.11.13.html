<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator regrets to inform its readers that the forces of sectionalism
                    triumphed in the election with Lincoln's victory, but feels confident that the
                    South can protect its own interests through the other branches of government,
                    which it still controls. It counsels against secession, which would place the
                    South in unnecessary danger by effectively turning all power over to the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is with deep pain that we announce the triumph of a Northern Sectional
                        party. We have labored earnestly to prevent that result, and supported the
                        only ticket which carried the flag around which all the conservative
                        strength of the country could rally without sacrifice of principle. The
                        ticket we supported bore aloft a national banner
                        around which conservatives North and South should have rallied with the view
                        of preventing the success of sectionalism North or South. Our efforts were
                        unsuccessful, though applied in the right direction, and sectionalism has
                        triumphed over nationality.--Though we are mortified at the success of the
                        Black Republicans in the Presidential election, yet we are rejoiced to know
                        that the elections for Congressmen have resulted in giving us a very safe
                        and decided majority against the Republicans in Congress. The success of the
                        Republicans in the Presidential election is but a barren victory, and its
                        fruits, like the apples of the Dead Sea, will turn to ashes upon their lips.
                        They will have the Executive, but no other branch of the Government, and
                        will, consequently, be impotent for mischief--they will not have the power
                        to do any harm, however much disposed they may be to do so. We have the
                        Senate, the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court in our favor,
                        either one of which would of itself be a sufficient protection to our
                        rights. As we have all three there can, by no possibility, be any danger
                        that our rights can be violated. No law can reach the President for his
                        signature without first having passed both Houses
                        of Congress, and we know that as at present composed no bill violative of
                        our rights can pass either House. So that we are
                        perfectly safe. The President cannot even make an appointment without the
                        consent of the Senate, so that we have nothing to dread in that respect. If
                        we remain united we have nothing to fear from the Black Republicans,
                        because, as before stated, we have both Houses of Congress and the Supreme
                        Court in our favor. The danger is in secession. If several of the Southern
                        States secede, they will leave us in a minority in Congress, where we now
                        have a safe majority. This may be the reason why some of the Southern States
                        are in such a hurry to secede. They think that if they secede and leave us
                        at the mercy of a Black Republican majority in Congress, that we will secede
                        likewise. This is the way in which they expect to drag us into a like
                        destiny with them. They will secede when we have a safe majority and there
                        can be no danger, that we may be left in a minority where danger will
                        threaten, in the confident belief that we will then secede and unite our
                        fortunes with theirs. To secede when there can be no danger would be adding
                        cowardice to treason. To give up when we have the game in our own hands
                        would be cowardly, foolish and criminal. South Carolina, and other States
                        disposed to secede, should remember that comity due to neighboring States
                        should restrain them from taking action without consulting the wishes and
                        interests of other States, particularly such as Virginia which is more
                        deeply interested than all the Cotton States combined. As no man has a right
                        to destroy even his own property when by so doing he will endanger that of
                        his neighbor, so no State has the right to secede when that act will involve
                        other States in the common ruin. Virginia has interests independent of the
                        Cotton States, and she should take care of them in spite of the action of
                        those States. </p>

<b>Disunionism in Virginia</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator criticizes those newspapers, such as the Clarke Journal, that are
                    now waving the "black flag of Disunion." The paper hopes that Union men will
                    unite to save Virginia from falling into the hands of Disunionists.<br>

<b>For the Spectator</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter to the editor claiming that, while states such as South Carolina
                    move toward secession, Virginia remains conservative and unwilling to break away
                    from its national government. Author praises Virginia as an example for the
                    entire South and calls for a convention of the entire state to express the
                    sentiments of Virginia in this crisis.<br>
