                    campaigns were told, we suspect that Henley and Jarboe, in the judgment of
                    people who are not fond of sports that make humanity blush and decency shrink
                    back in disgust from the haunts of civilized men, would be deemed murderers. For
                    such multiplied outrages, to hang them would be to profane the gallows, which is
                    retained for crimes that swarm not in such gangs."</excerpt>
