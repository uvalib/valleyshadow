<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The West Augusta Guard passed a resolution thanking Capt. Koiner and the
                    citizens of Fishersville for the "elegant pic nic and hospitable treatment"
                    extended to the Guard.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Paramount Question</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator argues that in the current political situation, all questions
                    other than the preservation of the Union should be made secondary. The paper
                    also calls upon all citizens to disassociate themselves from disunionists.<br>

<b>Three More Freshets in Staunton--A House Destroyed--Miraculous Escape of an
                    aged Woman</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Just as the Street Commissioners were repairing the damage from the last
                    flood, new floods came through Staunton twice and destroyed all the repairs that
                    had been made. Spectator adds a postscript to this article indicating that a
                    fourth flood came through the town, knocking down the house of Mrs. Parish who
                    would have drowned had she not been saved by Mr. Chandler. Mrs. Parish's house
                    was destroyed.<br>(Names in announcement: Mrs.  Parish, Mr.  Chandler)</blockquote>
<b>Stereoscopic Views of Staunton</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mr. William D. Cooke of North Carolina has taken stereoscopic pictures of
                    Staunton and they are well executed. N. Brooks and Charles Cochran are clearly
                    recognizable in the photos.<br>(Names in announcement:  N. Brooks,  Charles Cochran)</blockquote>
<b>"Free Fight"</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Report of a fight in the street on the previous Friday night near the
                    stores of Bledsoe &amp; Bro. Five or six people were called to answer an
                    indictment for the fight.<br>(Names in announcement: Judge  Points, Judge  Bickle)</blockquote>
<b>The Douglas Convention</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator wonders whether the delegates to the Douglas Democrat convention,
                    which will meet in Staunton, will stand by their candidate and his positions or
                    will succumb to the demands of the Breckinridge branch of the party. The paper
                    has faith in the Douglas delegates.<br>

<b>A Large Tomato</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Peter Engleman, Jun. has sent the Spectator a tomato that weighs two
                    pounds. He had a number of others weighing over a pound but many were destroyed
                    in the recent floods.<br>(Names in announcement:  Peter EnglemanJun.)</blockquote>
<b>To the Council of the Town of Staunton</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Author suggests ways of avoiding future flooding in Staunton. He argues
                    that digging lower and lower down Augusta Street only hurts those at the bottom
                    of the town. Rather, water should be prevented from collecting in the meadow by
                    widening the creek, and water channels that run through town should be dug
                    uniformly deeper.<br>

<b>For the Spectator</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Author calls for a deepening of the creek-bed and a raising of its banks.
                    In addition, he thinks that the city needs to build a brick aqueduct, which will
                    run under the street where the canal stops, in order to prevent future flooding
                    of Staunton.<br>
