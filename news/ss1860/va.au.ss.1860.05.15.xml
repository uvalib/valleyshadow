                    <p>The Convention of the constitutional Union Party, which assembled in
                        Baltimore last week, has presented to the country, as candidates for the
                        Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States, the distinguished
                        gentlemen whose names stand at the head of our columns. John Bell, of
                        Tennessee, and Edward Everett, of Massachusetts, are known in all sections
                        of the country as fit representatives of a party founded for the purpose of
                        bringing together all national and conservative men who love the
                        Constitution and the Union. They are statesmen of ability, integrity and
                        enlarged patriotism, in whose hands the rights and interests of every
                        section will be protected; and as such, will receive, we trust, the cordial
                        support of all who desire to avoid a purely sectional issue in the
                        approaching Presidential election. So far as our humble influence extends,
                        we shall use it in their behalf, from the solemn conviction that nothing but
                        the success of such men can save the country from continual discord, and
                        perhaps dissolution.</p>
                    <p>We had the pleasure of witnessing the proceedings of the Baltimore
                        Convention, and truly it was a refreshing scene. We breathed the atmosphere
                        of a pure patriotism, and felt our hopes for the perpetuity of our
                        institutions revive, when we saw men from every section of this vast
                        confederacy uniting their hands and their hearts upon the common platform of
                        the Constitution and the Union. No differences of opinion existed among that
                        band of unselfish patriots, or if there were diversities of sentiment upon
                        abstract questions, they sank into insignificance when compared with the
                        grand objects of national importance, for which the Convention assembled.
                        Consequently nothing occurred to interrupt the cordial communion of men who
                        felt themselves to be brethren, and it was indeed pleasant to see them dwell
                        together in so much harmony and peace.</p>
                    <p>Our readers will find elsewhere in this paper a synopsis of the proceedings
                        of the Convention. The conclusion to which all parties must come is, that
                        with such a ticket as we present to the country, selected by so large and
                        respectable a body of able men from all sections, we need not yet despair of
                        the Republic. Let the standard borne by John Bell and Edward Everett be the
                        rallying point of all who love the Union and the constitution, and all will
                        yet be well.</p>
