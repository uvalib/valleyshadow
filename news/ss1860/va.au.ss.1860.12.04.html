<b>Important Questions for Secessionists</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial recalling historical issues of land purchase (Louisiana Purchase,
                    purchase of Florida, annexation of Texas, etc.), using these issues to suggest
                    that states may not simply secede from the Union. If states or territories are
                    to break with the United States it must be a deal of mutual agreement, where
                    both the seceders and the United States as a whole agree to part ways.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator replies to "A County Man," a correspondent who wrote to the paper
                    to object to the praise heaped by the Spectator on Bolivar Christian for his
                    work on behalf of the Union party. Spectator assures the correspondent that it

                    returns of an Augusta precinct whose poll was taken at a place other than the
                    designated location. Spectator accuses these Democrats of attempting to cheat in
                    the election and of attempting to defraud the voters of their rights as
                    citizens.<br>(Names in announcement:  B.F. Points)</blockquote>

                    honor than anyone else who worked on behalf of the Union party. He believes that
                    many others worked just as hard.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr.  Christian, Mr.  Baldwin, Mr.  Stuart, Mr.  Doyle, Mr.  Sheffy)</blockquote>
