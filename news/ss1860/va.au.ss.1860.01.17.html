<b>Fighting for the Union</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial argues that secession would be a foolish way to remedy Southern
                    grievances and praises congressmen of both parties who are attempting to
                    preserve the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is a matter of surprise that any serious apprehensions as to the stability
                        of the Union should now be felt in any quarter. With the exception of the
                        insignificant faction of ultra abolitionists at the North and a few equally
                        insane gentlemen of the fire-eating stripe at the South, nobody seems
                        disposed at the present to tolerate dissolution. On the contrary the
                        prominent men of all the great parties, of both sections of the confederacy,
                        are bold in the declaration that the "Union must and shall be preserved."
                        The Democratic party, it is gratifying to perceive, are taking the true
                        ground here at the South, that dissolution is no remedy for the evils under
                        which we have naturally become very restive, and we are waking up to an
                        appreciation that the Union and the Constitution belong to the South as well
                        as the North, and that the rights and privileges guaranteed to us by the
                        Constitution, which is the bond of the Union, may and ought to be maintained
                        within the Union and under the Constitution.--It seems now to be the general
                        opinion that it is not only unwise and ridiculous, but absolutely cowardly,
                        to think of abandoning our rights under the and retreating ingloriously from
                        the glorious American Union, because some of the parties confederate are
                        disposed to trample upon and abuse us; but that, on the contrary, the true
                        and manly position to assume is, that we have rights in the Union,
                        guaranteed by the Constitution, which we mean to assert and maintain "at all
                        hazards and to the last extremity," Gov. Wise placed his foot upon this
                        solid ground first, in his speech to the medical students at Richmond, and
                        following his lead many of the prominent men and presses of the Democratic
                        party have taken the same sensible position. Mr. Pryor, well known to be a
                        champion par excellence of Southern rights and
                        interests, has made up his mind to save the Union, and declared in Congress
                        that the South does not intend to abandon the Union, but will vindicate her
                        rights in the Union, "peaceably if possibly, by force if necessary."
                        Heretofore, says the Baltimore American "Southern politicians seem never to
                        have thought it possible for the South to do anything but run away from
                        Seward and his fanatics-- dissolution (in other words, backing out) being
                        the only resource of the "despoiled nationalities" below Mason and Dixon's
                        line. But Mr. Pryor, for the first time in the history of Southern
                        Eloquence, takes a more courageous stand. He thinks it just as easy for the
                        South to whip the North as for the North to whip the South in.--At all
                        events, the South, according to Mr. Pryor rather than secede under any
                        provocation, is fully bent upon violence--"force if necessary." Instead of
                        backing out, it is going to fight to keep in. </p>
                    <p>While this strong position is taken by Southern Democrats, Mr. Hickman, of
                        Pennsylvania, an anti-Lecompton Democrat who has been voting with the
                        Republicans, and therefore a representative of both, is equally positive
                        that the Union shall not be dissolved. "No matter what the antagonism
                        between sections," says that gentleman, "the Union must and shall be
                        preserved."</p>
                    <p>In addition to these developments of a determination to preserve the Union,
                        on the part of two great parties, both of which have heretofore been
                        inclined to its destruction, we find a movement in progress under the lead
                        of such men as Crittenden and Broom and Stuart, having for its object the
                        organization of another great national party, to aid Messrs. Pryor and
                        Hickman in their patriotic intentions.</p>
                    <p>In view of all of these facts who can apprehend any danger to the Union? Who
                        is to accomplish the work of dissolution. As the American remarks, if Mr.
                        Hickman shall resort to arms to prevent the South from leaving the
                        Confederacy, and Mr. Pryor is resolved that the South shall urge war to keep
                        from leaving, it is pretty clear that the Union is tolerably safe--we
                        confess to like the idea of the South's fighting to keep in, while the North
                        is fighting to make the South stay in.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Herald publishes the speech of one of the "clerical agents,"
                        relative to the runaway slaves in Canada, together with an account of the
                        unfortunate fugitives in Nova Scotia. The condition of both, says the
                        Herald, is miserable and degraded in the extreme, and really demands far
                        more sympathy from the humane and philanthrop- [illegible] -an the most
                        exaggerated descriptions of the condition of the negro while in slavery. The
                        wretched lot to which these poor fugitives are abandoned by the
                        abolitionists, after they are stolen away from their comfort and the
                        protection of their Southern homes, is the most pitiable to which their race
                        is condemned, outside of the original savage state from which they have been
                        rescued.</p>
                    <p>In August last a difficulty occurred in Green county, Pennsylvania, between
                        the blacks and a portion of the white population, in consequence of an
                        attempt of the latter to drive the negroes off. Believing that the presence
                        of the negroes tended to lower the price of labor, the whites gave them
                        notice to leave, and this led to a collision in which one white man was
                        killed and another wounded. Eight negroes were arrested, and a few days ago
                        six of them were convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to the Penitentiary
                        for five years. No doubt the sentence was a just and proper one, but the
                        assault upon the negroes in the first instance shows what sort of sympathy
                        the blacks receive in the free States.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, in regard to the treatment of Virginia slaves, the Norfolk
                        Herald mentions a fact or two. It states that a gentleman of Norfolk county,
                        whose name is given, lately paid to his servants $550, for corn raised by
                        them for their own benefit on his land. Another gentleman paid to his
                        servants $600, earned in the same way; and another paid $300. Such treatment
                        of slaves is not peculiar to Norfolk county, but is practiced more or less
                        all over the State. We know it is not uncommon in this region.</p>
                    <p>The negroes alluded to, says the Herald, like millions in the Southern
                        States, are not only plentifully provided for in every way, but they are
                        saving money to use as they may find best in coming years--and withal they
                        seem as happy as lords. They work well and cheerfully in the day, and at
                        night, during the holidays they sing, dance and smoke, eat sweet potatoes,
                        drink hard cider, sit around big kitchen fires, "laugh and grow fat,"
                        regardless of all the "tomfoolery" and nonsense about the "poor oppressed
                        slaves."</p>
