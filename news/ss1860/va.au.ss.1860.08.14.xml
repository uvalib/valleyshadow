                    also calls upon all citizens to disassociate themselves from disunionists.</summary>

                <summary>Just as the Street Commissioners were repairing the damage from the last
                    flood, new floods came through Staunton twice and destroyed all the repairs that
                    had been made. Spectator adds a postscript to this article indicating that a
                    fourth flood came through the town, knocking down the house of Mrs. Parish who
                    would have drowned had she not been saved by Mr. Chandler. Mrs. Parish's house
                    was destroyed.</summary>

                <summary>Author suggests ways of avoiding future flooding in Staunton. He argues
                    that digging lower and lower down Augusta Street only hurts those at the bottom
                    of the town. Rather, water should be prevented from collecting in the meadow by
                    widening the creek, and water channels that run through town should be dug
                    uniformly deeper.</summary>

                    In addition, he thinks that the city needs to build a brick aqueduct, which will
                    run under the street where the canal stops, in order to prevent future flooding
                    of Staunton.</summary>
