                    <p>A good-tempered, well-mannered child, is one of the most beautiful and
                        blessed things of earth--the divinely human bud of a divinely flowering
                        humanity. If children knew how much, by pleasant courtesy to one another and
                        cheerful obedience to their parents, they can command of admiration and
                        love, they would surely cultivate good behaviour and delight in it. In the
                        social economy of the Chinese, irreverence towards parents and the aged, is
                        regarded and punished as the most culpable act of childhood. Hence the
                        universal modest and humble deportment of Chinese youth. They are not
                        accustomed to nicknames and bickerings among themselves, and their
                        intercourse with their elders is always deferential. These admirable habits
                        of childhood, encouraged and cultivated by all proper consideration on the
                        part of their parents and society, as well as by fundamental edicts of the
                        State, seldom forsake them in maturer years.</p>
                    <p>"Honor thy father, and thy mother," is one of the Divine commandments, and
                        the just punishment of childish irreverence towards the aged, may be learned
                        from the history of the children who mocked Elijah. First of all, let
                        children honour their parents--and if they honour, they will love and obey
                        them. Let them avoid evil communications and evil companions. Let them keep
                        their hearts and their tongues pure. Let them be sincere and honest. Let
                        them speak the truth always--no matter what the temptation to falsehood,
                        speak the truth--truthfulness in childhood is the chiefest of jewels.</p>

                    <p>This good Saxon word <emph rend="italic">(wife)</emph> is after all, the
                        dearest and most sacred word in the whole vocabulary of love. Around it
                        clusters all that is most beautiful, chaste, and permanent in the tender
                        passion. Into whatever forbidden paths the heart of man may wander, still it
                        must return, at last, to the hallowed name of <emph rend="italic"
                        >wife</emph> for consolation and rest. Any other relation between the sexes,
                        however alluring to the imagination, invariably ends in wretchedness, in
                        shame and degradation. </p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The great work to be accomplished in the present canvass is the preservation
                        of the Union against the combined assaults of Sectionalism, North and South.
                        Union or Disunion--that is the great and absorbing question in comparison
                        with which all others upon which political parties have been heretofore
                        divided sink into absolute insignificance. It is folly to mention, much less
                        to quarrel over and separate upon mere matters of governmental policy, when
                        the success of either of the two sectional parties now striving for the
                        ascendance, may lead to the utter destruction of the government itself. The
                        crisis which we have reached demands the oblivion of past differences, and
                        the hearty and cordial union of all good men for the common patriotic object
                        of preserving inviolate the sacred "palladium of our liberties."</p>
                    <p>We have ever believed that whenever the conviction forced itself upon the
                        minds of the honest masses of the American people that the Union was really
                        in peril, they would rise in their majesty and their strength to rebuke the
                        traitorous designs of corrupt and selfish men. The people are now convinced,
                        and the result everywhere will be a "regular ground swell" in behalf of the
                        Constitution and the Union. Many of those, who have heretofore acted with
                        the Democratic party, who would not believe us, cannot now doubt the
                        disunion designs of many in their own ranks with whom they have heretofore
                        cooperated, since their desertion of the regular Democratic organization to
                        follow the leadership and fight under the treasonable flag of Wm. L. Yancey,
                        who has justly been denominated the "Seward of the South." Into the arms of
                        this designing and selfish man and his associates in mischief Breckinridge
                        has deliberately thrown himself, and if elected by their influence and
                        exertions, we should expect him to be the creature of their will.</p>
                    <p>We do not state these facts and ask Democratic people to believe them, upon
                        our authority, but they are so told by many of the most prominent and honest
                        men of their own party--not the leaders who are all committed to Yancey and
                        Disunion--but by such men as those assembled in Convention at Staunton on
                        the 16th, representing the people and not the politicians. We should be glad
                        to see them unite cordially in the support of Bell, who was nominated as the
                        candidate of a party specially organized for the preservation of the Union;
                        but if they are unwilling to do that, we hope to see them stand firmly
                        together in determined opposition to the election of Breckinridge. Those men
                        in the Douglas Convention spoke noble and patriotic words in behalf of the
                        Union boldly and fearlessly, and if the honest Democrats who have been
                        unconsciously drawn into the disunion ranks cannot be induced to enter the
                        regularly organized Union army, we trust that they will do the next best
                        thing by enlisting with the conservative and Union-loving portion of their
                        own party.</p>
