<b>Singular Affair</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Story of an escaped slave "passing" as white in Greenbrier County, where he
                    managed to establish a family before being recognized years later and reclaimed
                    by his former master.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lewisburg (Greenbrier County) Chronicle</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some six years ago, a man came to this place, or rather its vicinity, calling
                        himself Heriff, and has since then worked for numerous gentlemen in the
                        county, as a day laborer. Although of rather dark complexion, no one ever
                        supposed him to be akin to the descendents of Ham. After living here
                        sometime, he won the affections of a pretty white girl whom he married.
                        Things went on 's quite prosperously for some time, two children gladening
                        the happy father's heart, when, alas! his felicitous existance was
                        unexpectedly terminated. A negro man, in town, seems to have conceived the
                        idea that all was not right with Heriff, and that he bore the indications of
                        being more closely connected with the sons of Afric's burning sands, than is
                        countenanced on Southern soil, and communicated this idea to a gentleman,
                        who upon seeing him, immediately recognized him as the same individual once
                        belonging to a gentleman at or near the Hot Springs in Bath county, and from
                        whom he had run off. The gentleman was informed of the fact, and on the 2nd
                        inst. he arrived here, in company with someone who could substantiate his
                        claims. He met Heriff in one of our stores, and informed him that he had
                        come for him and claimed him as his servant. He seemed rather indignant,
                        upon receiving this unpleasant piece of information, but after a few words,
                        he acknowledged his true character, and accompanied his master home.</p>
