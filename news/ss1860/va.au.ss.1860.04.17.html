<b>John M. Botts and his Traducers</b><br> (Column 5-6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Author sings the praises of John Minor Botts as a politician of principle
                    who has spent his career fighting the corrupt politicians of both major parties

                    for Botts to run for and receive the Presidential nomination of the
                    Constitutional Union movement, in a national and conservative spirit.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a perfect fever raging in Georgia now on the subject of buying
                        negroes. Several sales which have come under our eye within a month past,
                        afford an unmistakable symptom of the prevalence of a disease in the public
                        mind on this subject. In view of the fabulous prices offered for this
                        species of property, reflecting men are led to the inquiry, what is to be
                        done to supply the deficiency which is produced with us by the great demand
                        for negroes in the Southwest? We are unable to give any satisfactory answer.
                        But, so far as the effect which these high prices are to have in our own
                        State is concerned, we think we can truthfully say the fever will soon abate
                        in a very natural way. Men are borrowing money to day at exorbitant rates of
                        interests to buy negroes at exorbitant prices.</p>
                    <p> The speculation will not sustain the speculators, and in a short time we
                        shall see many negroes and much land offered under the Sheriff's hammer,
                        with few buyers for cash, and then this kind of property will descend to its
                        real value. The old rule of pricing a negro by the price of cotton by the
                        pound--that is to say, if cotton is worth twelve cents, a negro man is worth
                        twelve hundred dollars, if at fifteen cents, then fifteen hundred
                        dollars--does not seem to be regarded. Negroes are twenty-five per cent.
                        higher now, with cotton at ten and a half cents, than they were two or three
                        years ago, when it was worth fifteen and sixteen cents. Men are demented
                        upon the subject. A reverse will surely come.--Federal
                            Union. </p>

<b>For the Spectator</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Author argues that farmers are capable of judging Judge Thompson's
                    abilities as well as any lawyers, despite the assertions of "R.L.J." and "Z."
                    Claims that Thompson is slow and inefficient, and while knowledgeable in the
                    law, is not the best judge. Rhetorically asks how many times farmers have had to
                    leave their farm work and travel to court only to have the court be closed or be
                    forced to wait and return the next day. Condemns authors such as "Z" who defend
                    Thompson.<br>(Names in announcement: Judge  Thompson)</blockquote>
