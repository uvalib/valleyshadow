<b>The Legislature--How It Should Proceed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator urges the State Legislature to use caution and prudence with
                    regard to the issue of secession when it reconvenes in January and not to be
                    swayed by impulse and emotion. Spectator argues that the Legislature can, at
                    most, recommend a Convention to deliberate the question of secession, a
                    recommendation that must first be put to the people.<br>

<b>Treasonable Desertion</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Spectator surmises that Senators who abandon their positions in the Senate

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If a soldier deserts the army he suffers the penalty of death. If desertion
                        on the part of a soldier renders him deserving of death, what penalty should
                        be indicted upon those Senators who are now resigning their seats and
                        deserting their posts of duty, when, by so doing, they are betraying the
                        trusts confided to them, and surrendering the government into the hands of
                        the enemies of Southern institutions. If they remain steadfast at their
                        posts and faithful to their constituents, the enemies of the South can do us
                        no possible injury, as the Senators can control all the appointments of the
                        Executive to suit themselves. Any Senator who, under these circumstances,
                        should voluntarily desert his post of duty should be deemed a traitor to the
                        South.</p>
                    <p> Actions speak louder than words, and the mere professions of fidelity to the
                        South should be deemed false and hypocritical on the part of those who
                        surrender the power of appointment into the hands of the Black Republican
                        President. They profess to be the friends of the South, par excellence, and whilst expressing their devotion to the
                        South, they surrender the citadel which effectually protects the South, and
                        become thereby the indirect allies of the Black Republicans, for it will
                        serve the purposes of the latter just as well to get the majority in the
                        Senate by the desertion of the Southern Senators as by election on the part
                        of Black Republican Legislatures. It seems that some of the disunion
                        Senators are determined to do for the Republicans that which they could not
                        do themselves, to wit: give them a majority in the Senate that they may have
                        the power to make appointments to suit themselves without regard to the
                        rights or wishes of the South. </p>
