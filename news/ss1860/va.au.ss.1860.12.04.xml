                    that states may not simply secede from the Union. If states or territories are
                    to break with the United States it must be a deal of mutual agreement, where
                    both the seceders and the United States as a whole agree to part ways.</summary>

                    to object to the praise heaped by the Spectator on Bolivar Christian for his
                    work on behalf of the Union party. Spectator assures the correspondent that it
                    had no intention of praising Christian at the expense of anyone else.</summary>
