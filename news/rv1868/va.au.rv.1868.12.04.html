<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The question as to the extension of the stay-law, after January 1st 1869, at
                        which time it expires, is exciting no little interest throughout the State.
                        Meetings are being held and petitions, pro and
                        con, are gotten up, in which all the horrors of the extension, or
                        non-extension of the law are portrayed in in vivid colors and
                        forwarded to Gen. Stoneman, military Governor, Gen. Schofield, Sec'y of War
                        and Gen. Grant, Commander in Chief.</p>
                    <p>The debtor and creditor classes exist in every community and a few isolated
                        petitions, for or against, do not carry a just idea of the sentiment of the
                        people on the subject. What the views of the entire people may be we do not
                        know, nor do we stop to inquire, but cordially endorse the suggestion in the
                            Enquirer and Examiner, that meetings be held
                        in every county in the State, the subject thoroughly canvassed and the
                        sentiments of the entire people of the State thus thoroughly set forth, so
                        that the Military Governor, Gen. Stoneman, in whose province it seems to
                        fall, may act with the proper data before him. There is but little time to
                        waste, and, on a subject of such seeming importance to all, it behooves the
                        people generally to meet at once and express their semtiments, so
                        that the best interests of all may be subserved.</p>
                    <p>We therefore, suggest that a meeting be held in every county in the State,
                        where one has not been held, and at as early a date as practicable.</p>
                    <p>As an initiatory step in the Valley, we also suggest a meeting of the people
                        of Augusta, on Saturday the 12th inst., to discuss the subject and express
                        their sentiments. The first of January is fast approaching. The subject
                        demands a general expression and there is no time for delay. We, therefore,
                        call upon all to come forward on the day named, and calmly consider and give
                        expression to their sentiments, whether it be for or against the extension
                        of the law.</p>
