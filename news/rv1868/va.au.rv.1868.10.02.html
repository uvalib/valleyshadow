<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our attention has lately been called to the condition of our county roads by
                        several of our farmer friends. Some time ago the improvement of our roads
                        was agitated in a communication in our columns, and we then made it the
                        subject of an editorial. We desire again to call the attention of our people
                        to the importance of this subject. Next in importance to railroad
                        communication is the improvement of our county roads. We are now destined to
                        have superior railroad advantages by the early completion of the Chesapeake
                        &amp; Ohio Railroad and the then imperative necessity of the extension
                        of the Valley Railroad--in fact, the then almost absolute certainty of its
                        extension to Salem.</p>
                    <p>Can we take the full advantage of our Railroad communications without our
                        county roads are improved? We can not. Is our present system of working our
                        roads efficient and calculated to place our roads in proper condition? We
                        think not. Therefore, it behooves our people to look to their interest and
                        set on foot, at once, some plan by which our county roads can be put and
                        kept in thorough repair. There is no county in the State more capable of
                        making good county roads and keeping them in good condition than the county
                        of Augusta. We should then, by all means, take the matter in hand and set to
                        work to place our roads in the best possible condition.</p>
                    <p>With good roads our farmers can haul larger loads, with greater ease and less
                        wear and tear of vehicles and teams, their lands will be appreciated in
                        value thereby and they generally can reap almost the same advantage from our
                        railroads as those whose lands lie in close proximity to despots.--Whether
                        the present plan of working roads be retained, or a special tax be levied to
                        keep regular sets of hands on the roads, or some other method is adopted to
                        put and keep our county roads in good condition, the matter is important and
                        should be attended to at once. The roads leading to the county seat and the
                        various depots should meet with the earliest attention. Then in turn the
                        next in importance and so on until every road in the county is put in
                        complete repair. Money expended in this way will return the largest possible
                        revenue to all.--It is not what is made by what is saved that adds to our
                        wealth and in no way can as much be saved to all as by having good roads.</p>
                    <p>Other counties are turning their attention to this subject. Our energetic
                        neighbors of Rockingham are improving their roads, laying out air line roads
                        to their county seat, erecting bridges &amp;c., &amp;c. They are
                        alive to their immediate and prospective interests. Let us exhibit the same
                        zeal and liberality in improving our county roads and the result will amply
                        repay. We therefore call upon our citizens generally to take an interest in
                        the matter and let us make old Augusta as famous for her good roads as she
                        is for the energy and go ahead spirit of her people.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The last three years have fully justified our undoubting confidence in
                        Virginians, and we can proudly boast that the whole State, poor and desolate
                        as it is, has sprung forward with a power and energy that has astonished
                        even ourselves. We have no fears for the future--onwards! onwards! is the
                        motto of Virginia. If she has done so much when more than one-half of her
                        territory has been swept with the besom of destruction, what will, in coming
                        years, be her wealth and glory!--There rises before our eye of faith a
                        boundless vista of her future prosperity. We see, before the close of this
                        century, Old Virginia covered over with railroads and crowded with
                        population; with noble cities at every fall of her river, manufacturing for
                        the Union, with her mills developing the infinite wealth now hidden in the
                        bowels of the earth. This picture of the future is no opium dream; but it is
                        what must come to pass.--Norfolk Journal.</p>
