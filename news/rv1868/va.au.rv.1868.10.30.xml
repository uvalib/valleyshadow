                <summary>The paper declares the Augusta County Fair a "great success." The editors
                    estimate that between 7,000 and 10,000 people attended. The article gives an
                    account of the activities that included speeches, exhibitions, and sports
                    competitions.</summary>

                <summary>The editors announce that the Vindicator is being enlarged to eight
                    columns. "When we took charge of the 'Vindicator,' in the early part of 1863,
                    amid the excitement and disturbed condition of affairs, incidental to a state of
                    War, on account of a lack of printing material, together with a small
                    subscription list, we could furnish you with but a half sheet." Since then the
                    size of the paper has steadily increased.</summary>

                    and Lafon, has been playing before crowded houses in Staunton. "Billy Rice and

                <head>A New Plan of Contracts with Freedmen</head>

                    <p>Among the various styles of contracts with the freedmen none seem to work
                        better than the following, which has been largely adopted in South Carolina:
                        The farmer furnishes plow animals and farm implements, and keeps all under
                        his own care and control. He gives to each laborer a house and as much land
                        as he can cultivate on his own account, and firewood--all free. The employee
                        works for the planter the first half of the week, and works for himself the
                        balance of the time. The laborer meets his own expenses, and while working
                        his own crop has the free use of the plow animals and all the required
                        plantation tools. The laborers have no claim on the planter's crop, but have
                        absolute control of their own. By this arrangement the negroes obtain house,
                        land, firewood, and the use for three days of every week of all the
                        plantation animals and tools for three days' labor every week in cultivating
                        the employer's crop. And the employer has all the expense of feeding the
                        stock and keeping up the establishment. Those who have tried this plan says
                        it works to the satisfaction of both parties, and gives to the laborer who
                        behaves himself a permanent home and an interest in the place he cultivates,
                        and avoids the dissatisfaction often attending a division of the crop.</p>

                <summary>Describes in great detail a contract system for black farm laborers in
                    South Carolina. Claims it works really well and implies that Virginia should try
                    it out.</summary>
