<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Home Defence.</p>
                    <p>It is said with, we hope, no just cause, that the House of Delegates intend
                        to defeat the plan propased [sic] by Governor Smith for rendering the
                        protection of the country against raids more efficient. We cannot see the
                        sense of such a proceeding, and we are well convinced that it will not be
                        popular. The people have already suffered too much from these marauding
                        expeditions, the avowed object of which is to produce a famine in the
                        country. A great outcry was raised against Congress for placing on the list
                        of conscription ite[m]s over forty-five engaged in agricultural labors, and
                        the reason given was that, unless a sufficient number was left at home,
                        supplies of provision could not be raised, and a famine must come. It
                        strikes us that such famine will fully as likely be the consequence of
                        destr[o]ying the crops after they shall have been raised, as of never
                        putting them in the ground.</p>
                    <p>It has been said that we cannot prevent these raids by an armed force. We
                        can, nevertheless, greatly diminish their number. We can compel the
                        marauders to act in large bodies, and thus greatly circumscribe the sphere
                        of their opperations [sic]. We can by this means greatly reduce the number
                        of slaves and cattle which they may have it in their power to carry off. We
                        very much doubt whether we may not put an end to such exploits altogether by
                        placing on a war footing a sufficient number of men, always ready to
                        assemble and give battle on the shortest notice. When Stoneman's men passed
                        through the country last summer they moved as though the avenger of blood
                        were behind them. They expected to be attacked, and were ready to fly at the
                        first appearance of an armed force. Had there been such a force they would
                        all have been killed or captured. The mere fear of encountering such an one
                        saved the country from a degree of pillage infinitely more destructive than
                        that which it experienced.</p>
                    <p>We hope the House of Delegates will think twice before they put this bill to
                        death. The country require[s] such measures as it inaugurates, and will not
                        be satisfied without them.--Dispatch.</p>

                    <p>About dusk on the 11th inst., Lt. David Ream of the 18th Va. Cavalry shot and

                        to halt, which command Phenenger being unwilling or unable to obey, being
                        very much under the influence of liquor, Lt. Ream fired as Phenenger moved
                        beyond him, the ball entering the back on the left of the Spine, passing
                        through the lung and lodging near the skin on the right side. Phenenger fell

                        that the occurrence took place but especially so from the fact that both
