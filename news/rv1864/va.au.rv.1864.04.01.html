<b>To Whom It May Concern</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In addition to all the good news for the South--the re-enlistment of the
                    entire army, the support of the people for the Military, Tax, and Currency
                    bills, the provision by the people of supplies for troops--comes the news that
                    the crops should be plentiful this year. Since Virginia will likely be the scene
                    of perhaps the greatest struggle for victory, a large and steady supply of crops
                    is imperative. Rather than relying on crops coming from great distances,
                    Virginia troops need the quick availability of local crops.<br>

                    likely a precursor to what will be the most activity yet witnessed in the war.
                    Spring campaigns are imminent, and Virginia can expect to be the scene of much
                    activity.<br>
