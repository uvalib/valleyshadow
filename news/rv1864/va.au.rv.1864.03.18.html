<b>Appointments for 1864 of the Baltimore Annual Conference</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

<b>Southern Catholics Beware</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Irish lawyer Mr. McKeon spoke in New York City recently, quoting Mr.
                    Summers in the United States Senate as saying that the two relics of barbarism
                    were not slavery and polygamy but slavery and Catholicism. McKeon fears that
                    once "the knife is taken from the throats of the Southern people," it will be
                    turned to those of the Catholics of the North. The editor concludes that when
                    Puritanism has taken care of Southerners' local sin--slavery--it will turn on
                    the local sin of Northerners--Catholicism.<br>
