<b>Morale of the Yankee Army</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite reports in the North of high morale among Union troops, many
                    soldiers are deserting because they are dissatisfied with the new composition of
                    their regiments. Rather than being filled with Americans, the troops are filled
                    with immigrants, Canadians, and African Americans who have no loyalty to the
                    American flag or the war's cause.<br>

<b>War News</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a weekly recapitulation of developments on all fronts of the war, the
                    editor reports that picket line skirmishes continue in Petersburg and, in

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>Nothing of interest has occurred on the [illegible] in front of Richmond
                        during the past week.</p>
                    <p>On the lines about Petersburg there has been of late, more than the usual
                        cannonading and picket firing. On Saturday evening the enemy, for several
                        hours, shelled our lines near the Appomattox furiously, but with no result
                        worth mentioning. Besides there daily cannonading there is nothing of
                        interest occurring in the Petersburg front.</p>
                    <p>From the Lynchburg Republican we have the latest intelligence from the Yankee
                        raiders in the Southwest, states that they came as far as mack Meadow, a
                        point on the Virginia and Tennessee Rail Road, and after destroying the
                        Depot, and one or two small bridges, turned back in the direction of
                        Abingdon, destroying property of all kinds as they went. A party of fifteen
                        were sent to the Lead Mines in Wythe, who pattially [sic] destroyed them,
                        but it is through the damage can be repaired in a week or ten days at
                        farthest.</p>
                    <p>At Wytheville the Depot, Ordinance and other government offices, and that of
                        the Medical Purveyor were burned. All the Depots and Bridges on the Rail
                        Road, between Mack Meadows and Glade Spring are destroyed. The track is
                        thought to be but little injured at any point, and can be speedily repaired.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday evening the raiders were met on their retreat, at Atkin's, a
                        short distance this side of Marion, by the command of Colonel Witcher. A
                        fight ensued lasting from 4 o'clock until dark, when the enemy broke through
                        our lines and succeeding in escaping, not however without suffering
                        considerable loss. Col. Witcher pursued them and it was hoped would chastise
                        them still more.</p>
                    <p>It is reported by passengers from the West that the enemy had concentrated at
                        Saltville, and that a battle was fought there Sunday morning. We learn that
                        a courier from Saltville arrived at Dublin before the train left yesterday
                        morning, who reported that a fight had taken place and that the enemy had
                        been whipped and were retreating. We learn further that this statement was
                        believed by the military authorities at Dublin. If it be true we shall
                        possibly have official confirmation of it before going to press.</p>
                    <p>Conductor R.H. Buckner, with the engine of his train, went as far as Mack's
                        Meadows, seven miles from Wytheville, on Sunday. He confirms the report of
                        the retreat of the raiders and the burning of the depot at that point.</p>
                    <p>We regret to have the report of the deportation of the Bristol Register
                        confirmed. We also regret to hear a report that the office of the Abingdon
                        Virginian was partially if not wholly destroyed.</p>
                    <p>It is barely necessary to contradict the enemy's tale of the capture of
                        Savannah, and eleven thousand officers and men. We learn from the Richmond
                        papers that the Government received official dispatches from Savannah on the
                        19th which stated that all was well. The latest public intelligence from
                        that place is contained in the Charleston Courier of the 15th inst which has
                        the following.</p>
                    <p>The enemy made a demonstration on Savannah Tuesday and were repulsed. It is
                        supposed to have been only a feeler, put forth to ascertain our strength
                        there. General Hardee, in a despatch to General Beauregard dated Savannah,
                        Tuesday, December 13th, reports everything working well, and that in his
                        opinion the enemy were endeavoring to reach the coast by way of Genesis
                        Point and Fort McAlister. The enemy's fleet off Ossabaw Sound had largely
                        increased. Arrangements have been made which it is confidently believed will
                        interfere very materially with Sherman's progress towards the coast, if they
                        do not check him altogether. Sherman has been disappointed in not being able
                        to cross the Savannah river into South Carolina and effect a junction with
                        Foster's forces at Pocofaligo or Coosawatchie. He was thetefore [sic]
                        compelled to move down along the Ogeechee. All was quiet along the line of
                        railroad yesterday."</p>
                    <p>The news from Tennessee, furnished altogether by the Yankee papers is indeed
                        not of the most cheering character, and if true, it is wholly different from
                        what we expected to receive from that quarter. We have however this
                        consolation upon which we can always rely, that Yankee statements, made for
                        the Press, and the official bulletins of Stanton the Yankee Secretary of War
                        do not always contain facts but on the contrary are oftepn atched [sic] up
                        for the occasion, without regard to truths, and only intended to deceive,
                        and amuse the followers of Lincoln and Stanton.</p>
                    <p>The following from the Sentinel presents the whole affair in a nutshell.</p>
                    <p>It appears that on Thursday, the 15th an attack was made on Hood's lines
                        around Nashville, by Gen. Thomas, who held that city. On our left the attack
                        was sided by the Federal gunboats, and at that point it succeeded. On our
                        right the attack was unsuccessful, Hood holding his ground till night.</p>
                    <p>The enemy claim that our left was pressed back eight miles, and also that our
                        centre retreated two or three miles. This last movement was probably done to
                        prevent the flank, exposed by the falling back of the left wing. The number
                        of prisoners claimed to have been captured, "between eight hundred and a
                        thousand," would indicate no considerable disorder in our lines. The number
                        of pieces of artillery (sixteen) is out of proportion to the captures, and
                        was probably due to some accident.</p>
                    <p>Hood is reported, on the next day, to be retreating in full column. We have
                        great hope of hearing that he has since been able to make a more successful
                        battle. Unfortunately, it appears that Forrest was not with him in the
                        battle of Thursday. he has doubtless joined him again, as well as the
                        infantry sent to operate against Murfeesboro'. So far as we yet know, the
                        fight of Thursday may have pretty evenly deivided [sic] its favors; the
                        adva[n]tage being with the enemy on the left, and with Hood on the right. In
                        the next with galla[n]t Forrest to help, we may win a victory, which may God
                        grant, that will turn our mourning into laughter and thanksgiving.</p>
                    <p>We observe that the claim of victory, which may God grant, that will turn our
                        mourning into laughter and thanksgiving.</p>
                    <p>We observe that the claim of victory did not bring gold, down in New York,
                        the bankers saying that if the story was true, as told, it "did not amount
                        to much!"</p>
                    <p>Latest.</p>
                    <p>The Sentinel states that a report was current on yesterday that a member of
                        the Legislature had received a dispatch from the neighborhood of Saltville,
                        that Gen. Breckinridge and gained a decided victory over Burbridge on
                        Sunday, and that on Monday he again attacked the enemy, and compelled him to
                        retreat towards East Tennessee. The fight is stated to have occurred beyond
                        Glade Springs. Nothing relative to this reported fight had been received at
                        the War Department last evening.</p>
                    <p>By passengers in the Stage this morning we learn, that, Genl. Rosser attacked
                        on Wednesday morning about 4 o'clock, Custer's Division of Cavalry at
                        Mellrose, a point on the Turnpike 5 miles below Harrisonburg; and after a
                        short skirmish, succeeded in driving them from their position, and capturing
                        about 40 prisoners.</p>
                    <p>At last accounts they were moving down the Valley. It is fu[r]ther stated ,
                        that the main portion of the Yankee Cavalry now in the Lower Valley have
                        crossed the mountain, and are moving in the direction of Gordonsville. Genl
                        Early is in the right place, and will be able to confront them in any
                        direction they may think proper to take.</p>

                        To the People of Staunton and Augusta County:
                    </p>
                    <p>Our own dear boys have returned to winter among us--battered and
                        warworn--wanting all comforts, yet never complaining--deserving all honors,
                        yet never claiming them--brave yet modest. For nearly four years, this
                        gallant company, composed of our sons and brothers--the choice spirits of
                        our town and county, have bared their breasts to almost every battle
                        throughout the glorious campaigns of the Valley, and of old Virginia. Among
                        the first to volunteer in our sacred cause, their daring valor has never
                        quailed, but has often won the merited applause of our most distinguished
                        successes. What will their friends--their relatives--do for them now? What
                        testimonial of gratitude and approval will be offered to the remnant of that
                        gallant band who have periled their all for our protection? They come
                        divested of everything but glory. They have suffered all that we might be
                        saved. The festivals of Christmas and Year are at hand--let the fatted calf
                        be killed--let a grateful people see that these, their defenders shall be
                        warmed and fed--that having bravely periled all for us, the storms of Winter
                        shall not consume their precious bodies that the storms of War have spared.</p>
                    <p>People of a brave and patriotic community--the duty here enjoined has been
                        too long neglected. Come together now and act worthy. Cheer up the hearts of
                        your noble soldiers by unmistakable evidences of your approval and love.</p>
