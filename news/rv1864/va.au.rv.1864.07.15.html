<b>The Nigger Question in the Yankee Congress</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The United States House of Representatives and Senate recently revisited
                    the issue of opening the slave trade, according to this article, which relates

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Nigger Question in the Yankee Congress.</p>
                    <p>In the House of Representatives on the 29th the Civil Appropriation Bill was
                        under consideration. The Senate had proposed to amend the bill so that the
                        8th and 9th sections of the act to prohibit the importation of slaves into
                        any port within the jurisdiction of the United States after the 1st of
                        January, 1808, in which said sections undertake to regulate the coastwise
                        slave trade, be repealed forever.</p>
                    <p>The Committee of Ways and Means recommended a concurrence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brooks, of New York, (Dem,) suggested the danger of interfering with the
                        question of coastwise trade, which was now a monopoly in the hands of
                        Americans exclusively. The public mind might be so agitated that changes
                        would be made detrimental to commercial interests.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis remarked he believed the gentleman was mistaken as to the nature of
                        the amendment; it only proposed to so interfere with the coastwise trade as
                        to prevent the importation and transportation of slaves.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mallory, of Kentucky, said if the Abolitionist could make any profits by
                        continuing the slave trade they would do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaine of Maine, (Union) said the gentleman from New York (Brooks) would
                        by his policy strike down protection to the navigating and commercial
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brooks said that if there was free trade New York would vastly improve in
                        all her material interests.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaine replied that the gentleman would strike down the laws of
                        navigation in order that New York might be built up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cox said that the advantages of the coastwise trade was a contract
                        between the North and South. The North has broken the contract, but holds
                        the consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaine said a Western Confederacy was talked of.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cox said he never heard of it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaine, in the course of his remarks said, a Western Confederacy could
                        not be set up long enough to be kicked over, without an outlet to the ocean.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arnold of Illinois, (Union,) said the gentleman from New York remarked
                        some time ago, that Slavery was dead. Did he still think so?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brooks replied that he was no undertaker or embalmer, to bury the body of
                        Slavery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arnold asked, if slavery was dead, why continue the Slave trade?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brooks replied, that the gentleman, like Don Quixote, was fighting a
                        windmill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arnold said, he wished Slavery was a mere shadow; he was removing from
                        the statute books all tracts recognizing Slavery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brooks, noticing some remarks of Mr. Blaine, said the latter was guilty
                        of moral treason in saying that if the votes were taken, New York would give
                        a majority of 30,000 votes for Jeff Davis. This would give aid and comfort
                        to the rebels, and be paraded in the Richmond press.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaine asked how would New York decide between the Montgomery
                        Constitution and the reelection of President Lincoln? Would she not prefer
                        the former?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brooks replied she wanted the Constitution of our fathers and no other.</p>
                    <p>The debate was terminated by order of the House, when the question was taken
                        on the Senate's amendment, which was agreed to.</p>

                    <p>Who Are They?</p>
                    <p>Just when all Yankeedom is jubilant over the prospect of Grant's sure and
                        certain capture of Petersburg and the consequent reduction of the Rebel
                        Capital, and the daily journals are eagerly sought for the news of Grant's
                        marching into starved out Richmond, comes the startling cry, from the upper
                        Potomac, of a terrible Rebel invasion. Consternation is depicted in the face
                        of Unionists and fear and trembling shakes their feeble knees. Nor is the
                        alarm and panic allayed by the news from the threatened point. One report
                        has it that Early with a large force is moving into Pennsylvania, another
                        that it is only a small cavalry force bent on the destruction of the
                        Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Canal, both of which, (whether they are
                        a handful or a multitude,) have been seriously damaged. Then they have it
                        that Breckenridge heads this force of infantry and cavalry and that they
                        number 15,000, and finally they have it that it is Ewell's and Longstreet's
                        corps under the immediate command of Gen. R.E. Lee. That there is a
                        multitude of reports flying which have not reached us may be seen from the
                        following extract.</p>
                    <p>"A Chambersburg paper says that, in summing up the information gathered from
                        various border sources by a large corps of reporters, "the rebels had
                        crossed the Potomac at no less than twenty four different places, the
                        previous afternoon, in columns from five to ten thousand strong, and that
                        the main body had not yet reached the river," that according to all these
                        reports, "not less than a million rebels were about to enter Pennsylvania;"
                        that they had "maintained a line of battle twenty miles long all day Sunday,
                        on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad;" that they had fired at the rate of
                        fifteen cannon shots every second, and that, judging from the distance they
                        were heard, some of the rebel guns "could not have been less than fifteen
                        hundred pounders."</p>
                    <p>Since no one seems to be able to give them the desired information as to who
                        the invaders are, we, in consideration of their late kind treatment to the
                        people in the Valley, venture, in spite of all the Provost Marshals and
                        Commandants of Posts in the Confederacy, to relieve their minds. Gen.
                        Hunter, while in this county, received and had read to his troops official
                        information of the evacuation of Richmond and its occupation by Grant. Grant
                        wishing to make as much Bumcombe as possible has not desired this
                        information to be given to the Yankee public yet and consequently it will be
                        perceived that the last report they get from the threatened point is the
                        reliable one, to some extent. It is not only Ewell's and Longstreet's corps
                        but the whole of Gen. Lee's army, under his immediate command, which in the
                        evacuation of Richmond, have been forced to cross the Potomac to avoid being
                        surrounded and captured by the Victorious Hunter with Sigel as grand
                        flanker. It is true that Lee has about a half a million or perhaps a million
                        of men with him but they are so depressed at the loss of Richmond that Gov.
                        Curtin's Melish can easily capture the whole of them. There now, don't be
                        alarmed, Governor Curtin's Melish and Sigel's 100 day men are between you
                        and danger.</p>

<b>Calling Out the Reserves</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor states his concern over the recent calling out of the Reserves
                    of the Valley. Most of them are farmers who have been ignoring their corn crops,
                    which they planted at top capacity in order to salvage as much of their wheat
                    crops as possible in the few weeks since the Reserves were disbanded. Since only
                    white labor is available locally, the corn crop will suffer even more if white
                    farmers are called to service. The editor is certain that the Commandant of
                    Conscripts for Virginia is unaware of the labor situation in the area.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Calling out the Reserves.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen from the several orders, published in to-day's paper, that
                        the Reserves of the Valley are again called out.</p>
                    <p>We do not know what is the occasion of calling them out, but we do know that
                        it is a source of great inconvenience to this section. They are mostly
                        farmers, and have large crops out, which, even when they were absent a few
                        weeks since, suffered very much. In the little respite since they were
                        disbanded they have been assiduously engaged in saving their wheat crop,
                        doing little or nothing with their corn, which they planted to their utmost
                        capacity. As there is but little else than white labor in the Valley and no
                        possible chance of working the corn crop, (now much in need of it,) if the
                        Reserves are, at present, placed on duty, we felt it incumbent on us, not
                        only as a duty we owe to the Reserves and those dependent on them, but also
                        to the Confederacy, which will be greatly the loser thereby, to call the
                        attention of those in authority to the state of the case here.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances east of the Blue Ridge may be such, for all we know, as not
                        to be so much effected by the Reserves being called out, there being more
                        labor and the crops maturing more early in that section, but here it works
                        an exceedingly great hardship.</p>
                    <p>We are satisfied that the Commandant of Conscripts for Virginia, if
                        acquainted with the state of the case here, (with which we opine he is not,
                        but only acting for the good of the Confederacy from the facts in his
                        immediate proximity, unless there is an emergency of which we are not
                        cognizant and which we very much doubt,) could not make the hardship so
                        great [illegible] people, who have been robbed of their supplies by the late
                        Yankee raid and whose sole dependence is [illegible] the present promising
                        prospect of abundant crops.</p>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>The point of interest in the army of Gen'l Lee is now in front of Petersburg.
                        Nothing of interest has transpired at that point during the last week. The
                        Richmond papers assert positively that one corps of Grant's army has gone to
                        Washington, and the impression prevails that more are going. In confirmation
                        of the foregoing, authentic information has been received at Richmond that a
                        large number of Transports have recently passed down the James River. The
                        Northern papers inform us that the most intense excitement prevails in
                        Maryland and Pennsylvania, (and no doubt in Washington) in consequence of a
                        "Rebel" invasion, and it would not be at all strange that Lincoln regarding
                        his own safety paramount to every thing else had perem[p]torily ordered
                        Grant to Washington, to effect that object. While this may be mere
                        speculation, there is no doubt some movemen[t] is going on in Grant's army,
                        the character of which will be revealed in a few days.</p>
                    <p>From Northern Georgia, we learn that Gen. Johnston, in order to counteract a
                        flank movement made in force by the enemy, withdrew his army on the 3d
                        inst., from the vicinity of Marietta, and fell back to the line of the
                        Chattahoochee River. With this river in his front, and a line of formidable
                        breastworks prepared in advance for the reception of his army, he will be
                        the better enabled to resist the advance of the enemy, and at the same time
                        render the safety of Atlanta more secure.</p>
                    <p>An official Dispatch dated the 10th inst., from Gen Jones, says that Gen.
                        Robertson attacked the enemy Saturday morning, and drove them from their
                        position, with loss to us of 100 killed and wounded. Eenemy [sic] fell back
                        to transports and passed to James and Morris's Islands. monitors and
                        gunboats in Stone have been driven beyond effective range of our
                        batteries--the monitor damaged. It appears that the force now operating

                        concentrating at Ripley, Miss., in order to meet Washburn, who was at and
                        east of Lagrange, with a force of 18,000 men. It was not known with what
                        force Gen. Forrest would be able to meet the enemy, though it was felt that
                        a severe chastisement awaited him, as Forrest does not know the meaning of
                        the word defeat. He was dismounting every man who was not well mounted and
                        thoroughly equipped.</p>

                        "Staunton Spectator" has been suspended since the date of its last issue,
                        the 31st of May, in consequence of the destruction of the office by the
                        enemy on the 7th day of June. He is making preparations to publish it again,
                        and will do so as soon as it will be possible for him to obtain a suitable
                        Press and the necessary materials. having had his Job Press repaired, he is
                        again prepared to execute Job Work as heretofore. The enemy destroyed
                        everything in the three stories of the building, and the Job Press is the
                        only one that could be repaired--the others being, he fears, a total loss.</p>
                    <p>As the fabled Phoenix rises from its funeral pyre, so will the "Spectator,"
                        before many moons have filled their horns, rise from its heap of ruins--an
                        eloquent monument of the enemy's Vandalism and cowardly dread of truthful
                        utterances. They esteem an independent Press as more "terrible than an army
                        with banners." They feel that, "the pen is mightier and will prevail"--hence
                        their chivalric warfare upon Printing Offices.</p>
