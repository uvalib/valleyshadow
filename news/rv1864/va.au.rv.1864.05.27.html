<b>Progress of "Negro" Equality</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses changes in the ways white people and African Americans are
                    relating to each other, particularly in Washington, D. C. The writer
                    disparagingly and sarcastically notes the role of President Lincoln in pushing
                    for better treatment of African Americans. A steamboat line running between
                    Washington, Baltimore, and Fortress Monroe has had the rule that white and
                    African-American passengers could not eat together at the same table but now has
                    changed that rule, much to the writer's consternation.<br>

                    <p>Progress of "Negro" Equality.</p>
                    <p>From a Washington Letter.</p>
                    <p>The progress of the social equality of niggers with white people is making
                        fearful headway in this part of the world. The fiat has gone forth from the
                        White House that all who expect to find favour in the eyes of his Majesty
                        Abraham the First must be ready on all occasions to bow down and worship
                        this idol of the Republican party. General Butler (who feels that his head
                        is in some danger since the appointment of General Smith to command the
                        troops in his department) has just taken a step in this direction that will
                        no doubt restore him to full favour with ours would be monarchy. The daily
                        line of steamboats which run between this city, Baltimore and Fortress
                        Monroe, have always had among their rules, one which forbade the presence of
                        coloured people at the same table with the passengers. This rule was
                        enforced on a recent occasion. But, when the boat arrived at Fortress
                        Monroe, the friends of the coloured person who had been refused a seat at
                        the table complained to General Butler of the "indignity" thus offered to
                        one of "our coloured fellow citizens." The Hero of Big Bethel at once issued
                        an order directing that in future negroes should be allowed to sit and eat
                        at the same table with the passengers on board of these boats, and that no
                        distinction whatever should be made in the treatment of any person on
                        account of his colour. Henceforth, therefore the ladies and gentlemen who
                        travel on these steamboats will have the exquisite pleasure of sitting at
                        the stable [sic] side by side with filthy, greasy niggers.</p>

                    Generals, and especially General Lee, not to put themselves in positions of

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Review.</p>
                    <p>Why should we expect success in the present campaign? There are some who feel
                        a painful fear of the defeat of our armies, unless they see at all times
                        telegraphic dispatches or newspaper bulletins of our continued success. A
                        week's delay in obtaining news from the front is all that is necessary to
                        transform there from their tad pole condition to that of a small sized
                        croaker. They expect a General to hurl an adversary from strong positions,
                        defeat his army or put it to ignominious rout in less time than a squadron
                        of cavalry would advance to a charge. There are no Generals extant who could
                        equal the expectations of such persons. for all such we feel that it is a
                        useless task to write. To those who have no depression because of the
                        tapping of a railway by a raiding party nor are unduly elated by a minor
                        success we would say, in answer to the question at the head of this article,
                        that there is every reason to believe that we will win in the present
                        campaign. The campaign is not immediately confined, as regards its
                        commencement, to the Spring, at which time it opened here, but may be
                        considered as begun in the series of movements made in Texas, Mississippi
                        and Florida, all of which had more or less bearing on the impending struggle
                        in Virginia, being the mere movement of pawns in the great game of chess to
                        be played out on another part of the board between stronger pieces, to which
                        these lesser ones but aided the initiation. Let us take a recursery [sic]
                        view of these movements. The movement in Texas met with disaster and was
                        forced to take a new direction into Louisiana and Arkansas, although we have
                        it distinctly stated that the armies making the latter movement were
                        positively ordered to reinforce the army of Tennessee. In Mississippi the
                        forces under Sherman, with all their parade and bragging, failed to
                        accomplish any thing further than the destruction of a few bridges and the
                        tearing up of twenty-five or thirty miles of railroad track, and hastily
                        retreated also to reinforce the army of Tennessee. The expedition into
                        florida was speedily repelled by the gallant Finnegan, being driven under
                        the protection of their gunboats and of which only a few are left in that
                        State the remainder coming to the east to engage in the great game there.
                        After thundering at the walls of the detested city, Charleston for such a
                        length of time with but little effect, the men and armaments of that
                        locality have also been withdrawn to participate in their expected success.
                        Thus is it narrowed down to the two great fields of Georgia and Virginia,
                        the former of which is now being used by the enemy as a distraction from
                        their grand aim--which involves the destruction of the army of Northern
                        Virginia, the seizure of the capital and ultimate overthrow of the
                        Confederacy. In our immediate proximity we find that the contest is
                        measurably narrowing down to the conflict between the armies of Gens. Lee
                        and Grant. Averill and Crook essaying to make a movement on what might be
                        termed Gen. Lee's extreme left flank have been signally chastised by the
                        redoubtable Morgan, the gallant Jenkins, Jones, Jackson, French and
                        McCausland, while, Siegel, who tried the route of Banks in the Valley, came
                        as near being routed by the brave leaders off the Valley, Breckinridge and
                        Imboden, as did commissary Banks at the hands of the lamented Stonewall
                        Jackson. On the extreme right butler, reinforced by the forces from of
                        Charleston harbor and Florida, would fain have reached the city of Richmond
                        before his great superior Grant, but unaccountably and unfortunately found
                        in his way the ever present and invincible Beauregard, and, report says, is
                        endeavoring now to join his superior with the remnant of his demoralized
                        crew. Thus we see that the armies of the North have rapidly converged to the
                        grand centre under Grant, where they have already met a sufficiency of
                        obstacles, as acknowledged by their own rulers, to have deterred any save
                        Grant, whose stubbornness, for which he has been proverbial for years, seems
                        to have been intensified by his desire to obtain power in the North, of
                        which the failure to endeavor to proceed now would destroy the last shadow
                        of a hope.</p>
                    <p>He asserts that he will fight it out in the line he has selected if it takes
                        all summer, and we believe he will do so if he can muster the men
                        sufficient.</p>
                    <p>Then to sum it up although, Averill and Sigel may either attempt to distract
                        by movements, which will most surely be repelled, or, Butler may leave a
                        small force to annoy by disturbing communications below Richmond, yet the
                        contest if decided now must be done by the two great armies of Virginia.
                        With a vast preponderance of numbers they have failed most signally thus
                        far, having been defeated with immense loss (stated at 70,000 by Northern
                        papers) in every attempt to overwhelm Gen. Lee, and having accomplished
                        nothing save the cutting of railway and telegraph communication. Taking the
                        losses of the enemy into consideration, even allowing largely for
                        reinforcements to fill up their depleted ranks, they will, as the experience
                        of the many days battles proves, find that all the troops they can map under
                        Grant will be but adding numbers for destruction before the brave men with
                        whom gen. Lee will continue to contest their way. Of their own choice they
                        are contesting the matter just where we could most desire it. We have been
                        gloriously successful thus far and will in the end most assuredly defeat the
                        only army to whom the enemy look for success and put at rest forever, we
                        hope, the desire of the North to subjugate the brave people of our glorious
                        Confederacy.</p>
