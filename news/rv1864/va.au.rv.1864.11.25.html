<b>Gen. Lee's Vigilance</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>General Grant has paid General Lee a high compliment in stating that, at
                    every turn, federal forces find Confederate forces guarding their lines. Lee's
                    vigilance in covering all possible bases makes Grant's "on to Richmond" movement
                    futile and gives the latter little hope in having a good report for Lincoln.<br>

                    <p>The constant rain which has fallen for several successive days during the
                        past week has almost effectually put a stop (for the time being) to military

                        front. The following is Gen. Lee's report of the affair:</p>

                    <p>R.E. Lee</p>
                    <p>On Friday and Saturday the enemy made an effort to recaptured the position,
                        and re-establish their picket lines, but each time were repulsed with loss.</p>
                    <p>The "Express" gives the following statement of an affair that took place on
                        the Petersburg lines.</p>
                    <p>"A most amusing, and at the same time satisfactory incident, occurred in
                        front of Wright's brigade, just to the left of the Weldon railroad, on
                        Saturday morning an hour or two before day. A report was brought in that the
                        enemy was advancing at that point, and the men were called to arms at once.
                        The pickets were on the alert; and soon heard a noise in front, as of
                        advancing forces. A sharp volley of musketry was discharged at the supposed
                        foe, when a sudden rush was heard, and forward through the lines charged in
                        wild disorder forty-two fine beeves--until that moment Yankee property. They
                        had evidently strayed or deserted from the Yankee herd, or perhaps came in
                        search of those recently captured by General Hampton on the banks of the
                        James. They got lost on the way, and were wandering between the two armies,
                        coming in the direction of Petersburg, when they were discovered by our
                        pickets. The sudden discharge of musketry in their front, and the probable
                        wounding of one or two, frightened the creatures and caused them to dash
                        forward. This is the first instance on record of a charge by cattle on lines
                        defended by armed men and in the face of a rapid musketry fire. We
                        understand they came in good line of battle; and were not gathered up until
                        they had passed to the rear. They are remarkably fine beeves, and the
                        incident caused great amusement in camp. Perhaps the Yankees might learn a
                        lesson from the charge made by the dumb beasts they had transported for
                        slaughter."</p>
                    <p>Gen. Breckinridge's victory in East Tennessee gets better as it gets older.
                        The prisoners captured are now reported at eight hundred and fifty. The
                        Yankees stopped on Friday to make a stand at Strawberry Plains, but finding
                        General Vaughan again making for their rear; broke again, and did not stop
                        until safe within the fortifications at Knoxville.</p>
                    <p>As troops have been withdrawn from Knoxville to reinforce General Thomas at
                        Pulaski, we shall not be surprised to hear that General Breckinridge has
                        carried the city by storm, and dislodged Brownlow and his filthy associates.</p>
                    <p>The latest accounts from Georgia, state that Sherman was in close proximity
                        to Macon and a battle was deemed imminent. He has cut the Railroad between
                        Augusta and Macon at a point about 25 miles from Macon. The invading force
                        consists of four corps of infantry, viz: Fourteenth commanded by General
                        Jeff. C. Davis; Tenth, commanded by Gen. Osterhaus; Seventeenth corps,
                        commanded by Gen. Blair, and the Twentieth corps, commanded by Gen. Slocum.
                        The Confederate force will be stated hereafter, but is much larger than is
                        generally supposed.</p>
                    <p>Since writing the foregoing we learn that Gov. Brown's residence, in Canton,
                        Cherokee county, embracing his commodious dwelling house, kitchen,
                        out-houses, &amp;c., together with his office building, were all burnt
                        to the ground by the vandal foe, a few days ago. The officer in command of
                        the vandals who were sent to execute the work they so ruthlessly and
                        successfully performed, allowed the family who were living on the premises
                        at the time, only fifteen minutes to remove the furniture from the house,
                        and all that was not removed within that time was devoured by the flames.</p>
                    <p>The same party burned the court house, jail, academy, both the hotels, and
                        about two-thirds of the best dwelling and business houses in Canton.</p>
                    <p>From the lower Valley we learn that the enemy advanced with two divisions of
                        Cavalry, two miles this side of Mt. Jackson (Rood's Hill) on Wednesday last
                        and was met by a portion of our Cavalry and Infantry who immediately charged
                        them and drove them back twelve miles. They left their dead and wounded in
                        our hands. Our loss very small.</p>

                        the omnipotent order of Grant, yet so many have been the statements of the
                        loss of property in portions of this County made to us and many the cases of
                        individual hardship consequent thereupon, that we are again constrained to
                        notice this subject.</p>
                    <p>The people of the United States claim to be in the fore front of the world's
                        civilization and to possess all the attributes that make up a great and
                        glorious nation, and would fain posses the world's applause for all their
                        deeds, while they hold up to the scorn of that same world the nets of those
                        they are pleased to designate as Rebels to the "best Government the world
                        ever saw." We have no means now of disabusing the minds of outside nations
                        of the false ideas thus sought to be inculcated upon them, even if we
                        desired to do so, but we can build up a mountain of attested facts which
                        will stand as an everlasting monument of the malicious inhumanity and wanton
                        barbarity of that make-believe enlightened nation--a perpetual badge of its
                        disgrace. We propose then that our County Court shall, as the Rockingham
                        County Court has already done, appoint a committee whose special duty it
                        shall be to estimate the damage to the people of our county by the
                        incendiarism, theft and pillage of the public enemy, and report to the Court
                        as fully succinctly and promptly as possible, and the said report be
                        carefully preserved among the proceedings of the Court to be used when the
                        future demands of History shall require all the minutiae of the cruel and
                        heartless prosecution of this war on the part of our enemies. The loss of
                        property, by our people and the sufferings of innocent children, helpless
                        women and decrepit age, caused by the uncalled for destruction of their
                        means of subsistence demand that a record of the outrages spoken of above
                        shall be made and preserved, and we know of no means equal to the one
                        suggested of handing down to coming generations a statement of facts so
                        perfectly incontrovertable. We ask then that our County Court will at its

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Education of Children of Deceased Soldiers.</p>
                    <p>On last Thursday evening, a meeting in behalf of the Education of the
                        Children of deceased and disabled Soldiers was held at the Baptist Church of
                        this place. After prayer by Rev. W.S. Baird, Wesleyan Female Institute, Rev.
                        A.E. Dickinson of Richmond, addressed the congregation. He states that there
                        were in Va. 5000 children, whose fathers had perished in this war, which
                        number was of course increasing every day--that last June at the Va. Baptist
                        General Association a movement was inaugurated to secure the education of
                        these little ones, and that the plan was to expand all monies secured in
                        sending such children to the best and most convenient schools, without
                        regard to denomination. He eloquently dwelt on the claims of the soldiers,
                        whose chief anxiety was for his loved ones at home, and by whose sacrifice
                        and suffering our safety was secured, and our victory must be won. He dwelt
                        on the feelings of the widowed mother, and urged that we owed it to her to
                        aid in providing for her children whose Protector had died for us. He then
                        spoke of the importance to our nation of giving this large and increasing
                        class of youth at least a good English education--such as would enable the
                        truly talented among them to rise higher, and would prepare all for the
                        ordinary business of life. He was followed in a few statements by Rev. Geo.
                        B. Taylor, and then a subscription amounting to nearly $11,000 was secured.
                        It is hoped that the committee, consisting of H.H. Peck, C.R. Mason, and
                        W.H. Peyton, appointed to increase this sum will run it up to over $20,000.
                        Mr. Taylor also announced that the following gentlemen, vi: C.R. Mason, W.H.
                        Peyton, W.J. Shumate, W.J.D. Bell and M.G. Harman and himself had been
                        appointed to act for the Central Committee in Richmond in finding out and
                        putting to school all the children in the Valley of the class referred to.
                        This Committee will doubtless make some communication to the public, but it
                        may be stated here and now, that children of deceased soldiers, reported to
                        them will be provided with tuition and books at such schools as their
                        friends may select. Teachers in every neighborhood would do well to look up
                        such children and report them Ministers and Magistrates and indeed all who
                        care for the children of the dead soldier are earnestly invite to
                        co-operate. The writer has found in this town five such children, and placed
                        them at the Schools of their choice.</p>

                    recent battle at Cedar Creek totaled almost seven hundred and the Union wounded
                    totaled four thousand. Ninety of the Confederate wounded have died, eighty-two
                    have been sent to Northern prisons, and forty have escaped. The federal forces
                    in Winchester have provided medical attention to the Confederate prisoners but
                    have kept them from receiving food and other items from the women of the area.<br>
