<b>A Discontented Contraband</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article contains a letter to an African-American preacher in Nashville
                    from a former slave from Alabama who accompanied Yankee troops to the North but
                    who now feels more enslaved than he did in the South. He is unable to write but
                    found a free woman to write for him. He says he was foolish to leave a good home
                    and kind friends to join the "cruel, lying, swindling Yankees," who promise him
                    everything but deliver nothing.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Spurgeon on Negroes</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This excerpt from an interview with Rev. Mr. Spurgeon reflects his belief
                    that people in England have tired of helping America's African Americans. At
                    first the British were glad to help African Americans gain freedom. However, too
                    many of them have immigrated to Britain, and they often want too much. The
                    writer of the article comments that thousands of other people are beginning to
                    agree with Spurgeon.<br>

<b>Purchase of Cotton &amp;c.</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor alerts the readers to the bill passed by the Virginia Assembly
                    on the purchase of cotton supplies for distribution and sale to citizens of
                    Virginia and refugees. The editor calls on the county court to appoint an agent
                    for Augusta County at its next meeting to serve as purchaser in order to meet
                    the needs of the area.<br>

<b>Municipal Elections</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Wednesday's municipal election in Staunton produced the following results:
                    N. K. Trout, Mayor; W. L. Balthis, Sergeant; and the following Council
                    members--W. G. Sterrett, B. F. Points, J. W. Crawford, A. M. Bruce, J. B.
                    Scharer, W. B. Kayser, W. H. Wilson, J. B. Evans, F. M. Young, J. M. Hardy, and
                    D. C. McGuffin or Colonel George Baylor. The latter two received an equal number
                    of votes, but because F. M. Young has not been a resident long enough to be
                    eligible for office, both McGuffin and Baylor will be on the Council.<br>(Names in announcement:  N. K. Trout,  W. L. BalthisSergeant,  W. G. Sterrett,  B. F. Points,  J. W.

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John B. Watts, deputy clerk of the Circuit Court of Augusta County,
                    graciously refuses to be a candidate for the office of Clerk. He adds that in
                    his time as deputy clerk he has not conducted other business in that office and
                    calls on other candidates to make such a pledge. Because the building was built
                    for a specific reason and is a public facility, it should not be used for other
                    business, as has been the case in the past.<br>(Names in announcement:  John B. Watts)</blockquote>
