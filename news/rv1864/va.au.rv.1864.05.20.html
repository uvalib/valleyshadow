<b>From the Valley</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Last Sunday's skirmish involved General Breckenridge's troops and General
                    Imboden's troops against the enemy near New Market. A friend reported seeing
                    seventy-nine dead Yankees on one side of the road and thirty-three on the other
                    only one mile from New Market, indicating that enemy losses must have been
                    severe. General Imboden lost a number of members of the 62nd Virginia in the
                    engagement and captured a number of prisoners. Two hundred and thirty prisoners,
                    including those Imboden captured previously from the 1st New York Cavalry, have
                    arrived in Staunton, with more on their way. In the 62nd Regiment, Captain
                    Currence was killed and Captains Chipley, Bastable, Hill, Holt, Smith, and
                    Woodson were wounded. The Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute were in this
                    fight and performed well. Captain R. H. Phillips of Staunton provided a list of
                    the killed and wounded from the Institute, including Cadet Stuart of Augusta
                    County and C. W. Turner of Staunton, both wounded. Other cadets from Staunton
                    participated in the fight but were unharmed, including A. Stuart, C. Taylor, J.
                    Stuart, William Crawford, C. Harrison, and S. T. Phillips.<br>(Names in announcement: General  Imboden, Captain R. H. Phillips, Cadet  Stuart,  C. W. Turner,  A. Stuart,  C. Taylor,  J. Stuart,  William Crawford,  C. Harrison,  S. T. Phillips)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Staunton Artillery, under the command of Captain Garber of Staunton,
                    maintains the high reputation it earned in First Manassas with its performance
                    recently at Spotsylvania Court House. The Richmond Howitzers left their guns,
                    and General Lee called for volunteers to replace them. The Staunton Artillery
                    volunteered, operated the Howitzer Battery and two others, and worked so
                    efficiently that General Lee noticed the performance. From the Staunton
