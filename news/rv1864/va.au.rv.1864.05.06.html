<b>Lieut. Gen. Jackson</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor reminds readers of the plan to erect a tomb over Stonewall
                    Jackson's remains, a privilege bestowed by Jackson's family to the soldiers of
                    the Stonewall Brigade. This memorial is different from the statue to be erected
                    and paid for from contributions from the general public. Only past, present, and
                    future members of the Stonewall Brigade are eligible to contribute to this
                    cause, a privilege conferred upon them rather than a favor asked of them. About
                    six thousand dollars has been raised thus far, a sum that needs to be doubled at
                    least.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Prices Falling</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An overall decline in prices of general provisions is a good sign,
                    according to this article from the Mobile Tribune. Butter, for example, fell
                    from $10-$12 a pound three weeks ago to $5-$6 per pound.<br>

<b>A Word to All</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor notes the hopefulness of the present time and reminds readers of
                    their duties to the cause, particularly in terms of finances. He warns that some
                    people will hoard money or sell at high prices out of interest of personal
                    profit but contends that the well-being of the Confederacy is in everyone's
                    interest.<br>

<b>Sorghum</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor promotes the production of sorghum as a suitable substitute for
                    citizens when meat is so badly needed by the troops. Samuel A. Hoshour, Steward
                    of the Central Lunatic Asylum, has planted fourteen acres. Another local farmer
                    has studied the subject of sorghum production and offers advice on how area
                    farmers may obtain maximum output, including recommending planting at intervals
                    so that the entire crop does not become ready at the same time.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. Samuel A. Hoshour)</blockquote>
<b>Organization</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The society devoted to distributing artificial limbs free to maimed
                    soldiers was organized last Tuesday evening after hearing addresses by the Rev.
                    Mr. Stirewalt and Honorable H. H. Stuart. The society elected Stuart President,
                    R. H. Mauzy Secretary, and Colonel George Baylor Treasurer. The society
                    appointed committees of women and men to solicit and receive contributions. The
                    editor reminds the people of Augusta that contributing is a duty they owe the
                    soldiers.<br>(Names in announcement: Honorable H. H. Stuart,  R. H. Mauzy, Colonel George Baylor)</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor alerts the readers to the notice in another column by Major
                    Beverly Randolph calling for the immediate return of guns issued to Raid Guards,
                    as they are needed urgently.<br>(Names in announcement: Major Beverly Randolph)</blockquote>
<b>From the Lower Valley</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The most reliable report of the enemy's movement in the Valley indicates
                    that the enemy is encamped at Fisher's Hill, three miles from Strasburg, and has
                    captured Woodstock. This movement up the Valley is believed to have been a cover
                    for Sigel, who is reported to have met up with Meade's army by way of Front
                    Royal.<br>

                    <p>From the Lower Valley.</p>
                    <p>There are several reports of the movements of the enemy in the Valley. The
                        most reliable report is that the enemy are encamped at Fisher's Hill, three
                        miles this side of Strasburg and have occupied Woodstock--It is generally
                        believed that the movement up the Valley was to cover the movement of Sigel,
                        who is reported to have crossed to Meade's army by way of Front Royal.</p>
