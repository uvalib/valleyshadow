                    <p>Retaliation.</p>
                    <p>No nation of people on the globe are more kind and humane in their feelings
                        than the people of the Confederate States. They have been averse to treating
                        prisoners of war, who came not only with arms, but with the incendiary's
                        torch in their hands, to make the work of their subjugation more cruel and
                        more complete, with hearts blackened with the foul intent of adding infamous
                        disgrace to their many atrocities, other than they would if they had been
                        soldiers fighting in defence of homes and innocent ones, never having
                        inflicted a wrong and only maintaining the right, when our own unfortunate
                        prisoners have been immured in Northern dungeons to pine away from neglect
                        or indignities shown, and die alone and uncared for, and have ever provided
                        for those in their hands as best, in their isolated condition, they could.
                        The same desire not to inflict unnecessary punishment has restrained our
                        military leaders, save in rare and exceptional cases, from allowing the
                        death penalty to be inflicted for desertion, thus adding innocently to the
                        cost of life and suffering on many battle fields by their leniency and
                        losing the fruits of victory which our full numbers would have reaped. This
                        same humane feeling has prevented a just retaliation for wanton and cruel
                        murders committed by the enemy upon our prisoners--which, if inflicted at
                        once would have saved untold suffering. We can recall no instance in which,
                        even when prisoners were selected, actual retaliation was made, save in the
                        case published below, when Col. Griffin commanding on the Blackwater,
                        selected a private of the 5th Ohio "whom" says he: "I hang in retaliation"
                        for Private Bright of the 62nd Ga. Cavalry murdered by Gen. Wilde as a
                        guerrilla. No more of Col. Girffin's [sic] men will be executed as
                        guerrillas, for he will retaliate. If our leaders but follow Col. Griffin's
                        example they will save many of our men from being cruelly treated and even
                        murdered, which their excessive humanity but invites.</p>
                    <p>Further of Retaliation.</p>
                    <p>Our correspondent has obtained a copy of the letter sent to the Federal
                        General Wilde, by the Colonel commanding the forces on Blackwater, relative
                        to the late measures of retaliation adopted by our military authorities in
                        Eastern North Carolina:</p>
                    <p>"Head Qur's Forces on Blackwater</p>
                    <p>Franklin, Va., Jan., 1864.</p>
                    <p>"General Wilde,</p>
                    <p>Comd'g Colored Brig. Norfolk, Va.</p>
                    <p>"Sir--Probably no expedition during the progress of this war, has been
                        attended with more utter disregard for the long established usages of
                        civilization, or the dictates of humanity, than was your late raid into the
                        country bordering the Albemarle.</p>
                    <p>"Your stay, though short, was marked by crimes and enormities. You burned
                        houses over the heads of defenceless women and children, carried off private
                        property of every description, arrested non-combatants, and carried off
                        ladies in irons, whom you confined with negro men. Your negro troops fired
                        on Confederates after they had surrendered, and they were only saved by the
                        exertions of the more humane of your white officers.</p>
                    <p>"Last, but not least, under the pretext that he was a guerrilla, you hanged
                        Daniel Bright, a private of company L, Sixty-second Georgia regiment
                        (cavalry,) forcing the ladies and gentlemen who held in arrest to witness
                        the execution of Samuel Jones, a private of company B, Fifth Ohio, whom I
                        hang I retaliation. I hold two more of your men--in irons--as hosrage [sic]
                        for Mrs. Weeks and Mrs. Mundin. When these ladies are released, these men
                        will be relieved, and treated as prisoners of war.</p>
                    <p>"Colonel Joel R. Griffin."</p>

                <summary>The editor asserts that no people in the world are more kind and humane
                    than the people of the Confederacy, and he cites several examples to prove this
                    point. These traits have prevented Southern troops from retaliating, in most
                    cases, for Northern atrocities. In one case, however, Colonel Joel R. Griffin
                    selected a private from the 5th Ohio to execute in retaliation for the hanging
                    of Private Daniel Bright of the 62nd Georgia, who was held by General Wilde.
                    Griffin promises to hang others if Confederate prisoners continue to be hanged.
                    The editor of the Vindicator applauds this tactic and claims that Griffin's
                    example will save many Confederate men being held from being executed. The
                    article closes with a copy of the letter Griffin sent Wilde explaining his
                    position.</summary>

                    where they have been cared for, aligning with Northerners who have shown no
                    concern for them and who will place them on the front lines, and then shooting
                    Southerners who have lived with them for so long.</summary>
