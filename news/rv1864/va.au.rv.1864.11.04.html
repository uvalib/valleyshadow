                        Gen. Butler.</p>
                    <p>HdQr's Army Northern Virginia,</p>
                    <p>October 19, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Gen. U.S. Grant,</p>
                    <p>Commanding U.S. Armies:</p>
                    <p>General: In accordance with instructions from the Hon. Secretary of War of
                        the confederate States, I have the honor to call your attention to the
                        subject of two communications recently addressed by Major General B.F.
                        Butler, an officer under your command, to the Hon. Robert Ould, Commissioner
                        for the Exchange of Prisoners.</p>
                    <p>For the better understanding of the matter, I enclose copies of the
                        communications.</p>
                    <p>You will perceive by one of them that the writer has placed a number of
                        officers and men belonging to the Confederate service, prisoners of war
                        captured by the United States forces, at labor in the canal at Dutch Gap, in
                        retaliation, as is alleged, for a like number of Federal colored soldiers,
                        prisoners of war in our hands, who are said to have been put to work on our
                        fortifications.</p>
                    <p>The evidence of this fact is found in the affadavits [sic] of two deserters
                        from our service.</p>
                    <p>The other letter refers to a copy of a notice issued by a Confederate officer
                        commanding a camp near Richmond, calling upon the owner to come forward and
                        establish their claims to certain negroes in the custody of that officer.</p>
                    <p>The writer of the letter proceeds to state that some of the negroes mentioned
                        in the notice are believed to be soldiers of the United States army captured
                        in arms, and that, upon that belief, he has ordered to such manual labor as
                        he deems most fit[t]ing to meet the exigency an equivalent number of
                        prisoners of war held by the United States and announces that he will
                        continue to order to labor captives in war to a number equal to that of all
                        the United States soldiers who he has reason to beli[e]ve are held to
                        service or labor by the Confederate forces, until he shall be notified that
                        the alleged practice on the part of the Confederate authorities, until he
                        shall be notified that the alleged practice on the part of the Confederate
                        authorities has ceased.</p>
                    <p>Before stating the facts with references to the particular negroes alluded
                        to, I beg to explain the policy pursued by the Confederate Government
                        towards this class of persons, when captured by its forces.</p>
                    <p>All negroes in the military or naval service of the United States, taken by
                        us, who are not identified as the property of citizens or residents of any
                        of the Confederate States, are regarded as priso[n]ers of war, being held to
                        be proper subjects of exchange, as I recently had the honor to inform you.</p>
                    <p>No labor is exacted from such prisoners by the Confederate authorities.</p>
                    <p>Negroes who owe services or labor to citizens or residents of the Confederate
                        States, and who, through compulsion, persuasion, or of their own accord,
                        leave their owners, and are placed in the military or naval service of the
                        United States, occupy a different position.</p>
                    <p>The right to the service or labor of negro slaves, in the Confederate States,
                        is the same now as when those States were members of the Federal Union.</p>
                    <p>The right to the service or labor of negro slaves, in the Confederate States,
                        is the same now as when those States were members of the Federal Union.</p>
                    <p>The constitutional relations and obligations of the Confederate Government to
                        the owners of this species of property, are the same as those so frequently
                        and so long recognized as appertaining to the Government of the United
                        States, with reference to the same class of persons, by virtue of its
                        organic law.</p>
                    <p>From the earliest period of the independence of the American States, it has
                        been held that one of the duties incumbent upon the several common
                        governments under which they have, from time to time, been associated, was
                        the return to their lawful owners of slaves accoptured [sic] from the public
                        enemy. It has been uniformly held that the capture of abduction of a slave
                        does not impair the right of the owner to such slave, but that the right
                        attaches to him immediately upon recapture.</p>
                    <p>Such was the practice of the American States during their struggle for
                        independence. The Government under which they were then associated resumed
                        to the owners slaves abducted by the British forces and subsequently
                        recaptured by the American armies.</p>
                    <p>In the war of 1812 with Great Britain, the course pursued by the United
                        States Government was the same, and it recognized the right of the owner to
                        slaves recaptured fro the enemy. Both the Continental and United States
                        Governments, in fact, denied that the abduction of slaves was a belligerent
                        right, and the latter power insisted upon, and ultimately secured by treaty,
                        pecuniary indemnity from the British Government for slaves taken by its
                        forces during the war of 1812.</p>
                    <p>And it is supposed that a negro belonging to a citizens of a State in which
                        slavery is recognized and which is regarded as one of the United States,
                        were to escape into the Confederate States, or be captured or abducted by
                        their armies, the legal right of the owner to reclaim him would be as clear
                        now as in 1812, the Constitution of the United States being unchanged in
                        this particular, and that instrument having been interpreted in the judicial
                        decissions [sic], legislative and diplomatic acts and correspondence of the
                        United States as imposing upon that government the duty of protecting in all
                        cases coming within the scope of its authority, the owners of slaves as well
                        as of any other kind of property recognized as such by the several States.</p>
                    <p>The Confederate Government, bound by the same constitutional obligations,
                        considers, as that of the United States did, that the capture or abduction
                        of a negro slave does not preclude the lawful owner from reclaiming him when
                        captured, and I instructed to say that all such slaves, when properly
                        identified as belonging to citizens of any of the Confederate States, or to
                        persons enjoying the protection of their laws, will be restored, like other
                        recaptured private property, to those entitled to them.</p>
                    <p>Having endeavored to explain the general policy of the Confederate Government
                        with regard to the subject, I beg leave to state the facts concerning the
                        particular transactions referred to in the inclosed communications.</p>
                    <p>The negroes recently captured by our forces were sent to Richmond with other
                        Federal prisoners. After their arrival it was discovered that a number of
                        them were slaves belonging to citizens or residents of some of the
                        Confederate States, and of this class fifty-nine, as I learn, were sent,
                        with other negroes, to work on the fortifications around Richmond until
                        their owners should appear and claim them. As soon as I was informed of the
                        fact, less than two days afterwards, not wishing to employ them here, I
                        ordered them to be sent to the rear.</p>
                    <p>By a misapprehension of the engineer officer in charge, they were transferred
                        to our lines South of James river, but, when apprised of the error, I
                        repeated the order for their removal. If any negroes were included among
                        this number, who were not identified as the slaves of citizens or residents
                        of some of the Confederate States, they were so included without the
                        knowledge or authority of the War Department, as already explained, and the
                        mistake, when discovered, would have been corrected.</p>
                    <p>It only remains for me to say that negroes employed upon our fortifications
                        are not allowed to be placed where they will be exposed to fire, and there
                        is no foundation for any statement to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>The author of the communications referred to has considered himself justified
                        (by the report of two deserters, who do not allege that the negroes in
                        question were exposed to any danger,) in placing our prisoners at labor in
                        the canal at Dutch Gap, under the fire of our batteries.</p>
                    <p>In view of the explanations of the practice of the Confederate Government
                        above given and of the statement of facts I have made, I have now, in
                        accordance with my instructions, respectfully to inquire whether the course
                        pursued towards our prisoners, as set forth in the accompanying letters, has
                        your sanction and whether it will be maintained?</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your obedient servant</p>
                    <p>(Signed) R.E. Lee, Gen'l.</p>
                    <p>Hdq'rs Armies of the United States</p>
                    <p>October 20, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Gen. R.E. Lee, C.S.A., Commanding Army Northern Virginia:</p>
                    <p>General--Understanding, from your letter of the 19th that the colored
                        prisoners who were employed at work in the trenches near Fort Gilmer have
                        been withdrawn, I have directed the withdrawal of the Confederate prisoners
                        in the Dutch Gap canal. I shall always regret the necessity for retaliating
                        for wrongs done our soldiers; but regard it my duty to protect all persons
                        received into the army of the United States, regardless of color or
                        nationality. When acknowledged soldiers of the Government are captured, they
                        must be treated as prisoners of war, or such treatment as they receive will
                        [be] inflicted upon an equal number of prisoners held by us.</p>
                    <p>I have nothing to do with the discussion of the slavery question, therefore
                        decline answering the arguments addteed [sic] to show the right to return to
                        former owners such negroes as are captured from our army. In answer to the
                        question at the conclusion of your letter, I have to state, that all
                        prisoners of war falling into my hands shall receive the kindest possible
                        treatment, consistent with securing them, unless I have good authority for
                        believing any number of our men are being treated otherwise. Then, painful
                        as it may be to me, I shall inflict like treatment on an equal number of
                        Confederate prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Hoping that it may never become my duty to order retaliation upon any man
                        held as a prisoner of war.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your ob't servant,</p>
                    <p>U.S. Grant,</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant General.</p>

<b>The Poor Negro</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An excerpt from the Lynchburg Virginian criticizes the Yankees for
                    professing to confer citizenship on African Americans but not offering all of
                    the privileges available to other citizens. The example cited is a report from
                    Chicago where the African Americans of that city published a protest when their
                    children were excluded from public schools. The Lynchburg newspaper labels this
                    report "another evidence of the hollowness and insincerity of Yankee pretensions
                    respecting the negro."<br>

<b>Negroes to Fight for the South</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The New York News reports that the Confederacy is moving closer to using

                    <p>Negroes to Fight for the South.</p>
                    <p>The following is taken from the New York News, who
                        thus defines the at[t]itude of the negro for military service, when used in
                        the ranks of the Southern armies:</p>
                    <p>The slaves of the South can be made to supply an excellent material for
                        infantary [sic]. Docile and of great physical strength, they may be
                        converted into a soldiery in six or eight months. Under command of officers
                        to whom they have rendered a life long unquestioning obediance [sic], and to
                        whom they may be moulded into an invincible machine under the direction of a
                        man of military genius. Events are moving rapidly toward that conclusion.
                        Negroes of the South become attached to the Confederate armies in the
                        capacity, at first, of servants. The demand for men increasing, they were
                        next admitted by Congress to approach the status of a soldier by their
                        employment as attaches of the commissariat. Recruiting demands pressing
                        s[t]ill more closely on the whites of the South, the journals of Richmond,
                        falling in with a policy recommended twelve months ago by the legislature of
                        Alabama or Mississippi, insist now that negroes be sent into the field to
                        do, in battle, the duties of the soldier. This reserve policy of the
                        Confederates, if the necessity shall be held to demand such a step, to force

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday the 27th ult. General Grant made a very formidable attack upon
                        our lines both in front of Richmond and Petersburg. The attack was
                        simultaneous at both points, extending the whole length of our lines from
                        the Darbytown road on the North side to the Boydton Plank road below
                        Petersburg. As usual General Lee was fully apprised of the intentions of the
                        Yankee General, and was prepared to give him the dame kind of reception of
                        which he had been the recipient on many former occasions. The war worn
                        veterans of Gen. Lee met the attack with their accustomed valor, and showed
                        themselves worthy the confidence of their accomplished leader. The enemy
                        were repulsed with heavy loss at every point, leaving their dead and wounded
                        in our hands on the field. Their loss is variously estimated from five to
                        eight thousand in killed wounded and captured. Fifteen hundred prisoners
                        have already been received at the Libby in Richmond.</p>
                    <p>The Yankee General will publish this defeat as he has done others of a
                        similar character, as a reconnoisance [sic] in force, for the purpose of
                        "feeling" the enemy, and that the object was satisfactorily accomplished.
                        The deserted camp that they captured will be heralded as something great,
                        many valuable papers and documents will be said to be found therein, the few
                        prisoners taken will be magnified into many hundreds, and various other
                        bulletins of that sort will be published throughout Yankeedom to cover up
                        the failure of this last attempt at another "On to Richmond."</p>
                    <p>How this affair can be called (by any sane man) a reconoissance [sic], we are
                        certainly at a loss to know. It if was in truth entitled to be such--it was
                        certainly made on a grander scale than is usual in such cases. Gen. Grant
                        was commanding in person, his associates Meade, Warren and Hancock with
                        their respective corps' were in motion--the whole Yankee army, infantry,
                        artillery and cavalry, from one end of the line to the other, advanced in
                        order of battle precisely as if they intended to bring on a general
                        engagement. They did make the attack, and attempted several times to storm
                        our works, but were each time severely repulsed with immense slaughter. The
                        engagement was a general one, and although Gen. Grant and Mr. Secretary
                        Stanton may succeed in throwing dust in the eyes of their Yankee admirers we
                        are satisfied that our own people, will regard it as a general battle in
                        which we triumphantly repelled every assault made upon our lines, and at the
                        same time administered to the Yankee General a severe rebuke which will be
                        keenly remembered by him for some time to come.</p>
                    <p>The following despatch from Genl. Lee gives the additional news from the army
                        in front of Petersburg.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, Oct. 31, 1864.</p>
                    <p>
                        Hon. J.A. Seddon:
                    </p>
                    <p>General Malone penetrated the enemy's picket line last night, near
                        Petersburg, and swept it for half a mile, capturing 230 officers and men,
                        without the loss of a man.</p>
                    <p>Total number of prisoners captured on 27th, below Petersburg, according to
                        General Hill's report, was 700.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) R.E. Lee.</p>
                    <p>The latest accounts from the army of Tennessee say that Hood and Beauregard
                        effected a junction at Gadsen, and marched to the Tennessee River crossing
                        at Guntersville on the 23rd and 24th ult.</p>
                    <p>We have no news from Missouri, but that which we get through Yankee papers.
                        They represent Price badly whipped, yet their latest dispatch represent, him
                        still in Missouri, when their previous accounts have placed him some
                        distance beyond Fort Scott in Kansas, in full flight. The truth is that
                        Price has never been driven out of Missouri and that all these dispatches
                        are hatched up for the occasion, and sent abroad for effect on the pending
                        Presidential election in Yankeedom.</p>
                    <p>We learn Gen. Forrest has blockaded the Tennessee river. On the 29th ultimo
                        he captured a steamer and barge, and got off sixty wagon loads of shoes,
                        boots, blankets and hard bread. The vessels were destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Duffle captured by Col. Mosby a few days ago, has arrived in Richmond
                        and taken lodgings at the Libby.</p>
                    <p>No news, from the lower Valley. Our army still in camp at New Market.</p>

<b>Must Have a Success</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor comments that Pennsylvania will vote Democratic in next
                    Tuesday's Presidential election and that Maryland has failed to adopt an
                    abolition constitution, thereby dimming Lincoln's prospects for reelection.
                    Lincoln has employed a number of tactics to increase his support, but all have
                    failed. What he needs is a military victory, which explains Grant's attack on
                    Lee in Virginia. The editor warns that the days leading to the election could
                    hold more such attacks as the North seeks a military victory that will boost
                    Lincoln's chances.<br>

                        that State having gone democratic as far as heard from, and Maryland failing
                        to adopt the new abolition Constitution, by her home vote, has made the
                        present occupant of the White House, at Washington very uneasy. He dislikes
                        exceedingly to loose his lease of power and must attempt to retain it.
                        Something must be done and quickly to destroy the prospect of McClellan's
                        election or, in other words, to prevent the defeat of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

                        of the Bible have been tried without success. Other means such as tampering
                        with the rights of voters, &amp;c., have proven equally unsuccessful.
                        The only thing that can buoy the present administration in its, as they
                        fear, sinking condition, is a military success. To the achievement of which

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor reports that no one complained when General Lee revoked all
                    detail duty and called for all soldiers to report to their enrolling officer.
                    Lee learned that Grant was planning a major attack and thus recalled them back
                    into service. The editor criticizes whoever ordered that these men be marched
                    through their home counties and guarded as if they might not report for duty
                    willingly.<br>

                    <p>"Upon The Revocation . . ."</p>
                    <p>Upon the revocation of details many of our best men, the very bone and sinew
                        of our land, reported promptly to the Enrolling Officer and went soon
                        thereafter to Camp Lee, in time to make the allowed selection of commands.
                        However much the necessity which called them from their homes was to be
                        regretted, no one could complain, certainly they did not, but with exceeding
                        cheerfulness responded to the call of their country and went to share the
                        same toils, fatigues and dangers with the brave veterans of the war. We do
                        complain, however, of the after treatment received by these unmurmuring men.
                        These men were sent from Richmond to Gen. Early's army under guard, as if
                        they, who had reported promptly when called upon and after arriving at Camp
                        Lee, where they learned that Gen. Lee desired men at once, waved the
                        examination they were entitled to and with alacrity selected their
                        companies, were a set of skulking stragglers or deserters instead of being
                        the best and most reliable men in the country. If any had delayed to report
                        and consequently had to be brought to the Enrolling Office under guard,
                        having thus evinced by their conduct that they intended to evade the call,
                        then we would utter no complaint, no matter how heavily guarded they might
                        be, but the case however is entirely different.</p>
                    <p>We have no doubt it was humiliating to these men to be marched under strict
                        guard, through their county, town, and especially so when a short distance
                        from town they met a squad of 100 Yankee prisoners coming from the army, not
                        as strongly guided as they themselves were, but we hope this feeling may
                        have been but temporary for our people think not a whit less of them than
                        formerly. No disgrace attaches to them, for they have acted the part of men,
                        but the party by whose authority they were sent from Richmond under guard
                        should hang his head in everlasting shame for such treatment to such men,
                        who have shown themselves to be the unfaltering reliance of their country in
                        her time of need.</p>
