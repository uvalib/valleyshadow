                    <p>Arming Negroes.</p>
                    <p>From the Mobile Register.</p>
                    <p>A year ago we called attention in these columns to the reserve power of
                        resistance to our enemies residing in the slave population of the South. We
                        advocated then, as a last resort, and one to be used without hesitation, the
                        arming of the negroes whenever it became necessary to secure our
                        independence--The question is recently revived, and is attracting more than
                        usual attention. It is well that the public mind, as well as the policy of
                        the government, should be settled on the question, against the time when we
                        shall have to call on this means of defence. We do not think the time has
                        yet come. For this campaign it would be too late, even if it were needful,
                        and for the next--and who knows if we are to have another?--there is time to
                        act after the present campaign is finished.</p>

<b>The Battle of Bell Grove</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor offers a summary of the battle between General Early and General
                    Sheridan near Cedar Creek on Wednesday, October 19, 1864. In spite of
                    Confederate losses, the enemy cannot claim victory.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Battle of Bell Grove.</p>
                    <p>When we issued our paper last week a rumor was prevalent that Gen. Early had
                        whipped the enemy near Cedar Creek, which we stated merely as a rumor, no
                        definite information of the results of the fight having reached us.</p>
                    <p>The facts, as nearly as we are able to get them, gleaning from Yankee
                        statements as well as our own are as follows:</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday the 19th inst., Gen. Early attacked the forces of Sheridan at
                        Bell Grove on Cedar Creek, about [illegible] o'clock in the morning, having
                        consumed the greater portion of the previous night in getting his men into
                        proper position. So cautiously were the movements made that our forces
                        gained the rear of their left flank undiscovered and completely surprised
                        them. We had possession of their entrenchment and many of their guns were
                        captured and turned upon them before they were fairly apprised of the
                        situation. The Eighth corps was first attacked and, before [illegible] make
                        any resistance, was [illegible] headlong rout from its encampment. The
                        Nineteenth corps, likewise being completely flanked on the left, and
                        vigorously pressed in front, vainly essayed to extricate the Eig[h]th from
                        its perilous condition and stay the "rebel advance" which, says a Yankee
                        correspondent, "relentless as fate and cold as thought," "with wild yells
                        and withering volleys, both front and back, continued," and though the
                        [illegible] corps was ordered up to its [illegible] was driven back,
                        together with the Sixth and Eig[h]th corps, to some [illegible] ground where
                        they took a position, facing due East, from which they were again driven and
                        made the next stand on still higher ground some distance to the rear. Says
                        the same correspondent "the Rebels, however, seemed determined to push their
                        advantage to the utmost and again directed their efforts against our left
                        flank. This position was destined to be held but a short time," when they
                        were again compelled to retreat, our forces pressing them, to a position
                        beyond Middletown when Gen. Early halted his army to reform them, many
                        having straggled, allured by the rich booty of the enemy's vacated
                        encampments.</p>
                    <p>The plan of the battle was grand and its execution thus far brilliant. By ten
                        o'clock we had gained a glorious victory, having routed two corps and driven
                        back a third, capturing over 1500 prisoners, many wagons and ambulances, and
                        over twenty pieces of artillery. Says the same correspondent on this point.</p>
                    <p>"We had been surprised and driven out of a splendid position; had lost
                        multiplyingly in prisoners; and lost twenty-four pieces of artillery,
                        thirty-four ambulances, including all the medical wagons and medical
                        supplies of the Nineteenth corps, and several headquarter wagons. We had
                        yielded more than two miles of battlefield to the enemy; many of our finest
                        officers were killed and disabled, and the killed and wounded were thick
                        around."</p>
                    <p>At this time, Gen. Sheridan, having arrived on the ground in hurried haste
                        from Winchester, reformed as many of the straggling mass as possible, and
                        prepared to resist the further advance of Gen. Early. Until 3 o'clock P.M.
                        affairs remained quiet, when Sheridan advanced to attack. The first attempt
                        was made against our centre which was repulsed easily, when they threw their
                        forces on our left which gave way, brigade after brigade, before a very
                        feeble effort of the demoralized enemy and the order was given for our whole
                        line to fall back, which, with slight exceptions, was done in order,
                        [illegible] being pursued by the enemy's infantry, until Cedar Creek was
                        neared [illegible] naturally the flanks converged [illegible] centre, thus
                        massing our troops [illegible] compactly. While in this condition, many of
                        ours and the captured wagons, ambulances and artillery pie [illegible] owing
                        partly to bad management and partly to the breaking down of a bridge, were
                        blocked in the road, causing some confusion out of which grew an uncalled
                        for stampede, some assert by an attack on the artillery and wagons
                        &amp;c., by a small body of cavalry, while others say without a
                        [illegible] in which all the wagons, artillery &amp;c., &amp;c., in
                        the road were left unprotected and were recaptured without an effort at
                        defence on our part, and by a small squad of Yankee Cavalry.</p>
                    <p>The enemy can not boast of a victory, though we lost some 23 pieces of
                        artillery, over and above what we captured, for they did not capture
                        anything in the fighting but lost heavily [illegible] wounded and prisoners.
                        They [illegible] a loss of 5000 and Gen's Wright, [illegible]and Ricketts
                        wounded, and [illegible] killed.</p>
                    <p>Our loss will not exceed one thousand in all, including Gens. Ramseur
                        [illegible] Battle wounded. The former fell into the hands of the enemy and
                        by Sheridan's last dispatch is reported dead.</p>

                    <p>Gen'l Early's Address to His Army.</p>
                    <p>Head Quarters Valley District,</p>
                    <p>October 22d, 1864.</p>
                    <p>
                        Soldiers of the Army of the Valley:
                    </p>
                    <p>I had hoped to have congratulated you on the splendid victory won by you on
                        the morning of the 19th at Bell Grove on Cedar Creek, when you surprised and
                        routed two Corps of Sheridan's Army and drove back several miles the
                        remaining Corps, capturing 18 pieces of Artillery, 1500 prisoners, a number
                        of colours, a large quantity of small arms and many wagons and ambulances,
                        with the entire camps of the two routed Corps; but I have the mortification
                        of announcing to you that, by your subsequent misconduct, all the benefits
                        of that victory were lost and a serious disaster incurred. Had you remained
                        steadfast to your duty and your colours the victory would have been one of
                        the most brilliant and decisive of the war, you would have gloriously
                        retrieved the reverses at Winchester and Fisher's Hill and entitled
                        yourselves to the admiration and gratitude of your country. But many of you
                        including some commissioned officers yielded to a disgraceful propensity for
                        plunder, deserted your colours to appropriate to yourselves the abandoned
                        property of the enemy, and subsequently those who had previously remained at
                        their posts, seeing their ranks thinned by the absence of the plunderers,
                        when the enemy late in the afternoon, with his shattered columns made but a
                        feeble effort to retrieve the fortunes of the day, yielded to a needless
                        panic and fled the field in confusion, thereby converting a splendid victory
                        into a disaster. Had any respectable number of you listened to the appeals
                        made to you and made a stand even at the last moment, the disaster would
                        have been averted and the substantial fruits of victory secured--but under
                        the insane dread of being flanked and a panic stricken terror of the enemy's
                        cavalry, you would listen to no appeal, threat or order, and allowed a small
                        body of cavalry to penetrate to our train and carry off a number of pieces
                        of Artillery and wagons which your disorder left unprotected. You have thus
                        obscured that glorious fame won in conjunction with the gallant men of the
                        Army of Northern Virginia who still remain proudly defiant in the trenches
                        around Richmond and Petersburg. Before you can again claim these as comrades
                        you will have to erase from your escutcheons the blemishes which now obscure
                        them, and this you can do id you will but be true to your former reputation,
                        your country and your homes. You who have fought at Manassas, Richmond,
                        Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and from the
                        wilderness to the Banks of James River, and especially you who were with the
                        immortal Jackson in all his triumphs are capable of better things. Arouse
                        yourselves then to a sense of your manhood and an appreciation of the sacred
                        cause in which you are engaged. Yield to the mandates of discipline--resolve
                        to stand by your colours in future at all hazards and you can yet retrieve
                        your reputation and strike effective blows for your country and its cause.
                        Let every man spurn from him the vile plunder gathered on the field of the
                        19th, and let no man whatever his rank, whether combatant or non-combatant,
                        dare exhibit his spoils of that day. They will be the badges of his
                        dishonor, the insignia of his disgrace. The officer who pauses in the career
                        of victory to place a guard over a sutler's wagon for his private use is as
                        bad as the soldier who halts to secure for himself the abandoned clothing or
                        money of a flying foe, and they both sell the honour of the Army and the
                        blood of their country for a paltry price. He who follows his colours into
                        the ranks of the enemy in pursuit of victory, disdaining the miserable
                        passion for gathering booty, comes out of the battle with his honour
                        untarnished and, though barefooted and ragged, is far more to be envied than
                        he that is laden with rich spoils gathered in the trail of his victorious
                        comrades.</p>
                    <p>There were some exceptions to the general misconduct on the afternoon of the
                        19th, but it would be difficult to specify them all. Let those who did their
                        duty be satisfied with the consciousness of having done it, and mourn that
                        their efforts were paralyzed by the misbehaviour of others. Let them be
                        consoled to some extent by the reflection that the enemy has nothing to
                        boast of on his part. The Artillery and wagons taken were not won by his
                        valour. His camps were destroyed, his army terribly shattered and
                        demoralized, his losses far heavier than ours even in proportion to the
                        relative strength of the armies, his plans materially impeded and he was
                        unable to pursue by reason of his crippled condition. Soldiers of the Army
                        of the Valley! I do not speak to you in anger. I wish to speak in kindness
                        though in sorrow--my purpose is to show you the cause of our late misfortune
                        and point out the way to avoid similar ones in future and ensure success to
                        our arms. Success can only be secured by the enforcement and observance of
                        the most rigid discipline--officers, whatever their rank, must not only give
                        orders but set the example by obeying them and the men must follow that
                        example.</p>
                    <p>Fellow Soldiers: I am ready to lead you again in defence of our common cause
                        and I appeal to you be the remembrance of the glorious [illegible] in which
                        you have formerly participated, by the woes of your bleeding country, the
                        ruined homes and devastated fields you see around you, the cries of anguish
                        which come up from the widows and orphans of your dead comrades the horrors
                        which await you and all that is yours in the future if your country is
                        subjugated, and your hopes of freedom for yourselves and your posterity, to
                        render a cheerful and willing obedience to the rules of discipline, and to
                        shoulder your muskets again with the determination never more to turn your
                        backs on the foe, but to do battle like men and soldiers until the last
                        vestige of the footsteps of our barbarous and cruel enemies is erased from
                        the soil they desecrate and the independence of our country is firmly
                        established. If you will do this and rely upon the protecting care of a just
                        and merciful God all will be well. I will be proud to lead you once more to
                        battle.</p>
                    <p>J.A. Early, Lt. Gen'l.</p>
