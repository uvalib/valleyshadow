<b>Yankee Treatment of Negroes</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Louisiana Governor Moore recently claimed that more African Americans would
                    die because of war conditions than would white soldiers, Northern and Southern,
                    combined. He attributed this situation to the uncaring, unsympathetic, and
                    inhumane treatment African Americans received at the hand of Yankee soldiers.<br>

<b>Confederate Money</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor complains that prices have increased recently for no good
                    reason. Many sellers have claimed that the recently revalued Confederate
                    currency has forced them into adopting higher prices. However, the editor argues
                    that their logic is flawed.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Confederate Money.</p>
                    <p>Since the enactment the Currency and Tax bills, as was anticipated by many
                        would be the case till April 1st, prices have been attempted to be raised,
                        and from no cause, that we can see. An excuse is given, that sellers are
                        forced to do it from the fact that they are compelled to fund their money or
                        exchange for the new issue at 33 1-3 per cent discount, or in other words
                        three dollars for two. There is no reason for this increase in the prices of
                        articles held for sale. If the seller could save himself at the prices he
                        sold at before the passage of these acts he can not possibly lose by either
                        the funding or exchange of his old notes. Suppose that he funds what will
                        pay his taxes for the year 1864, which, all who have any large amounts to
                        pay will do, he certainly has not lost a cent by that operation, virtually
                        paying his taxes with the old issue. but suppose he is compelled by delay,
                        by possession of a larger amount than he desires to fund, or otherwise, to
                        exchange his old issue for the new at three dollars for two, he will not
                        have as many dollars in his pocket after the exchange, but he will be the
                        possessor of that which will certainly purchase as much as the old issue he
                        exchanged would have done before the passage of the Currency Bill. This is
                        perfectly plain, since there is of the old issue in circulation now
                        $750,000,000 and by means of the exchange of the old issues for the new
                        alone, that amount will be reduced to $500,000,000 (which amount can never
                        again be exceeded) and hence from this diminution in the amount of
                        circulation and consequent appreciation of the new issue, 66, 2-3 cents,
                        then will be worth $1,00 now. But when we take into consideration the
                        funding and other features of the bill, that amount will be reduced much
                        more. The least liberal calculation we have seen does not make the amount
                        likely to be in circulation after July 1st more than $300,000,000, just
                        $50,000,000 more than is thought by all to be necessary for the business
                        purposes of the country, which last amount will surely be absorbed by
                        taxation and the amount in circulation will then be at the acknowledged
                        healthy standard of $250,000,000 or just one third of the present
                        circulation. The exchange of three dollars of the old issue for two of the
                        new cannot be injurious, since only one third of the present amount will be
                        in circulation, but on the contrary after this exchange one dollar should be
                        worth three of the present issues and hence the increase in prices now is
                        altogether untenable under the excuses given. We say to our readers, use but
                        do not abuse the present issues of Confederate money, on account of the fear
                        of loss from an exchange for the new issue, for you can not be injured by
                        it. Buy only what you need and o not pay the increased per centage asked by
                        some dealers, but fund and exchange your money rather and you will be better
                        off in the long run.</p>

<b>Our Soldiers</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Some time ago the Vindicator called upon the women of Augusta to form
                    knitting and sewing societies to help furnish soldiers from the county and
                    soldiers from elsewhere who are cut off from their families with necessities.
                    The recent sleet and the letter of Brig. General James A. Walker, commander of
                    the Stonewall Brigade, renew the appeal. General Walker states that two hundred
                    men in his brigade lack shoes and socks. William B. Gallaher of Waynesboro
                    donated fifty pairs of shoes, and his mother, Mrs. H. L. Gallaher, donated fifty
                    pairs of socks. The editor hopes their example will inspire others to meet the
                    needs of men in the field.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. William B. Gallaher, Mrs. H. L. Gallaher)</blockquote>

<b>A Word to the Wise</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor at the Rockingham Register respects the agreement between
                    Mennonites and Tunkers and the Confederate government but hopes that no man
                    exempt from military service for reasons of conscience is shirking his duty to
                    grow as much as his farm can produce in order to pay taxes in kind and to

                    <p>To our German Friends.</p>
                    <p>We wish to say a word to our German friends, the Tunkers and the Mennonites,
                        on the subject of their duty to their Government and their country in this
                        crisis in our fortunes. They are exempt from all military duty by the simple
                        payment of a few hundred dollars. The Confederate States Congress has shown
                        its respect for their rights of conscience, and has ratified the obligation
                        into which the Government had heretofore entered. It is expected of them all
                        that they will do their duty fully "in the field" of agriculture and of
                        peace at home. They must all go to work now and raise all the provisions
                        which their farms can possibly produce. The Governme[n]t expects it of them,
                        and they ought to do it. It will be seen and known who of them now fails to
                        do his duty. We have heard it stated that some of them did not intend to
                        raise more upon their farms than will be necessary to pay their taxes. We do
                        not believe this; but if it should turn out to be true, we pledge ourselves
                        to report to the world and to the Government the names of all such enemies
                        their country, for enemies of their country they certainly are.</p>
                    <p>The Confederate Congress meets again in May, and if it shall then be found
                        that any man who has been allowed to remain at home has not done his duty as
                        a farmer, we hope the law may be so changed as to
                        put him into the ranks of the army. No man ought now to be allowed to remain
                        in the Confederacy who will not do his whole duty to his country. Virginia
                        expects and has a right to expect that every man will do his duty.</p>
