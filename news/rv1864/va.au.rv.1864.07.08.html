                    <p>The Fort Pillow Affair--Reputation of Federal Slanders.</p>
                    <p>(From the Atlanta Confederacy.)</p>
                    <p>From Governor Isham G. Harris, of Tennessee, who accompanied, and has just
                        reached this city, in return from the expedition of Forrest into West
                        Tennessee, we get the following true version of the late attack upon Fort
                        Pillow. In view of the perverted accounts of the Yankee papers, this
                        official narrative of the whole proceeding will be found as interesting as
                        it is necessary to vindicate the truth of history.</p>
                    <p>Arriving in the vicinity of Fort Pillow, Gen. Forrest, having previously
                        arranged his plans and issued his instructions for the attack, rapidly
                        advanced his lines, and gained, after a brief, sharp contest, the
                        outer-works of the enemy. Having possessed himself of this position, he
                        threw forward a line of skirmishers in a sort of ravine between the
                        outer-works and the fort, which line was protected from the Federal
                        sharpshooters by his reserve line in the outer defences.</p>
                    <p>He then sent in a flag of truce to the commander of the garrison, demanding
                        the unconditional surrender of the fort and garrison, with all the stores
                        and munitions, stating the advantage of his position, his determination to
                        carry the fort, and announcing that if his demand was not complied with he
                        did not feel certain that he, himself, would be able to control his men when
                        they entered the fort, after having been forced to take the risks of
                        assault.</p>
                    <p>Hearing, after the note was dispatched and before an answer to it was
                        received, that the Federals believed the demand for surrender a ruse de guerre, and that Forrest, in person, was
                        not in command of the assailants--Gen. Forrest himself rode up within
                        hailing distance, announced to the enemy in person that he was General
                        Forrest, and verbally demanded the surrender.</p>
                    <p>A reply was sent back, couched in defiant language, declining to accede to
                        the demand.</p>
                    <p>The assault was commenced, and in five minutes after the bugle sounded the
                        charge the fort was in possession of our men. Our advanced skirmishers went
                        over the works pell-mell, all around them, each man lifting his fellow by
                        the leg, and mounting on the shoulders of their comrades until the fort was
                        filled with Confederates.</p>
                    <p>Col. Booth, commanding the garrison, was the first man killed, and not an
                        officer of the negro regiments was left alive.</p>
                    <p>It is true that a few, black and white, throw down their arms and made signs
                        of of [sic] surrender--but at the same time the men on each side of them
                        still retained their arms and kept up a constant fire and show of
                        resistance. In the heat, din and confusion of a fire at such close quarters
                        there was no chance for discrimination. In less than five minutes after our
                        men cleared the esplanade, the fort was cleared of the enemy, the main body
                        of whom fled to the edge of the river leaving the fort colors still flying.
                        At the river they still kept up the firing until the number was fearfully
                        reduced, and until, as General Forrest states himself, he absolutely
                        sickened to witness the slaughter. He ordered the firing to cease, and
                        dispersed his staff along the lines with orders to that effect. It was next
                        to impossible to effect an immediate cessation of the firing, the enemy,
                        themselves still fighting. General Forrest rode up and down the lines
                        ordering the men to cease firing, and finally stopped the carnage. The
                        survivors of the garrison were all taken prisoners.</p>
                    <p>The maximum aggregate force of the Federal garrisons was 800. About 500 were
                        buried by Gen. Forrest's man. About fifty of their wounded were paroled and
                        sent upon a gunboat to Memphis. Two hundred prisoners were brought away, and
                        among the number about thirty negroes.</p>
                    <p>There is not the semblance of a shadow of truth in the Federal exaggerations
                        of wholesale slaughter. The above are substantially the facts of the
                        capture, coming directly and officially from the prominent actors in the
                        bloody drama.</p>

                    <p>Apologetic.</p>
                    <p>Our last paper made its appearance on May 27th, 1864, and we were preparing
                        as usual to issue on the next week and were nearly ready when the advance of
                        Gen. Hunter to Harrisonburg rendered it necessary that all who could be
                        serviceable in repelling the invaders should go forth to meet them. Together
                        with the citizens of town and county my printers were called to arms and
                        consequently the publication of the paper on June 3rd was impossible. Owing
                        to the misfortune of June 5th at Piedmont, Augusta, the enemy in force
                        occupied Staunton on the next day, Monday June 6th. They proceeded to my
                        office to destroy it, when to their amazement they found the sole tenement
                        in Washington Press, (the type having been removed to a place of security on
                        Saturday previous to the battle of Piedmont,) which they damaged, as they
                        thought, beyond repair. The repairing of the press occupied but a short
                        time, but the movement of the reserves with the forces of Gen. Breckinridge,
                        and their participation in the rapid and fatiguing pursuit of the robber
                        Hunter and his plundering incendiaries, prevented the return of my hands
                        until the latter part of last week, thereby rendering the publication of my
                        paper at an earlier date impossible. We have not, as far as the office is
                        concerned, suffered a very material loss, a few hundred dollars covering the
                        amount. However, we regret exceedingly the annoyance the delay has
                        occasioned our readers and hope to be able to make ample amends by a regular
                        issue hereafter.</p>
                    <p>To the people of the county and valley we tender our earnest, fellow-feeling
                        sympathy, (our house like theirs being plundered by the vandals,) for the
                        losses they have sustained.</p>
                    <p>To our readers we have only to say that we hope they will appreciate the
                        difficulties under which we labored and promise should the vandals ever come
                        this way again, that, with a few hours notice, we will place our office
                        beyond the power of their fiendish malice to destroy and thus preserve it
                        for the convenience of our people, no matter what may be the desire of the
                        enemy to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>To many of our people, who have heretofore not been connected with us as
                        subscribers or readers, but who have congratulated us upon rescuing our
                        office from destruction, and expressed their gratification on account of its
                        being preserved, we return our most heartfelt thanks and hope by a steady
                        adherence to the course marked out at the commencement of our editorial
                        career, to retain their kind wishes, at least, so long as we are connected
                        with the editorial fraternity.</p>
                    <p>To the enemies of our country, the vile Yankees, we desire, in closing to say
                        that what they have done to us, in common with our neighbors, has not varied
                        the tone of our feeling towards them one iota. We have always hated them and
                        what we have seen (or felt), of them in their late raid through our valley
                        could not possibly have lowered them in our estimation, but has served
                        simply to prove conclusively to us that we were not wrong in the estimate we
                        placed upon them many years ago. They have injured us permanently to some
                        extent, but they have not accomplished their purpose. The Vindicator will
                        make its regular appearance in spite of their attempts to annihilate it and
                        will continue to speak its true sentiments of the Yankee fiends who rule the
                        hour at Washington and their worthy emissaries, who, faithful to their
                        masters, shun the glare of Southern muskets, but vauntingly advance upon and
                        plunder the widowed hearth and fatherless home.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Justice.</p>
                    <p>Our neighbors of the "Chronicle" and "Register" have been informed and
                        asserted, that during the stay of the Yankees in our midst, some one or two
                        of our citizens took the oath of allegiance to the United States. We have
                        made frequent inquiries from persons likely to know and can not hear of a
                        single instance. On the contrary we hear of two instances of downright
                        refusal to accept paroles not in the usual form, (the only approach to an
                        oath of allegiance offered,) and the offices indi[c]ting were forced to
                        change the form and make the parties subject to exchange. A few of our
                        citizens, participants in the battle of Piedmont, were captured and paroled
                        in the regular way, but no oaths of allegiance taken. Supposing that one or
                        two only as reported had taken the oath, it would be a conclusive proof that
                        our people are loyal, but when not one took the oath and those who were at
                        all approached in that way by the offer of permanent paroles, indignantly
                        refused them, we think the loyalty of our people an incontestable fact.
                        Information, and no doubt a great deal, was obtained here, in reference to
                        citizens of this town and county, but from whom did they get it? We have
                        heard it currently reported that the names of some five who had given
                        information and expressed union sentiments had been shown to a gentleman
                        captured and paroled by the enemy, but upon inquiry we learn that there is
                        nothing further to substantiate this report than the word of the Yankee who
                        gave the names of the parties to the gentleman spoken of above. Knowing the
                        Yankee character as well as we do we cannot conceive it a super human task
                        for the officer, in order to make Unionism exist here, to lie about it and
                        even give the names of parties, whose names he might have happened to have
                        heard whilst here.</p>
                    <p>Their information we think, on account of the character and incorrectness of
                        a great deal of it, was obtained from negroes, though there were some few
                        whites who left with them, who might have reported many things to them. In
                        every case, those who left were not natives, but residents since the war
                        only and brought here by circumstances occasioned by the war, which adds
                        another proof of the great dislike of our people for the Yankees.</p>
                    <p>No people under the sun are more loyal to their country and government than
                        the people of Augusta. They have suffered much, but preserve the same
                        heartfelt desire for the success of the Confederate Cause and intense hatred
                        to the Yankee Nation and people they have ever felt. Then as a matter of
                        justice simply we request our co[n]temporaries of the "Chronicle" and
                        "Register" to state what we now know to be the fact and thus do away, as far
                        as possible, with the injurious effect of their, as we consider, too hasty
                        assertion of the disloyalty of some of our citizens. We are satisfied that
                        the wrong done was purely unintentional, but the statement having been made
                        requires denial through the same channel and we know that it will afford our
                        brother Editors pleasure to contradict a rumor so false and damaging to a
                        neighboring people.</p>
                    <p>As an illustration of the facility with which false statements obtain
                        currency and are circulated as facts, we will state an instance: One of our
                        farmers, residing about six miles from Staunton, on the Monday following the
                        departure of Hunter and his vandal horde, brought several barrels of flour
                        to town to relieve the suffering occasioned by the robbery of private
                        citizens. The empty barrels were returned which he carried home with him.
                        Forthwith the rumor was started that the farmer, thus manifesting a desire
                        to alleviate those who were in need, had taken three barrels of flour home.
                        Thus was an act designed as a kindness, and as such received, converted into
                        a mercenary speculation when there was not even the shade of a suspicion to
                        justify it. Doubtless, similar misapprehensions have been received as to the
                        action of others, and is evidence sufficient to guard every right thinking
                        and justice loving man against receiving any statement as veritable, which
                        may have a tendency to bring into question the loyalty and fidelity of a
                        people, who have attested their patriotism on every field of contest, as
                        well as by the liberality of their disinterested service to accommodate
                        those who have been so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of the Yankee
                        plunderers.</p>

                    <p>The Enemy in the Valley.</p>
                    <p>The occupation of the Valley of Virginia has long been a much desired object
                        with the Yankee Nation. Many have been their attempts to obtain full
                        possession of it and as often have they been sent back howling to the banks
                        of the Potomac. But a few weeks since they essayed it again and met an
                        invincible host of heroes under Breckinridge, at New Market, whence they
                        fled, whipped and demoralized, to their old retreat.</p>
                    <p>From some, to us, incomprehensible cause, soon thereafter, nearly all the
                        forces who had gained this glorious victory over the army of Siegel, were
                        withdrawn from our midst and as soon began the reorganization of Siegel's
                        routed troops under the renegade Hunter. They advanced, and the handful of
                        men under Imboden, left here to protect one of the richest and most
                        important portions of the State, were compelled to fall back to a point in
                        the rear, selected and fortified for the purpose of giving the invaders
                        battle. The enemy attempted and nearly succeeded in flanking this position
                        when the movement was discovered. Our small forces, then reinforced by Gen.
                        Wm. E. Jones' command and the Reserves of this and adjoining counties, moved
                        to meet them, and an engagement took place near Piedmont, about eleven miles
                        distant from Staunton. The enemy's different charges had been repulsed and
                        in a short time the victory would have been ours, (the enemy having
                        commenced making preparations to retreat,) when, from some unaccountable
                        cause, some of our forces gave way and lost both the day and the temporary
                        possession of the Valley. Staunton was occupied by them the next day, our
                        forces having fallen back towards Fishersville, when they commenced that
                        incendiarism and thieving which has characterized this raid of Hen-roost
                        Hunter and makes him as deservedly odious as Beast Butler. By Hunter's order
                        the fine mill of J &amp; B F. Walker, near Mt Meridian, was burned,
                        also, the Woolen Factory of Crawford and Young, the Steam Mill, Steam
                        Distillery Government Workshops, Stables and Forage-houses, the Stage
                        Stables of J.I.A. Trotter together with twenty-six coaches, and the Railroad
                        Depots, (all in Staunton,) and the large mill of W.F. Smith, in the town of
                        Greenville.</p>
                    <p>They destroyed the track of Railroad west of this place, at intervals, to
                        Goshen, burning the bridges at Swoope's, Craigsville and Goshen, and
                        destroyed a number of culverts and small bridges at different points on the
                        road. East of Staunton, they tore up the track, bending the rails, to
                        Christie's Creek, burning the bridge over the same and the Depot at
                        Fishersville.</p>
                    <p>They broke open the stores here, taking whatever they wanted and leaving the
                        rest a prey to an accompanying rabble, cut to pieces and destroyed the
                        machinery of the Shoe Factory, and broke the presses of the Spectator and
                        Vindicator, throwing the type of the former into the street.</p>
                    <p>By an order from Gen. Hunter to take all the provisions from each family,
                        leaving only three days rations, they robbed the man of means and widow with
                        her mite of whatever their larder contained, leaving but a scanty supply,
                        save where the humanity of some officer, to whom the execution of the order
                        had been entrusted, prevented him from faithfully complying with it, in
                        which few, exceptional cases something more was left. To particularize these
                        robberies would more than fill our columns, hence we deem it sufficient to
                        say that nearly every body in that part of the county occupied by the enemy,
                        as well as the town, suffered in the same way. Some two or three who had
                        been suspected of sympathizing with the enemy and who, report says, claimed
                        protection on this account, suffered as did others, their unionism not being
                        able "to save their bacon." In many instances, after the execution of
                        Hunter's order, the plunderers returned at night and stole the remainder.</p>
                    <p>On their march beyond this county, they acted in the same fiendish way. At
                        Lexington they burned the V.M. Institute and Professors' houses, save that
                        of Gen. Smith, all the mills and manufacturing establishments on the point,
                        near the bridge, the private residence of Ex. Gov. Letcher, and destroyed
                        the office of the Lexington Gazette. They also burned the private residence
                        and iron manufactory of John T. Anderson, Esq., in Botetourt, and as they
                        proceeded towards Lynchburg left a track of desolation in their rear. We
                        rejoice that by the timely arrival of troops in Lynchburg that city was
                        saved the terrible ordeal of Yankee occupation. The enemy learning of the
                        arrival of Earley, left that vicinity in hurried haste, and although our
                        troops were anxious to overtake the invaders and moved with a vim, yet only
                        occasionally could they get a meagre chance at the scared Yanks, many of
                        whom were mounted on fresh horses stolen on their route, who rode and walked
                        in turn with those on foot, and thus made it impossible to overtake them.
                        Hunter is reported in Wheeling and has expressed his satisfaction at what he
                        has accomplished. Nothing else could be expected from him. He has
                        accomplished nothing as regards the overthrow of the Confederacy, having run
                        away from the only point he could have materially damaged it, the immediate
                        front of Earley, and is satisfied since he has robbed the people and burned
                        their mills to starve them out. We consider him as mean, if it were
                        possible, meaner than Beast Butler, having shown a disposition to surpass
                        the latter's infamous course, but was forced to stop ere he had completed
                        half the foul intent of his base and brutal mind.</p>

                    <p>About the 27th of August 1862 he enlisted as a soldier in Co. H, 62nd, Regt.
                        Va. Vols. He was a brave and patriotic young man, and nobly did he fight in
                        defense of his country, until the bloody battle of New Market where he was
                        struck by a shell from one of the enemies guns and died in a very short
                        time. Thus died a man in the vigor of his strength, but he died not as many
                        do without the hope of future felicity. In February last he became much
                        concerned about the salvasion [sic] of his soul and sought an interest in
                        the blood of Christ, and he was enable to rejoice from a sense of his
                        acceptance with God and of sins forgiven. He united himself with the M.E.
                        Church of which he lived a consistent member to the time of his death. Thus
                        he lived and died, not only a soldier in defense of his country, but also a
                        soldier of the cross of Christ, and is now reaping the rewards of the
                        faithful in the kingdom of heaven, where wars and rumors of war are heard of

                        ever and ever. To the bereaved friends we would say, "hard as the trial and
                        sorrows may be" trust in that being who holds in his own hands the destinies
