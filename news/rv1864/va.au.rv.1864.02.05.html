<b>A Step in the Right Direction</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses a new bill that changes the policies for use of substitutes in
                    the military service and suggests some changes to improve the bill.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Army Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor describes a bill passed by the Confederate Senate as a
                    "monstrosity" and calls upon the House to alter the bill before passing it. The
                    bill calls for widespread conscription and reflects, in the editor's opinion,
                    the Senate's fear that the war will soon be lost. The repercussions of such a
                    wide conscription, however, will be far more damaging, as there will be no
                    farmers, millers, and other necessary workers left at home.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The True Spirit</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When Northern troops were at Rogersville, Tennessee, they arrested a
                    shoemaker, DeWit C. Harry, known as Clint, formerly of Augusta County. When his
                    wife visited him at the guard house, she told him she would rather raise their
                    ten sons alone than have him take an oath of loyalty to the Union. When an
                    officer there rebuked her, she recoiled and told him she was raising ten boys to
                    hate and fight the likes of him. The editor uses this anecdote to demonstrate
                    that the daughters and sons of Augusta County carry the "true spirit" of the
                    cause with them wherever they go.<br>(Names in announcement:  DeWit C. Harry)</blockquote>
<b>To the Voters of Augusta County</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Citizens and Soldiers write the voters of Augusta County to endorse the
                    candidacy of William H. Burnett for Clerk of the County Court since General
                    Imboden has decided not to run for reelection. Burnett has been deputy clerk and
                    has done nearly all the work of the office for ten years. The writers offer a
                    glowing summary of Burnett's qualifications.<br>(Names in announcement: General  Imboden, Mr. William H. Burnett, Mr.  Kenney)</blockquote>
