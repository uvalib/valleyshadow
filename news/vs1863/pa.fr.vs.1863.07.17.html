<b>Unquestioning Support</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer challenges the Republican argument that attacks on the
                    administration are tantamount to attacks on the government. If the Democrats had
                    applied the same standard when they were in power, particularly under Buchanan's
                    administration, Republicans would have been as freely arrested as Democrats are
                    now.<br>

<b>Proceedings of the Democratic State Convention</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A summary of the activities of the Democratic State Convention held in
                    Harrisburg on June 17. George W. Woodward was nominated for Governor on the
                    ninth ballot, while Walter H. Lowrie was nominated for Chief Judge by
                    acclimation. A number of resolutions were also passed, pledging the Democrats of
                    Pennsylvania to a war policy of "The Constitution as it is, and the Union as it
                    was" and condemning, among other things, the deportation of Vallandigham from
                    Ohio.<br>

<b>What is Franklin County Doing?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors call for a reorganization of the 126th Regiment to defend the
                    town from future attacks.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors urge that a permanent militia be organized in each state. If
                    there had been such a body to throw against Lee, they claim, he could have been
                    easily defeated. The present system of raising troops is inadequate, and
                    something new must be done to prevent further invasions.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Democratic Nominees</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors discuss the two candidates nominated by the State Democratic
                    Convention. Hon. George W. Woodward was not originally a nominee for the
                    position, but his name was put in as the "unusual interest and anxiety" over the
                    nomination produced a series of deadlocked ballots. Woodward was a framer of the
                    current State Constitution, and was the first Democratic nominee for Supreme
                    Court when the office was made elective. His decisions, along with Chief Justice
                    Lowrie, who was renominated for election, are among the most cited from the
                    bench. It is fitting, say the editors, that he be nominated as a man of law to
                    help safeguard civil liberties before they are "irrevocably swept away."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer argues that attempting to defeat the Confederates who are
                    fighting to save slavery by abolishing slavery makes no sense.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Louisville Democrat</blockquote>
<b>A Card</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>District Attorney W. S. Stenger writes to deny reports in the Lancaster
                    Express that he had tried to shake hands with the Confederate commander Jenkins
                    during the raid, only to be rebuffed by Jenkins. He also goes on to defend
                    Franklin County Democrats of charges of welcoming the Confederates.<br>(Names in announcement:  W. S. Stenger)</blockquote>

<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report on the movement of troops, both Confederate and Union,
                    through Franklin County in the aftermath of Gettysburg. Several cavalry
                    engagements took place in the vicinity of Funkstown and Boonsboro. Union
                    commanders are now stationed in Chambersburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Riot</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that some of the militia from New York who came to defend
                    Franklin County have been behaving badly. Their actions included an assault on
                    Captain Doebler on the grounds that he was a coward, which extended into a
                    general melee.<br>(Names in announcement: Captain  Doebler)</blockquote>
<b>Serenade to General Couch</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>General Couch, headquartered in the Franklin Hotel, was serenaded in his
                    quarters on Friday by the Chambersburg Brass Band. The General responded with a
                    short speech promising to drive the enemy from the border. He was followed by
                    Col. McReynolds of New York and Major McVey, of Chester County, Pennsylvania.
                    The editors criticize McVey's speech as partisan, and he apparently imputed the
                    bravery of the community.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Captured</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A number of citizens left Chambersburg last week for Hagerstown, thinking
                    that there would be a battle here. The Confederates captured a number of them
                    and sent them to Richmond on the grounds that they were spies. Among the
                    captured were Dr. James Hamilton, L. W. Tritle and George Kauffman (several
                    other names are listed but are obscured by a tear in the paper).<br>(Names in announcement:  L. W. Tritle, Dr. James Hamilton,  George Kauffman)</blockquote>
<b>Appointment</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A doctor in Chambersburg (whose name is obscured by a rip in the paper) has
                    been appointed Assistant Surgeon and assigned to the 20th Regiment State
                    Militia.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Brave Cavalry Dash</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors relate the capture of a party of Confederate cavalry in
                    Greencastle by a squad of Federal cavalry.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>"The Franklin Repository"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note the publication of the Franklin Repository, the product of
                    the purchase by Col. A. K. McClure and Henry S. Stoner of the Repository and
                    Transcript, and the Dispatch.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. A. K. McClure,  Henry S. Stoner)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report that the streets of the town need a good cleaning after
                    their occupation by the Confederates.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Copperhead Heroism</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report an anecdote that when a Confederate requested of a
                    female resident an axe with which to cut down the liberty pole in the Diamond,
                    she refused, even when the soldier threatened her with his pistol. That woman,
                    note the editors, "is one of the most 'malignant copperheads' in town."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>An Act of Vandalism</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>During the Confederate occupation, several Confederate soldiers broke into
                    the Columbus Lodge of Odd Fellows, cut to pieces the regalia, and "mutilated
                    everything they could lay their hands upon."<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The members of Company C of the "First Coal" or 4th Regiment Pennsylvania
