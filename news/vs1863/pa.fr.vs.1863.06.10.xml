                <excerpt>"The Democratic meeting on Saturday night, a week ago, seems to have
                    wonderfully disturbed our neighbor of the Transcript. He raves and foams like a
                    madman, beating the air and talking incoherent nonsense to such an extent as to
                    seriously alarm his friends for his safety. . . . Our neighbor should not have
                    gone off in this way, in a peaceable community, for no other reason than a large
                    number of his fellow-citizens chose to assemble together to listen to the
                    address of a speaker, whose every utterance strictly accorded with their own
                    sentiments."</excerpt>

                <summary>The editors quote passages from editorials in the Transcript that attack
                    the Democratic club meeting at Franklin Hall the previous week. The Transcript
                    accuses the Democrats of being "false to the country" and of attempting to
                    "stifle the administration in Washington." It concludes by saying "down with the
                    villain who thus boldly bears his traitor heart and is hypocritical enough to
                    mingle with his treasonable speech pitiful whinings for the Union." The editors
                    of the Spirit and Times insinuate that the editor of the Transcript is insane
                    and proclaim the right of Democrats to assemble at any time. The Spirit defies
                    the editor of the Transcript to prove that any element of the speeches justified
                    the language he used to attack them.</summary>

                <summary>The editors say that while they had ceased mentioning anything to do with
                    the "slander and scurrility usually found in the Dispatch," they had to defend
                    Hon. Wm. H. Miller, a speaker at the recent Democratic club meeting, from the
                    slander heaped on him by the Dispatch's article, "A Feast of Treason." The
                    article could only have been meant to start a riot at the meeting, which the
                    editor of the Dispatch tried to do himself at the meeting. The individual who
                    gave the Dispatch his evidence had heard it on a trip to Harrisburg as part of
                    the official delegation to welcome back the 126th Regiment. While talking to
                    some Democrats, this unnamed individual misinterpreted some of their statements
                    while he was "under the influence of his intense patriotism or something else."</summary>

                    T. McIlhenny, Esq., which stated that the "Copperhead" meeting in Chambersburg
                    was disrupted by "nine-month men" cheering for Hooker. Rather, say the editors,
                    most of the veterans there were Democrats and they helped clear the hall of the
                    "cowardly crew who came there for the purpose of disturbing the meeting."</summary>

                <summary>The editors ask those who "rail at slavery" to show what can be done for
                    blacks that is better. They claim not to want to defend slavery, but state that
                    it has evolved out of the "necessities of the two races in contact." They argue
                    that any changes to the institution would take ages. If blacks would be better
                    off without slavery, then they should be released if such an action would bring
                    no harm to whites. However, the editors doubt that the lot of blacks would be
                    improved by emancipation.</summary>

                        an honorable, high-minded gentleman.</p>

                    by the saving fund, while Lieut. Ashmead has taken over Shryock's old quarters;
