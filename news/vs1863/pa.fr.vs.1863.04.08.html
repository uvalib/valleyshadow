<b>The Government and the Administration</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The most dangerous assumption of the party in power, say the editors, is
                    that there is no difference between the government and the administration. Thus,
                    criticism of the administration is interpreted as criticism of the government,
                    and thus seen as disloyal and subject to restraint when habeas corpus is
                    suspended. The editors then go into the differences between a government and an
                    administration, and argue that their criticism of the administration actually
                    strengthens, not weakens, the country, for it helps keep the administration's
                    power bounded by the Constitution.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors attack an editorial in the Repository and Transcript which
                    accused the Democrats, when in power, of plunder and robbery. The Spirit and
                    Times argues that the Repository's editor must have been asleep for the past two
                    years, and missed the cases of George D. Morgan, Senators Chandler and Cummings,
                    Assistant Secretary of War Tucker, Governor Curtain's shoddy, and the
                    Pennsylvania horse contracts, all Republicans accused of swindling or nepotism.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since the Emancipation Proclamation has failed to free the slaves of the
                    South, says the writer sarcastically, a new tactic should be tried--pass a
                    proclamation divorcing all the women of the South from their husbands. They give
                    more aid and comfort to the rebels than the slaves, after all.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Herald</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors publish a claim by the Repository and Transcript that General
                    McClellan is a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret Democratic
                    military society. Either provide proof of the claim, they demand, or retract the
                    slander against McClellan.<br>

<b>Railroad Accident</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John H. Laker of Quincy Township, while driving his wagon over the
                    "Waynesboro Cut" across the railroad tracks, was hit by the afternoon train from
                    Hagerstown last Saturday. He and his horse escaped without harm, but his wagon
                    was destroyed. A public meeting held shortly thereafter in Quincy resolved to
                    petition the legislature to pass a law forcing the railroad company to bridge
                    the cut.<br>(Names in announcement:  John H. Laker)</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is with great gratification we refer to the high degree of prosperity of
                        the educational institutions of Chambersburg. They seem to be meeting with
                        almost as large a share of public favor as they did before the commencement
                        of the war; and this is something that perhaps can be said of very few
                        schools, colleges and seminaries in the country. The young ladies seminary,
                        under charge of the Rev. Henry Reeves, will commence a new half session on
                        the 20th of April. The character of this institution is already so well
                        established, and it has received such extensive patronage and given such
                        general satisfaction, that we need only refer to the large and unexceptional
                        corps of teachers--now more complete than ever before--whose names appear in
                        another colmumn [sic]--to give a full endorsement to the declaration that
                        this institution stands among the first--if not pre-eminently the very
                        first--of the female seminaries in Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. K. Shryock has retired from the control of the Chambersburg Academy,
                        and Mr. J.R. Kinney, Mr. Shryock's former assistant, has taken charge of it.
                        The new principal is a graduate of Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. and came
                        into our midst, last year, with the most flattering recommendations, all of
                        which, we can say in candor, he has fulfilled to the utmost letter. On the
                        withdrawal of the former principal, the Trustees unanimously elected Mr.
                        Kinney as his suscessor [sic]. The character of the gentlemen composing the
                        Board of Trustees, should make this a sufficient recommendation to parents
                        wishing to send their sons to a good scientific and classical school. Mr.
                        Kinney announces as his assistants--Rev. James F. Kennedy, teacher of the
                        ancient and English classics; Miss Flory, teacher of primary department;
                        Miss Schively, teacher of French and Drawing; and Miss Virginia Reilly,
                        teacher of Music. Good and cheap boarding can be procured in town; and we
                        learn the trustees have under consideration the erection of a boarding house
                        in connection with the Academy. We hope this will be done soon, as it will
                        grea[t]ly promote the success of the school.</p>

<b>An Improvement Demanded</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors describe the scene on the road to the Cemetery during a recent
                    funeral. The road has deteriorated so badly that the cart carrying the coffin
                    was upset and the coffin was tossed to the ground. The editors declare this a
                    disgrace to the community and demand that the City Council improve the street
                    quickly.<br>
