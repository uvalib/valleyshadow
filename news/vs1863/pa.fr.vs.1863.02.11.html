<b>The Recall of General McClellan</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter, copied from the Baltimore American, professes to be written by
                    "a humble mechanic" who protests the removal of General McClellan as well as the
                    issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. All of the charges leveled against
                    McClellan were groundless, he claims. In particular, the charge of moving too
                    slowly has no merit, when compared to the progress of the army since he was
                    removed--"stuck fast in the mud." The writer urges Lincoln to rid himself of his
                    advisors save Seward, and look toward people like John Crittenden, Millard
                    Fillmore, Edward Everett, General Butler and General Banks.<br>

<b>Whither Are We Drifting?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors point to three pieces of national legislation--Senator Wilson's
                    bill giving the President absolute power over the state militias, a bill giving
                    the power to the President to suspend habeas corpus at his discretion, and
                    Thaddeus Steven's bill to allow the enlistment of black soldiers--as evidence of
                    a move toward despotism by radical leaders. There is some hope, the editors say,
                    of reversing this course if Lincoln were to reject the "destructive and
                    revolutionary doctrines of abolitionism" and recall General McClellan to the
                    head of the army, but they conclude there is little chance of that. Instead,
                    they hope that God and the people of the United States will find some way to
                    prevent the subversion of the government by both Southern and Northern traitors.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our last issue we made some observations on what we believed to be the
                        designs of the radical leaders now controlling the party in power. Events
                        daily transpiring have confirmed us, not only in the belief that they intend
                        to divide the country, but that their ultimate design is a total subversion
                        of our republican form of government and the establishment of a military
                        despotism. The enlistment bill of Senator Wilson, conferring absolute power
                        on the President over the militia of the several States; the bill granting
                        to the President, at his discretion, the power of suspending the writ of
                        habeas corpus and Thad. Stevens' negro soldier bill, together with the many
                        arbitrary acts of this administration and its utter disregard of the sacred
                        obligations of the Constitution, all point unerringly toward the
                        establishment of an absolute despotism on the ruins of our republican
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>In view of these facts it is the duty of all true patriots, of whatever name
                        or party, to awake to a sense of the dangers that are threatening the
                        destruction of our noble form of government. The danger is imminent and
                        admits of no delay. It will require prompt, energetic, vigorous and
                        determined action on the part of the true friends of the government to save
                        us from impending anarchy and despotism. The fatal and destructive policy of
                        the administration has brought the country to the very verge of run, whilst
                        the bold, bad men who have urged it on in its course and whose mad counsels
                        it has heeded, are dancing in fearful orgies over the ruins they have
                        created.</p>
                    <p>The administration might, perhaps, yet save the country from total ruin if it
                        would change its present suicidal policy, discard the destructive and
                        revolutionary doctrines of abolitionism, and recall Gen. McClellan to the
                        head of the Army. In this way it could restore confidence to a demoralized
                        army, renew the hopes of a disheartened people and by a few vigorous blows
                        struck at the "heart of the rebellion," between now and the first of May
                        next, (the time fixed by Greely for a recognition of the Southern
                        Confederacy), the waning fortunes of the Republic might be retrieved and the
                        unity of the nation and constitutional liberty preserved.</p>
                    <p>But of this we have no hope. Fanaticism has gone too far to recant. Ephraim
                        is joined to his idols and the only hope now rests with God and the people.
                        We cannot believe that either will permit the destruction of the noblest
                        form of government ever devised by man's wisdom. We have an abiding faith in
                        the patriotism of the people. We believe they will prove equal to the task
                        of preserving the Government from the combined assaults of Southern and
                        Northern traitors who are attempting its overthrow, the former by armed
                        rebellion and the latter by the subversion of the Constitution and laws.</p>
                    <p>How it is to be done we cannot well see at present, but that the people in
                        some way or other will yet rescue the country from the gulf of ruin to which
                        it has been brought by Northern fanaticism and Southern treason, we have no
                        doubt. But it behooves them to be on the alert and carefully note the drift
                        of events. Let every true patriot, who desires to see perpetuated the
                        priceless legacy bequeathed to us by our fathers, and purchased with their
                        blood, ponder well the inquiry at the head of this article, remembering
                        always that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.["]</p>

<b>To Our Readers</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that, owing to the unusual amount of advertisements in the
                    paper, they have not given the readers the amount of reading material that they
                    might wish. The editors ask the readers to indulge them for a few weeks, when
                    they will again "be able to furnish them with the usual quantity and variety of
                    substantial reading as heretofore."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>"A Merciless Tyrant"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors quote an article from a Richmond paper, which notes the attack
                    of Thaddeus Stevens on the loyalty of the people of Kentucky. The Richmond
                    writer goes on to criticize the Kentucky "tories" who sold the state out to the
                    Yankees, and he expresses the hope that Stevens will continue to abuse them. The
                    editors of the Spirit and Times question what right Stevens has to doubt the
                    loyalty of the people of Kentucky, who they believe to be "infinitely more
                    loyal" than Stevens himself.<br>

                    </p>
                    <p>Camp of "Tyler's Brigade," 5th Corps, <br>Near Fredericksburg, Va.
                        <br>February 1st, 1863.</p>
                    <p>The most violent and disagreeable storms we have experienced since our
                        military service commenced, came upon us last week. It snowed, blowed and
                        rained almost incessantly for three days, the snow finally getting the
                        mastery, and now as it is melting away leaves us in mud so deep that it
                        would take a long pole to fathom it.</p>
                    <p>The chief talk about camp at present is in regard to the recent change of
                        commanders. Gen. Burnside was not looked upon as a brilliant, dashing
                        chieftain, nor was his executive capacity considered sufficiently
                        comprehensive for the government of so large an army as this immense force
                        around me. But he had the respect and esteem of every one, except, perhaps,
                        a few croakers, for his uprightness and honesty, his pure patriotism and I
                        might say, especially for the almost brotherly affection known to exist
                        between him and Gen. McClellan. His was not the temper[a]ment to cause any
                        remarkable degree of enthusiasm among his command; but his motives elicited
                        admiration, and if he failed to execute them successfully they were honest
                        failures, owing to no lack of support from his men but the disparity of his
                        own ability with the magnitude of his operations. Gen. Hooker who succeeds
                        him, has a record which establishes his bravery and skill beyond a doubt;
                        but he has yet to show that he too is not deficient in the same quality of a
                        great commander needed by Gen. Burnside, namely: executive capacity. The
                        government of an army of two hundred thousand men in time of war, is a
                        stupendous task, and demands a mind possessing an extraordinary combination
                        of qualities, vouchsafed to but few in the military movements of the past
                        and hardly yet developed in the events of our own time. The star of
                        Rosecrans rises with almost dazzling brightness over the field of
                        Murfreesboro', and his name is lauded all over the land. Yet taken from his
                        present command of perhaps 60,000 men and transferred to this field, he
                        would fail in satisfying the demands of the country and advancing to
                        success, from the want of that important and essential quality referred to
                        in Burnside and as many assert in Hooker also. Thus far the only man
                        approaching the standard of ability for the task, has unquestionably been
                        McClellan. He received the unqualified endorsement of Gen. Burnside himself
                        in this respect, and the army to-day holds him pre-eminent above every other
                        man as the best fitted to command them. It is to gratify no indulgence of
                        feeling for Gen. McClellan that I refer to him. But it is a well-known fact
                        that the affairs of this army have not been controlled with the same degree
                        of ability, nor has the same degree of success attended its efforts since
                        his departure from it. The progress of time but strengthens the confidence
                        of the army in McClellan, and history is amply vindicating his wisdom and
                        his fame. With the assumption of command by Gen. Hooker, a new era in our
                        existence begins. We enter upon it full of hope for the speedy and complete
                        success of our army. He will, I doubt not, receive a cordial and earnest
                        support, and if another failure comes to be recorded, it is chargeable alone
                        to the almost unpardonable mismanagement that seems to characterize nearly
                        every movement of the Army of the Potomac.</p>
                    <p>Quite a large batch of orders have been recently issued, having in view the
                        better discipline of the army; preventing desertions, which by the way are
                        enormously on the increase; calling for thorough and complete inspections;
                        restricting permits for absence, &amp;c., &amp;c., all of which if
                        faithfully carried out will bring about a better state of affairs.</p>
                    <p>A large number of vacancies caused by resignations, deaths and dismissals,
                        now exist in every Army Corps. In our own Brigade the official Roster is
                        greatly reduced. There is plenty of good material to fill these vacancies,
                        but will hardly be made available except in necessitous cases, owing to the
                        comparatively short time we have yet to serve.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the continued absence of Gen. Tyler and the recent departure of
                        Brig. Gen. Humphreys on a short visit to Washington, Col. Gregory is now in
                        command of the Division, and Lieut. Col. D. W. Rowe of the Brigade.</p>
                    <p>We expect to occupy a new camp ground tomorrow about a mile from this point.
                        It is said to be a much pleasanter location and has plenty of good water and
                        wood convenient.</p>
                    <p>The boys are in better health than they have been at any time since we have
                        been on this ground. It was supposed that the recent exposure and march
                        through the mud would produce much sickness, but the pro[g]nostications on
                        this point have very agreeably failed of realization. The boys are carefully
                        noting the days as they lessen our period of return. Less than three months
                        hence and I hope that every one of our present number may be blessed in the
                        happiness, joys and comforts of home. This especially is the prayerful wish
                        if [sic] your correspondent.</p>

<b>The Negro Soldier Bill</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors extract several statements from the Congressional debate over
                    Thaddeus Stevens's "negro soldier bill." Mr. Wadsworth of Kentucky argues that
                    the aim of the bill was to entrench blacks in the cotton states who would then
                    be able to exterminate or drive out the whites. Wright of Pennsylvania thought
                    that if things were so bad that the Union needed blacks to help, than things
                    were too far gone that the blacks would be of any use. He added that the
                    solution to the military problems was to put McClellan at the head of the army.
                    Diven of New York said he thought the President already had the authority to
                    call up black troops.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the National House of Representatives on Friday a week, the negro soldier
                        bill, introduced by Mr. Stevens, was under discussion. We select from the
                        debate as follows:</p>
                    <p>The House resumed the consideration of the negro soldier bill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wadsworth (Ky.) protested against its passage. It was a confession to the
                        world of our desperate condition, and that our efforts to suppress the
                        rebellion have failed. Unsuccessful in saving the Constitution and hope of
                        liberty on this Continent, it was now proposed to acknowledge that the negro
                        was now our only hope of salvation. This he would not admit. He still
                        thought that there was wisdom, valor and strength enough in the people to
                        preserve all we held dear, and that Almighty God will turn aside the
                        troubles which now embarrass us.</p>
                    <p>The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) had explained the reason for
                        the passage of this bill, which was drawn up by the Secretary of War
                        himself. It was to put the negro soldier on an equality with the white as to
                        military protection in the event of being taken prisoners; but this was not
                        the true reason. Its purpose was to organize in military array the negro,
                        proclaimed free by the President's proclamation, to entrench them on the
                        soil of the cotton States, and maintain them there, to exterminate or drive
                        off the whites of that section. Of what use would be the proclamation of
                        emancipation unless followed up by the arming the [sic] negroes as now
                        proposed. The President having now taken the step there was no retreat from
                        it. He had yielded to the clamors of his ultra friends. While opp[o]sing the
                        bill generally, he contended it is not our policy to call negroes into the
                        war as soldiers when we can obtain a far better class of defenders.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wright (Penna.) said this government and the Union were the result of
                        compromise. In concession and compromise it had its birth; the very day the
                        Declaration went forth to the Colonies from Independence Hall, there was
                        compromise and concession. From that period to 1850 such a policy has
                        prevailed. The Union was then saved by the compromise of the great and
                        ruling spirits of the land, Clay, Webster, Calhoun and others, meeting
                        together for that purpose. Were gentlemen here less wise than those men? If
                        ever there was a time in the history of the country when concession and
                        compromise should be exhibited it was now.</p>
                    <p>The enactment of a measure repulsive to the sentiment of a large mass of
                        people might produce such a state of affairs that we some morning might
                        awake to find we have no government in existence. [A voice--"Yes we will."]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wright was willing to make any honorable sacrifice, now that the other
                        side of the chamber show a corresponding disposition. If gentlemen here
                        would all agree upon a base of compromise as to the conduct of this war, it
                        should not last three months. He opposed the bill because, among other
                        reasons, it would produce demoralization, and the soldiers of the army had
                        said to him that if black men were sent to them, they will regard it as a
                        condemnation of their conduct, and leave the service if they can. How far
                        this feeling extends, he was not able to say.</p>
                    <p>He said the white Anglo-Saxon race was capable of taking care of itself; but
                        if we have not power to maintain our position, negroes cannot help us out of
                        the difficulty. They were not reliable in the military service.</p>
                    <p>He believed that by a re-construction of the Cabinet, and the restoration of
                        General McClellan to the army, the country could be saved. [At this point
                        applause broke forth in heavy volumes from the galleries, accompanied by
                        stamping of feet and clapping of hands].</p>
                    <p>The Speaker said if such disorders were repeated, he would order the
                        galleries to be cleared.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wright said that McClellan was not a favorite of his. He had never
                        advocated him here, but he believed that no other general in the army
                        embodies the feelings and sentiments of his troops.</p>
                    <p>If you want to carry victory on your arms you must have a commander in whom
                        the army have confidence. It was idle to talk about victory with a
                        demoralized army. McClellan, he repeated, was the head of the American Army,
                        and should be placed in command. [The galleries again broke forth in
                        applause, but somewhat suppressed in consequence of the Speaker's
                        admonition, which was now repeated.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wright, resuming, said, let the President make a new and mixed Cabinet,
                        representing the two great parties of the country, restore General McClellan
                        to command, and call for two hundred thousand men, who would rush to his
                        standard in an instant.</p>
                    <p>Addressing the Republicans, he said: You must abandon your ultra notions, or
                        we are gone. We have got to compromise. Abandon the proposition to bring
                        negroes into the army, or we are lost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Diven (N.Y.) did not think that this bill was of such paramount
                        importance as to justify the excitement it has produced in this hall. He
                        thought the President already possessed the power to employ negro soldiers.
                        Provision was already made for their employment in all conditions to which
                        their services can be made efficient, but he preferred his own proposal,
                        offered in June last, making provision for their emigration, and, in
                        addition to their employment, making provision for themselves and families;
                        their operations to be confined to rebel localities, and not to operate on
                        the border States loyal to the Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cox, while opposing the bill, remarked that its object was to produce a
                        dissolution of the Union; for gentlemen from border States have said that it
                        would be impossible to restore the Union if negroes are brought into the
                        field, like fiends of hell in accordance with the policy which began in hate
                        and is followed up by a spirit of vengeance. A large portion of our army is
                        made up of Celtic blood, and he would tell gentlemen that they would not
                        fight beside negroes. The prejudice cannot be eradicated.</p>
                    <p>As Mr. Lovejoy had made some allusion to his diminutive size, he was reminded
                        of an epitaph, which he lately saw in a newspaper about the gentlemen from
                        Illinois, as follows:</p>
                    <p><br>Beneath this stone good Owen Lovejoy lies, <br>Little in everything
                        except his size; <br>What though his burly body fills this hole; <br>Yet
                        through Hell's key-hole crept his little soul. <br>[Great laughter.] But he
                        did not believe <br>this of the gentlemen from Illinois.</p>
