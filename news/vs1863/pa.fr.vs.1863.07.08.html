<b>Apology</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors apologize for the interruption of publication due to the recent
                    Confederate raids.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some weeks since, the editor of the Vicksburg Whig, apologized for the non-appearance of his paper, by saying the
                        Yankee shells burst so close to the windows of the office that the hands
                        were unable to work. We must give our readers a similar excuse for the
                        non-appearance of our paper for the last three weeks. It will be seen the
                        outside of this issue bears date June 17th. We were almost ready to issue
                        when the rebel Jenkins made his first appearance, and we again attempted it
                        last week, and were just ready to go to press when the whole rebel army
                        arrived in town and again suspended operations. We hope the interruption is
                        now over, and will issue this number, thought the suspension and
                        irregularity of the mails, renders it uncertain whether our subscribers will
                        get their papers at the usual time.</p>

<b>The State Convention</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report that the Democratic State Convention met on June 17 and
                    nominated Hon. George W. Woodward of Luzerne County for Governor, and Hon.

<b>New York First in the Field</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that Gov. Seymour of New York, upon hearing of the
                    invasion of Pennsylvania, telegraphed Governor Curtain and promised him 15
                    regiments in defense of the state and soon had 14 under marching orders. This
                    should disprove, claim the editors, any accusations by abolitionists that
                    impugned the loyalty of a "copperhead" such as Seymour.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The reports which the newspapers and eye-witnesses bring us of the three
                        great battles near Gettysburg, are not very full and satisfactory, but
                        enough is known to warrant the assertion that we have achieved a complete
                        and glorious victory over the enemy. The first engagement began at nine
                        o'clock on Wednesday morning, July 1st, about two miles this side of
                        Gettysburg, on the Chambersburg turnpike. The forces engaged on our side
                        were only the first and eleventh corps, under command of Generals Reynolds
                        and Howard, the other corps not having arrived on the field. We were
                        compelled to fall back a mile or so, during the great portion of the day,
                        but regained nearly all the lost ground before night. During the night the
                        greater portion of our army came up, and all were in position by daylight.
                        The enemy did not commence the attack until four o'clock in the afternoon.
                        The engagement lasted until dusk, and the enemy were repulsed at all points
                        and driven back with great slaughter. At daylight on Friday morning the
                        fight was again resumed, the enemy being the attacking party. We held our
                        own until noon, when an advance was made along our whole line. The rebels
                        hotly contested every foot of ground, but were driven back to the foot of
                        the mountain, leaving the ground covered with their killed and wounded. Our
                        forces captured several thousand prisoners and a large number of cannon.
                        This engagement is said to have been the hottest of the war. So completely
                        were Lee's columns shattered that he commenced rapidly to retreat along the
                        mountain the same night, our cavalry and artillery harrassing [sic] him at
                        every step. He took the route by Millerstown, through Monterey towards
                        Boonsboro, and will doubtless, unless he is completely cut off, go by way of
                        Hagerstown to the river at Williamsport. Here his retreat has been most
                        effectually checked, by the destruction of his pontoon bridges by Colonel
                        French. A large portion of our forces will probably succeed in getting
                        between the retreating army and the river. In which case, if the rebel
                        general is brought to bay, he may make an obstinate stand, and another
                        desperate battle may be fought, probably on or near the old Antietam
                        battle-field. Whether any considera[b]l[e] portion of the rebel army ever
                        succeeds in recrossing the river, there can be no doubt that the greater
                        part of their immense wagon train will be captured. This train retreated by
                        Newman's pass through Greenwood, New Franklin and Greencastle. Already fifty
                        or sixty wagons have been taken, and if the river continues high, the entire
                        train must fall into our hands. Thus far the victory of our army, under
                        command of the gallant Meade, has been most complete and over-whelming; and
                        it only remains to be seen whether the scattered remnants of the rebel host
                        succeed in gaining the Virginia shore and saving themselves annihilation.
                        Meade has been largely reinforced, and he has already done so magnificently
                        that we hope of still better things from the Army of the Potomac. All honor
                        to this gallant Army! Nobly and completely has it redeemed the disasters of
                        Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville! And a terrible lesson has it taught the
                        defiant rebel horde who flaunted their banners so insultingly in our faces,
                        and boasted that they could march and plunder and destroy wheresoever they
                        pleased.</p>

                    <p>Southern Pennsylvania has again been occupied by a portion of the rebel army.
                        The apprehension of another invasion of the State had been general amongst
                        the people since the latter part of May; and that apprehension was confirmed
                        by the large body of the enemy's cavalry which General Pleasanton found
                        massed on the upper Rappahannock, and by the subsequent news of the disaster
                        to our arms in the Valley of Virginia. By eight o'clock, on Monday morning,
                        the 14th of June, there was no longer any room to doubt the whereabouts and
                        purpose of the Confederate army. A portion of Milroy's supply train, which
                        fortunately was absent from Winchester when our forces evacuated, and was
                        making its escape northward, when near Chambersburg, was seized with a
                        frightful panic, and dashed through the town at a furious rate, the
                        teamsters shouting "The rebels are coming!" "They are close after us!" Such
                        a scene of wild excitement and consternation we have never witnessed before.
                        Drivers were swearing and yelling at the top of their lungs; wheels were run
                        off from wagons, and horses fell dead in the streets from sheer exhaustion;
                        and still the grand stampede continued, every man and horse seeming animated
                        with the one desire of saving himself from rebel clutches. This
                        extraordinary spectacle served to alarm our citizens seriously. The
                        merchants at once proceeded to close their stores and to remove and secrete
                        their most valuable merchandize; and the timid and fearful prepared to
                        "skedaddle" without loss of time. About this time a telegraphic message was
                        received from the operator at Hagerstown, to the following effect, "The
                        rebels are in town, I am off." While this dispatch showed that the enemy
                        were not yet in Pennsylvania, it also proved that they were on their way
                        hither. And so the preparations for their reception were continued. It was
                        too late to prepare for defense against such a large body as was reported
                        advancing, and all who remained in town resolved to make their property as
                        secure as possible, and then calmly submit to their fate.</p>
                    <p>The vicinity of the Cumberland Valley depot presented a scene of lively
                        interest. The Railroad Company were preparing to remove their rolling stock
                        and the machinery from the shops; and almost every family had some valuables
                        they wished transported to places of greater safety, while many were anxious
                        to go themselves. Those who had horses and cattle were startling them down
                        the eastern turnpike or running them off to the mountains. Our colored
                        populations, and particularly the "contrabands," were alarmed beyond
                        measure. Some fled to the woods, others sought protection in the houses of
                        the citizens, and others succeeded in getting charge of some of the
                        "skedaddling" horses, and thus made good their own escape and, at the same
                        time, conveyed the hors[e] flesh to a place of safety.</p>
                    <p>About dusk, Lieutenant Palmer, of the provost guard, came in and reported the
                        rebels in force this side of Greencastle and advancing towards Chambersburg.
                        And at eleven o'clock at night, the advance guard arrived at the southern
                        end of town, enquired for some of the principal citizens, demanded the
                        surrender of the town, and gave notice that the town would be burned if they
                        were fired on from any of the houses. Subsequently a squad of them dashed
                        down Main street, and when near the Diamond were met by a party of citizens,
                        who succeeded in capturing three of them and running off their horses. The
                        remainder the party wheeled and retreated to their main column, which soon
                        advanced and took possession of the town. General Jenkins, the officer in
                        command, established his headquarters at Montgomery's hotel. While the main
                        body proceeded to the eastern end of the town, and encamped in and around
                        the farm of Colonel McClure. They then threw out their pickets towards Green
                        Village and Scotland, a portion of whom proceeded to burn the railroad
                        bridge over the Conococheague, at the latter place, as a precaution against
                        an advance of the federal forces. Guards were also thrown along all the
                        roads leading out of the town, and thus all egress and ingress of the
                        citizens was effectually stopped, and we were cut off from the civilized
                        world.</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday morning, Jenkins issued an order requiring the dry-good's, grocery
                        and drug stores to be opened; and assured the citizens nothing should be
                        taken but such clothing, provisions and drugs as the men needed. Each of the
                        four drug stores was placed in charge of a surgeon, who examined the stock
                        on hand, and indicated such artitcles [sic] as they wanted; which articles
                        they packed in boxes and took with them, and for most of which they paid the
                        prices asked in Confederate money. The dry goods and grocery stores were
                        crowded with customers during their stay; and the rebels generally seemed
                        willing to pay in their own scrip whatever prices the merchants placed upon
                        their goods. Jenkins also ordered the immediate release of the three
                        prisoners, who had been taken by the citizens, and declared immediate
                        release of the three prisoners, who had been taken by the citizens, and
                        declared he would hold the borough authorities responsible for the return of
                        the captured horses. The prisoners were released, and as the horses could
                        not be found, having doubtless been run off to the mountains by their
                        captors, the Town Council, after a brief consultation, determined to give
                        them $900, in rebel scrip, which was obtained from the druggists and
                        merchants. This seemed to satisfy them for their loss.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday morning Jenkins issued an order to Colonel Hoskinson, Chief
                        Burgess, requiring him to have all the arms in possession of the citizens
                        delivered at the Court House, by ten o'clock, in default of which all the
                        houses were to be searched. Quite a number of the citizens complied with the
                        order. About four hundred and fifty guns were handed over, but many of them,
                        being shot guns or light fowling pieces, were given back to their owners.
                        They, however, succeeded in getting some fine rifles, in this way. And about
                        ten o'clock, the same day, a courier arrived at Jenkin's headquarters, from
                        the direction of Hagerstown, bringing, as it proved, an order for him to
                        fall back. For immediately after the arrival of this messenger, the General
                        gave orders for his command to prepare for a backward movement. They
                        commenced to fall back at once, and by one o'clock in the afternoon had all
                        left town. Just before leaving, some of the rear guard fired the warehouse
                        of Messrs. Oaks &amp; Linn, but the flames were soon extinguished by the
                        citizens and a large and destructive fire thus prevented. Some of this party
                        were fired on by citizens and the fire was returned, but no one was injured
                        on either side.</p>
                    <p>In their departure, this force of Jenkins carried away a large number of our
                        colored population, old and young, male and female. Some of these were
                        "contrabands," who had come to us from Virginia, but many of them were free,
                        and had been born here and had lived here all their lives. Some were driven
                        along the road by a guard, others were mounted behind some of the cavalry,
                        and others were tied to the wagons. Some of them were very cruelly treated,
                        and the general distress and consternation among them was pitiful to behold.</p>
                    <p>It was first thought that this move of Jenkins was a mere raid, and, when
                        they left us, we had almost begun to think the worst was over. But we soon
                        learned that they had retired no further than Greencastle, from which point
                        they made incursions to Waynesboro', Mercersburg and McConnelsburg, and
                        scoured and ravaged the whole southern portion of the County. We also
                        learned that Ewell's and Longstreet's corps were at Hagerstown, and then the
                        impression became general, that Jenkins advance was a reconnaissance in
                        force, to be followed, at an early day, by a general movement of the rebel
                        army.</p>
                    <p>During Thursday, Friday and Saturday, nothing of importance occurred. The
                        Rail Road company, with commendable energy and alacrity, proceeded at once
                        to rebuild the Scotland bridge. And the citizens began forming themselves
                        into companies as rapidly as possible. The great obstacle to such
                        organizations was the want of arms. But assurances were received from
                        Governor Curtin that as soon as these organizations were completed, and
                        transportation could be had, the arms would be furnished. Some four or five
                        companies were almost full, when the second sudden appearance of the rebels,
                        and the want of arms, served to disband them for the time.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday the Eighth regiment of New York militia marched into town, and met
                        with a perfect ovation from the citizens. Cambric and the Union colors
                        fluttered from almost every window, and cheer after cheer rent the air. They
                        halted in the Diamond and were soon supplied with loads of substantials and
                        delicacies from the hands of the fair ones; to which the brave defenders
                        responded by many a hearty cheer for the ladies and citizens of
                        Chambersburg. They marched to the Southern end of the town and there
                        encamped for the night, where they were joined on Monday by the
                        Seventy-first New York and a battery (both of which also met a cordial
                        reception), and by as many of the citizens as were supplied with arms. Brig.
                        Gen. Joseph F. Knipe, also arrived on Sunday and took command.</p>
                    <p>On Monday evening it was found that the enemy were again advancing in great
                        force, and all our infantry and artillery were withdrawn from the southern
                        end of town and sent towards Shippensburg. At the same time the post-office
                        was also removed. The information then received proved correct. At a quarter
                        before eleven o'clock on Tuesday, the cavalry of Jenkins again entered the
                        town. Squads were at once detailed to cut down the telegraph poles and
                        destroy the wires, which they did most effectually. They also went down the
                        rail road, tearing up the rails, placing the cross-ties in heaps and burning
                        them, and throwing the rails into the fire, for the purpose of warping them.
                        They attempted to burn Scotland bridge again, it only having been completed
                        the day before, but the timber being wet, they failed in their attempt, and
                        then proceeded to destroy it, as far as they were able, by cutting and
                        sawing the timbers. About eleven o'clock at night this party again fell
                        back. And at ten the next morning the general advance was made--First came
                        an immense body of cavalry, steadily and quietly, every man with his hand on
                        his carbine, and his eye glancing suspiciously at each open window and door.
                        Then came the infantry, Ewells celebrated corps, formerly commanded by
                        Stonewall Jackson, full fifteen thousand strong, in three divisions, each
                        regiment bearing the "Stars and Bars" or some regimental or State flag, and
                        their bands, or drum corps discoursing "the Bonnie Blue Flag," "Dixie," or
                        "The Marsel[l]aise." There was but little confusion or noise, nothing but
                        the tramp, tramp of thousands of feet, and the continual monotonous rattle
                        of canteens and equipments. First came a brigade, then its artillery, then
                        its ambulances, and then its baggage train. And so the march continued,
                        during the entire day, until the novelty wore off, and the eye began to tire
                        with the endless succession and the heart grew sick over the gloomy prospect
                        before our happy valley. One division of Ewells corps, that of Early
                        comprising 5,000 men and twenty guns, with a small cavalry force, had been
                        sent by way of Greenwood directly over the mountains towards Gettysburg. On
                        their way they burned the furnace of Thaddeus Stevens, located at the
                        western base of South mountain. On Thursday came the corps of A.P. Hill full
                        twelve thousand strong; and on Friday came that of Longstreet. They occupied
                        almost these entire three days in passing through town. And the entire force
                        numbered, by actual count, fully fifty thousand men two hundred and ten
                        cannon, twelve, twenty-four and thirty-two pounders, and over two thousand
                        wagons. This of course does not include Earley's division, and one or two
                        other brigades, which are known to have positively gone over the mountain by
                        other routes than the turnpike from this to Gettysburg. We would not
                        estimate the rebel force which passed through this valley at less than
                        75,000 strong, and it might reach 85,000.</p>
                    <p>General Lee and staff entered town with the corps of Hill, and made their
                        Headquarters for two days, in what is commonly known as Shetter's woods,
                        about a fourth of a mile east of town. The General is a stoutly built man,
                        apparently about fifty years of age, with gray hair and a stiff, scrubbly
                        gray beard. He was dressed very plainly, with not a single mark of his rank
                        about him, wearing a black slouch hat without ornament, dark blue or black
                        military cape, and plain gary [sic] pantaloons. The men with whom we
                        conversed speak of him as a rigid disciplinarian, but think he is the
                        greatest general the world has ever produced. "Old Bob Lee," as they all
                        call him, whatever may be his real ability, at least possesses the unbounded
                        confidence of his men, and herein lies the great secret of his previous
                        successes.</p>
                    <p>Stewart's and Imboden's cavalry brought up the rear of the army on Thursday,
                        July 2nd. They had scarcely reached town when a courier came from Lee,
                        hurrying them and the regiment which was here doing provost duty, on to
                        Gettysburg. This was the first intimation that we had that the great battle
                        was imminent. By Friday evening there was not a rebel to be seen in town,
                        except some stragglers, who were taken prisoners, as fast as they came in,
                        and confined in the jail or sent east.</p>
                    <p>Captain Boyd, of the First New York cavalry, who had been scouting between
                        this and Shippensburg, made a brilliant dash upon a party of Stewart's
                        cavalry, near Stoufferstown, about one mile from this place, on Thursday
                        afternoon, and succeeded in taking forty prisoners, losing none in killed
                        and only one or two slightly wounded. Captain Boyd and Lieutenant Palmer
                        have done gallant service in harras[s]ing the enemy in this vicinity, and
                        have taken a large number of prisoners, wagons and horses.</p>
                    <p>Early on Sunday morning Ex-Sheriff Taylor, David Taylor, Alexander Martin and
                        one or two others of this place, captured a rebel train of ten wagons,
                        containing fifty wounded men from the battle of Gettysburg.</p>
                    <p>Among the celebrities of the army we succeeded in seeing Lee, Ewell, A.P.
                        Hill, Longstreet, Early, Rhodes, Picketts, Wright, E.T. Johnson, Imboden and
                        Stewart. Ewell lost a leg at Anteitam [sic], and when riding is strapped to
                        his saddle; Early also seemed to have a wooden leg; Hill, Rhodes and
                        Picketts are comparatively young men; Imboden and Stewart are well up in
                        years. Colonel Battles of Alabama was the first provost marshal of the town.
                        He established his headquarters in the Court-House, he was courteous and
                        gentlemanly, and his guard, with scarcely an exception, behaved well.
                        Afterwards the guard was changed every day, and we had some rough customers
                        to deal with. The promises and pledges made one day were invariably broken
                        the next; and interferance [sic] with private property finally became the
                        rule and not the exception.</p>
                    <p>So much for the "pomp and circumstance of glorious war." We might stop here,
                        and call this the sunshine of war. But the picture must have its dark
                        shading. At first this advance of the rebel army seemed like some grand
                        review, but soon we began to feel the heavy burden, and to tast[e] the gall
                        and worm-wood of bondage. Soon after Jenkins' second arrival he issued a
                        requisition upon the citizens of Chambersburg for fifteen hundred rations.
                        There was no alternative but to furnish them; at least there was only one
                        alternative, and that was to have the provisions taken from their houses by
                        force. A stranger, visiting town about this time, would have thought we were
                        preparing for some grand picnic. Old and young might be seen trudging along
                        with their baskets or bundles of provision. When Ewell entered town, he made
                        his headquarters at the Franklin House, and his first act was to issue the
                        following requisitions:</p>
                    <p>Headquarters 2nd Army Corps, <br>June 24th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>
                        To the authorities of Chambersburg, Pa.:
                    </p>
                    <p>By direction of Lieut. Gen. R.S. Ewell, I require the following articles:</p>
                    <p>5,000 suits clothing, including hats, boots and shoes. <br>100 good saddles.
                        <br>100 good bridles. <br>5,000 bushels grain (corn or oats.) <br>10,000
                        lbs. sole leather. <br>10,000 lbs. horse shoes. <br>400 lbs. horse shoe
                        nails. <br>Also, the use of Printing office, and two printers to report at
                        once.</p>
                    <p>All articles except grain will be delivered at the Court House Square, at 3
                        o'clock, P.M. today, and the grain by 6 o'clock, P.M., today.</p>
                    <p>J.A. Harmon. <br>Maj. and Ch.Q. 2nd Corps De Arm.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters 2nd Army Corps, <br>June 24th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>By command of Lieut. Gen. R.S. Ewell the citizens of Chambersburg will
                        furnish the following articles, by 3 o'clock, this afternoon,</p>
                    <p>6,000 lbs. lead. <br>10,000 lbs. harness leather. <br>50 boxes tin.
                        <br>1,000 curry combs and brushes. <br>2,000 lbs. picket rope. <br>500
                        pistols. <br>All the caps and powder in the town. <br>Also, all the neats
                        foot oil.</p>
                    <p>Wm. Allen, M and C.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently another requisition was sent in for the following articles:</p>
                    <p>50,000 lbs. bread. <br>100 sacks salt. <br>30 bbls. molasses. <br>500bbls.
                        flour. <br>25 do vinegar. <br>25 do beans. <br>25 do dried fruit. <br>25
                        do sour-kraut <br>25 do potatoes. <br>11,000 lbs. coffee. <br>10,000 lbs.
                        sugar. <br>100,000 lbs. hard bread.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the citizens was called at once. It was estimated that the
                        articles called for would be worth between three and four hundred thousand
                        dollars, and it was decided peremptorily to refuse to furnish anything, and
                        a number of gentlemen were appointed to wait on Gen. Ewell, and refuse the
                        demand, and at the same time represent that we were in his power, and that
                        all we asked was to be governed strictly by the rules of war. After this
                        refusal, guards were sent to all the stores, the military authorities took
                        pos[s]ession of such groceries, hardware, flour, drugs, soaps &amp;c. as
                        they wanted. And then the merchants were directed to keep their stores open
                        and sell to those who wish to buy for confederate scrip, on pain of having
                        their doors burst open and their goods taken without any remuneration. Mr.
                        S. S. Shryock sold books and stationary to the amount of $8000 in Rebel
                        paper. The Messrs. Eyster sold dry goods and groceries to the amount of
                        $5000, and a number of others to the amount of $2000 and $3000. There was
                        not a store of any prominence that did not suffer heavily. Those who did not
                        open at the first demand were compelled to see their doors broken in. The
                        officer who seemed to have particular charge of this delightful piece of
                        work was a Major Tod[illegible]a brother of Mrs. Lincoln. The doughty Major
                        come [sic] very near getting his skull split, however, by one of our brave
                        and patriotic young ladies. She had taken her position in the cellar of her
                        father's private house, which they insisted on searching, and as they came
                        to the cellar stairs, she stood there with an axe in her hands, and calmly
                        informed the major if he came one step further she would knock his brains
                        out. Thinking discretion the better part of valor the major withdrew.</p>
                    <p>At eight o'clock on Wednesday morning, July 1st, the destruction of the
                        Railroad works began. During the present season, the engine house, carpenter
                        shop, blacksmith and machine shops, which had been burned by Stuart in his
                        raid last fall, had all been again erected, in an improved style and almost
                        fire proof, and the only way to destroy them was to blow them up or tear
                        them down by hand. The latter plan was adopted. The first assault was upon
                        the engine house. The large wooden doors and window shutters and sash were
                        torn loose, thrown upon the turn table and burned, as was also the wood work
                        in the other shops and in the company's ware house. Then the work of
                        destruction commenced in reality. Parties of a half a dozen, using railroad
                        iron as battering rams, began to undermine the walls about a foot from the
                        ground, after thus undermining a certain distance, each wall crumbled and
                        fell of its own weight, bringing a portion of the roof with it. This mode of
                        destruction was most complete. The entire ends and sides of several
                        buildings fell out, leaving scarcely one brick upon another; and the few
                        walls which were left standing were so shattered as to be of no service.
                        They attacked the wooden car house and the small building occupied by the
                        telegraph office with axes and saws and had not completed their work in this
                        quarter, when the order came from Lee to prepare three day's rations and
                        start immediately for Gettysburg. Had it not been for the interruption, they
                        would doubtless have cut down and burned the whole of these buildings. The
                        turn table is on an improved plan, being constructed entirely of iron; and
                        the object of having the burning material upon it, was to warp and crack the
                        iron, so as to render it unservice[a]ble. In this they were only partially
                        successful, and the damage can be readily repaired.</p>
                    <p>Among the heaviest losers are the Messrs Taylor, who had an entire drove of
                        two hundred fat cattle captured, in McConnell's Cove, Fulton County, while
                        on their way to this place from Western Virginia. Their loss will reach
                        eleven thousand dollars. Some of our millers too have been very heavy
                        losers. The Messrs Harkleroad have lost very heavily, as also Mr. John Barr
                        and Mr. Henry Greenawalt. And all those farmers who did not send away their
                        stock had them taken, some of whom cannot well afford the loss. What the
                        general loss in this county will be when booked up, we have yet no means of
                        telling; but it is safe to say, that, leaving out of consideration the
                        general damage to property and land, it will not fall under two hundred
                        thousand dollars. So much for three weeks of rebel rule in Franklin County.</p>
                    <p>The rebel army were better clad and shod than we expected to see them. Their
                        clothes were much worn, faded and scuffed, but there were comparitively
                        [sic] few whom you could positively call "ragged," and we did not see a
                        hundred men in their bare feet. Their general demeanor was civil and quiet,
                        though several citizens were deprived of hats, coats, and shoes, which some
                        of the dilapidated chivalry immediately appropriated to their own use, and
                        one or two lost their watches and pocket books. As soon as the enemy entered
                        town, guards were placed over all the liquor that was reported to the
                        commanding general, the soldiers were refused admittance into any of the bar
                        rooms or saloons. And we only saw one or two cases of drunkenness. Lee's
                        first order was as follows:</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army of Northern Va., <br>Chambersburg, Pa., 27th June, 1863.</p>
                    <p>General Orders,</p>
                    <p>No 73.</p>
                    <p>The Commanding General has observed with marked satisfaction, the conduct of
                        the troops on the march and confidently anticipates results commensurate
                        with the high spirit they have manifested.</p>
                    <p>No troops could have displayed greater fortitude or better performed the
                        arduous marches of the past ten days.</p>
                    <p>Their conduct in other respects has, with few exceptions, been in keeping
                        with their character as soldiers and entitles them to approbation and
                        praise.</p>
                    <p>There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness on the part of some,
                        that they have in keeping the yet unsullied reputation of this army, and
                        that the duties exacted of us by civilization and christianity are not lest
                        obligatory in the country of the enemy than in our own.</p>
                    <p>The Commanding General considers that no greater disgrace could befall the
                        army, and through it, our whole people than the perpetration of the
                        barbarous outrages upon the unarmed and defenceless, and the wanton
                        destruction of private property, that have marked the course of the enemy in
                        our own country.</p>
                    <p>Such proceedings not only degrade the perpetrators and all connected with
                        them, but are subversive of the discipline and efficiency of the army, and
                        destructive of the ends of presenl [sic] movement.</p>
                    <p>It must be remembered that we make war only upon armed men, and that we
                        cannot take venge[a]nce for the wrongs our people have suffered without
                        lowering ourselves in the eyes of all whose abhorrence has been excited by
                        the atrocities of our enemies, and offending against Him to whom vengeance
                        belongeth, without whose favor and support our efforts must all prove in
                        vain.</p>
                    <p>The Commanding General therefore earnestly exhorts the troops to abstain with
                        most scrupulous care from unnecessary or wanton injury to private property,
                        and he enjoins upon all officers to arrest and bring to summary punishment
                        al who shall in any way offend against orders on this subject.</p>
                    <p>R.E. Lee, General.</p>
                    <p>In despite of this order, however, a number of private houses and offices
                        were entered, and two or three book cases and iron safes were broken open,
                        and many valuable books and papers destroyed and carried away. A number of
                        farmers houses in the country were also ransacked and pillaged.</p>
                    <p>A notable feature in the rebel army was the immense quantity of wagons and
                        horses they brouget [sic] with them. Many of those were captured from our
                        forces, and others were taken from the surrounding country. A large number
                        of horses, wagons, ambulances and caissons bore the mark "U.S." There is a
                        probability that a great portion of their immense train will be
                    recaptured.</p>
