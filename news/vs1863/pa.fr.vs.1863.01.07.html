                    do not comment on it extensively, the editors observe that Lincoln's

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
                    <p>The President has issued the promised emancipation proclamation declaring the
                        slaves of certain States and parts of States "henceforth and forever free."
                        It will be found in another column of our paper to-day.</p>
                    <p>Our views upon the policy of emancipation are well known to our readers and
                        we do not deem it necessary to reiterate them at this time. We may say,
                        however, that we regard this pronunciamento, to
                        use the language of the President himself, as impracticable as the "Pope's
                        bull against the comet." It is unwise, ill-timed, outside of the
                        Constitution and full of mischief. Its effect will be more thoroughly to
                        unite and exasperate the whites of the South in their resistance to the
                        National Government, and to make the war still more prolonged, bloody and
                        bitter.</p>
                    <p>But the radicals have told us that it would end the war in thirty days; that
                        it was the great remedy for the evils afflicting the country; and the
                        Harrisburg Telegraph of Saturday last, exclaims:
                        "The deed is done. The heart of the rebellion has been struck and the Union
                        is saved."</p>
                    <p>Well, we will now see this emancipation policy tested practically, and learn,
                        from experience, the value of abolition philosophy. The country expects them
                        to redeem their promises and with one tremendous blow struck at the "heart
                        of the rebellion" crush it at once, and give peace to the country.</p>
                    <p>Drive on, "Massa Linkun," we are anxiously
                        awaiting the result.</p>

<b>Disturbed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors suggest that the reason that the Dispatch is upset with the
                    Spirit and Times's coverage of Fredericksburg is because of mental infirmity.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>How Richmond was not Taken</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Citing testimony from the court martial of General McDowell, the author
                    argues that if McDowell's corps had not been withdrawn from McClellan's command
                    during the approach to Richmond, McClellan would have been able to take the
                    city. Therefore, the author concludes, the blame should be laid at the feet of
                    President Lincoln, who split the armies and gave McDowell a separate command.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Bloody Beecherisms</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer quotes several speeches by Henry Ward Beecher, in which the
                    minister argues that the blood being shed in the war is for a noble cause and
                    that God should be thanked that there are more men who can be sacrificed. This,
                    says the writer, is evidence that abolitionists are willing to sacrifice all in
                    a fanatical quest for their goal of emancipation.<br>

<b>Worthy of Commendation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that the management of the Cumberland Valley Rail Road has
                    settled with about seventy-five members of the Corn Exchange militia regiment of
                    Philadelphia, who were wounded in the accident last year. The editors believe
                    this is a highly honorable gesture by the company. While the management does not
                    acknowledge any responsibility, they are nonetheless devoting part of their
