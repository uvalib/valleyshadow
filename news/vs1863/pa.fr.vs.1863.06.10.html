<b>Monster Mass Meeting in Independence Square, Philadelphia!</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Transcripts of speeches from a mass meeting held in Philadelphia to protest
                    the arrest of C. L. Vallandigham. The meeting was addressed by Ex-Chief Justice
                    of Pennsylvania Ellis Lewis and Hon. Chas. J. Biddle.<br>

<b>The Transcript on Rampage</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors quote passages from editorials in the Transcript that attack
                    the Democratic club meeting at Franklin Hall the previous week. The Transcript
                    accuses the Democrats of being "false to the country" and of attempting to
                    "stifle the administration in Washington." It concludes by saying "down with the
                    villain who thus boldly bears his traitor heart and is hypocritical enough to
                    mingle with his treasonable speech pitiful whinings for the Union." The editors
                    of the Spirit and Times insinuate that the editor of the Transcript is insane
                    and proclaim the right of Democrats to assemble at any time. The Spirit defies
                    the editor of the Transcript to prove that any element of the speeches justified
                    the language he used to attack them.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>"A Feast of Treason"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors say that while they had ceased mentioning anything to do with
                    the "slander and scurrility usually found in the Dispatch," they had to defend
                    Hon. Wm. H. Miller, a speaker at the recent Democratic club meeting, from the
                    slander heaped on him by the Dispatch's article, "A Feast of Treason." The
                    article could only have been meant to start a riot at the meeting, which the
                    editor of the Dispatch tried to do himself at the meeting. The individual who
                    gave the Dispatch his evidence had heard it on a trip to Harrisburg as part of
                    the official delegation to welcome back the 126th Regiment. While talking to
                    some Democrats, this unnamed individual misinterpreted some of their statements
                    while he was "under the influence of his intense patriotism or something else."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Earning His Wages</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors attack a report in the Gettysburg Star and Banner, edited by J.
                    T. McIlhenny, Esq., which stated that the "Copperhead" meeting in Chambersburg
                    was disrupted by "nine-month men" cheering for Hooker. Rather, say the editors,
                    most of the veterans there were Democrats and they helped clear the hall of the
                    "cowardly crew who came there for the purpose of disturbing the meeting."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Gettysburg Star and Banner</blockquote>
<b>Thirty Thousand Freemen in Council</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors direct the reader's attention to the speeches on page one from
                    the mass meeting in Philadelphia, which protested the arrest of C. L.
                    Vallandigham. The thirty thousand people who allegedly attended the gathering
                    demonstrate to the editors that the "great popular heart still beats true to
                    constitutional freedom."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors ask those who "rail at slavery" to show what can be done for
                    blacks that is better. They claim not to want to defend slavery, but state that
                    it has evolved out of the "necessities of the two races in contact." They argue
                    that any changes to the institution would take ages. If blacks would be better
                    off without slavery, then they should be released if such an action would bring
                    no harm to whites. However, the editors doubt that the lot of blacks would be
                    improved by emancipation.<br>

<b>In Memoriam</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors celebrate the cessation of publication of the Dispatch. While
                    they bore no personal hostility toward the proprietors, it amazed them that
                    people could get so caught up in a "fanatical idea" that they lost all sense of
                    "honor, decency, or propriety, and the regard for the rights and feelings of
                    others."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Happy Denouement</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that something recently had changed the demeanor of their
                    junior partner, William Kennedy. He appeared anxious and his heart was not in
                    his work. When questioned, Kennedy revealed he was to be married, and the
                    editors direct the reader's attention to the report under "Married."<br>(Names in announcement:  William Kennedy)</blockquote>
<b>Newspaper Change</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Snively Strickler has sold the Repository and Transcript to Col. A. K.
                    McClure and his partner, H. S. Stoner, Esq. The new firm takes possession this
                    week and will issue its first edition next week, under the paper's old name, the
                    Franklin Repository. The editors regret "the loss of our friend Strickler from
                    the editorial fraternity," but praise McClure's "enviable reputation" as a
                    journalist, and Stoner's reputation as a "excellent business man and an
                    honorable, high-minded gentleman." They also note that the partners have
                    purchased the Dispatch and are shutting it down, leaving only one Republican
                    newspaper in town.<br>(Names in announcement:  Snively StricklerEsq., Col. A. K. McClure,  H. S. StonerEsq.)</blockquote>
