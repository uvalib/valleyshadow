                <summary>A reprint of a speech given by Congressman William A. Richardson of
                    Illinois, during debate on a bill appropriating money to aid Missouri in
                    abolishing slavery. Richardson claims that it should be up to the individual
                    states to abolish slavery, and that there is no provision in the Constitution
                    allowing the federal government to undertake what the bill proposes.
                    Furthermore, abolishing slavery in Missouri would mean a flood of free blacks
                    into Illinois, he believes, which his constituents would see as a poor reward
                    for the soldiers they sent to help save Missouri from the secessionists.</summary>

                <excerpt>"It is an old saying, that the first thunder of the season awakes the
                    snakes, and it must have been the late storm that stirred out the "copperheads"
                    on Friday last. For out they came, though the day was scarcely warm enough for
                    them, and like the Serpent that Aaron cast down before Pharaoh, they very
                    quietly went to work and devoured all the little poisonous snakes that were
                    hissing out their venom around them."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We publish, in another column, the result of the Spring elections in the
                        different townships of the county, and we ask thinking men to look upon that
                        result and ponder the lesson it contains. In the face of the bitterest
                        denunciation and most unscrupulous misrepresentation, the Democracy, with
                        scarcely an effort, have carried nearly every district in the county, and in
                        those they have not carried, have reduced the Republican majorities to a
                        merely nominal figure. A careful count of the different votes for Judge of
                        Elections--the fairest test we can imagine--gives us a majority of at least
                        five hundred in the county. This seals the fate of Abolitionism in our
                        midst. Franklin county is now largely Democratic beyond the peradventure of
                        a doubt. It is an old saying, that the first thunder of the season awakes
                        the snakes, and it must have been the late storm that stirred out the
                        "copperheads" on Friday last. For out they came, though the day was scarcely
                        warm enough for them, and like the Serpent that Aaron cast down before
                        Pharaoh, they very quietly went to work and devoured all the little
                        poisonous snakes that were hissing out their venom around them. Stand firm,
                        Democrats, be moderate, patient, long-suffering, stick together, and the
                        story of Aaron's big snake won't be a circumstance to the way the
                        "blacksnakes" and "blowers" will disappear before next fall.</p>

                    the approaching elections, will sweep sectional fanaticism forever from the face

                <summary>The editors argue that the Democratic Party has always, up until Lincoln,
                    controlled the policy, guarded the honor, and extended the territory of the
                    United States. A brief citation of such events as the War of 1812, the admission
                    of Texas, and the Mexican-American War, the editors believe, shows the
                    Democratic Party on the correct and forward-looking side of all the issues. Even
                    though the Democratic Party at the present moment is being maligned, it has been
                    this way before, and somber second thoughts will show that the Democratic
                    policies of maintaining the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was is the
                    most sensible and patriotic policy.</summary>

                <excerpt>"We are rapidly approaching the bloody days of the French revolution. We
                    recently heard a conversation between two officers of the army, one of whom had
                    just returned from Indiana; the latter said that, all over that State, union
                    leagues were formed, and were secretly supplied by the Governor with arms.
                    "They'll keep the d--d copperheads in their places," the valiant knight
                    remarked. So this is the object of the organization, is it?"</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Transcript</emph> urges the formation of a "union or
                        loyal league." The people are beginning to ask, "what are these union
                        leagues?" Let us try to answer the question. Are they intended to advance
                        the interests of the people, promote the success of our armies or save the
                        Union? If so, how? By contributing money to the support of the Government?
                        They can do that individually, by purchasing government bonds, more readily
                        and effectually than they can by clubs and secret organizations. By
                        contributing men to the army? Not one of these "union leaguers" has ever
                        volunteered in defence of the country, or they would not be here now to
                        villify [sic] and traduce their fellow-citizens--Not one of them has the
                        remotest idea of ever doing so, or there would be no necessity of resorting
                        to a universal conscription bill. "The primary object" of these leagues,
                        says the <emph rend="italic">Transcript</emph>, "is to bind together all
                        men, of all trades and professions, in a common union, <emph rend="italic"
                            >to maintain the power, glory and integrity of the Union</emph>." Let us
                        see how much money or how many men this proposed league will contribute to
                        redeem this pledge. Actions speak louder than words. By their fruits ye
                        shall know them.</p>
                    <p>Since these "Union Leagues" bear the mark of hypocrisy on their very faces,
                        and are not what they pretend to be, let us ask the question, what is the
                        real object and aim of the organization? We have had two theories in
                        reference to them. They are either intended as a trap to catch unwary
                        Democrats, and induce them to abandon their own time-tried organization--and
                        thus bolster up the waning fortunes of the party in power; or they are
                        intended as a secret military organization--to extend throughout the whole
                        loyal North--and ultimately to establish a military despotism. If the first
                        surmise be true, but little evil will result from it, for no true Democrat
                        will be enticed from his allegiance to the party under whose guidance the
                        Republic has heretofore prospered, and which is yet destined to restore the
                        Union and preserve the Constitution. But if the latter be true, God help the
                        nation! We are rapidly approaching the bloody days of the French revolution.
                        We recently heard a conversation between two officers of the army, one of
                        whom had just returned from Indiana; the latter said that, all over that
                        State, union leagues were formed, and were secretly supplied by the Governor
                        with arms. "They'll keep the d--d copperheads in their places," the valiant
                        knight remarked. So this is the object of the organization, is it? They
                        alone are to decide who are "copperheads," and "copperheads" are to be "kept
                        in their places"--that is, in other words, to be prevented from expressing
                        their opinions by voice or through the ballot box. Well, let the issue come;
                        the sooner it is met the better. That it will be met, boldly and fearlessly,
                        at the very threshold, we tell these men plainly. And we say, in the
                        language of the Cleveland <emph rend="italic">Plain Dealer</emph>:</p>
                    <p>"Woe unto these foolish wretches if they inaugurate such a system. Woe unto
                        them and their children after them if they rashly, and under any pretence
                        whatever, build up armed clubs throughout this land--let them heed the
                        revolutionary history of France. Let bankers, merchants, the "solid men,"
                        the owners of stone fronted mansions, tremble when the time comes that they
                        hold their wealth at the mercy of furious clubs, when, as in the old cities
                        of Italy, every house becomes an armed castle, and the laws are powerless.
                        We feel an unutterable contempt, horror and scorn for the reckless
                        anarchists who would deliberately propose or sanction a project so fraught
                        with death to American liberty."</p>
                    <p>Such is the movement now being inaugurated in Pennsylvania. It is such an
                        organization the <emph rend="italic">Transcript</emph> urges "all loyal men"
                        to unite in forming, here in our midst. Let the people look to their rights!
                        In these revolutionary times we should be prepared for any emergency. The
                        terms "union" and "loyal" are adopted to deceive the unwary and conceal the
                        diabolical purposes that lie hidden in the inmost recesses of this secret
                        society. Democrats, stand firm, be moderate and conservative, treat your
                        opponents courteously, but maintain your liberties at every hazard. Not only
                        the security of your lives, persons and property, but the very existence of
                        the Government depends upon united, firm, moderate action.</p>

                <summary>The editors criticize the Transcript's call for the formation of a local
                    Union or Loyal league. Such an organization could have only two purposes, say
                    the editors. One would be to trap unsuspecting Democrats into supporting a
                    Republican organization, which the editors feel has little chance of success.
                    The other would be to form a secret military organization to terrorize political
                    opponents. The editors urge Democrats to be vigilant and monitor their liberties
                    at all costs.</summary>

                    ask the privates of the army their opinion, they would soon find, the editors

                        15th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>The death of T.J.C. McGrath, which occurred last week, produced deep sorrow
                        throughout our Regiment. His proverbial good nature, winning manners and
                        kindly bearing, rendered him popular wherever known. As a soldier he was
                        faithful to duty and highly esteemed by his comrades. Poor Tip, I trust he
                        has passed from this vale of tears, troubles and tribulation, to realize the
                        joys of another and better world.</p>
                    <p>The rule respecting "leaves of absence" and "furloughs," works admirably. Two
                        line officers out of each Regiment and two enlisted men out of every hundred
                        are permitted to be absent at a time. The period of absence is limited to
                        ten days. The Commanding General in adopting this rule, intended it as a
                        reward for meritorious conduct, and he expects Colonels of Regiments to use
                        proper discretion in forwarding recommendations of applicants.</p>
                    <p>A long list of officers absent from the army without leave, and dismissed
                        from the service with the approval of the President, is published. Two or
                        three from our Brigade appear among the number, none however, I am pleased
                        to say, from our Regiment.</p>
                    <p>The Medical Director of the Army has just called the attention of the
                        Commanding General to the fact that many of the troops occupy huts built
                        over excavated ground, or holes. He denounces them as abominable
                        habitations, productive of low forms of fever and calculated to insidiously
                        undermine health. He recommends that the men live in huts or cabins or tents
                        above ground, and that in every case they be kept properly ventilated.
                        Inspections will be shortly made, and the order will be enforced. This is a
                        matter of no little importance. I believe that most of the cases of fever we
                        have had in our camps this winter have originated from the occupancy of
                        these ground holes. Those who have them may think them very comfortable; but
                        their atmosphere is poisonous and filled with disease and death.</p>
                    <p>Our Brigade Bakery is an institution entitled to notice. It consists of three
                        immense ovens with all the "fixins" for carrying on the business
                        extensively. Ten bakers and assistants do the work, and the whole affair is
                        under the superintendence of Captain Clarke, our Brigade Commissary of
                        Subsistence, a man in every way qualified for the position and whose
                        urbanity and kindness has won for him the esteem and respect of the large
                        number of troops who receive their rations through his Department. Two
                        thousand loaves are daily turned out of the bakery and furnished to the
                        command. The quality of the bread is not equaled by our regular home
                        bakeries; but is more like the unapproachable, clear white, substantial
                        loaves our wives and mothers set us down to at our home tables. It has been
                        demonstrated that these bakeries save the Government a large sum of money.
                        The "hard tack" formerly used did very well at times; but at least one box
                        of every ten became sour, mouldy, or wormy, and immense quantities were
                        wasted. The bread, of course, is more conducive to health and more agreeable
                        for use. The boys live well now; having plenty of bread, coffee, tea, sugar,
                        onions, potatoes, beans, rice, &amp;c. Fresh beef is issued four times a
                        week. The excellence of the Commissariat has done much to establish General
                        Hooker in the confidence and esteem of his army. They feel that he cares for
                        them and is doing all he can to promote their comfort.</p>
                    <p>Thursday night there was a splendid display of sky-rockets visible from our
                        camp. Our boys were sure that there was "something out"--a move, perhaps an
                        attack. Next morning the trouble was solved thus: Capt. De Hart, of a Jersey
                        Regiment, General Berry's Brigade, thought that if war did exist it had no
                        business to interfere with matrimonial arrangements. Accordingly a large
                        party assembled at the Headquarters of General Berry to witness the Captain
                        renounce single blessedness and take upon himself the cares of married life.
                        The lady accompanied by ten bridesmaids and ten gentlemen to aid the
                        Captain, had arrived in the morning from Washington. It was altogether a gay
                        and interesting affair, away down here on the Rappahannock, where two
                        hostile armies are staring each other in the face, "making mouths," shaking
                        fists, and waiting to see which will knock off the chip first. The ceremony
                        was performed, "a union of hearts, a union of hands, none can sever," and
                        festivity and rejoicing ruled the hour. General Hooker was there, having
                        laid aside the fighting propensities which he is accused of possessing, and
                        displayed unusual amiability and deep interest in the scene. Now, the
                        commander of this great army is a "bach," and a rosy cheeked, handsome one
                        at that. You should see him mounted on his splendid gray charger in the full
                        uniform of a Major General and you would have no trouble in deciding the
                        impressibility of his presence on fair woman's heart. On this occasion he
                        was attacked in force. The Rebs themselves could not have beseiged [sic] him
                        more closely. He made a tremendous dash, however, and forced himself
                        through, but not until his fair assailants had cut every button from his
                        coat. This explains how "Fighting Joe" lost his buttons, and here is an
                        incident which will be told over and over again, and be associated with his
                        name in the history of his remarkable life. The buttons will pass from hand
                        to hand prized mementoes of the occasion and of the wonderful man whose coat
                        they once adorned. But the General was brought to the wedding for use as
                        well as ornament. The ceremony was scarcely over until the bride, with one
                        of her most winning smiles, solicited his autograph. The General hesitated
                        but the appeal was irresistable [sic]. It was given, and the bride held in
                        her hand a "twenty day's leave" for her husband, signed by Major General
                        Hooker, commanding the Army of the Potomac. Thus the rockets were not
                        meaningless--there was "something out."</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. West, the highly respected pastor of the Presbyterian congregation
                        at Spring Run, paid us a visit some ten days ago and preached to the boys
                        last Sunday. He takes a deep interest in the army, and while here made many
                        new friends by his kindly words of advice and pious teachings. I can well
                        understand why this excellent man has secured the warm affections and
                        unbounded esteem of his people.</p>
                    <p>The report of our Medical Directors show that the health of our Brigade is
                        greatly improved. There are at present no cases of fever in our hospital and
                        no severe or malignant forms of other diseases. I state this to correct
                        erroneous information which I understand prevails at home.</p>
                    <p>As I close a tremendous storm of snow, sleet and rain prevails, accompanied
                        by heavy peals of thunder and terrific lightning.</p>

                    two to C. W. Eyster and Co., and several to the railroad. They mostly contained
                    flour, and about half was lost. None of the conductors were seriously injured.</summary>

                    <p>A telegraphic despatch from Fortress Monroe, on Friday last, announced the
                        death of Perry A. Rice, Esq., in the Libby Prison, at Richmond. Mr. Rice, it
                        will be remembered, was captured at Mercersburg by Stewart's Cavalry, in
                        their raid through this country, and taken with them across the Potomac,
                        since which time he has been confined in the Libby Prison. His friends made
                        every effort to have him released or exchanged, but their efforts were
                        unavailing. He was kept in close confinement, even after it was evident his
                        health was giving away; and he finally was compelled to lay down his life,
                        far away from home and friends, surrounded by diabolical and inhumane
                        enemies. This case strikes us as a peculiarly hard one. We never could see
                        the end to be gained by Mr. Rice's arrest and confinement at Richmond. He
                        was a private citizen, a non-combatant, and held no official position under
                        the Federal or State Governments, and we cannot see why he might not have
                        been released or exchanged, as was the case with several others from this
                        county. Poor fellow, it was his sad fate to yield up his life in this war,
                        without any of the glory that attaches to military service. Mr. Rice was a
                        member of the Bar, and practiced law in Mercersburg. He leaves a wife and
                        young family to mourn his loss. His courteous demeanor made him many trends,
                        in and out of the profession, who will long continue to cherish his
                    memory.</p>

                    Confederate raid last fall, died in Libby Prison in Richmond. Rice was a private
                    citizen who held no political office, and his death in prison was particularly
                    cruel and unjust.</summary>
