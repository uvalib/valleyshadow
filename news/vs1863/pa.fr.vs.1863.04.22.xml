                <summary>A Democratic meeting will be held at the Court House on April 25 for the
                    purpose of establishing a Democratic club. The editors invite "all conservative
                    citizens, opposed to the unconstitutional and revolutionary projects of the
                    party in power," to attend.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Colonel McClure addressed the "Union Leaguers," on Tuesday evening last, and
                        we can not refrain from expressing the opinion that his speech was a most
                        remarkable one to be delivered by a Republican speaker at a Republican
                        meeting. He commenced by administering a powerful rebuke to his partisan
                        friends for stigmatizing as "traitors" all who disagreed with them in
                        politics. These men had gone from our midst, side by side with Republicans,
                        their blood was shed upon every battle field, their dead bodies had been
                        carried through our streets, followed by a whole community in tears and
                        sorrow. "These men are not traitors," said the Colonel, "and you know it."
                        He then spoke of the Emancipation Proclamation. He was not prepared to say
                        he would have issued it, had he been in Mr. Lincoln's position, and he now
                        declared that if it stood in the way of the restoration of the Union it
                        ought to fall that the Republic may live. The most remarkable feature of the
                        speech was that it did not endorse a single measure of the administration.
                        While the speaker concluded with the significant declaration, that he
                        considered his first duty due to his country and would follow that duty
                        though it might lead him into a different path from that in which he had
                        heretofore traveled. It is scarcely necessary to add that this portion of
                        the Colonel's speech met with no sympathy or applause from the "leaguers."</p>
                    <p>As a set-off to these sentiments, which seemed to come from his heart, but
                        which the speaker saw met with but little favor in the eyes of his
                        Republican bearers, he "tacked about" and made some very unjust flings at
                        the Democratic party, in which he not only contradicted himself but also
                        misstated facts known to the whole country. For instance, he boldly asserted
                        that Seymour, the Democratic Governor of New York, had refused to enforce
                        the last draft in his State, and that through his neglect the State of New
                        York yet owed the United States Government forty thousand men. Now, every
                        man of ordinary intelligence knows that Seymour was not Governor of New
                        York, when the last draft was called; that he was only inaugurated the
                        latter part of last January; and that it was Governor Morgan, <emph
                            rend="italic">Governor Seymour's Republican predecessor</emph>, who
                        declined to enforce the draft in New York. Colonel McClure at least must
                        know this fact; we have no hesitation in saying he did know it, and wilfully
                        misrepresented the facts of the case as he knew them to be. He also declared
                        that Democratic Governors had withheld one hundred thousand men from the
                        General Government, while he must have known that when the draft was
                        demanded there was but one Governor of the slightest Democratic
                        predilections in the loyal States--Governor Sprague of Rhode Island--and
                        that Rhode Island was the only one of the New England States which filled
                        its quota; while Governor Andrews, the Abolition Governor of Massachusetts,
                        and Governor Buckingham, the Abolition Governor of Connecticut, together
                        with the Abolition Governors of New Hampshire and Maine, have failed to fill
                        their respective quotas to this day. These are plain facts, and Colonel
                        McClure's slick sophistry utterly fails to gloss them over. The Colonel
                        declared, too, that the triumph of the Democratic party would be a verdict
                        against the Government. Why it would be so, he did not pretend to tell us,
                        nor does it appear from his previous argument. He went to a great deal of
                        trouble to prove to his republican friends that Democrats were not traitors,
                        that they were not disloyal to the Government, how then could their triumph
                        be a verdict against the Government? We have good reason to think that even
                        Colonel McClure himself does not believe the truth of this assertion.</p>
                    <p>This speech was a curiosity in its way. It was evidently a damper on the
                        enthusiasm of the "Union Leaguers," and during its delivery we heard a
                        precocious youth, in our rear, whisper "copperhead"--whether in reference to
                        the speaker or ourselves we did not enquire. But its shameful
                        inconsistencies, bold perversions of facts and illogical conclusions badly
                        become a man of Col. McClure's pretensions and standing. We have never had
                        much confidence in his political honesty, but he is a man of acute judgment
                        and extensive influence, and, in a great crisis like this, he should not be
                        on the fence in his political views. If he does not approve of several of
                        the measures of Mr. Lincoln's administration, if he sincerely believes that
                        Democrats are not traitors because they see fit to differ with this
                        administration on the constitutionality and policy of these very measures,
                        and if he thinks that the Democratic party are and have been right on these
                        issues, he should have the manliness to say so. On the decision of these
                        very questions, at the polls, depends the very existence of the Government
                        which the Colonel professes to venerate; and we only ask him, in his own
                        language, to give to these Governmental problems that same sincere
                        consideration he gives to his own affairs.</p>

                <summary>The editors attack the Transcript's frenzy over the supposed discovery of a
                    secret society of draft resisters in Berks County. In fact, say the editors,
                    these men had banded together to legally test the draft in the courts and
                    pledged money to support the legal fees of the members if one were drafted. The
                    Transcript has blown the situation far out of proportion by interpreting it as
                    part of a secret society of millions.</summary>

                <summary>Lieut. George A. Welsh of Company A, 126th Reg't Penn. Volunteers, was at
                    home on a leave of absence. He looks well and says that "the great heart of the
                    army of the Potomac still beats true to its idol, General McClellan." Bruce
                    Lambert, one of the original Anderson Troupe, has returned home, the Troupe
                    having been mustered out of service. The Spirit notes that "Army life seems to
                    have agreed with Bruce remarkably well."</summary>

                    <p>The bill legalizing the payment of bounties to volunteers has passed both
                        branches of the Legislature, and will no doubt be approved by the Governor.
                        It merely legalizes the payment of bounties and empowers County
                        Commissioners, &amp;c. to levy a tax for the liquidation thereof. These
                        bounties, it will be remembered, were voted by county, city, borough, and
                        township authorities, without warrant of law, and this act is intended to
                        sanction and legalize such appropriations.</p>

                    houses of the legislature and will undoubtedly be signed by the Governor. The
                    bill puts legal footing under the actions taken by various county, city, borough
                    and township authorities last year.</summary>

                    <p>Camp of "Tyler's Brigade," 5th Corps, <lb/>Near Fredericksburg, Va.
                        <lb/>April 13th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>At the date of my last letter, I had ample reasons for believing that another
                        movement of this army was near at hand. I need not mention those reasons
                        now; suffice it that we are still here with favoring indications that we
                        shall remain for several weeks.</p>
                    <p>Through private correspondence, the court martial case of Gen. Tyler has no
                        doubt been pretty well published through our State. For special reasons I
                        have not referred to it in this correspondence, and only do so now to
                        correct an error occurring in a notice of the case, printed in various
                        journals. It is stated in said notice that the General was acquit[t]ed of
                        every charge save one, and this was for writing an official letter to
                        Governor Curtin, and <emph rend="italic">publishing</emph> it in the
                        Harrisburg <emph rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>. It is true that General
                        Tyler did write a letter to Gov. Curtin accompanying the list of casualties
                        in our Brigade at the Fredericksburg fight. This letter was not regarded as
                        an official document by the writer, nor did he think for a moment that it
                        would ever appear in print. It was published in the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Telegraph</emph> without his knowledge or consent, and in the decision
                        of the court in the case, he was merely convicted of writing the letter,
                        which they held as a violation of an established order, <emph rend="italic"
                            >without reference to its publication</emph>. Every other charge against
                        the General was discarded by the court, as unsustained by the evidence in
                        any way or shape. The General is again in command, firmer than ever in the
                        affections of his Brigade, and ready to lead his column, when the order is
                        given, and exert his best efforts, and offer his life, if needs be, for the
                        sacred cause of his country. General Tyler is one of the heroes of this war.
                        His bravery and skill in some fifteen fights obtained the most distinguished
                        official commendation. And in his future the country may rely upon new deeds
                        of daring and bravery worthy of its cause and his own fame.</p>
                    <p>Some weeks ago this Brigade contributed a very handsome sum of money for the
                        purpose of purchasing, for presentation to Gen. Tyler, a substantial
                        testimonial of their appreciation of his services and their high regard for
                        him as a man. The matter was entrusted to a committee of gentleman who
                        performed their duty in a most creditable manner. The Philadelphia <emph
                            rend="italic">Press</emph> referring to the gifts says:</p>
                    <p>The horse intended for the General was purchased in Ohio, and is a noble
                        animal, having been purchased by its previous owner at the price of one
                        thousand dollars. The saddle and other requisite trappings made by M.R.
                        Nece, of this city, are of a character to correspond with the horse, being
                        really superb specimens of the saddlery art.</p>
                    <p>The sword and spurs are of Messrs. George W. Simmons &amp; Brother's
                        celebrated manufacture, the former being one of the richest ever got up in
                        this city. The hilt of it represents a shell; the guard is wrought in
                        festoons of laurel; the upper tip bears the arms of Pennsylvania and Ohio,
                        emblematically blended to represent the General's own State (his home being
                        Ravenna, Ohio,) and the State of the splendid brigade which he commands. The
                        lower tip bears in relief a representation of the General on horseback in a
                        charge. The crampet is a vine of laurel; the blade is richly engraved; the
                        scabbard and all the mountings being [illegible] plated with gold.</p>
                    <p>The presentation took place on Tuesday of last week, in front of the Generals
                        Head Quarters. The whole Brigade were assembled to witness it, and a fine
                        band enlivened the scene with exquisite music. Hon. John Wallace, M.C., of
                        the 24th District of your State, made the presentation speech, and was
                        eloquently replied to by the General. The event was one of deep interest,
                        and evinced the earnest feeling of friendship and esteem existing between
                        the General and his command.</p>
                    <p>Another gallant man has fallen a victim of the tragedy at Fredericksburg.
                        Captain J.K. Taylor, of the 129th Regt., P.V., our Brigade, died from wounds
                        received at Fredericksburg, in Washington, on the 31st ult.</p>
                    <p>Col. J.C. Frick and Lieut. Col. W.S. Armstrong of the 129th Regt., P.V.,
                        dismissed from the service some months ago by court martial, have been
                        re-instated by an order from the Secretary of War. They returned to the
                        Regiment on Friday and received a most enthusiastic welcome.</p>
                    <p>President Lincoln visited us last week, and made a tour of the army. He
                        reviewed five corps, or about 75000 men, on Tuesday. It was a sight that
                        almost baffl[e]s description: Certainly no similar event that has ever
                        occurred in this continent, surpassed it in splendor or brilliancy. He made
                        an inspection of the different camps, ours among the rest, accompanied by
                        General Hooker, and was very highly pleased with the neatness and
                        cleanliness displayed. The President seems to be in very poor health. He has
                        become extremely pale and emaciated, and is evidently suffering from the
                        pressing cares and labors of his position. It was noticeable, however, that
                        he still retained his vivacious spirit and was exceedingly friendly to all
                        who approached him. He was accompanied by Mrs. Lincoln and their son, "a
                        broth of a boy" who promises to be a great credit or a great trouble to his
                        distinguished parents.</p>
                    <p>The most acceptable arrival we have had for some time time [sic], was "the
                        gentleman with the greenbacks." He came into camp yesterday unheralded and
                        in the most unostentatious manner, though he has enough of funds with him to
                        pay off our whole Division for the four months ending February 28th. He pays
                        our 126th at 10 o'clock today. The friends of the boys at home may look for
                        some handsome remembrances, as I have no doubt large sums will be forwarded
                        to selected persons for distribution.</p>
                    <p>At this writing much interest is felt with regard to affairs in front of
                        Charleston. Its capture would be a God's blessing and a sure forerunner of
                        Peace. Success and glory to our gallant boys engaged in the work.</p>
                    <p>The feeling seems to be universal that the crisis of the war is near at hand,
                        and that Rebeldom is doomed. Let us work energetically, giving encouragement
                        to our patriot armies, and trusting to an All Wise Providence. The day is
                        certainly dawning, and ere long we shall witness the meridian splendor full
                        of the joys of Peace, and opening a new era of hope and blessing, of
                        happiness and prosperity. Again we will be the comforter and protector of
                        the down-trodden and oppressed, and united inseparably, we shall prove that
                        we have and are determined to preserve, for all ages, our country as the
                        Model Republic of the World.</p>
