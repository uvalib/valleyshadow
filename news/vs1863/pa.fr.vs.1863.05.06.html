<b>Remarks of Hon. Charles Ingersoll</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a speech given by Charles Ingersoll to the 15th Ward Democratic
                    Association in Philadelphia. Ingersoll spends the majority of the speech arguing
                    that Lincoln's administration, by restricting individual liberties and accruing
                    greater power to itself, violated the intent of the framers in how changes
                    should be made to the organic law that structures the government. All such
                    changes should come from the people, argues Ingersoll, not from within the
                    government itself. He believes another constitutional convention should be
                    called to reign in the Lincoln administration. Ingersoll then goes on to argue
                    that the abolitionists are the greatest disunionists and that they are the
                    people most willing to let the country be divided. If the South can be made a
                    reasonable offer by the Democrats, he concludes, there is every indication that
                    it would come back into the Union.<br>

<b>Let Us Be Honest With Ourselves</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In this editorial, the editors describe a shift in the political sentiments
                    of Franklin County, with conservative men either joining the Democratic party or
                    dropping out of party politics altogether. The editors claim that, if a
                    Democratic administration were to be elected, it would adopt a platform
                    characterized by "the union of the sword with the olive branch." The Democrats
                    would first call for a National Convention of states to see if any sort of
                    amicable resolution could be reached (as Ingersoll suggested on page 1, the
                    editors note). They would restore civil liberties, subject the military
                    authority to civilian control, rid the government of corrupt contractors, and
                    "restore the Constitution in its ancient spirit and vigor, and . . . reunite the
                    shattered and bleeding Union."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Facts brought to our knowledge, almost every week, have convinced us that
                        there is a great change taking place in the political sentiments of the
                        Franklin county. Thinking and reflecting men are beginning to feel that the
                        crisis demands intelligent action on their part; and they are pausing and
                        giving a calm and honest consideration to public affairs. They are
                        unalterably opposed to any division of the Union; they are willing to make
                        the greatest sacrifices to restore the Union and maintain the Government;
                        and yet they can see no ray of hope in the present avowed policy of the
                        party in power. That party holds out no encouragement, gives no basis upon
                        which to build for the future, embraces nothing but hatred and vengeance,
                        conquest and subjugation. Many of these men, who have been lifelong
                        opponents of the Democratic party, are coming out and declaring their belief
                        that the only hope of the country is in the success of Democratic
                        principles. We could mention numbers of them by name, but they are
                        sufficiently well known in the communities in which they reside.</p>
                    <p>There are other men, who, sick at heart and bereft of hope, disgusted at the
                        angry criminations and recriminations which characterize the political
                        discussions of this day, have resolved not to mingle with either political
                        party. In this decision they are manifestly in error. No citizen, in the
                        hour of national peril, can shirk responsibility by wrapping himself up in
                        the seclusion of his home, and saying "I will have none of the
                        responsibility clinging to my skirts." My dear sir, if wicked and injurious
                        measures triumph at the ballot box, while your vote might have defeated
                        them, you will be responsible for the result.
                        Every man has an interest in the preservation of good government; and there
                        is a corresponding duty, of which, do as he may please, he can not divest
                        himself; the obligations of civil society demand that he shall choose
                        clearly whom he will serve. If he honestly believes there is safety for the
                        country in the principles of the Republican party, let him advocate them
                        with all his ability and vote for them; but if he as honestly believes that
                        those principles are sapping the very foundations of our Government and
                        leading inevitably to anarchy or despotism, let him have the manliness to
                        say so, despite the slanders and vituperations which may be cast upon him.
                        "If the Lord be God, serve him; if Baal, then serve him." However much we
                        may differ as to principles and policy, no man has a right to say, "As for
                        me, I have no principles and policy." If he is possessed of any intellect at
                        all, the assertion must be false. He must believe some things in themselves
                        to be right, and others to be wrong; and he merely means, by this assertion,
                        that he lacks the moral courage to avow the right and denounce the wrong.</p>
                    <p>There is another and a numerous class of men who are anxiously casting about
                        the political horizon to see which way the polar needle of duty points. They
                        come to us, as advocates of the Democratic party, and ask, "What is your
                        position in reference to the war, and what do you intend to do if you get
                        into power again?" The question is honestly asked and should be as honestly
                        answered, difficult as the task may be, in the present uncertain and
                        unsettled state of events. It is impossible to read aright the horoscipe of
                        the future, and our line of policy must in a great measure depend on events
                        as they transpire; but this much we may declare, without fear of our
                        position ever becoming untenable. We have never agreed, do not now agree and
                        have no intention of agreeing in future to a dissolution of the American
                        Union, unless indeed it be to avoid some still greater calamity. We propose
                        to accomplish the preservation of the Government and the Constitution by the
                        union of the sword with the olive-branch. For those who will resist the
                        power of this Government, legally and rightfully administered, under the
                        Constitution, we have the sword. To those who are willing to submit to its
                        benign, its healthful, its peaceful sway, we will hold out the olive-branch
                        of peace. To this end we favor the calling of a National Convention, at as
                        early a day as possible, to see whether there is not yet left us some hope
                        of restoring the Union by amicable means, believing that by the sword alone
                        this end can never be accomplished. For the reason we are opposed to those
                        measures of the Administration which have thus far only had the effect of
                        dividing the loyal sentiment in the North, and more closely uniting those in
                        arms against the government at the South--holding them to be obstacles
                        thrown in the way of a restoration of the Union, rather than incentives to
                        it. If we get into power, we will restore the liberty of the press and the
                        freedom of speech, believing them to be the very bulwarks of individual
                        liberty; and we will give a still stronger guarantee to this individual
                        liberty by reestablishing the sacred privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus.
                        We will reassert the supremacy of the law, by subjecting the military to the
                        civil authority of the country, in districts where war does not exist. We
                        will stop all arbitrary arrests, believing that the acquittal of the
                        innocent and the punishment of the guilty will be more surely and speedily
                        effected by legal arrests and trials, under due process of law. We will
                        endeavor to institute a rigid system of reform, turn from their places the
                        Contractors and Government agents who have robbed the country of hundreds of
                        millions of dollars during the last two brief years; and use our best
                        vigilance to keep all such, in future, from filling places of honor and
                        profit. Should the efforts of the present Administration fail to crush the
                        rebellion, the Democratic party will, when it gets hold of the reins of
                        Government, use all power, and all the statesmanship it can muster to its
                        aid, to restore the Constitution in its ancient spirit and vigor, and to
                        reunite our shattered and bleeding Union, as it was before the reckless
                        fanaticism and uncompromising, revengeful spirit of the present day severed
                        the holy bonds which bound us in one brotherhood.</p>
                    <p>These are the views and objects which the Democratic party profess, and as a
                        pledge of their sincerity they refer to the history of the country. From the
                        formation of the Government to the present time, with the exception of a few
                        brief years, they have made the laws and controlled the policy of the
                        nation, and their shrewdest opponents can not point to a single breech of
                        faith, or a single pledge violated during that period. How, then, can they
                        be charged with insincerity now? In the every-day relations of business, you
                        do not call him a rogue who has always dealt fairly and honestly with you.
                        Apply the same rule to the political parties of the day, and when the
                        Democratic party plays false to the interests of the country, discard it,
                        denounce it, leave it, and we will go with you. But call no man a villain
                        until you have proven him such. Calling our neighbors thieves and adulterers
                        and wine-bibbers, does not make them such, but the more likely makes us
                        slanderers and defamers, liable to the judgment of the law. And when foolish
                        or wicked men talk loosely about Democrats being "traitors," "sympathizers
                        with treason" and "rebels"; they simply become violators of the law
                        themselves, and loose [sic] all claim to the title of good citizens, while
                        their poisoned shafts of slander fall harmless to the ground, short of the
                        mark they were aimed at. On this question of sincerity the Democratic party
                        stands at least as fairly as the Republican party; and the choice must be
                        made between the two. How many times during the last two years has the party
                        in power turned its back upon its plighted faith and its voluntary promises
                        to the nation? Time and space fail to enumerate; but every day's
                        congressional proceedings, every presidential proclamation and every
                        executive order, bears the damning evidence upon its very face. The
                        administration of Abraham Lincoln has not proven true to its pledges to the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Let us go one step farther and take each party at what it pretends to be and
                        promises to do. The acknowledged leaders of the Republican party tell us the
                        old Union can never be restored, and never shall be, with their consent.
                        They promise to give us a grand, consolidated government in its place, it is
                        true; but it is a government with all State lines and liberties blotted out,
                        with a standing army and a burdensome tax, with a muzzled press and a
                        stifled public opinion, full of bayonets and bastiles and provost marshals
                        in the back-ground. On the other hand the Democratic party pretend to
                        believe the old order of things can be restored, and they want leave at
                        least to attempt to give us the old Union, the Union as it was made by our
                        fathers, with all the equal rights and liberties of the States and the
                        citizens under the constitution. If they fail, we will, at the worst, be no
                        farther from the end than we are now; and the experiment is assuredly worthy
                        of a trial. The only question these honest, reflecting men in our midst have
                        to answer for themselves, is: are we in favor of an honest attempt to
                        restore the old order of things, or will we prefer to see a splendid,
                        consolidated Government, with all the gilt and trappings of royalty, erected
                        on the ruins of our once boasted Republic? When this question is
                        answered--and it should be answered speedily--they are prepared to act with
                        one or the other of the great parties into which the citizens of the country
                        have divided themselves.</p>

<b>Peace and the Democratic Party</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                        ascertained by a reconnoissance form [sic] Lowe's Balloon.</p>
                    <p>A great portion of our Falmouth batteries were engaged on Sunday with the
                        rebel batteries, firing across the river and city.</p>
                    <p>The firing both of musketry and cannon, on the right, in the direction of
                        Chancellorville was very heavy.</p>
                    <p>The enemy have been forced to fight on ground of General Hooker's choosing.</p>
                    <p>It was believed, on both wings, that Gen. Stoneman's expedition to cut the
                        railroad, between the rebels and Richmond, had proven successful--thus
                        cutting off the only path of retreat.</p>
                    <p>So confident was Gen. Hooker, at Falmouth, of success, that in conformity
                        with his orders, a force had already commenced to rebuild a bridge over the
                        Rappahannock.</p>
                    <p>The Herald has also an extra giving news up to
                        eleven o clock Sunday morning, which says, that on Saturday evening there
                        was a brilliant fire, which appeared to proceed from the burning of rebel
                        encampments below Stoneman's station.</p>
                    <p>Fredericksburg was occupied about 2 o'clock on Sunday morning by our troops.</p>
                    <p>The batteries on either side of the river commenced playing upon each other
                        about five o'clock, and the roaring of cannon was loud and prolonged.</p>

                    <p>Two Great Battles Fought! <br>The Rebels Repulsed. <br>The Killed, Wounded
                        &amp; Prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Philadelphia, May 5th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>The Washington Republican "Extra," of yesterday
                        says: "Suffice it to say that, in consequence of reported dashing operations
                        of Gen. Stoneman on the line of the Railroad to Richmond, General Lee could
                        not ingloriously flee, but was compelled to come out from behind his
                        defences and fight on Hooker's own ground selected at Chancellorsville,
                        about 10 miles South-west of Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>The battle lasted most of the day on Saturday, and continued with great
                        fierceness until 2 o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>
                    <p>At four o'clock on Sunday morning, the fight again opened, and lasted until
                        10 o'clock yesterday forenoon, when the enemy's batteries became silent, and
                        the wildest cheering commenced on the extreme right and ran along the whole
                        line.</p>
                    <p>When our informant left the prevailing opinion was that the enemy's
                        am[m]unition was exhausted, or they had been attacked by Hooker's left
                        wing--the force under Sedgwick, which crossed below Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>Another gentleman who was with our forces in Fredericksburg, says Gen.
                        Sedgwick succeeded in reaching the key to the whole line of monster rebel
                        works, Fredericksburg, before day dawned, yesterday, (Sunday,) morning.</p>
                    <p>The rebels immediately opened a most terrific fire.</p>
                    <p>At first some of the Regiments wavered at seeing their commanding officers
                        falling around them, but the skillful and dashing Col. Sharler, by his cool
                        daring and personal examples, rallied the column and led it into the rebel
                        works, carrying the key and with it the whole line of rebel works, at a
                        bayonet charge.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the principal work was carried, about 11 o'clock yesterday
                        forenoon, the whole rebel force in and about Fredericksburg made a retreat
                        out on the Plank road towards Chancellorville, in the direction of Lee's
                        main army.</p>
                    <p>The slaughter at Chancellorsville is estimated to be very large on both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Among the killed on our side is Gen. Berry of Maine.</p>
                    <p>General Howard was wounded.</p>
                    <p>We captured many large guns, ammunition stores and, up to yesterday, about
                        2,000 prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Postscript.--Our advices from the field up to noon to-day are that the
                        victory of Gen. Hooker's army is more complete than was at first supposed.
                        All that the most sanguine could hope for has been realized, though the
                        losses are very heavy.</p>

                        after a heavy fight--Templeton the rebel spy was killed and several officres

                        Warrenton Junction as being so terrific as to have thoroughly routed and
                        scattered them in every direction--I have sent in 25 prisoners of Moseby's
                        Command all of whom are wounded, the greater part of them badly--Dick Moran
                        is among the number--The loss of the enemy was very heavy in killed besides

                    <p>Washington, April 30, 1863.</p>
                    <p>From the best attainable information from persons arriving from the
                        Rappahannock it appears that some important movements took place yesterday.</p>
                    <p>There was no fighting of any importance. The force crossed at Kelly's ford.
                        Pontoon bridges were laid two and three miles below Fredericksburg, and we
                        held possession of these points last night.</p>
                    <p>The enemy formed lines of battle and planted batteries on the heights in
                        their rear, and also fired a few shots to get the range.</p>
                    <p>In crossing we lost one or two officers killed, and from thirty to forty men
                        wounded. Our men crossed first in boats and drove the enemy out of their
                        rifle pits, killed and wounded many, and took one hundred and six prisoners,
                        including several officers one of whom was Lieutenant Colonel Hammond, of
                        the sixth Louisiana. These prisoners arrived here yesterday and were sent to
                        Old Capitol prison.</p>
                    <p>Another informant says the left wing, thirty five thousand strong, crossed
                        four miles below Fredericksburg, a little below where Franklin crossed
                        previous to the first battle of Fredericksburg. They fought twelve hours,
                        drove the enemy eight miles out of their rifle pits and behind their
                        entrenchments.</p>
                    <p>The Third brigade of the First division of the First corps has suffered more
                        than any other in the fight. Our forces have captured between five and six
                        hundred prisoners, who will soon be brought to this city.</p>
                    <p>Many of these prisoners have voluntarily come over to us, having thrown away
                        their arms in small squads, and beg for food. They pick up what soldiers
                        have thrown away on the march. Other rebels, however, say they have plenty
                        to eat.</p>
                    <p>The right wing crossed at Kelly's Ford, and Gen. Stoneman's cavalry is
                        reported to be somewhere in the rear of Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>One corps remains at Falmouth as a reserve.</p>
                    <p>Operations of the Right Wing. <br>Crossing The Ford.</p>
                    <p>The onward movement of the Army of the Potomac, involving the crossing of the
                        Rappahannock in the face of the enemy, commenced on Monday, and ere you
                        receive this letter the different corps will have firmly established
                        themselves on the "sacred soil" across the river.</p>
                    <p>The movement commenced at daybreak, General Howard's corps having the advance
                        on the march, and the men did not halt until they reached Mount Holly
                        church, just one mile this side of Kelly's Ford, where General Hooker
                        intended the crossing should be made. The weather was warm for this season
                        of the year, and the men suffered somewhat in consequence but they bore up
                        manfully against the fatigue, and won golden opinions from their officers.</p>
                    <p>The Fifth corps, under General Meade, and the Twelfth, under Gen. Slocum,
                        followed by different roads, and the troops, who were in excellent spirits,
                        marched until nightfall without delay. The destination of each corps was
                        kept a profound secret among the men and officers even, and it was not until
                        they reached the spot that they were able to divine their commander's real
                        intentions. Brigadier general privates alike were in ignorance of the plan,
                        and it is even said that few of the major generals were conversant with the
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Basbeck's brigade, of the Eleventh corps, who had been guarding
                        Kelly's Ford for the last fortnight, gave the troops a hearty welcome, and
                        encouraged them with the prospect of an easy crossing in the morning. They
                        reported that but few rebels were in sight, and that there would be no
                        difficulty in laying the pontoons and proceeding on the "onward movement."</p>
                    <p>The work of laying the pontoon bridges was confided to Captain Comstock, of
                        General Hooker's staff. General Hooker was also present and superintended in
                        person the important work. The boats, which had been secreted in Marsh run,
                        which empties into the Rappahannock just below Kelly's Ford, were manned by
                        the Seventy-third Pennsylvania and the One Hundred and Fifty-fourth New York
                        Volunteers, who pushed fearlessly across the river and took possession of
                        the opposite bank. The rebel pickets made a slight show of resistance and
                        then fell back. Skirmishers were immediately thrown out, but without caming
                        [sic] up with any of the "butternuts." Subsequently the Eleventh and twelfth
                        corps passed over the bridges without accident, and at night the column
                        rested on the south bank of the river..</p>
                    <p>On Tuesday morning General Stoneman crossed over, followed by the Fifth army
                        corps, commanded by General Meade, and ere this the column is on its way to
                        the Rapidan, where a crossing is to be effected at Germania. General Hooker
                        superintended the movement in person and as he rode through the lines the
                        troops received him in the most enthusiastic manner. His headquarters were
                        at Morrisville, five or six miles from the ford, just before the movement
                        commenced. Here he made known to his corps commanders his intentions, and
                        gave them directions how to proceed when they had reached the opposite bank
                        of the river.</p>
                    <p>The destination of the army after crossing the Rapidan remains a secret,
                        except to those high in authority; dut [sic] all sorts of speculations are
                        entered into as to the commander's intentions. The weather is lovely do day,
                        and promises well for our brave boys across the river. To-morrow, or the day
                        after at the furthest you may expect to hear some important news. The troops
                        are in splendid condition, and if there is to be any fighting you may rest
                        assured they will acquit themselves with credit.</p>
                    <p>Operations on the Left Wing. <br>Activity of the Army Officers.</p>
                    <p>Colonel McQuabe, Fourteenth New York Volunteers, arrived in camp about ten
                        o'clock, having heard that preperations [sic] were being made for a
                        movement, despite the urgent entreaties of his physician to the contrary--he
                        has been suffering for some days from an attack of billious fever--he left
                        his sick bed and came to resume command of his brigade. I should state in
                        this connection that General Griffin also left a sick bed to take command of
                        his division. For the same reason Colonel Ames, finding his regiment was not
                        able to move for some time, in consequence of large numbers being sick with
                        smallpox, was anxious, if possible, to have a hand in the first fight, and
                        accordingly has offered himself and been accepted as volunteer aid on
                        General Meade's staff.</p>
                    <p>We have been joined by the three years members of the Twelfth New York, and
                        also those of the Thirteenth New York who are enlisted for three years or
                        the war. They have marched all the whole distance from their old camp since
                        morning to join us, thus showing their love for the cause.</p>
                    <p>Major Michael, of the Fourteenth New York Volunteers has been appointed
                        colonel of a new regiment being organized, and Major Gleason, of the
                        Twenty-fifth New York, lieutenant colonel. The position of major has been
                        offered to Lieutenant Yates, Acting Assistant Adjutant General of Colonel
                        McQuabe's brigade.</p>
                    <p>Crossing the River.</p>
                    <p>After my letter yesterday morning had closed, our batteries, which had opened
                        upon the rebel sharpshooters, rendered it possible to cross in the pontoon
                        boats without essential loss. The Sixth Wisconsin regiment, Col. Bragg, and
                        the Twenty fourth Michigan, Col. Morrow, crossed in pontoon boats, and on
                        reaching the opposite shore charged upon the heights, drove the
                        Sharpshooters from the rifle pits, and took a large number of prisoners
                        ninety one certain, of whom five were wounded and taken to the hospital, and
                        the remainder were sent to the headquarters of the army. The rebel loss is
                        represented to be one hundred and 67 in all, including the killed.</p>
                    <p>The Charge.</p>
                    <p>The charge upon the rifle pits was most gallantly made. The artillery fire
                        was so hot for them that they were not aware our infantry were over the
                        Rappahannock until they heard and saw them. Then their fears magnified the
                        Western boys into giants and invincible warriors, and they considered it
                        more prudent to surrender than to fight. Beyond the rifle pits, and out of
                        the range of musketry fire from there, a body of rebels, more numerous than
                        our infantry which had then crossed, fled precipitately upon the approach of
                        our boys.</p>
                    <p>Laying the Pontoons.</p>
                    <p>In five minutes after the rebel sharpshooters had been captured the Engineer
                        corps, assisted by infantry, had laid the pontoon bridges, and and [sic] the
                        first brigade of Wadsworth's division, under Col. Phelps, immediately
                        crossed the river. Afterwards the remainder of the First division went over.</p>
                    <p>The Artillery.</p>
                    <p>The artillery that opened upon the rebels was Companies B and G, First
                        Pennsylvania, commanded by Lieutenant R.B. Ricketts, and company F, First
                        Pennsylvania, under Captain Ransom, of the Fifth Regulars. Their pieces were
                        four three inch regulation guns. Captain Tafts' twenty pounder Parrett guns
                        distributed explosives from a point more to the left, and continued to
                        shower their shells during the day at intervals.</p>
                    <p>The Position.</p>
                    <p>The position of our batteries was relatively the same as the fight in
                        December, when the crossing was made by the same troops at the same point,
                        and when our artillery and infantry were complimented for their gallantry.
                        The fire from the rebel rifle pits was terribly severe upon our infantry,
                        who were utterly unprotected while they were making preparations to cross.</p>
                    <p>The Engineer Corps.</p>
                    <p>The Engineer corps laying the pontoon bridges consisted of a detachment from
                        the 50th New York regiment (Companies C and K), under command of Major
                        Beers. The losses in this corps were, fortunately, only two wounded.</p>
                    <p>The Killed and Wounded.</p>
                    <p>The Brooklyn Fourteenth, Sixth Wisconsin and Twenty-fourth Michigan lost the
                        most heavily and all their losses occurred before the river was crossed.
                        Other regiments also lost in killed and wounded. The whole number of our
                        casualties was nine killed and fifty-seven wounded. The rebel killed found
                        on the field were twelve, and their wounded, who were taken prisoner, five.
                        Others of them were killed or wounded, undoubt[e]dly. They were of the 13th
                        Georgia and 6th Louisiana ergiments [sic].</p>

                    <p>How little is now in reserve for the next battle? With what remorse will
                        every man and woman regret the indifferences of the present hour, when
                        garments and various comforts are suddenly required? Heretofore hundreds of
                        boxes were ready for shipment--now everything is lacking. The great rise in
                        the price of material is one cause of this falling off; and this should
                        render more imperative the duty of concentrating and sending through the
                        most efficient channel all the stores which our loyal women furnish.</p>
                    <p>Another cause of this falling off is in the weariness consequent upon this
                        protracted war. But in the language of the President of the Commission, "As
                        long as the men fight the women must knit and sew," and the friends at home
                        furnish means to alleviate the sorrows and wants of the camps and hospitals.
                        Whatever you may have hitherto been doing, from this time consider how you
                        can best and most surely reach the suffering soldier, where he is most
                        exposed and most forgotten. Do not delay; do not abandon your efforts after
                        a short time. You must enlist in the work for the war. It is the woman's
                        part in the patriotic struggle we are in.</p>
                    <p>The Ladies Aid Society will meet (for the present) every Tuesday afternoon,
                        at 2 o'clock, at Mrs. B.F. Need's. All who are willing to assist are
                        cordially invited.</p>

                    <p>--Rebels Massing their Troops in our Front--General Stoneman Reported as
                        Destroying the Richmond Railroad.</p>
                    <p>The following statement is derived from gentlemen who left the Rappahannock
                        on Saturday.</p>
                    <p>They confirm the statement, already published, that our army has crossed the
                        Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers with less opposition than was anticipated by
                        the most sanguine.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels massed a considerable force on their front on Thursday, and at
                        Midnight there was some artillery practice between our and the Rebel guns,
                        at long range.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the Rebels learned on Wednesday that our forces had crossed above
                        Fredericksburg, they commenced moving troops to intercept the advance, and
                        continued it all night, and the following day.</p>
                    <p>Trains were constantly running with troops from Richmond, and the enemy had
                        concentrated all their available troops around Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>The latest news from Chancellorsville, about ten miles southwest of
                        Fredericksburg, now occupied by our forces, is, that General Stoneman's
                        cavalry force had cut the railroad leading to Richmond. This is stated on
                        the assertion of a gentleman connected with the civil department of the
                        Government, who arrived at Washington on Saturday morning.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt of the fact that our army was, at last accounts in the most
                        cheerful and hopeful condition, and a congratulatory address issued by
                        General Hooker to the army on Thursday, had inspirited it with a
                        determination to succeed. The Rebels will have to fight Hooker on a battle
                        field selected by himself, or surrender.</p>
