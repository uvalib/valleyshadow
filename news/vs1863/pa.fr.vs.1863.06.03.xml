                <summary>A "large and enthusiastic meeting" of the Democratic Club was held in
                    Franklin Hall on last Saturday evening, and was better attended, claim the
                    editors, than any of the "Union League" meetings. Capt. Samuel R. McKesson and
                    John R. Orr, Esq., acted as President and Secretary. B. F. Nead, Esq., reported
                    that Franklin Hall had been secured as a regular meeting place for the club. H.
                    C. Keyser, chairman of the committee on the constitution and by-laws, read a
                    series of articles for organization which were approved. William Kennedy, Esq.,
                    introduced Congressman William H. Miller of Harrisburg, who in his speech
                    denounced the restrictions on the freedom of speech, the arrest of Vallandigham,
                    and the attempts by Republicans to equate criticism of the administration with
                    criticism of the government. Miller's speech was interrupted by hissing from
                    "several 'Union Leaguers' and a dozen boys, whom they seemed to have in charge,"
                    who were escorted out of the hall. Hon. George W. Brewer then addressed the
                    gathering.</summary>

                <summary>The flag of Company B, 126th Reg't Penn. Volunteers (from Fulton County),
                    was emblazoned with the words "Copperheads Beware" by Lieut. James Pott,
                    supposedly unbeknownst to the members of the unit. Many privates came to the
                    Fulton Democrat and told the editors they disagreed with the action. The flag
                    was then taken to the meeting of the Fulton Union League and adopted as their
                    party banner. The paper warns Democrats to be alert for "lawless violence."</summary>
