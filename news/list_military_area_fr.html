  Expresses strong support for the Union cause. "There is but one sentiment--one purpose--one determination among men of all political parties, and that is, to stand up for the Government and sustain it in all efforts to put down rebellion and re-establish the Union." Mass meeting held. Home Guards formed. Chambersburg Artillery departs. Fund established to aid families of soldiers. Union Pole raised in public Square. Light artillery unit drilling. German company formed. "Our people are aroused and there is no difficulty here in obtaining men and money to carry on the war."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.04.24.xml#04">Valley Spirit, April 24, 1861, p. 4, c. 1: "Ready, Aim, Fire."</a><br>
  Editors declare loyalty to Union. "A formidable band of traitors have broken up the Union and made war against the government. While we considered them friends we battled for their rights in the Union, but when they determine to break up the Union and array themselves as enemies against us, we are their enemies."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.05.01.xml#04">Valley Spirit, May 1, 1861, p. 4, c. 2: "The Provisions."</a><br>
  The contract for supplying provisions to the soldiers quartered in Chambersburg has been awarded to Mr. J. Allison Eyster. "There is no man in our community better qualified, or possessing greater facilities for filling this important post." The contract for supplying beef has been awarded to Messrs. Ben. and T. and A. Cook and John Ely. "These gentlemen have been killing some of the largest and finest cattle ever brought to this market to fulfill their contract."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.05.01.xml#05">Valley Spirit, May 1, 1861, p. 5, c. 1: "Soldiers' Exemption."</a><br>
  Law protects enlisted soldiers from being served papers "until thirty days after he shall have returned from duty, to his usual place of residence, or until forty days after he shall have been discharged."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.05.15.xml#01">Valley Spirit, May 15, 1861, p. 1, c. 1: "Semi-Weekly Valley Spirit."</a><br>
  The Spirit will be published twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday mornings, "in order to keep our readers advised, at the earliest day, of the important events so rapidly taking place around us. There will be no additional charge in the amount of subscriptions." Plans include a daily letter from Washington, letters from soldiers abroad, and other original matter.</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.05.15.xml#02">Valley Spirit, May 15, 1861, p. 2, c. 2: "Considerate."</a><br>
  A Pittsburgh man (formerly of Chambersburg) forwarded twenty casks of lager beer to a company at Camp Slifer. "As an evidence of how gratefully the present was received, the company have resolved to return the casks by the next train empty."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.05.18.xml#02">Valley Spirit, May 18, 1861, p. 2, c. 2: "Flag Presentation."</a><br>
  The ladies of Chambersburg presented a flag to the 7th Regiment.</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.05.18.xml#02">Valley Spirit, May 18, 1861, p. 2, c. 1: "Getting Used to It."</a><br>
  Editors report on public response to militarization of town. "Our citizens are becoming used to the novelty of the presence of a large body of military in their midst. They seem to attract but little attention, or interest, any longer and our people are settling down to their usual occupations in their quiet way as formerly."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.06.12.xml#02">Valley Spirit, June 12, 1861, p. 2, c. 1: "Something Wrong."</a><br>
  Soldiers stationed at Camp Chambers, complaining of food shortages, broke ranks and headed into town. "We do not know whether it is "red-tape," or too much Whiskey, that occasions this shameful neglect of the men, but from whatever cause it proceeds, we hope to see it remedied speedily and effectually."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.06.26.xml#02">Valley Spirit, June 26, 1861, p. 2, c. 5: "Telegraph Complete."</a><br>
  The military telegraph line from Chambersburg to Hagerstown "is now complete and in working order. The first message passed over the wire on Friday last."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.07.31.xml#02">Valley Spirit, July 31, 1861, p. 2, c. 1: "Home Again."</a><br>
  Franklin County companies welcomed home. "They have performed a good share of arduous service during their three months enlistment, but, with a few slight exceptions, all have enjoyed remarkably good health, and return to their homes in fine spirits. Quite a number of the men say that they are ready to re-enlist for three years."</p>

  <p><a href="../../news/vs1861/pa.fr.vs.1861.07.31.xml#02">Valley Spirit, July 31, 1861, p. 2, c. 3: "J. Allison Eyster."</a><br>
  Mr. Eyster has been taken prisoner by "the dastardly rebels of Virginia." Editors describe the incident "as a most wanton outrage. He was not in arms against them, or in any way connected with the army, and is too honorable man to act in the capacity of a spy. There was no charge brought against him--nothing to warrant his arrest, or to justify or palliate, in any way such an outrage on an unoffending citizen of Pennsylvania."</p>
