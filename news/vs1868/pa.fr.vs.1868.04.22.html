<b>Impeachment</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that the counsel for President Johnson has rested its
                    case. The editors refuse to speculate, but reiterate their conviction that
                    Johnson has done nothing to warrant conviction. The paper claims that the public
                    is much troubled and worried by the suspense.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Pompey Smash--X--His Mark</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper ridicules the African Americans who participated in the Virginia
                    Constitutional Convention. The editors assert that only the president and
                    secretary of the convention had to sign the document because "very few of the
                    niggers who helped to make that instrument were able to sign it, because very
                    few of them knew how to write their names."<br>

<b>Getting Scared</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper asserts that the Radicals fear the outcome of the impeachment
                    trial.<br>

<b>Sambo Puts Down his Heel</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A racist article on General Schofield's supposed preferable treatment
                    towards blacks over whites in Virginia. Tells about the Virginia Convention,
                    Schofield's recommendation against an iron clad oath, and his inactivity after
                    the Convention passes an iron clad oath. Also tells the tale of Dan Rice's
                    "Sacred Cow" as a metaphor for the situation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gen. Schofield can do pretty much as he pleases with the white men of
                        "District Number One," formerly known as Virginia, but he can't make headway
                        against the niggers. He says to Gov. Pierpoint, "go, and he goeth;" but when
                        he says the same thing to a nigger, the "American citizen of African
                        descent" puts down his heel and refuses to move a peg.</p>
                    <p>The General addressed the Virginia Convention on Friday last in opposition to
                        the "iron clad oath." He said his experience had taught him that it would be
                        impossible to carry on the State Government with such a test, and he thought
                        that as a party measure it would be fatal to the new Constitution. When he
                        left the Convention, an effort was made to reconsider the oath, but this was
                        refused by a vote of 32 against 26.</p>
                    <p>If this were a body of white men, we have no doubt that Gen. Schofield would
                        send a squad of soldiers into the hall in which it sits and disperse it for
                        venturing to disregard his wishes. But Sambo, like Dan Rice's "Sacred Cow,"
                        is altogether too sacred or too dangerous an animal to be trifled with. The
                        "Sacred Cow," it will be remembered, deeming her sacred character insulted
                        by something that Dan did or said on one occasion, elevated her tail and
                        lowered her horns, and then quickly reversing the position of both, tossed
                        Dan out of the ring, doing considerable damage to his "tights."--If Gen.
                        Schofield should undertake to treat this Convention as he treated the white
                        Governor, Sambo would butt him out of "District
                        Number One" before the sun had time to go down on his wrath.</p>

<b>A Rail Road Meeting</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A meeting will be held to discuss connecting Chambersburg and Waynesboro by
                    rail. The paper urges all businessmen to attend, and stresses the importance of
                    securing Chambersburg as the hub. "The section of country which it is proposed
                    to thus open for our benefit is exceedingly fertile and productive. It is the
                    richest portion of our country." Failure would risk cutting Chambersburg off

                    <p>Court is still in session, Judge Rowe presiding since Wednesday last, owing
                        to the absence of Judge King, who is expected to resume his seat on the
                        Bench to-day. The following cases have been disposed of since our last
                        report:</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Irving McDowell. Disturbing Singing School. Daniel Raffensberger

                        Verdict Not Guilty. Stenger for Com; Duncan for Def't. The Dist. Att'y asked

                        another bill found by the Grand Jury, charging him with having a large
                        quantity of counterfeit money in his possession with intent to pass the
                        same. In default of $600 bail, the Defendant was recommitted.</p>
                    <p>Com. vs. Isaac Wright. The indictment contains three counts--the first
                        charging Def't with setting fire to a Stable on the "Poor House Farm"--the
                        second with attempting to set fire to said
                        Stable--the third with setting fire to a wood-pile on the same premises.
                        Verdict Not Guilty on all three counts, but Guilty of an attempt to set fire to the wood pile. Sentenced 6 months to
