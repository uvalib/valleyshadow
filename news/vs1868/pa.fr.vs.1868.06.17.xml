                    <p>In his letter of acceptance, General Grant says that "a purely administrative
                        officer should always be left free to execute the will of the people. I have
                        always respected that will, and always shall."</p>
                    <p>As the Radical party interprets this announcement, it means that if General
                        Grant should be elected President, he would be willing to make himself a
                        mere machine to carry out the wishes of a majority of Congress. This
                        announcement by the General, doubtless grown out of the conflict which
                        exists between Congress and the present Chief Executive. Grant evidently
                        regards Congress as the representatives of the people, and as such
                        commissioned to dictate to the President the line of policy which he is in
                        duty bound to pursue. Even if Congress should see fit to pass an act
                        palpably unconstitutional, he would hold himself bound to execute it. He
                        would be willing to surrender all the rights and prerogatives of the
                        Executive office at the bidding of the Legislative Department. If, for
                        instance, Congress should strip the President of the pardoning power, which
                        is expressly vested in him by the Constitution, the humiliating spectacle
                        would be presented to the American people of their Chief Magistrate tamely
                        acquiescing in the outrage, and alleging as the reason for such conduct,
                        that <emph rend="italic">it was the will of the people as expressed through
                            their representatives</emph>. In this manner, all the dearly bought
                        rights of the American people, so solemnly guaranteed to them in the written
                        Constitution, would be held only by the audience of the American Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party has always been distinguished for its respect for the
                        will of the people. It is the party of the people. But it holds that for the
                        security of all governments, and especially those of the republican form, it
                        is necessary that the rules for its proper administration should be clearly
                        laid down and rigidly enforced. It regards a written Constitution as
                        essential in the safety and security of the Republic. The American people,
                        through delegates elected for that express purpose, embodied their will in
                        relation to the government of this nation in the Constitution of the United
                        States. That Constitution was submitted to the States for ratification, and
                        was by them adopted. It is therefore the supreme law of the land because it
                        is the will of the American people. The Democratic party asks of its
                        candidates that he shall swear "to preserve, protect and defend" that
                        Constitution from all assaults come from what quarter they may. And it will
                        insist upon him standing fire against all infringements or violations of the
                        rights of the American people as guaranteed to them in that instrument. It
                        wants no man in the Presidential chair who will be driven hither and thither
                        by "every wind of doctrine." The constitution is to be the only guide of the
                        President. Acts passed in conformity to it, which admit of different
                        constructions, it is his duty to bring to the test of judicial authority.
                        But acts passed by Congress which are glaringly antagonistic to the letter
                        of the constitution, he must have the independence to refuse to execute. The
                        nation desires no man in the Presidential chair who will submit to
                        infractions of the Constitution upon the ground that they are committed by
                        the representatives of the people. For after all, the representatives of the
                        people are held to strict account by their constituents, and their conduct
                        is judged of by the light of that very Constitution. It is impossible for
                        the Radical party to destroy that love and regard for the Constitution which
                        are so characteristic of the American people. The masses believe that the
                        liberty of the citizen can only be maintained by preserving and defending
                        the Constitution, and they are right in that belief. Let General Grant say
                        that "a purely administrative officer should always be left free to execute
                        the will of the people" <emph rend="italic">as embodied in the Constitution
                            of the United States</emph>, and he will thus administer a just and
                        well-merited rebuke to the present fanatical Congress which has been so
                        happily foiled in its efforts to rob the present Chief Executive of his
                        position as defender of the American Constitution because of his steadfast
                        adherence to its letter and spirit. We advise him to study the following
                        words from our Copperhead Fathers:</p>
                    <p>The constitution, which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and
                        authentic act of the whole people, is <unclear>sacredly</unclear> obligatory
                        upon all.--George Washington.</p>
                    <p>I have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support
                        the constitution. I have acquired an habitual attachment to it, and
                        veneration of it.--John Adams.</p>
                    <p>The preservation of the General Government, in its whole constitutional
                        vigor, is the sheet anchor of peace at home and safety abroad.--Thomas
                        Jefferson.</p>
                    <p>To hold the Union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness; to
                        support the constitution which is the cement of the Union, as well in its
                        limitations as in its authorities.--James Madison.</p>
                    <p>By what means shall we contribute most to cement the Union and give the
                        greatest support to our most excellent constitution?--James Monroe.</p>
                    <p>In unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which I shall be governed in
                        the fulfillment of those duties, my first resort will be the Constitution
                        which I shall swear to the best of my ability, to preserve, protect and
                        defend.--John Quincy Adams.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution is a sacred instrument, which should be guarded with
                        sleepless vigilance.--Andrew Jackson.</p>
                    <p>I shall endeavor to preserve, protect and defend it, by anxiously referring
                        to its provisions for direction in every action.--Martin Van Buren.</p>
                    <p>Our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the
                        constitution clothes them.--Wm. H. Harrison.</p>
                    <p>My earnest prayer shall constantly be addressed to the all wise and all
                        powerful Being who made me understandingly to act the principles of that
                        constitution..--John Tyler.</p>
                    <p>The constitution itself plainly written as it is, the safeguard of our
                        federal compact, the offspring of concession and compromise, binding
                        together in the bonds of peace and union this great and increasing family of
                        free and independent States, will be the chart by which I shall be
                        directed.--James K. Polk.</p>
                    <p>My guide will be the constitution. For the interpretation of that instrument
                        I shall look to the decision of the judicial tribunal established by its
                        authority.--Zachary Taylor.</p>
                    <p>The constitution will be my guide. I regard all its provisions as equally
                        binding.--Millard Fillmore.</p>
                    <p>Which was the President bound to obey?--a political platform, or the
                        Constitution as expounded afterwards by the Supreme Court? the decree of a
                        nominating convention, or the supreme law of the land? He could not hesitate
                        in the choice under his oath faithfully and to the best of his ability "to
                        preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." Sad
                        must be the condition of any country where an appeal can be taken from
                        judicial decisions to excited popular
                        elections!.......................Anarchy and confusion must be the
                        inevitable consequence. Public and private rights are sacrificed to the
                        madness of the hour. The Government itself becomes helpless for their
                        protection, and to avoid such evils history has taught us that the people
                        will at last seek refuge in the arms of despotism.--James Buchanan.</p>

                <summary>The paper reports that the new Young Men's Christian Association is
                    succeeding beyond expectations. "The establishing of a moral power in the
                    community whose influence may save many young men from seeking the haunts of
                    vice, and from treading the paths that go down to 'Death and Hell,' and keep
                    them for society, for their country and for God, certainly cannot fail of the
                    sympathy and aid of every christian heart." The organization also hopes to open
                    a free reading room and library.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>There will be a festival held in Repository Hall, on Wednesday and Thursday
                        evenings of this week. The proceeds of this Festival are to be devoted to
                        the building of a monument to the memory of every soldier of Franklin
                        county, who fell in the service of his country. This praiseworthy and
                        patriotic duty has been undertaken by our town ladies, and judging from the
                        energy displayed by them during the war, in raising funds for the benefit of
                        our sick and wounded soldiers, we opine the monument will be an entire
                        success.--This is a matter which concerns all parts of our county, and every
                        citizen should respond to the call of those having the affair in charge.
                        Contributions of money, or anything that can be converted into money, will
                        be thankfully received.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting held in the Lutheran Lecture Room, on the 4th inst., an
                        organization of those engaged in this good work was effected by the election
                        of the following officers:</p>

                    <p>The Managers met on the 8th inst., at the house of Mr. Jacob L. Dechert, when
                        the following young ladies were appointed a committee to solicit

                        that the managers are encouraged to hope their undertaking will be entirely
                        successful.</p>

                    <p>The Convention to select delegates to the Soldiers' and Sailor's National
                        Convention to be held in the City of New York on the 4th day of July next,
                        assembled in the Court House to-day(Tuesday) at 9 o'clock, A.M. The
                        Citizens' Band proceeded to the depot between eight and nine o'clock to meet
                        the delegation from Waynesboro and Greenscastle and escort them to the place
                        of meeting. This delegation was accompanied by the Greencastle Band. Both
                        bands entertained the Convention during its sessions with most excellent
                        music. The attendance at the Convention was large and the proceedings were
                        marked by the utmost enthusiasm and harmony.</p>
                    <p>Immediately upon assembling, on motion of Capt. Geo. W. Skinner, the
                        following officers were chosen: President; Lt. Col. B.F. Winger; Vice
                        Presidents, Private George Pugh and Capt. A.J. Brand; Secretaries, Capt.
                        J.B. Burk and Private Milton A. Embick. On taking the Chair Col. Winger made
                        a brief address, stating the objects for which the Convention had been
                        called.</p>
                    <p>The following Committees were then appointed: On Resolutions--Capt. Geo. W.
                        Skinner, Lieut. M.D. Reymer, Sergt. Frank Donavan.</p>
                    <p>On Permanent Organization--Lieutenant George W. Welsh, Sergt. J.L.P. Detrich,
                        Private Geo. T. Cole. The Convention then took a recess until one o'clock,
                        P.M.</p>
                    <p>The Convention reassembled at 1 o'clock. The Committee on resolutions
                        reported the following which were adopted:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>: That as soldiers we enlisted to crush
                        rebellion, to maintain the national honor untarnished and to preserve the
                        Union of the States, and these objects having been accomplished, it is our
                        opinion that the war upon the South ought to cease.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>: That the safety of this Government lies
                        in the recognition of the fact that the Constitution of the United States is
                        the supreme law of the land; that the reconstruction policy, inaugurated and
                        sought to be carried out by Radical Congresses, is inimical to the spirit of
                        that Constitution, and that we cannot give our support to any man, however
                        distinguished, who declares his purpose to adopt that policy as his own.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>:That Military governments in time of
                        peace are dangerous to a republic, and that we are unalterably opposed to
                        the despotism established and maintained in the South by military power as
                        being needlessly oppressive to the people of that section and utterly
                        subversive of the rights and liberties of American citizens.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>: That we regard with abhorrence the
                        declaration of the Radical Convention recently assembled in Chicago, that it
                        is the intention of the Radical party to maintain the negro in the exercise
                        of the right of suffrage in the South, knowing well that this is but a
                        preliminary step toward the extension of the same right, by Act of Congress,
                        to the negro of the North; that whilst engaged in the contest for the
                        preservation of the Union, the white soldiers proved their superiority to
                        the negro on many a bloody battlefield, and they are unwilling now to admit
                        him to an equality with them in matters pertaining to the administration of
                        the government.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>: That whilst the delegates elected by
                        this Convention to the Soldiers' and Sailors' National Convention, to be
                        held in the City of New York, on the 4th day of July next, are expected and
                        earnestly instructed to labor for the nomination of some able and
                        distinguished soldier as the Conservative candidate for the office of Chief
                        Magistrate of the nation; yet we have no hesitation in expressing our
                        conviction that the interests of the patriotic soldiers of the country can
                        safely be committed to the National Democratic Convention which is to
                        assemble in the same place on the same day, and we hereby express our hope
                        that, should that Convention deem it expedient to nominate a soldier for
                        that position, the Convention, to which the delegates chosen here are
                        accredited, will ratify the nomination made by that Convention of some
                        civilian, distinguished for his integrity and statesmanship, who can bring
                        back to this nation the peace and prosperity which were ours before the late
                        unhappy war.</p>
                    <p>At our time of going to press this afternoon, the Convention is still in
                        session and we are obliged to defer the publication of the remainder of the
                        proceedings until our next issue.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In pursuance of a call, as announced in these columns, there was a large
                        assemblage of our citizens and soldiers in the Court House on Thursday
                        evening last. The Citizen's Band was present and entertained the audience
                        with some well executed national airs--such as many of those present were
                        accustomed to hear on the "tented field," and in the deadly strife and tug
                        of war. Once more the gallant survivors of many a hard fought battle field
                        met side by side, and they who shared the fight mean to share the peace they
                        helped to make.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was organized by calling Dr. R. Rush Senseny to the chair, and
                        Thomas Donavan as Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Dr., to the great delight of all present, in stating the objects of the
                        Meeting, delivered a brief, eloquent, earnest and highly appropriate speech,
                        in very fine style, and was loudly applauded by the audience, showing their
                        high appreciation thereby.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Geo. W. Skinner, being called upon, delivered in a clear, forcible and
                        earnest style, a speech of some length, in which he hurled back the slander,
                        so oft repeated, that there were no Democratic or conservative soldiers in
                            <sic>the the</sic> late war.</p>
                    <p>The speaker then pointed to the honored graves of our dead soldiers, on a
                        hundred battle-fields and in a hundred grave-yards and cemeteries, to prove
                        the fact that there were thousands, aye! hundreds of thousands of democratic
                        soldiers in the late war, who proved their devotion to their country and
                        sealed it with their blood.</p>
                    <p>The soldiers present this night, he said were living witnesses also to the
                        fact that Franklin county did send out some democratic soldiers; and many
                        obscure mounds, and many a marble monument on Southern soil shows that many
                        never returned. This slander was refuted with some warmth by the Captain,
                        and justly--for, as he says, it is a base and cowardly attempt of the
                        Radicals to rob the honored braves of the blood-bought glory they now so
                        richly merit. The Captain in vindicating the brave defenders of our national
                        honor from this defamation, did it in a scholar-like and soldierly manner.</p>
                    <p>The issues involved in the present crisis of our country were dwelt upon, and
                        clearly presented by the orator, and he demonstrated that the soldiers who
                        fought for union and peace abroad, from a sense of duty, have the same duty
                        still resting upon them to fight for the same ends at home--then with
                        bayonets, now with ballots. He clearly defined what was the position of the
                        Radical party in the reconstruction policy, by which, in times of peace,
                        they have established a military despotism in violation of the constitution.
                        That to-day, in this land, we have a despotism, more galling and absolute
                        than was ever set up in the old world by the boldest tyrants that ever
                        cursed or oppressed a people. We are, of course, unable in a brief notice to
                        do the speech of the Captain anything like justice.</p>
                    <p>The Captain during the delivery of his remarks, was frequently, loudly and
                        enthusiastically applauded by the audience, who heard him with much pleasure
                        for the first time in this town.</p>
                    <p>The organization of the Club was effected, and about sixty-seven names were
                        appended to the list. The list has since swelled to over one hundred. The
                        meeting was more numerously attended by citizens and soldiers than was
                        anticipated by the movers; and the interest manifested by the soldiers
                        present, and the enthusiasm shown, were highly gratifying to all who love
                        their country and their country's good.</p>
                    <p>There are still more soldiers who desire to join the Club. They are requested
                        to report themselves to one of the officers who will take measures
                        immediately to introduce them into full membership. The soldiers of this
                        "neck of woods" didn't fight to make negroes their equals, or to establish
                        military governments over any portion of the Union. All such are earnestly
                        requested to join.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>For several days prior to Saturday last, bills were posted upon our street
                        corners and at all public places about town, announcing the fact that a
                        meeting would be held in the Court House on that (Saturday) evening for the
                        purpose of organizing a Grant and Colfax Club. It was confidently expected
                        that the soldiers, sailors and citizens who sympathize with the Radical
                        party would easily fill the Court-room. But the whole crowd that could be
                        assembled, under the pressure of a vigorous and frequent ringing of the
                        Court-House bell, numbered <emph rend="italic">thirty-six</emph> persons,
                        and they were a seedy and motley assemblage. And, cut of all the Attorneys
                        at the Bar who vote the Radical ticket, not one was on hand to address this
                        small and lifeless audience. Out of six hundred Radical voters in the
                        Borough of Chambersburg, thirty-six were willing to join a Grant and Colfax
                        club. There is something "rotten in Denmark." Conservative men are shrinking
                        back from the precipice over which they are invited to plunge.
                        Negro-equality and military power have no charms for them. They see in these
                        doctrines the seeds of death to the Republic. This accounts for the lack of
                        interest and want of enthusiasm in the Radical ranks. Meanwhile, the
                        Democracy are hanging their banner on the outer walls and the cry is still,
                        "they come."</p>
