<b>Why Seymour Was Nominated</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises the choice of Horatio Seymour as the Democratic nominee. Denounces
                    the Republican policies while pumping up the virtues of the conservative
                    Democratic policies and values. Explains why Seymour is the perfect symbol of
                    the Democratic party and predicts his ultimate triumph.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The man who went to the Democratic National Convention at New York, went
                        there to give expression to the principles which have found a judgment again
                        in the hearts of the American people. The wild passions engendered by the
                        war have subsided. The sober second thought has come once more. Boston has
                        resumed her way. Love for our old constitution is being again manifested.
                        Everywhere there is welling up from the popular heart an earnest desire to
                        be rid of the extravagance, corruption and oppression which have
                        characterized the rule of the Radical party. Conservative men--no matter by
                        what political tie bound heretofore--have been anxiously looking for some
                        way of escape from this body of death to which Radicalism has bound the
                        nation. With alarm they have seen innovations upon our old customs, against
                        which our forefathers especially warned us. They have witnessed the
                        ascendency of doctrines which, if incorporated into our government, must
                        give the death blow to free institutions in America. They have gazed upon
                        the spectacle of sovereign States oppressed by the most arbitrary military
                        governments the world has ever seen. The elective franchise has been the
                        mere plaything of tyrants in epaulettes. In direct violation of the
                        Constitution, Congress has forced negro-suffrage upon the States of the
                        South and protected the negro with the bayonet in the exercise of this
                        illegally conferred privilege. The grossest abuses of this power have
                        already been practiced. Under the guardian care of the troops stationed at
                        the ballot box, the most flagrant outrages upon white men have been
                        committed. By means of the most gigantic frauds, Radical defeats have been
                        turned into victories. Double-breasted ballot boxes have been manufactured
                        to order and stuffed with Radical tickets. Elections in the South have thus
                        become a perfect farce. And yet all this unconstitutional, iniquitous
                        conduct has been solemnly encouraged and approved by the American Radical
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the treasury of the country has been drained, and the taxation
                        upon the people increased in order to furnish the means to carry on these
                        high-handed proceedings.</p>
                    <p>Against all this, the Conservative sentiment of the country has been rising
                        in its strength. It demanded an open, bold and distinct enunciation of
                        principles directly hostile to those of the Radical party. It required, too,
                        the nomination of a man not only possessed of sufficient intellect to grasp
                        and comprehend the great questions at issue and to point out the way of
                        escape for the nation from the perils which environ it, but one also whose
                        past record would be a sure guarantee of his devotion to the constitution
                        and the Union of the sovereign States.</p>
                    <p>The Convention met in a spirit of perfect harmony. It was an assemblage of
                        the best men of the nation, convened for no selfish purposes, to do honor to
                        no particular man, to advance the interests of no particular action. They
                        came together, each with his personal preference, but willing to yield to
                        the will of the majority. And when it seemed to the Convention that no one
                        of the distinguished gentlemen whose names were before it, was possessed of
                        that commanding strength which was likely to insure a nomination entirely
                        satisfactory to the conservative elements of the country, in a moment it
                        abandoned them all, and turning its eye upon the greatest and best of living
                        statesmen, with entire unanimity laid its nomination, unsolicited, unsought,
                        positively refused, at his feet. With an enthusiasm spontaneous and
                        universal, and expressive of the deliberate judgment of the Convention,
                        Horatio Seymour was designated as the standard-bearer of the great
                        conservative hosts, now gathering for a contest in which victory is to crown
                        their efforts. Why was it? First: Because he is confessedly the
                        representative man of the Democratic party--a man whose devotion to the
                        Constitution began with his early years and has continued down to the
                        present hour--a man who believes in a strict construction of that
                        Constitution, and who is opposed to the exercise of any power by any one of
                        the Departments of the Federal Government that is not expressly granted to
                        it by that instrument--a man who looks with horror upon the encroachments
                        which Radicalism has made upon the rights of the States--a man who believes
                        that the question of suffrage belongs to the people of the several States,
                        North and South--a man whose belief in the strength of the Union is so
                        strong that he can not be induced to assent to the new-born Radical
                        doctrine, that the States which attempted to secede did actually sever their
                        relations to the Union--a man who will not agree to tarnish the faith and
                        honor of the nation by now pursuing a policy in regard to those States
                        different from that so solemnly announced by Congress during the progress of
                        the war--a man who is opposed to military governments in time of peace, and
                        who entertains a most decided hostility to such money-draining institutions
                        as the Freedmen's Bureau--a man who is unwilling to degrade the Anglo-Saxon
                        race by permitting negroes to take possession of, and rule the Southern
                        States now, and afterwards to attempt the same thing in the north--a man who
                        is in favor of reducing the National expenses in every possible way, so that
                        the money realized from our onerous taxes may be appropriated to the
                        liquidation of our National debt. Horatio Seymour is unquestionably a true
                        exponent of the principles of the Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>Secondly: Because he is a man of universally acknowledged ability. He is
                        possessed of that breadth of intellect which enables him to grasp the most
                        abstruse questions of political economy. And then, too, he has a most
                        wonderful faculty of making his thoughts clear to everybody. He ranks
                        highest among living statesmen. His political opponents will not presume to
                        deny his intellectual qualifications for the position of President.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly: He is a man of stainless character. His life has been a pure one. No
                        taint of corruption is upon him. No suspicion of dishonesty attaches to his
                        name. Possessed of that dignity and purity of character which have made his
                        name a synonym for virtue, the Democracy will not be hampered in the
                        campaign by the necessity of defending their own candidate when their time
                        should be occupied in assailing the weak points of the Radical
                        standard-bearer.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly: He is a man of nerve. He is as fearless as he is pure. With his
                        feet upon the path of right and duty, there need be no fear that he will
                        turn back, or halt by the wayside. He is possessed of that force of
                        character which finishes what it undertakes. He will bring back to this
                        Government something of its former prosperity. Under his guiding hand,
                        despotism, wherever established in this country, will be stricken down. The
                        military will be made subordinate to the civil power, as our fathers
                        intended it to be. The constitution will be preserved, protected and
                        defended in accordance with the oath which Horatio Seymour will take.</p>
                    <p>A candidate uniting within himself these admirable and requisite
                        qualifications must command himself to the people. They will see for
                        themselves the striking contrast between him and General Grant. They will
                        cast behind them the dead issue of the present hour, and rushing forward to
                        rescue the country from the dangers into which Radicalism has plunged it,
                        they will rally around the Democratic banner and cast their vote for Horatio
                        Seymour.</p>

<b>Why Grant Was Nominated</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Says Grant was nominated only because of his stature as a popular general
                    and not because of any intellectual or moral qualities. Belittles Grant's record
                    in the Civil War. Also wonders why the Republicans passed over men who helped
                    build up the party in favor of a man Democrats consider mediocre at best. Ends
                    by explaining why Grant will never receive support from different interest
                    groups.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The men who went to Chicago, went there for the purpose of registering the
                        sentiment of their constituents that General Grant was the only man who
                        could possibly keep the Radical party from falling to pieces. The public
                        sentiment which made Grant's nomination a certainty before the Convention
                        met, did not spring from admiration of any particular qualifications which
                        he possesses. They claimed for him no strength of mind to grasp in a
                        statesmanlike manner the great questions that are pressing upon us for
                        solution. They were not dazzled by the brilliant light of an excellent moral
                        character, for the testimony of the great lights of the Radical party is
                        that Grant is a common drunkard who "can not stand up before a glass of
                        whisky without falling down." They were not induced to nominate him by any
                        hold which he has upon the popular heart, because it is everywhere admitted
                        that during the time he led our armies in the field, he never troubled
                        himself about the wants or sufferings of his men, and that during the
                        sanguinary conflicts in which they engaged, he hurled them into the thickest
                        of the fight without caring how many of them went down to a bloody death.
                        His name never drew forth the plaudits of his soldiery.--There was not
                        strong attachment to his person bordering on idolatry. His men regarded him
                        as cold and selfish and ambitious. Such a man, therefore, could not be
                        expected to draw to him the support of the millions on account of any love
                        which they bore to him. The Radical leaders knew this well when they made
                        him their standard-bearer. They know it now. But the idea which secured his
                        nomination was this. General Grant was the commander of the Army of the
                        Potomac when General Lee surrendered.--He could therefore be presented to
                        the country as the Great Rebellion Crusher. This fact of itself would elect
                        him. And behind this, stood the other prevailing opinion that if Grant could
                        not be elected, nobody else could. The intellectual men of the party were
                        therefore compelled to stand back and give place to this mediocre General,
                        who, under the influence of a lucky star, stumbled into notoriety, and who,
                        puffed up with the credit of military successes which were achieved by men
                        whose names are not so well known to fame, now presumes to give lessons in
                        statesmanship. The utter rottenness of the Radical party compelled Grant's
                        nomination.</p>
                    <p>It was a sore trial for the old leaders of the party to surrender their
                        claims to this aspirant for Presidential honors. Ever since the organization
                        of the Republican party, some of them have been laboring for its success
                        with the hope that when victory perched upon its banners, they would be
                        rewarded with the first honor within the gift of the people. They have borne
                        the brunt of many a hard political fight. They have, time and again, rallied
                        the despondent rank and file and led them on to victory.--Whilst General
                        Grant was a common bar-room loafer engaged in the delightful pastime of
                        sucking whisky and voting the Democratic ticket, these men were busily
                        engaged in devising ways and means to insure the success of the Republican
                        party then struggling into life. Some of them are possessed of strong
                        intellect and good moral character. By constant study and earnest inquiry,
                        they have been fitting themselves to fill the highest places in the land. By
                        rigid discipline they have subjected their passions and appetites to their
                        control so as to win the admiration of their countrymen for sobriety and
                        virtue. And yet, so far from being rewarded by their party in the manner
                        longed for, they find that they have been wasting time, money and brains.</p>
                    <p>Expediency has stood in the way of merit. All the sterling qualities which
                        fit men to sit in high places have been set aside to give place to
                        availability. What a sorry compliment to the common sense of the American
                        people! We feel sure that the Radical Convention underrated the intelligence
                        of the nation. The masses do not desire a political blockhead in the
                        Presidential chair. They are not prepared to vote for a man whose only
                        recommendation is that he lost more men in inducing Lee to surrender than
                        Lee had in his whole army, and who is, confessedly, disqualified
                        intellectually to administer our National Government. No enthusiasm has
                        followed his nomination. The extreme Radicals will not allow themselves to
                        become excited over a man who never voted a Radical ticket in his life. The
                        temperance men will not support a man who scarcely ever draws a sober
                        breath. The whiskey men will not support him because he is the candidate of
                        a party which has taxed the popular beverage beyond all reason. The
                        Anti-tobacco men can not rally around him because he never appears in
                        company without puffing his cigar. The negro-lovers will not run wild about
                        him because when negro-suffrage is mentioned he talks nothing but horse. And
                        lastly, all honest men will not support him, because Bennett, of the New
                        York Herald, is fishing for some substantial
                        reason why he should lend him his influence.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper suggests that Republican policy will result in African Americans
                    serving in Congress. "If the Republican party advances as rapidly on the negro
                    question in the next five years as it has advances in the last five, there will
                    be a heavy rise in the price of cork. A black face will be 'the height of
                    fashion,' and all fashionably-disposed Republicans who are afflicted with white
                    faces will betake themselves to burnt cork."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>DEMOCRATIC STATE COMMITTEE ROOMS,<br> CLEARFIELD, PA., JULY 14, 1868.</p>
                    <p>
                        To the People of Pennsylvania:
                    </p>
                    <p>The political contest just entered into is laden with grave results to your
                        business and to yourselves.</p>
                    <p>The Radical party asks a renewal of its power and a continuance of its
                        misrule.</p>
                    <p>Defeated in every recent election, it now disguises its principles, and
                        trusts for success to the military prestige of an available candidate.</p>
                    <p>It offers to Grant the shadow of power, as a price of securing the reality to
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Its success will bring you continued misgovernment by a Radical Congress, the
                        control of every department of the government by Radical domination, and the
                        perpetuation of its iniquities, its extravagance, its elevation of the
                        negro, and its prostration of your business interests.</p>
                    <p>It came into existence to benefit the negro; its devotion to his interests
                        gave us four years of war, grinding taxation and three thousand millions of
                        debt; its determination to place the negro over the white man has for more
                        than three years kept society shattered, commerce paralyzed, industry
                        prostrated, the national credit below par, and the Union divided.</p>
                    <p>It has governed us for near eight years; the history of its first
                        administration is written in four years of blood and recorded in an enormous
                        national debt; the history of its second administration is near four years
                        of peace, with absolute power, and a Union not restored, a government of the
                        sword, business destroyed, taxation crushing the energies of the people, and
                        the negro vested with the balance of power.</p>
                    <p>Its end and aim is the preservation of Radical power through the vote of
                        negroes, and to this will be sacrificed your material interests, and, if
                        necessary, your personal rights and your form of government.</p>
                    <p>Military rule oppresses the nation and eats out the substance of the people.
                        It is fit that Grant should lead the party that maintains that rule, for his
                        laurels were gathered by the sword alone.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party, placing itself upon the Constitution, pledges itself to
                        strict obedience thereto, to the maintenance of the government created
                        thereby, to the supremacy of law, to a reform of abuses, to economy in
                        administration, to equal taxation, and to justice to all.</p>
                    <p>It antagonizes and denounces that infamous policy which, during more than
                        three years of peace, has overtaxed the people, has governed by the sword,
                        and has destroyed the credit of the nation.</p>
                    <p>Its policy is one of thoughtful foresight, of cautious statesmanship; it
                        seeks no new path; but by the line of the written law, in the light of
                        experience, it will guide the Republic back to the highway of progress and
                        prosperity and will restore it to national credit and fame.</p>
                    <p>It presents to you with pride its candidate for the Presidency: Horatio
                        Seymour, of New York, a statesman and an honest man. Capable and pure,
                        possessed of large experiences and gifted with the rarest qualities of the
                        head and of the heart, strong in intellect, sound in judgment and prompt in
                        action, none more competent to lead us back to the haven of law and order.</p>
                    <p>Pennsylvania owes him a debt of gratitude for his prompt aid when her border
                        was attacked.</p>
                    <p>The issues are before you: they are,</p>
                    <p>The statesman against the soldier; intellect against force; the law against
                        the sword.</p>
                    <p>It is for you to determine which of these will best suit our present unhappy
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>By order of the Dem. State Committee.<br> WILLIAM A. WALLACE, Chairman.</p>
                <br>
