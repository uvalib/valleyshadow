                <transcript>
                    <p>During our late war, whenever a signal victory was won, it was the custom of
                        Congress to pass a resolution embodying a vote of thanks to the commander of
                        the triumphant forces. This action was doubtless based upon the idea that a
                        prompt recognition and proclamation of meritorious conduct would stimulate
                        our soldiery to nobler deeds of courage and their leaders to greater
                        activity. It was also deemed desirable to trumpet our successes to the whole
                        country, so as to encourage the nation in the work of crushing the
                        rebellion. Exceeding care was taken, too, to let the European world know
                        that victory had perched upon our banners, so as to intimidate those
                        foreigners who were inclined to aid the South in the attempt to dissolve the
                        Union. With all this we have no fault to find. It is but right that he who
                        perils his life in the defence of his country should receive his due need of
                        praise. Love of country is not the only stimulant of the soldier. Ambition
                        often impels men to the display of extraordinary heroism. Love of fame is
                        sometimes stronger than love of country. But whether it is patriotism or
                        ambition that animates the military hero, there is nothing which spurs the
                        one or intensifies the other more than the plaudite of his fellow men. The
                        surest way, therefore, to excite men to a continuance in well-doing, or to
                        an effort after higher and nobler things, is to see to it that they get the
                        proper credit for what they have already done. These thoughts have been
                        called forth by the conduct of General Hancock in the South. As everyone
                        knows, the acts of Congress pretending to look to the reconstruction of the
                        Southern states conferred almost unlimited power upon the district
                        commanders. Sheridan and Pope took advantage of this power and <del/>
                        advancing, retarded healthy <unclear>reconstruction</unclear>. Under their
                        administration, the State governments were rapidly handed over to the
                        control of the negro. <del/> from constable up to Governor, were removed
                        without any hesitation on political grounds. The process of the Courts was
                        unobserved and openly disregarded. The writ of <emph rend="italic">habeus
                            corpus</emph> was trampled beneath the feet of their soldiery wearing
                        the United States uniform. Trial by jury had become a farce. Negroes stepped
                        into the jury-box and were declared competent and free to fill the highest
                        offices in the States.</p>
                    <p>But when Hancock took command of the district over which Sheridan had played
                        the tyrant, a different order of things was established. He declared the
                        civil law to be supreme. He announced his determination to uphold and
                        protect the courts in the exercise of their lawful authority. He
                        <sic>shewed</sic> himself unwilling to blot from his memory the recollection
                        of those great rights which the Barons of England wrung from King John on
                        the plains of runnymede, and which have become the chartered privileges of
                        the American people. He regards the military not as an instrument to oppress
                        but, on the contrary, to protect the people. The soldiers under his
                        authority are to be used to enforce, not to violate the law. The sacred
                        right of trial by jury is not to be taken away in violation of the
                        constitution of the United States. The privilege of the writ of <emph
                            rend="italic">habeus corpus</emph> is to be preserved at all hazards.
                        The liberties of the citizen are not to be guarded as of no account, but are
                        to be guarded with the most scrupulous care. No selfish ambition moved him
                        to the exercise of unconstitutional measures in order to render himself
                        popular with the fanatical magnates in Congress.</p>
                    <p>In thus determining to bring the Southern States again under the operation of
                        the civil law, General Hancock has shown an appreciation of the true spirit
                        of our republican institutions which entitles him to prompt consideration at
                        the hands of Congress.--And President Johnson suggested something eminently
                        appropriate in his special message to Congress when he recommended a public
                        recognition of his patriotic conduct.</p>
                    <p>Such action would be proper for three reasons. First, it would have an
                        excellent effect upon General Hancock himself. It would stimulate him with
                        fresh vigor for renewed efforts in behalf of constitutional liberty. It
                        would bear to his heart the fact that his unselfish patriotism has been duly
                        appreciated by those who legislate for the country. It would teach him to
                        continue in the good work of exacting a rigid observance of the law in
                        preference to the exercise of unrestrained arbitrary power. No doubt he has
                        the approval of his own conscience which is a sufficient reward for the
                        faithful performance of his duty, but there is nothing like sympathy felt,
                        and sympathy expressed, in nerving a man for the performance of difficult
                        undertakings.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, it might exert a salutary influence upon the nation. In these days
                        of wholesale corruption, it is refreshing to find a public man who stifles
                        his lust for power, if any he has, and refuses to shape his course with a
                        view to conciliate the ruling party. When other district commanders are
                        reveling amid the pomp and pageantry of their military power, it is
                        gratifying to see a General marking his every act by the strictest
                        republican simplicity. Whilst Pope is putting forth every energy with a view
                        only to better his standing with a particular organization and with the
                        avowed purpose of reconstructing the Southern States in the interest of the
                        Radicals and the negro, it is a source of unbounded satisfaction to discover
                        one whose only anxiety is to so act that the Republic shall receive no
                        detriment. Well has the President said, "of such an act as his, at such a
                        time, it is but fitting that the dignity should be vindicated, and virtue
                        proclaimed, so that its value as an example may not be lost to the nation."
                        Our people have become too familiar with the abuse of their dearest rights
                        by high military officials during the war. They have seen the safeguards of
                        their liberties stricken down. They have trembled at the growing inclination
                        to do away with the time-honored usages of their ancestors, and to
                        substitute new and startling customs in their stead. Hence they can not be
                        too soon familiarized with the old forms of law which the war temporarily
                        set aside. The true greatness of this nation lies in the path which our
                        constitution marks out. Let it be taught to applaud public virtue,
                        republican simplicity and a rigid observance of the laws.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly: The cause of <emph rend="italic">republicanism</emph> throughout the
                        world will be advanced by an official utterance on the part of Congress of
                        their approval of General Hancock's course. By the word republicanism, we
                        mean the principles of republican government. It was the boast of the
                        monarchical governments of Europe when our civil war began, that our
                        republic was a failure. They argued that strength and stability could alone
                        be found in their system. The wish as to us was, with them, doubtless,
                        father to the thought. The splendor of our young republic so dazzled their
                        eyes that they imagined that it would soon outstrip all other governments in
                        the contest for preeminence. They naturally became envious of its successful
                        operation, and, consequently, gloried in the internal dissensions which
                        threatened its dismemberment and downfall. And when our war closed, and
                        Radicalism seized upon the military power as an engine of oppression, they
                        naturally supposed that we were gravitating towards a stronger government,
                        and that soon our boasted institutions would pass from the hands of the many
                        into the hands of the few. They cannot understand a system of government
                        based on the judgments and consciences of the masses. They are partial to
                        military governments, just as they are to monarchies, because they smack of
                        despotism wielded by a privileged few.</p>
                    <p>Let the announcement go out therefore to the world that republican government
                        is <emph rend="italic">not</emph> a failure--that we have no idea as a
                        nation of wiping out republican institutions--that we are wedded to the old
                        faith of our forefathers who rebelled against the tyranny of Great
                        Britain--that <emph rend="italic">the majesty of our law</emph> is more
                        impressive, and more worthy of our sacred regard than the splendor and power
                        of royalty, and that we honor those most of all who yield their first and
                        truest allegiance to the constitution which is our supreme law. By all
                        means, let Congress bear public testimony to the value of General Hancock's
                        services.</p>

                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> refers us very politely to the
                        letter of General Grant addressed to the President protesting against the
                        removal of Sheridan and Stanton, as an evidence of his loyalty and peculiar
                        fitness for the Radical nomination. We have never questioned General Grant's
                        loyalty. We knew, too, that the man who wielded the strength of the Union
                        armies and periled his life in defence of his country would naturally be
                        very favorably disposed towards a companion in arms who had borne himself
                        bravely and won fame in the contest for our National existence. We do not
                        wonder therefore at General Grant's sympathy for Sheridan. But it is not
                        loyalty alone, even judged by the strange standard which was set up during
                        the war, that is to win a nomination at the hands of our opponents. In the
                        words of the <emph rend="italic">Morning Post</emph> of Philadelphia, "to
                        say that Grant is loyal is not enough; we must know whether he is Radical."
                        No matter what his predilections are for certain officials; no matter what
                        is the construction which he puts upon a particular law; no matter that he
                        is mortified at the summary decapitation of his military friends,-- all this
                        has very little to do with his fitness for the nomination as the candidate
                        of the Radical party for the Presidency. The one consideration,
                        overshadowing all others, is his position on the question of the rights of
                        the negro. Is he in favor of negro suffrage? Is he willing to place the
                        negro on terms of perfect political and social equality with the white man?
                        If not, he can not be the standard bearer of the Radical party. The argument
                        of availability will not stifle the voice of principle. Men there are,
                        strong, able men among the Radical leaders who would rather suffer
                        overwhelming defeat than surrender their fanatical notions. They are
                        determined on having the issue distinctly made without regard to the
                        consequences. Can the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> show us anything
                        from General Grant favorable to negro suffrage? Does the letter to which we
                        are referred commit him in favor of that doctrine? Not at all. Then why
                        should our neighbor pretend to glean any comfort and encouragement from it?
                        The truth is, the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> has staked the
                        success of the Radical party upon a throw of the die. It is trusting to
                        blind fate, hoping that the good fortune which attended its organization
                        during the war, will replace the disasters which it has so recently
                        experienced. We have carefully read the letter to which our neighbor has
                        called our attention, but we have utterly failed to discover anything
                        therein on the question of negro suffrage.</p>
                    <p>But, we must be allowed to say further that the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Repository</emph> has exhibited an unusual degree of dullness of
                        comprehension if it has for an instant supposed that we desire the <emph
                            rend="italic">Democracy</emph> to nominate General Grant for the
                        Presidency. It says, "it(the SPIRIT) has heretofore betrayed a great desire
                        to capture him as an available candidate for the Democracy." Permit us to
                        correct you once for all, neighbor. We have never experienced such a desire,
                        entertained such a hope, or written a line with a view to accomplish such a
                        purpose. We would not favor General Grant's nomination under any
                        circumstances. In the first place we prefer a civilian, and, in the second
                        place, we do not believe that General Grant is composed of the stuff of
                        which Presidents ought to be made. If the Radicals shall see fit to select
                        some other man as their standard-bearer, we will not favor the General's
                        nomination by the Democracy as a matter of expediency. Observing, as we
                        think we do, the distinct line which separates the two great parties of the
                        present day, we can not give our confidence to a man who refuses to speak
                        and let the nation know what his opinions are or the great questions at
                        issue. We would not give a picayune for the man who has not sufficient
                        strength of intellect to entertain an opinion and sufficient independence of
                        character to express it regardless of personal consequences. Reticence in a
                        public man might be excused if his personal interests were alone involved.
                        But when the public weal is at stake--when enormous deception may be
                        practised by reason of his impenetrability, his duty as a patriot requires
                        him to give utterance to his political opinions. If nobody were interested
                        in the question who shall be President but General Grant, it might make no
                        difference what General Grant's opinions are. But when every measure now
                        introduced into our governmental system is of such vital importance and
                        transcendent interest to the whole American people, neither General Grant,
                        nor any other man who is likely to be called upon to take charge of our
                        national affairs, has a right to seal his lips and refuse to commit himself
                        upon the leading question which agitates the public mind. We imagine that
                        General Grant has concluded not to commit himself until such time as he
                        thinks he has divined the direction in which the popular current is running.
                        It seems to us that if he were gifted with ordinary preceptive faculties, it
                        would not take him long to see that the people, whose will he has declared
                        is the law of the land, are not very favorably disposed towards the doctrine
                        of negro equality. He seems, however, to have no skill in foretelling events
                        by the shadows which they cast before them. In this very same letter, to
                        which our special attention has been directed, he took occasion to use the
                        following language with reference to Sheridan: <lb/> In conclusion, allow me
                        to say as a friend desiring peace and quiet, the welfare of the whole
                        country, North and South, that it is in my opinion, more than the loyal
                        people of the country--I mean those who supported the Government during the
                        great rebellion will quietly submit to: to see the very man of all others
                        who they have expressed confidence in removed.</p>
                    <p>The result thus predicted has not been realized. So far from refusing to
                        submit quietly to this action of the President, the people have given it
                        their hearty approval. The attempt to lionize the deposed General was a
                        wretched failure. Americans know how to appreciate courage and military
                        genius upon the battle field, and, at the same time, to rebuke acts of
                        tyranny proceeding from a disposition to oppress the vanquished and a desire
                        to subordinate the civil to the military power. They love republican
                        institutions, and will not rally to the standard of any man who desires to
                        supplant them, or who would be willing to commit them for safe keeping into
                        the hands of an ignorant and degraded race which has never shown any
                        capacity for self-government. The removal of Sheridan, therefore, contrary
                        to General Grant's expectations, has not awakened any considerable
                        indignation or clogged the wheels of government for a single instant.</p>
                    <p>As to Stanton, about whom General Grant was also exceedingly exercised, the
                        cause is still worse. The great "organizer of victory" has sunk almost
                        completely out of sight, if not altogether out of mind. The only occasions
                        on which he is expected to engage public attention is when some one of his
                        victims drags him into a court of justice, to seek redress for the
                        high-handed outrages of which he has been the villainous perpetrator. Nobody
                        weeps for Stanton, and even General Grant himself, after declaring in this
                        letter to which our attention is specially directed, that "his removal can
                        not be effected against his will without the consent of the Senate," becomes
                        in fact the instrument of his removal by inditing a short letter over his
                        own signature, to which Stanton surrenders as a "superior force" which he
                        cannot resist.</p>
                    <p>It gives us pleasure always to make others happy. In thus assuring our
                        neighbors of the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> of the fact that we
                        have no designs upon General Grant, we experience extraordinary felicity for
                        the reason that their nerves will be thereby soothed, this phantom which
                        their own imaginations have conjured up to haunt them will vanish, and their
                        cup of joy will be filled to the brim.-- Once for all then, we disclaim any
                        partiality for, or interest in General Grant as the Democratic candidate for
                        the Presidency. We shall make no attempt to capture him as an available
                        candidate. The Democratic party is able to stand or fall upon principle.
                        Reverses can not annihilate it. It has borne, and risen superior to, too
                        many defeats to fear permanent disorganization therefrom. It has confidence
                        in its fundamental doctrines. No personal popularity can demoralize its rank
                        and file. The honest, exultant masses who glory in the name of Democracy
                        have refused to bow the knee to the ebony idol which Radicalism has set up,
                        and they will move in solid column against any man who worships at its
                        shrine. Let our neighbor rest assured that if Grant is rejected by the
                        Radical Convention, he will not be the nominee of the Democratic Convention,
                        and that if he shall be declared the standard bearer of the Radical party,
                        not all his splendid military record can save him from the crushing defeat
                        which will be administered by the men who have determined that this shall be
                        emphatically a white man's government.</p>
