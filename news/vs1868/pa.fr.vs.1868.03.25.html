<b>The Border Relief Bill</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports the passage of the Border Relief Bill and its contents. Says it is
                    good but not nearly good enough because it does not pay damages in full.
                    Nevertheless, praises the representative of Franklin county for getting it
                    passed and urges the Senate to act on it quickly.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill, introduced by Col. B.F.
                        Winger of this County, looking to the payment of the losses sustained by the
                        border counties at the hands of Rebels. The first section, appropriating
                        five hundred thousand dollars to be distributed pro
                        rata among the sufferers, was stricken out, and another substituted
                        in its place. The bill as it now stands makes no appropriation, but provides
                        for the adjudication of the claims and requires them to be filed in the
                        office of the Auditor General. It also makes it incumbent upon the proper
                        officers of the State to make an effort to collect the claims from the
                        General Government for the benefit of the suffers.</p>
                    <p>It is a good bill as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. There is
                        no substantial reason why the Legislature should not appropriate money to
                        pay the full amount, or at least a good portion of these claims. It is no
                        fault, however, of our energetic representative that this has not been done.
                        He has labored faithfully for the success of this measure, and it is chiefly
                        owing to his indefatigability that the present bill is not now slumbering in
                        Committee. We hope that Mr. McConaughy will strain every nerve to pass the
                        bill in the Senate. It is of the utmost importance that the amount of these
                        losses should be definitely ascertained and placed on record, so that if the
                        National Government refuses to pay them, an effort may be made hereafter to
                        induce the representatives of the people of this Commonwealth to do an act
                        of justice to this plundered section. With the amount officially
                        ascertained, we will know what to ask, and the Legislature will know better
                        what amount to appropriate.</p>
                    <p>We understand that Governor Geary has expressed his willingness to sign the
                        bill. Let Mr. McConaughy move therefore, and move rapidly.</p>

<b>The Radical Quarrel</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper gloats over the feud within the Republican party between
                    supporters of Andrew Curtin and supporters of A. K. McClure. "The Radical party
                    of this State, which has heretofore been held together by the cohesive power of
                    public plunder, has lately become a very unhappy family."<br>

<b>The Election</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on past and recent local elections and notes the declining
                    majorities of Republicans. Congratulates Democrats on recent victories in the
                    board of Return Judges.<br>(Names in announcement:  W. S. Everett,  D. O. Gehr,   Clark, Dr.  Senseny)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democracy of Chambersburg made a noble fight last Friday, and covered
                        themselves all over with glory. In March 1867, at the election of Borough
                        officers, W.S. Everett, Esq., the Radical candidate received 515, and D.O.
                        Gehr, Independent candidate, supported by the Democrats, received 260 votes,
                        leaving a majority of 255 for Mr. Everett.</p>
                    <p>But as Mr. Gehr received no Radical votes and failed to poll the full
                        Democratic vote, this calculation may be considered unfair. Take, therefore,
                        the vote cast for the Judges of Election. The aggregate vote cast then, in
                        the two wards, for the Radical candidates for judges of election was 578.
                        The aggregate vote for the Democratic candidates was 317, showing a Radical
                        majority of 201 votes.</p>
                    <p>Last week the vote for Mr. Clark, Radical, for Burgess was 427, while that
                        for Dr. Senseny, Democrat, was 407, showing a Radical majority of twenty
                        votes only.--Last Spring the whole vote polled in the Borough was 835. This
                        Spring it is 834. Surely Radicalism is waning. Let it wane.</p>
                    <p>The elections in the County have resulted gloriously for the Democracy. We
                        have a majority of five in the board of Return Judges. Strange to say, the
                        Quincy Democracy were asleep and allowed the enemy to steal a march on them.
                        We have an excellent set-off to this, however, inasmuch as we have taken
                        Mercersburg by storm.</p>

<b>Disgraced by the Radicals</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper argues that if Andrew Johnson is removed from office, the United
                    States will be "disgraced in the eyes of the world." Convicting a Chief
                    Magistrate as a criminal would embarrass the nation. The paper blames the
                    radicals for bringing on the crisis, and points out that they elected Johnson
                    vice president in the first place.<br>

                    members of our different churches." "The Association does not aim to do the work
                    of the Church, for that is a work the Church alone can do, but is an organized
                    union of Christian philanthropists aiming at the religious, intellectual and
                    social amelioration of young men particularly." "To live for God and Humanity
                    should be the highest ambition of human effort. To better the condition of the

                    Christ and to Heaven, is superlatively the grandest and most glorious work that
