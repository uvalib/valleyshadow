                    <p>Money has been scarce in the inland towns all summer, and it is every day
                        growing scarcer. The spring trade was dull; there was hardly any summer
                        trade at all, and the hoped for revival in the fall has not come. The
                        prospect ahead of business men is very dreary, and it is feared that this
                        will be one of the worst winters that poor people have had to encounter for
                        a long period of years.</p>
                    <p>This is the news that comes to us from all quarters. If misery could be
                        relieved by company, the business men of Chambersburg might experience
                        relief from the knowledge that business is stagnant and money scarce in all
                        the inland towns throughout the Union. But this knowledge affords no relief,
                        for it furnishes no aid in the payment of notes and drafts.</p>
                    <p>Those who wish to know why it is that business is so dull and money so scarce
                        in the interior of the country, may learn the cause by reading the speech of
                        Gov. Seymour. That speech shows that the middle and western parts of the
                        country are suffering from the unwise legislation of the party that has
                        ruled the country for the last seven or eight years.</p>
                    <p>This party destroyed the State Banks and set up National Banks in their
                        stead. Under the old system, each State could establish as many Banks and
                        authorize the issue of as much currency as the wants of its inhabitants
                        required. But under the National Banking system set up by the Radicals, only
                        a certain amount of Bank notes can be issued; and instead of apportioning
                        these among the several States, according to the wants of the inhabitants
                        thereof, they were given out to those who were the first to apply for them.
                        The New England States, with characteristic greed, made haste to organize
                        Banks under the new law, and gobbled up an undue proportion of the National
                        Currency. Gov. Seymour shows that Massachusetts sucked up fifty seven
                        millions of it, while Illinois, with double her population, got only ten
                        millions. Rhode Island has forty dollars of this currency to every one of
                        her inhabitants, whilst States in the middle and west have only ten dollars
                        to each inhabitant.</p>
                    <p>Thus it comes that money is scarce and business dull in the middle and
                        western States, whilst capital is piled up in the hands of the Banks and
                        Brokers in the eastern cities, where it is used in speculations that make
                        the rich richer and the poor poorer.</p>
                    <p>The Radical leaders cling with great tenacity to the financial system they
                        inaugurated. There is no hope for the business men of the interior so long
                        as that system prevails. There must be a more equal distribution of currency
                        and a more equal distribution of taxation, or widespread disaster will
                        ensue. <emph rend="italic">A change is needed</emph>--a change of measures
                        and of men. The election of Gen. Grant means a continuance of the evils
                        which are now pressing the business men of the interior to the earth. The
                        election of Gov. Seymour would bring a change of policy which would work a
                        revival of business and make money plenty where there is now a great want of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Let business men read Seymour's speech and study it well. Let them consider
                        the financial situation very carefully before they cast their votes in
                        November.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We hope that every Democrat, and every conservative Republican who believes
                        with us that a change is needed in the administration of national affairs,
                        will turn out on Tuesday next and vote for Seymour and Blair.</p>
                    <p>Times are hard and getting harder; money is scarce and getting scarcer; taxes
                        are high and getting higher the government expenses are enormous and growing
                        worse; the public debt is fearful and being augmented every month; the
                        Radical Congress is squandering the people's money and Radical office
                        holders are stealing half the revenues they collect.</p>
                    <p>The public welfare demands a change. Honest Republicans who vote with the
                        dishonest crew who are plundering the people will regret the act all the
                        days of their life. Their eyes will ere long be opened to their error. Those
                        who vote for Seymour and Blair--for the immediate restoration of the
                        Union--for the reduction of government expenditures and the consequent
                        reduction of the public debt--for the lightening of taxation--for the more
                        equal distribution of currency and the revival of business that would result
                        therefrom--these will have no cause to reproach themselves, let matters go
                        as they will. They can rest in the consciousness that they performed their
                        duty. If evil ensues, the fault will not be theirs.</p>

                    <p>The Radical Congress refused to vote one dollar for the relief of the
                        citizens of Chambersburg whose property was carried away or burned by the
                        Rebels. The same Congress has voted twelve million dollars a year to the
                        negroes of the South, which is distributed to them by the Freedmen's Bureau.</p>
                    <p>Nearly everybody in Chambersburg is pinched for money. Our business men have
                        a terrible struggle to sustain themselves. If the Radical Congress had given
                        to the sufferers here just one million of the twelve millions it has given
                            <emph rend="italic">every year</emph> to the Southern Negroes who did
                        not suffer at all, everything would go easy with the people of Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>Can any Radical give a good reason why millions should be appropriated every
                        year for the Southern Negroes, while not one dollar is given to the White
                        sufferers of Chambersburg? We would like to know the reason, if one exists.
                        Can the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> give it? Can any of the
                        Radical orators give it?</p>
                    <p>A memorial, it will be remembered, was sent from this place to Congress,
                        setting forth the sufferings of our people and praying for relief. Gen.
                        Koontz presented it and endeavored to get a favorable report upon it from
                        the committee to which it was referred. John A. Bingham, of Ohio, and other
                        leading Radical members of Congress, were on that committee. They refused to
                        report in its favor. Bingham was strongly against it. With his big fee in
                        one pocket for prosecuting Mrs. Surratt to the gallows, and his $5,000 for
                        one year's service in Congress in the other, he felt too comfortable to
                        concern himself about the poor White people of Chambersburg. But his bowels
                        of compassion were deeply moved when the appropriation for the Freedmen's
                        Bureau came up, and he voted to invest twelve millions more of the people's
                        money for the benefit of the Southern Negroes, just after he had refused to
                        vote one dollar to us.</p>
                    <p>Do the people of Chambersburg really want indemnity for their losses? Do the
                        people of the rest of Franklin county want indemnity for theirs? If so,
                            <emph rend="italic">how should they vote</emph> in order to get it?</p>
                    <p>John A. Bingham is regarded by his friends as a great lawyer. If Grant should
                        be elected to the Presidency, Bingham would be urged upon him for Attorney
                        General, and in all probability he would be appointed. What advice would he
                        give the President upon the indemnity question? After going against us in
                        Congress, would he be likely to go for us in the Cabinet? And if the
                        Radicals in Congress care so little about us as to give us nothing when a
                        Presidential election is coming on, notwithstanding all their anxiety to
                        obtain votes, what have we to expect from them after they get another four
                        year lease of power?</p>
                    <p>It is very probable that what we are saying on this subject will be
                        disregarded by every Radical voter in Chambersburg and throughout the
                        county. It is to be feared that party prejudice and party drill will blind
                        them to their own vital interests. We perform our duty, however, in warning
                        them against voting for the candidates of the party which, through its
                        representatives in Congress, has refused them indemnity for their losses,
                        whilst it has squandered millions upon Negroes who had no claim to one cent
                        from the National treasury. If they would rather vote for Grant and give
                        twelve millions a year to the Negroes, than vote for Seymour and secure a
                        million or two for themselves, there is no help for it. But what a sight it
                        is to see intelligent white men voting so directly against their own
                        interests!</p>

                    <p>The Radicals are running Gen. Grant solely on his military record. To help
                        them to a proper conception of his military genius, we commend to their
                        perusal the following extract from Mr. Greeley's book entitled "The Great
                        American Conflict," where, in describing one of Grant's assaults upon the
                        Confederate lines, it is thus related:</p>
                    <p>"Twenty minutes after the first fire fully ten thousand of our men were
                        stretched and writhing on the sod, or still and calm in death, while the
                        enemy's loss was probably little more than one thousand. And when, hours
                        later, orders were sent to each corps commander to renew the assault at
                        once, without regard to any order, <emph rend="italic">the men simply and
                            unanimously refused to obey it</emph>. They knew that success was
                        hopeless, and the attempt to gain it murderous, hence they <emph
                            rend="italic">refused to be sacrificed to no purpose!</emph>"</p>
                    <p>What a commentary on the generalship of the Radical candidate. And let it be
                        remembered that the commentator is Horace Greeley. The survivors of that ten
                        minute conflict, though as brave men as ever trod the earth, refused to
                        advance again. Their good sense saw what the profound military genius of
                        Gen. Grant failed to perceive, that to assault the enemy again was to run
                        upon useless slaughter, and they refused to be sacrificed merely to gratify
                        the obstinacy of their commander. What other American General ever had the
                        mortification to see his positive order countermanded by the unanimous
                        action of his whole army?</p>

                    <p>The negro has not yet been admitted to the ballot box in Pennsylvania. Fully
                        one-half of the Republicans in the State, if interrogated to-day, would say
                        that they would never consent to his admission to it. Yet these same
                        Republicans will vote for Grant, and so vote to sustain the Radical
                        reconstruction policy, whereby the negroes in the Southern States have been
                        admitted to the ballot box. The negroes in those States have not merely been
                        put upon an equality with the white people and given the power to contend
                        with them at the polls upon equal terms. They have been given the entire
                        control of the ballot box and it expresses their will alone.</p>
                    <p>Do the Republicans of Pennsylvania flatter themselves that because the negro
                        does not vote in this State he does not stand upon terms of equality with
                            <emph rend="italic">them</emph>? True, he does not elbow them at their
                        voting places. He does not spread his perfume around their polls. His
                        ivories do not shine like a polished steel-trap through the window where
                        their ballots are taken in. But in those places where the destinies of the
                        nation are decided, he meets them on terms of equality and speaks in a voice
                        as potential as theirs.</p>
                    <p>There will be Senators in the United States Senate on the fourth of March
                        next, who were elected by negro members of the Legislatures of Southern
                        States. There will be members of the House who were elected by the direct
                        votes of negroes at the ballot box. Each Senator thus elected by negroes in
                        the Legislature, and each member thus elected by negroes at the polls, will
                        have a voice and a vote equal to each Senator and each member elected by the
                        white people of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>To this position of political equality with the intelligent white men of the
                        North have the ignorant negroes of the South been elevated by the
                        reconstruction policy of the Radicals. Every Northern man who votes for
                        Grant votes to weigh a Southern negro in the scale against himself. And what
                        is worse, he gives the negro a chance to outweigh him. In one of the
                        Southern States, the negro population does not equal the population of a
                        single county in Pennsylvania. And yet those few thousand negroes will have
                        two Senators of the United States, the same as the three million whites of
                        Pennsylvania or the four million whites of New York. One Florida negro will
                        balance the power of forty or fifty white Pennsylvanians in the United
                        States Senate under Radical reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>Many Republicans look upon this elevation of the Southern negroes merely as a
                        deserved degradation of the Rebels. They overlook the fact that it is also a
                        degradation of the white people of the North. We confess our fear that they
                        will continue to look at it in a wrong light, and only awake to a true view
                        of it when they find Negro Equality fastened upon the country beyond their
                        power to shake it off. Negro Equality did we say? Let us say Negro
                        Superiority, for that is what it amounts to when a few thousand Florida
                        negroes can stifle the voice of three million white Pennsylvanians in the
                        United States Senate.</p>
                    <p>All who are in favor of Negro Superiority will vote for Grant; and let no one
                        who votes for Grant forget <emph rend="italic">what</emph> he is voting
                    for.</p>

                        they nominated John Cessna. Now mark the result in Bedford county. Cessna,
                        for Congress, received 2658, and Sams, Radical candidate for County

                        Cessna is beaten 211, making a difference against Cessna of 301.</p>

                <head>The Voice of a Workingman</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The following is from the pen of a workingman who voted for Mr. Lincoln:</p>
                    <p>CHAMBERSBURG,<lb/> Oct. 26th, 1868.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Messrs Editors:</emph>--It appears from the Daily
                        Journals, that the gallant Seymour is making his way to the White House by a
                        few of his able speeches, and that the people flock to hear him by tens of
                        thousands. I am glad to hear that he has taken this method of opening the
                        eyes of those who have been blinded by the misrepresentations of his
                        political foes. There is no danger of the "silent Grant" imitating him in
                        this particular. Seymour will have the whole lecture ground to himself so
                        far as Useless Grant is concerned. I am sorry that Grant knows nothing much
                        but fighting. Had he been an orator and statesman like Seymour, we should
                        have had lively and interesting times before Election day, for there is no
                        doubt that Grant is uneasy in his boots at this unlooked for change of
                        programme. However, if Grant cannot talk much, he can fight some; and that
                        seems to compensate the American people for his lack of speech, and
                        statesmanlike qualities. Seymour, on the other hand, is no fighter of the
                        bloody kind. He uses no deadly weapons. His voice and pen constitute the
                        whole outfit of his fighting material. He reasons thus: that we have had
                        fighting enough to satisfy this generation surely, if not, we shall need the
                        "young Napoleon" in the field again, and not in the White House, where
                        another of a different cast of mind is needed. What the American people are
                        thinking about in wanting to make a President out of such raw material as
                        Grant I know not. Surely out of this land of thirty-five million people we
                        can find a better man for our chief magistrate than the hero of Vicksburg.
                        If Grant be a good General, let him remain at the head of the Army and not
                        make a fool of him by sending him to the White House. By making him
                        President you spoil his usefulness. If Professor Agassiz was taken from his
                        scientific labors, and compelled to earn his living by the degrading
                        employment of working side by side with the Darkies on the roads, we should
                        soon see the anomaly of his position when he ceased to benefit the world by
                        his scientific researches. And so it would be with Grant, should we take him
                        from the Army and try to make a statesman of him. How the American people,
                        especially the laboring portion of them, can be so demented as to assist in
                        the attempt to elevate to the highest position in the land such a stupid
                        say-nothing as General Grant, simply because he has been a fighting
                        character like a great many others, seems to me a puzzler. If being a great
                        bruiser be a suitable qualification, then John Morrissy is richly entitled
                        to his seat in Congress. The Republican party did not like <emph
                            rend="italic">Morrissy the Bruiser</emph> to occupy a seat in Congress.
                        They said that he was unadapted for any such position; but what do they say
                        of Grant the bruiser? they say that he is just the man for the Presidential
                        office. What inconsistency! Then again; how should we appear in the eyes of
                        distant nations if a tobacco smoking biped like Grant should be our first
                        choice? They would be apt to say "what kind of people are those Americans,
                        if Grant be their leading spirit?" Have they got no men of education and
                        refinement in that land of many States and much boasting, that they are
                        under the necessity of placing at the helm of a great nation a commonplace
                        man? Are there no Seymours left, to shape the destinies of that great
                        nation, and bring order and prosperity out of chaos and confusion, that they
                        are obliged to bring forward a third or fourth rate man? Or is it the old
                        tactics of expediency that they are resorting to again?</p>
                    <p>In the Lincoln case we know we chose a man of rough and unpolished exterior,
                        but then we knew him to be a man of brain power. He was a man of some
                        promise.--We had read his speeches in the Lincoln and Douglas controversies,
                        and knew our man, because he opened his mouth and spoke the sentiments of
                        his mind. But the only four words we can get out of Grant, is, "Let us have
                        Peace." The sentence sounded to my ears when I first read it very like the
                        last words of a dying man when his death bed is besieged by a ravenous crew
                        of relations in quest of his <sic>wordly</sic> goods.--There is no doubt
                        that Grant feels the ludicrousness of his position, but his ambition, like
                        that of a great many others, prompts him to make a plunge at the White House
                        even if he sinks in the attempt.</p>
                    <p>Hurrah! for Seymour, the workingman's friend. Let every workingman read
                        carefully his speeches and judge for himself.--Be not led astray by a venal
                        press. Seymour is the champion of progress. He wishes to see the humble and
                        degraded classes raised to a higher intellectual standard, and not become
                        worse degraded by competition with the colored race.<lb/> WORKINGMAN.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Gentlemen:</emph>--According to promise as set forth in
                        my two preceding letters to my friends and acquaintances in Path Valley and
                        Amberson's Valley, and near Bossart's Mill in Franklin county, Pa., I
                        proceed to show that the reconstruction acts were not only unnecessary, but
                        were in violation of the rights and liberty of the white people South, and
                        in their operation were destructive of the ends of free government in the
                        South:</p>
                    <p>I now state that these reconstruction laws are an injury to the North. First,
                        because their operation has been to retard the prosperity of the South, in
                        this, the interference of strangers, to wit: Bureau agents, Resisters and
                        their political agents, by their false promises to the negro of a division
                        of lands and mules among them, have made many negroes lazy and idle, or at
                        least impatient of labor, and by their improper teachings and fostering in
                        them the idea of an opposition of interest to that of the whites, they have
                        made many of them insolent and thieving and insubordinate and addicted to
                        violence and crime, and in all cases they have impaired their efficiency as
                        laborers. This, in connection with other causes, greatly damaged the
                        agricultural interest, and through these all other interests in the North
                        and South have been greatly damaged. This has made cotton dear, and all
                        cotton <sic>fablics</sic> dearer in the North as well as here. It has nearly
                        destroyed the market which the South furnished to the North, and has piled a
                        higher tax upon the productive industry of the North. Again, the
                        reconstruction laws have piled a mountain of taxes on all the Southern
                        States, by protracted Conventions, and Legislatures composed of negroes and
                        parties having no interest here, voting themselves large pay and making laws
                        for party ends. The United States have not been benefitted by the taxes
                        attempted to be collected down here. It is well known that not half of the
                        taxes collected off the impoverished people down South, has ever reached the
                        United States Treasury. This is known from the fact that all the agents here
                        connected with the revenue and employed in distributing rations to the
                        indigent whites and negroes, don't live in their extravagant manner on their
                        salaries.</p>
                    <p>I know a sub-tax collector who, although always heretofore poor, is reported
                        to be worth $50,000. He and all the agents of the Government here live like
                        Princes. The principle collector of this district lives on the fat of the
                        land--spends money with the profusion of a Prince, gives suppers that cost
                        thousands of dollars in New Orleans, and is an aspirant for Congressional
                        honors. All these agents dress splendidly, ride in fine carriages, smoke
                        Havana <sic>segars</sic>, and always have abundance of money. It is known
                        that they collude with one another and by means of false returns they pocket
                        a large part of the money that would lighten your taxes if it were honestly
                        applied. Of the large amount of rations voted by Congress for the destitute
                        blacks and whites in the South, not the half of it is distributed among the
                        people. I have a destitute family of blacks on my place this summer, and I
                        know that the head of the family has not received rations sufficient for
                        more than two months. He received only one and one-half barrels of meal and
                        about twenty pounds of meat for two children and two adults. Now I have the
                        information from an unquestionable source that some of the agents for the
                        distribution of rations, offered to sell to a party hundreds of barrels of
                        mess pork and divide the proceeds with him if he would sell it off on joint
                        account.</p>
                    <p>I have just seen it stated in the papers that a report was recently made to
                        the Legislature of La., that the murder of two or three negroes in this
                        (Morehouse) parish is a matter of daily occurrence.</p>
                    <p>This is another slander of our people for political effect; for it is a most
                        outrageous falsehood. I am sure that there have not been instances of murder
                        in this parish in six months.</p>
                    <p>There have been within a year quite as many cases of the killing of white men
                        by white men as the killing of negroes. It is utterly untrue that negroes
                        are maltreated by white men, unless it is for some outrage or crime to which
                        they have been prompted by radical agents and influence or by their savage
                        nature. We need their labor, and we want their votes too much to treat them
                        badly. J.B. MATTHEWS.</p>

                    <p>NEW YORK, October 20.</p>
                    <p>FELLOW CITIZENS: It is a privilege and duty to address you on the eve of the
                        great battle which we are to fight, and which is to decide whether the
                        Government of this Republic is to remain four years more in the hands of the
                        Radical party, or whether by an energetic, united, and last effort you will
                        wrest the power from its grasp, and give to us, under a Democratic
                        Conservative administration, a Government based upon principles of justice,
                        economy, and constitutional liberty.</p>
                    <p>The issues of the present campaign are plain and self-evident. They appeal to
                        the intelligence and patriotism of every voter in the most unmistakable
                        terms. They have been ably discussed by distinguished orators and leaders of
                        our party since the nomination of our candidates.</p>
                    <p>What the Democratic party intends to do, if placed in power by your
                        suffrages, is to restore peace and union to our country; to heal the wounds
                        and sufferings caused by the rebellion; to give to the people of the South
                        the rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution, and by which
                        alone we can bring back prosperity and quiet to that distracted section; to
                        reduce materially our military and naval establishments, kept up now on an
                        immense scale and at an enormous cost; to introduce into every department of
                        Government the strictest economy, and to develop, by an equitable system of
                        imposts and taxation, the growing resources <sic>of of</sic> our country,
                        and thus to place the Federal finances on a solid and stable footing and to
                        pave the way to a gradual and safe return to specie payments. We are charged
                        by the Radical party, the party of violence and usurpation which for the
                        last four years, to <sic>plolong</sic> its own existence, has set at naught
                        the Constitution and the fundamental principles of our Government, that we
                        intend revolution and defiance of established laws. The accusation is
                        unfounded and absurd; it cannot be entertained for a moment by any
                        intelligent voter, who has even the most superficial knowledge of the
                        history of his country. The Democratic party can proudly point to every page
                        of its record. It has never violated a single obligation of the fundamental
                        compact by which these United States entered into the family of nations. Its
                        watchword, in peace as in war, has been and will always be the Union, the
                        Constitution, and the Laws. And no man nor any set of men, however high they
                        might be placed by the suffrages of their fellow citizens, can ever expect
                        to receive the support of this great Conservative party in any revolutionary
                        attempt against established laws. The ballot-box and the supreme will of the
                        American people are the only means of redress to which we look.</p>
                    <p>Fellow Democrats! You are fighting for a good and righteous cause. You have
                        for your leader a tried statesman; a patriot who stood by the Union in its
                        darkest hour; a man equally beloved for the purity of his private character
                        as honored for his public virtues.</p>
                    <p>Opposed to you are the men who have subverted the structure of our system of
                        representative self-government, vindicated to the world by more than half a
                        century of prosperity and greatness; the men who have increased our enormous
                        debt by profligacy and corruption unparalleled; the men who in two
                        successive Congresses have demonstrated their incompetency to diminish our
                        burdens by economy or apportion them with equity; the men who have so
                        distributed our burdens so as that they press with excessive weight upon the
                        labor and industry of the country, making rich men richer by making poor men
                        poorer.</p>
                    <p>Opposed to you are the men who have denied for three years of peace, and will
                        continue to deny until your votes arrest them, self-government to the people
                        of ten States; the men who have taken away the power of our Chief Magistrate
                        to insure a faithful execution of the laws, or to command the army and the
                        navy of the United States the men who did their worst to expel the President
                        from the White House for obeying faithfully the behests of your supreme law;
                        the men who, being conscious of their crimes, dreaded to have the Supreme
                        Court declare their quality, and therefore abridged its jurisdiction and
                        silenced its votes; the men who have usurped and are grasping and wielding
                        powers not possessed to-day by any monarch among civilized nations.</p>
                    <p>Against these men and all their despotic purposes, which General Grant would
                        be as powerless to hinder as he whom they elected four years ago has been;
                        against these men, their crimes in the past, their fast accomplishing
                        designs in the future, you are soon to make one final and determined
                        onslaught.</p>
                    <p>Four years ago we failed to expel them from power, though we predicted then,
                        as we now predict, their incompetency to give to the people peace; declaring
                        then as we now declare, the revolutionary purposes of their most active
                        leaders, who rule their party, as they would rule the country, with a
                        despotic sway. But these four years have justified our warning. Our worst
                        predictions then are enactments now. What we feared they have done. The
                        revolution has made steady progress. Once more we call every patriot to join
                        our ranks.</p>
                    <p>If the people will now rise in their majesty and might, they can save their
                        institutions, and rebuild them. If they are supine and regardless of their
                        sacred interests, so much in the last four years has been
                        <sic>accomplisd</sic>, and so much in the next four years may easily be
                        accomplished, no obstacle then remaining, that the Revolution will become a
                        fixed fact, the structure of our government will have been completely
                        remodeled. It may be a government; still it will no longer be your
                        Representative Self-government.</p>
                    <p>For this final struggle then fellow Democrats of the United States, let us
                        invigorate every muscle and nerve every heart. The time is short. The foe is
                        stubborn and desperate, for our victory would be the death blow to the
                        Republican party. It could have been held together by no other nomination.
                        It cannot survive your successful assault. One victory is enough, your
                        triumph in November will finally reestablish the Union and the Constitution
                        for another generation of men; it will restore peace and good order to the
                        South, prosperity to the North, and a wise and frugal rule to both. The
                        great prize is worthy your most strenuous endeavor.</p>
                    <p>Our ranks are unbroken; our courage is unabated. Once more to the breach, and
                        this time Victory!</p>

                    <p>"All Quiet Along the Potomac," but not along the Conococheague. Cessna came
                        to town on Monday, and in the evening he squalled to a small squad of "Boys
                        in Blue" away up in the third story of Austin's Bank Building, on the corner
                        of the Diamond. We went out on New England Hill to listen to him. He made
                        the windows rattle up West Market street, but as the wind was blowing
                        eastward, we saved the drum of our ears without the aid of cotton. Cessna
                        expressed great gratification at his election, because it was not only a
                        triumph over his political enemies, but over the scalawags of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph> and his personal enemies in the
                        Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
                    <p>After paying his respects to these unfortunate creatures, he lowered his
                        bovine head and with a loud bellow made a desperate charge at the poor
                        Rebels. He put them to rout so completely that we doubt whether a Rebel Ram
                        will ever venture up the Conococheague again to blockade the port of
                        Chambersburg. Of course he flattered the "Boys in Blue" that during all the
                        time when they were fighting under the flag from the summer of 1861 to the
                        autumn of 1864, he was seeking office at the hands of this disloyal
                        Democratic party--that at the very time when the battle of Gettysburg was
                        raging, he was going about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour all other
                        aspirants for the Democratic nomination for Governor. We believe he said
                        nothing about running ten votes behind the Radical candidate for Suveryor in
                        Bedford county.</p>

                    Cessna ran for office as a Democrat during the war when those soldiers were off
                    fighting.</summary>
