<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have frequently urged, in these columns, the necessity of some action by
                        our citizens upon the projected Railroad. And we would again, now as our
                        Borough has made some move in regard to this matter, urge our townsmen to
                        prompt and speedy action; let no opportunity, such as is here presented to
                        do something for our town, escape us. Little more can be said in regard to
                        the necessity of having Chambersburg as the terminus of this Road than
                        appears in the remarks made by the speakers, on the evening of the meeting
                        in the Court House. But should we fail now to accept the generous proffer
                        made by our neighbors in Waynesboro and along the proposed route, of
                        assisting in the construction of the Road; and should we decline joining
                        with them and the Mont Alto Iron Company in this great enterprise at this
                        time, the time might and will likely come when they may and will say to us,
                        we have made other arrangements. It is well known that not long since the
                        enterprising people of Waynesboro had a large amount of money subscribed to
                        complete a road from their town to Gettysburg. Now should we decline uniting
                        our means and energies in this project of constructing a Road to
                        Chambersburg at this time, they might in a short time agree to change their
                        plan and build a Road connecting their town with the Western Maryland Road.
                        This would be to us an incalculable loss.</p>
                    <p>Should we decline also accepting the proffer of the Mont Alto Iron Company,
                        made to us at this time, they too may soon make other arrangements and build
                        a freight road to Scotland, thus leaving Chambersburg entirely out of their
                        consideration. Indeed, it seems this was their original design, but they
                        were induced, by others along the route, to make a proposition to the
                        citizens of Chambersburg, to have them aid in building a Road with a
                        terminus in this Borough instead of Scotland. These matters are of serious
                        consideration, not trifles light as air; for this Iron Company and the
                        citizens of Waynesboro are determined to have a Railroad, and with the
                        proper exertions on the part of our citizens, Chambersburg may be vastly
                        benefitted by it as a terminus; but should they fail to act promptly, they
                        may instead of having a Railroad coming to the town, with all its benefits
                        and advantages, have a Railroad going around them, still further decreasing
                        trade and travel. Let us look well to our interests! Let us see to this
                        matter!</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A meeting of our citizens was held in the Court Hall on the evening of the
                        fifth, in regard to our new Railroad. Col. James C. Austin was called upon
                        to preside, and C. M. Duncan, Esq., made Secretary. George W. Weistling,
                        representing the Mont Alto Iron Company, gave an interesting account of the
                        progress of the subscriptions already made by the citizens of Waynesboro and
                        vicinity to this Railroad--to and from Waynesboro, via Quincy, Mont Alto and
                        Fayetteville to this Borough. He also said that their Company would
                        contribute fifty thousand dollars, towards the building of the contemplated
                        Road. He demonstrated, very clearly, that this Road, if made a first class
                        Road, would command a great trade, and be a good investment, besides being a
                        vast benefit to the region of country it would traverse, and also that it
                        would be an advantage to our Town to have the Road terminate here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Weistling further spoke of the probable cost of the Road, which would be,
                        according to his estimates, about $300,000. Of this amount the Cumberland
                        Valley Railroad Company agreed to pay $100,000. This estimate of the cost of
                        the Road was made upon a basis with Scotland as the terminus,--to make
                        Chambersburg the terminus would increase the length of the Road, and would
                        be a route of heavier grade--and as a consequence would cost more to build
                        it. Mr. Weistling further showed that lateral and branch Roads of this kind
                        have paid well--enumerating certain Roads which had not so fair a prospect
                        as this projected Road.</p>
                    <p>He showed the demand, the necessity of a road, from the amount of freight
                        from the furnace as well as other manufacturing establishments along the
                        route and particularly trade located at Waynesboro.</p>
                    <p>After a thorough exposition of the proposed Road, its prospects, the
                        probabilities of its success, its benefits and advantages--Mr. Weistling
                        concluded his remarks.</p>
                    <p>Col. F. S. Stumbaugh followed with some well timed inquiries and remarks, in
                        which he heartily favored the construction and early completion of said
                        Road.</p>
                    <p>I. H. McCauley, Esq., followed with a well timed speech, citing certain
                        branch Railroads in our southern counties, showing clearly and conclusively,
                        that such branch or lateral Roads have succeeded beyond the expectation of
                        their advocates and projectors, in the amount of trade done upon said Roads,
                        and the amount of business and enterprise awakened and are in general
                        remunerative investments, promoting the prosperity of all connected with
                        them. Mr. McCauley's remarks were highly pertinent to the occasion and were
                        listened to with great attentiveness.</p>
                    <p>Col. Theo. McGowan then moved that the following citizens be named as a
                        committee to solicit subscription to said Railroad, in Chambersburg and
                        vicinity, in order to bring the Road to Chambersburg as its terminus,
                        viz:--C. M. Duncan, J. Alliyson Eyster, Wm. Chambers, T. B. Wood and H. M.
                        White.</p>
                    <p>The committee was duly approved by the audience.</p>
                    <p>The President then asking whether there were any other remarks, C. M. Duncan
                        addressed the audience at some length, in which he urged the necessity of
                        immediate and prompt action upon the part of the citizens of this Borough.
                        Stating that time was an essential matter, that NOW, this proffer was made
                        to us by the citizens of Waynesboro and persons along the route, and by this
                        Mount Alto Iron Co., that it might be that six or twelve months hence they
                        might reconsider, might decline the proffer. That now the people of this
                        region of our county stretched forth their hands towards us to join us in
                        still closer ties, and bind themselves to us in bonds of steel. Could we
                        fail to embrace the offer?</p>
                    <p>He insisted that this enterprising community would have a Railroad--either
                        going South, to the Western Maryland Railroad, or joining their fortunes
                        with the Mont Alto Iron Company, construct a Road to Scotland, and that such
                        a Road would lose to Chambersburg, and lose forever, a trade which bids fair
                        to be at no distant day very extensive. He impressed upon the audience the
                        necessity of Chambersburg being and becoming the terminus of the proposed
                        road, showing its benefits and advantages to our Borough, and the great loss
                        our Town would sustain by allowing said Road to be constructed with a
                        terminus at some other point on the Cumberland Valley Road.</p>
                    <p>He showed that the vast beds and strata of Iron ore, and the inexhaustible
                        bodies of limestone along the proposed Route, in addition to agricultural
                        products, would bring a great trade to the Road, and to this Borough.</p>
                    <p>In speaking for the citizens, he promised Mr. Weistling, that the citizens of
                        this Borough, now awakened, to some extent, to their true interests, would
                        do all they could to bring the proposed Road to this Borough, and that our
                        citizens, though suffering from the losses of Invasion and Fire, were still
                        willing to contribute to the best of their ability to the speedy
                        construction of the proposed Road. Considerable enthusiasm and interest were
                        manifested by the citizens present in the plans and projects urged and
                        descanted upon, in regard to the building of the projected Railroad.</p>
