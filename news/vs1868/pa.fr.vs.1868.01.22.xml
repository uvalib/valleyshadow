                    <p>The Radicals in Congress seem determined to impose severer tasks upon the
                        forbearance of the American people than even those to which they have
                        heretofore been subjected. The new amendments to the Reconstruction acts
                        propose to set aside both the President and the Supreme Court, and to
                        devolve their duties upon the General of the Army, making him at once the
                        interpreter and the executor of the laws. This government, once believed by
                        all intelligent Americans to be "the best devised by the wisdom of man,"
                        has, when tried in the crucible of Radicalism, been found so full of dross
                        as not to be worth preserving. All its three branches are to be melted down
                        into one. The Executive and the Judiciary are practically to be done away
                        with, and Congress, with the aid of such tools as it may choose to employ,
                        is to make, interpret and execute the laws.</p>
                    <p>In nothing has the revolutionary spirit of Radicalism displayed itself more
                        conspicuously than in the Congressional legislation in regard to the Supreme
                        Court. When the Radicals got possession of the Executive and Legislative
                        branches of the Government, they found a majority on the Supreme Bench
                        opposed to their law-defying schemes. Following the example of a tyrannical
                        English King who created new Peers when he found his measures rejected by
                        the House of Lords, the Radical Congress added to the number of Judges.
                        Subsequently, when it was found that even this high-minded packing of the
                        Court had not sufficed to make it rapidly Radical in all cases, and when, on
                        a comparison of the ages and physical condition of the Judges, it was
                        supposed that the first among them to die off would be conservatives, an act
                        was passed providing for the gradual reduction of the Supreme Bench to a
                        less number than it was composed of when the Radical Congress had solemnly
                        decided that the public interests demanded an increase! One of the
                        conservative Judges has since passed away, and, under the law, his seat has
                        remained vacant. But with all this the Radicals do not feel secure. So
                        little faith have they in the constitutionality of their acts, that they are
                        afraid to submit them to the test which all acts of Congress have heretofore
                        been required to stand.--They have passed a bill requiring the concurrence
                        of two-thirds of the whole number of Judges on the Supreme bench, before any
                        law of Congress shall be declared unconstitutional. If this shall be found
                        ineffectual to secure their acts against condemnation by the highest
                        judicial authority in the country, they will go a step further, and, as
                        proposed by Congressman Williams, of this State, require a unanimous
                        decision of the Court to nullify an act of Congress.--And if at any time a
                        unanimous decision should be rendered against one of their pet measures,they
                        will forthwith adopt an amendment to the Constitution abolishing the Court
                        itself. This is what they are getting at by "regular approach." This is what
                        they would do now if they did not apprehend that the people would be
                        startled by it. Their calculation is that by gradually undermining the
                        powers of the Court, they will at length, if in their opinion it be
                        necessary, be able to abolish it altogether.</p>
                    <p>What have the people to say about all this? have they so little respect for
                        the Government established by Washington and other patriots of the
                        Revolution, that they are willing to see it overturned by a fragmentary
                        Congress that does not even represent the majority of the section from which
                        its members come? If the people of the United States really <emph
                            rend="italic">feel</emph> that reverence for their institutions which
                        they have always professed, they will not much longer tolerate these
                        assaults by the Radical Congress upon the Executive and Judicial branches of
                        the Government. There is a point at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue,
                        and in our opinion that point has been reached. There is also a point at
                        which forbearance becomes a crime, and it does seem as if the Radicals were
                        blindly bent on dragging the people to that point. It remains to be seen
                        whether the people will commit the crime of forbearing to save the
                        Constitution and Government from utter subversion.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to find that this assault of the Radical Congress upon a
                        co-ordinate branch of the Government meets the condemnation of sober-minded
                        Republicans.--We ask the attention of thinking members of the Republican
                        party to the following from one of their leading journals:</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">From the New York Times.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>The extremists are reckless, if not desperate. For twelve months past they
                        have been engaged in tying the hands of the President and stripping him of
                        authority conferred by the Constitution; and now they are about to attempt
                        the same operation upon the Supreme Court, with the view of preventing an
                        adverse decision upon the reconstruction acts.</p>
                    <p>On the part of those who share the views of Mr. Stevens, the talked-of
                        measure will be consistent. Whatever else may be charged against them, they
                        at least have not resorted to false pretenses to justify the Congressional
                        policy. No constitutional scruple has been allowed to stand in their
                        way.--They have boldly confessed that policy unconstitutional and have
                        rested its <orig reg="defense">defence</orig> upon the plea of revolutionary
                        necessity.--The Constitution, according to their theory, is for the time
                        subject to the higher law of the conqueror, as interpreted by a partisan
                        majority. If essential to their plans, they would disregard every
                        constitutional right of the Executive, and make the Supreme Court in all
                        things subservient to their will.</p>
                    <p>If this project prevail, the higher attributes of the court will be
                        destroyed. The principle will be, in effect, affirmed that partisan
                        exigencies, real or supposed, constitute the supreme law; that the court,
                        created by the Constitution in part to judge of the validity of
                        Congressional action, shall henceforward be powerless, whatever the
                        character of that action may be. Today the proposition is that, instead of a
                        majority of the judges, two-thirds of the whole shall concur;
                        <sic>to-morrow</sic>, if necessary, the concurrence of all may be required.
                        There is no limit to the interference if it be commenced--no restriction
                        save that which a majority of the dominant party may for the moment impose
                        upon themselves. They proclaim that they may enact what they please, and may
                        obviate objection on the ground of unconstitutionality by usurping power to
                        mould the decisions of the court in any shape which to themselves may seem
                        best. If it be unmanageable after exacting a two-thirds judgement, or a
                        unanimous judgement, the number of judges may be increased; and thus, by one
                        device or another, the independent jurisdiction of the court may be
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>No more significant commentary on the reconstruction legislation--no more
                        startling illustration of the unscrupulousness which actuates the Radical
                        leaders--can be conceived, than that which this affair affords. The
                        cowardice as well as the bravado of guilt is stamped upon its face. It shows
                        an utter absence of confidence in the constitutional efficacy of the
                        measures which are applicable to the South, and an utter want of moral
                        courage to uphold the principles that are involved. A consciousness of right
                        usually inspires calmness and strength, and the party which realizes it
                        seldom shrinks from the contingencies incident to political warfare. These
                        extreme Radicals, however, seem to shut their eyes when they rush ahead.
                        They are afraid of the ground they tread upon, and of phantoms at every
                        turn. Now it is of the President, <del/> of the district commanders, and yet
                        again of the Supreme Court. We suspect that they also begin to fear the
                        people in whose name they act, and whose instinctive sense of justice
                        revolts against the abuse of their delegated power. The idea seems to
                        prevail in the Reconstruction and Judiciary Committees that there is no time
                        to lose. The thing called reconstruction must be pushed through, even though
                        it be necessary to muzzle the Supreme Court judges.</p>
                    <p>How the Court will treat the attack upon its independence remains to be seen.
                        It is not likely to respect or to obey a law which interferes with its
                        constitutional function, notoriously for the accomplishment of an
                        unconstitutional purpose? What then?--Suppose the Court by a majority of its
                        members, declares the reconstruction acts constitutionally invalid, and
                        refuses to recognize as constitutional the law defining the conditions of a
                        judgement? Will Congress, having failed to legislate the Court into
                        compliance, undertake to legislate it out of existence? Will a party
                        majority make the General-in-Chief the judge of the Judges, as well as the
                        superior of the President?--Will they at last avow their contempt for the
                        Constitution and their resolve to proceed regardless of its provisions? To
                        this position their steps unquestionably tend, and the only influence that
                        can restrain them will be fear for their own safety. Of what possible value,
                        then, will be the policy of Congress when pushed to extremities? A party
                        whose leaders trample on the Constitution because it impedes their
                        operations cannot long retain the confidence of the country, and when their
                        overthrow comes--as come it must--what will be the fate of their policy?
                        what the upshot of their plotting and legislating and usurping? These are
                        inquiries which concern more than themselves, for they indicate the
                        reopening of the Southern question and the reconstructing of reconstruction,
                        as consequences of the recklessness which marks the Radical <orig

                <transcript>
                    <p>Early in the winter fifty thousand working people, whose daily bread was
                        bought by daily labor, were reported to be out of employment in the city of
                        New York alone. Later accounts inform us that thousands of men have been
                        thrown out of work in Pittsburg and the manufacturing towns of Western
                        Pennsylvania. The same is true of all cities and manufacturing towns in the
                        Northern and Western States. Meanwhile almost everything that is consumed in
                        the families of working men keeps up in price, and house rents are actually
                        advancing nearly everywhere. To make matters still worse, the weather has
                        been uncommonly severe, requiring more clothing and more fuel than usual to
                        keep the body warm. The present winter will long be remembered by poor and
                        unemployed people who manage to survive it.</p>
                    <p>Why are hundreds of thousands of industrious mechanics and laboring men in
                        the North now out of work? Is not our country as large as it ever was? Are
                        not the various products of Northern industry as much needed as ever they
                        were? Is there not, in fact, owing to the destruction and the suspension of
                        supply caused by the war, greater scarcity of farming implements and
                        machinery in general than for many years past, especially in the South and
                        South-west? Why then does silence reign in so many Northern workshops, and
                        why are thousands of Northern workmen reduced to the verge of starvation?</p>
                    <p>The South was the best customer of the North. She did very little
                        manufacturing. Her furniture, her dry goods, her carriages, her wagons, her
                        farming implements, her iron, her machinery of all kinds, were drawn from
                        the industrial hives of the North.--Fertile as is her soil, she did not
                        produce enough of wheat for her own consumption. Rapidly as cattle and hogs
                        multiplied and fattened in her genial climate, she did not cure enough of
                        beef and pork for her own use. Flour, bacon, and mess beef were supplied to
                        her by the teeming West. Her capital and labor were mainly devoted to the
                        production of cotton and sugar, and with the proceeds of these she bought
                        the products of the North.</p>
                    <p>If, at the close of the war the Southern States had been permitted to fall
                        back quietly into their places in the Union, and the Southern people had
                        been permitted to resume their former avocations without being plagued to
                        death with disfranchisement and threats of confiscation, the business of
                        that section would have leaped forward all the more buoyantly on account of
                        its long and constrained interruption, and the demand for the products of
                        Northern industry would have exceeded all previous experience. This would
                        have been particularly the case if the negroes, instead of being invited to
                        take part in political affairs and to fool away their time on matters beyond
                        their comprehension, had been given to understand that the liberty they had
                        gained meant liberty to work and to enjoy the legitimate fruits of their
                        toil.</p>
                    <p>As it is, the South is too poor to buy the things we make to sell. Her white
                        people are given no rest, and her negroes, fed by the Freedmen's Bureau at
                        the expense of the public treasury, have been taught to believe that
                        henceforth their mission is to govern the country and be maintained by
                        it.--Hence it is that our workshops are silent. Hence it is that several
                        hundred thousand Northern mechanics and laboring men are this day out of
                        work, and many of them out of bread.</p>
                    <p>Few States feel this cutting down of trade with the South more sensibly than
                        Pennsylvania. The Eastern half of our State sent its products out of the
                        port of Philadelphia to the various Southern cities on the Atlantic coast,
                        whence they were distributed to the interior, to the amount of millions
                        every month. The Western half sent its products from Pittsburgh and
                        neighboring places down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, also to the amount
                        of millions per month. These products of the industry of Pennsylvania were
                        bought by the Southern planters--the late slave owners--the very class
                        against whom Radical vengeance is specially directed. In crushing the
                        planters, the Radical Congress has crushed our best customers and cut off
                        our trade, and condemned thousands of our most industrious citizens to
                        idleness and want. Let every man who feels an interest in the prosperity of
                        the North bear in mind that the stagnation in business from which every
                        branch of industry is suffering is the result of Radical misrule.</p>

                    the North because now the South cannot buy Northern products like it used to.
                    Also takes a stab at black southerners by saying they should get out of the
                    political arena and stay on their farms.</summary>
