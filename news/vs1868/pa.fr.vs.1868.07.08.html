<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson took the best possible way to celebrate the anniversary of the
                        Declaration of Independence. In the exercise of his clear constitutional
                        "power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United
                        States," he issued an amnesty proclamation which removes all pains,
                        penalties and disabilities from all who were engaged, directly or
                        indirectly, in the rebellion, except those who are under presentment or
                        indictment for treason, or other felony. The wonder is that this step has
                        been so long delayed. The people of the South long ago manifested a
                        disposition to accept the result of the great contest in good faith, by
                        acknowledging the supremacy of the National Government. No opposition to the
                        enforcement of the laws has been shown since the surrender of the rebel
                        armies. Men who went into the war and fought for the establishment of the
                        Southern Confederacy with all the energy and enthusiasm of their fiery
                        natures, at the close of the struggle, went quietly to work to sustain
                        themselves and families and to rebuild their shattered fortunes.
                        Notwithstanding the sensational dispatches with which the people of the
                        North have been regaled--notwithstanding the false reports of numerous
                        outrages said to have been wantonly committed, the truth is that nowhere in
                        the Union has there been greater security for life than in the South. It has
                        been the constant aim of the Radicals to create the impression that the
                        spirit of rebellion has all along been nursed in that section and has only
                        been kept in subjection by the presence of the military forces.--Upon this
                        allegation, Congress has based its legislation so inimical to the interests
                        of the Southern people and so destructive of the most sacred principles of
                        the Constitution. It was high time, therefore, that the President should
                        disabuse the public mind of this impression wherever it has taken hold. We
                        apprehend that the admirable preamble to the proclamation will do this
                        effectually.</p>
                    <p>The Radical papers assert that it evinces a fresh disposition on the part of
                        the President to renew the quarrel with Congress.--The New York Times says that he should not have ventured on this
                        step without consulting Congress, although it admits that he is acting
                        within his constitutional power.--That is a rich idea, that the Executive is
                        to be such a puppet in the hands of the Legislative Department, that he dare
                        not exercise the authority clearly vested in him, and him alone, by the
                        Constitution without asking its permission. General Grant, if elected, will
                        be willing to demean himself to that extent, but it must not be expected of
                        a Democratic President. And especially would it have been refreshing to see
                        Andrew Johnson getting down on his knees to a Congress that has made use of
                        all the unparliamentary epithets towards him that the English language can
                        furnish--a Congress that has sought to strip him of all the powers with
                        which the Constitution clothes him--a Congress that in its madness and
                        fanaticism, sought to depose him for attempting to remove a Cabinet
                        officer--it would have been peculiarly refreshing to witness Andrew Johnson
                        bending as a suppliant at the bar of the House and making its gracious
                        permission to do what no power on earth can prevent him from doing.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson has had the independence and moral courage to do what he
                        thought right in this matter. He has lifted a burden from the necks of the
                        Southern people. All honor to him for this proclamation.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The letter of General Frank P. Blair which we print in another column will
                        well repay perusal. It surely gives out no uncertain sound. Its author is
                        frank and bold. He knows well--no man knows better--that the object of the
                        Northern soldiery in fighting the battles of the country, was not to
                        establish such bastard governments in the South as have been formed by the
                        Radical Congress. He sees, as all intelligent soldiers see, that instead of
                        the war preserving the "dignity, equality and rights of the several States
                        unimpaired," it has robbed the Southern States of their dignity, impaired
                        their equality, and stripped them of their constitutional rights. A set of
                        Northern squatters has assumed to control the negro population and, through
                        it, the State governments. This has been done in pursuance of the
                        Congressional policy. General Blair is in favor of uprooting this policy. He
                        desires the issue to be put plainly before the country so that the sovereign
                        people may declare whether or not they will tolerate such trampling under
                        foot of State rights. He believes the Reconstruction acts to be in palpable,
                        flagrant violation of the Constitution, and hence he would treat them as
                        null and void from the beginning, and all action taken under them as illegal
                        and consequently of no binding force. He asserts that it will be obligatory
                        upon the President elect, on account of the oath which he takes, to defend
                        the Constitution from the terrible attacks made upon it by Congress. Such
                        action on the part of the new President would make short work of the
                        carpetbaggers and place the State Governments under the control of the
                        citizens of the several states. The day of negro rule would soon be over and
                        the states of the Union would soon enter upon a new career of harmony and
                        prosperity. General Blair, in our judgment, strikes at the root of our
                        difficulties and strikes boldly. The same principle and spirit in Andrew
                        Johnson would have saved the country the ignominy into which the Radicals
                        and their proteges, the negroes, have plunged it. Had he treated the
                        Reconstruction acts as null and void on account of their
                        unconstitutionality, he would have rallied around him a great and strong
                        party which would have born down all opposition, whether wordy or warlike,
                        and ten chances to one, reelected him to the first office in the gift of the
                        American people.</p>
