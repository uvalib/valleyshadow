<b>What They Talk About</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contrasts the issues addressed by the Democrats versus those addressed by
                    the Republicans. Claims the latter only talk about dead issues like slavery and
                    secession while the former discuss real issues like the economy and
                    reconstruction. Proclaims the Democratic party as alive and well and ready for
                    the election.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It must be amusing to listen to a Radical speak in the present campaign. It
                        has been our privilege to read one or two, and to be informed of the style
                        and matter of a few others. From our information thus gathered, we are led
                        to the conclusion that the Radical speakers are frightened at the issues
                        that have grown out of the war.--They are afraid to discuss them. They are
                        still harping upon the disloyalty of the Democratic party during the
                        rebellion. They are still bandying the words, Copperhead, traitor, rebel
                        sympathizer. They are busily engaged in  the Democracy for gross
                         five or six years ago, seemingly oblivious of the fact that the
                        people are calling them to account for their own terrible misrule during the
                        last three years. With great atrocity they go before an
                        audience of American citizens--longing for relief from the burdens under
                        which the nation is staggering--earnestly desirous to ascertain the
                            avenue of escape from the evils into which Radicalism
                        has plunged the country and discuss the Slavery
                        question. They know well that slavery is "dead as
                        Garrick," and that there are no mourners at its tomb. And
                        yet they would persuade the people that it is the purpose of the Democratic
                        party to resurrect that forever buried institution.</p>
                    <p>With equal seriousness, they talk about the secession question. They occupy
                        their time in attempting to convince the masses that a State has not the
                        right to secede from the Union. They seem to think that the people are too
                        ignorant to know that this question has been finally settled by the bloody
                        arbitrament of the sword, and that the settlement has been accepted, and
                        acquiesced in, by the citizens of the Northern and Southern states alike.</p>
                    <p>Another favorite hobby, is the old, oft repeated charge of Democratic
                        opposition to the war for the preservation of the Union. They deny that
                        Democrats took part in the struggle in any considerable numbers, and
                        appropriate to themselves the honor of all the victories won by the Union
                        forces. They forget that during the war, more than three million,(3,000,000)
                        of men enlisted in the Union armies, and that the whole number of votes for
                        Mr. Lincoln was one million eight hundred and fifty eight thousand, two
                        hundred and fifty.(1,858,250) Even granting that every man who voted for
                        Lincoln went to the war, where did the excess of men come from? And when the
                        fact is taken into account that a great many of those who voted for Lincoln
                        did not go to the war, it seems to us to be made
                        out very clearly that our armies were nearly equally divided in political
                        sentiment.</p>
                    <p>Now, what has all this kind of talk to do with the great questions that now
                        divide the political parties of the country? What light will it throw upon
                        the Congressional Reconstruction policy which has been so signally condemned
                        by the people wherever elections have been held? How will it explain the
                        startling extravagance and unprecedented corruption which have
                            marked the Radical administration in a time of
                        profound peace? How will it justify the usurpation by the Legislative
                        Department of the rights granted by the Constitution to the Executive and
                        the Judiciary? What satisfaction does it give the people in relation to the
                        military governments which have been established in the South without any
                        warrant, or shadow of right? How will it excuse the degradation of the
                        native white population of the South and the elevation to political power of
                        ignorant negroes and unprincipled carpet-baggers? What mode of payment does
                        it suggest of the heavy debt which hangs like a horrid nightmare upon the
                        bosom of the nation? What assurance does it give to the laborer that better
                        times are coming? What information does it furnish the bondholder as to the
                        payment of his bonds?</p>
                    <p>These are the questions in which the people take an interest now. The public
                        mind is agitated upon these issues. The people are tired of the cant which
                        has been drummed into their ears by the Radicals ever since the close of the
                        war. They ask for a fish, and the Radicals give them a serpent. They ask for
                        bread, and the Radicals give them a stone.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party addresses itself to the solution of the difficult
                        problems presented by the present condition of the country. It leaves behind
                        it all decided questions, and busies itself only
                        about those which concern the people now. It regards Slavery as dead,
                        Secession as dead, and dead forever, and it leaves the efforts of the
                        patriotic Democracy in behalf of the Union to the judgment of impartial
                        history. Had the Democratic party clung to the dead bodies of exploded
                        doctrines in the past, instead of meeting every issue as it arose, it would
                        indeed have been buried long since beyond the hope of resurrection. The
                        funeral orations pronounced at its grave, and the epitaphs written upon its
                        tombstone, might then have have had something of truth in them.
                        But it is because of its ability to adapt itself to the ever changing wants
                        and circumstances of the people that it is, in
                        truth, the Democratic party, and that it is now,
                        in reality, in full life and in most excellent trim for the contest.</p>

                    <p>The Radicals re-produce the stale slanders of the past, and try to ignore the

                    <p>They imagine that you have slept during three years of their iniquitous

                    <p>They have proven themselves powerful to destroy and powerless to restore.</p>

                    <p>Why is the national debt greater now than when Lee surrendered, and why does
                        it still increase?</p>

                    M. Duncan received a majority of votes on the third ballot and was declared the

<b>Waynesboro' Democratic Meeting</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>T. D. French, Secretary of the Waynesboro' Democratic Meeting, writes to
                    the Spirit to describe the recent gathering. French asserts that several hundred
                    citizens, at least four times as many as turned out for the Republican meeting,
                    assembled to hear the Democratic speakers. The Waynesboro' Brass Band provided
                    entertainment. The speakers denounced the "political and financial disorder of
                    the country" occasioned by Republican rule. Officials argued that "if we wished
                    to save the nation from bankruptcy and ruin--if we wished to have a free
                    country--that the Radical element now in power should be routed by the people at
                    the coming elections."<br>(Names in announcement:  John Douglas,  J. N. Stiffy,  Samuel Nicodemus,  C. J. T. McIntyre,  W. S. Stenger,  F. M. Kimmell,  T. D. French)</blockquote>
