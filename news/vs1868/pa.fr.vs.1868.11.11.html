<b>The Result of the Election</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    spirits by pointing out states like New York where Democrats triumphed. Also
                    shows increased vote totals for Democrats since 1864 and insists they will do

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Once more the Democracy have met defeat. The Radical party has triumphed.
                        General Grant has been elected President, and Schuyler Colfax Vice
                        President, of the United States. For this result we have been
                            preparing ourselves since the October election. The
                        triumph of the Radical party then in the States of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
                        Indiana, insured its triumph at the Presidential election. We are not
                        surprised therefore.</p>
                    <p>But although not surprised, we do not disguise the fact that we feel deeply
                        mortified at the result. It was our honest belief that the success of the
                        Democratic party in this contest would have done much towards relieving the
                        country of its financial embarrassment--that it would have given a fresh
                        impetus to business of every kind--that it would have wheeled all the States
                        of the Union into line and, by restoring peace to them, have enabled them to
                        contribute their share toward the liquidation of the public debt. And more,
                        that it would have abolished military government in this country, and
                        brought us back to the quiet and cheap reign of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>The triumph of the Radical party does not allow us to hope for any of these
                        things. Its record was before the country. The unprecedented extravagance
                        that marked its administration--its unconcealed admiration for the pomp,
                        pageantry and "pickings" of a military government and its undisguised
                        advocacy of the doctrine of negro equality--all these commit it in a system
                        of still more lavish expenditure and, consequently, more frightful taxation.
                        The business of the country must continue to languish--the currency will
                        continue to depreciate--the National credit will continue to sink until wide
                        spread bankruptcy and ruin startle the nation from its dream of security and
                        prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The Radicals will insist, and rightfully too, that the result of the election
                        is an endorsement of the Congressional reconstruction policy. They will
                        demand that this policy shall be continued. The majority of the white
                        population of the South will remain disfranchized. Those governments will be
                        placed entirely in the hands of the negroes. The negroes, puffed up with an
                        aura of their importance, will become arrogant, overbearing, tyrannical.
                        They will commit outrages of the most brutal kind. Riots will ensue and the
                        continuation of military governments then become a necessity to keep the
                        peace. And in four years more, the Radicals will justify the continuation of
                        military rule on the ground that the Southern whites would not allow the
                        negroes to ride rough shod over them. The lands of the South will remain
                        uncultivated and of course unproductive. The burden of paying the expenses
                        of the government and the interest of the public debt will thus fall upon
                        the North. But as the people of the North have just voted to continue that
                        sort of thing, they should not complain.</p>
                    <p>But although we have been beaten in the Presidential election, all is not
                        lost. The Democracy have carried the Empire State gloriously and elected
                        that gifted young statesman, John T. Hoffman, to the Gubernatorial chair.
                        And that, too, in place of Reuben R. Fenten, the present Radical Governor.</p>
                    <p>Little New Jersey has redeemed herself by electing a
                        Democratic Governor in place of Marcus L. Ward, the present Radical
                        incumbent. We have a majority in the New Jersey Legislature also, thereby
                        securing a United States Senator in place of Mr. Frelinghuysen, Radical,
                        whose term expires on the fourth of March next. The Democratic gain in
                        Congressmen is very considerable. From present appearance we will have in
                        the next Congress at least thirty Democrats more than
                        were in the last Congress.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the Democracy have not gained all for which they fought--whilst they
                        have not succeeded to the extent that they had hoped and expected to
                        succeed--and whilst they have good reason to feel mortified at their
                        failure--they nevertheless ought to be proud of the gallant fight which they
                        have made. They fought against the prestige of a great military name--they
                        fought against enormous sums of money. Clinging to the constitution--wedded
                        to the principles of civil liberty--striking boldly to save the slight
                        remnant of our republican government--equivocating on no issue but taking a
                        decided stand upon all issues--without money and without clap-trap of any
                        sort--they advanced far in front of the position occupied in 1866. They have
                        not only maintained their organization as it was then, but they have added
                        to its numbers. They carry more States than they did in 1864. They are
                        beaten much less on the popular vote than they were in 1864. Lincoln's
                        majority in 1864 was greater than Grant's is in 1868. McClellan received but
                        21 Electoral votes in 1864. Seymour will receive about 100.--Lincoln's
                        majority on the popular vote in 1864 was 406,312. Grant's is less than
                        200,000. Add to the Democratic vote, those who have been disfranchised by
                        the arbitrary power of Congress--who if they had been allowed to exercise
                        the right of suffrage would have voted the Democratic ticket--and the fact
                        is established beyond question that General Grant, with all his boasted
                        popularity, is a minority president. He is not the choice of a majority of
                        the qualified voters of the Union. This fact ought to make him modest at
                        least.</p>
                    <p>Let the Democratic party therefore be proud of this contest. Let it keep its
                        organization perfect. It will move on to victory afterwhile. Be not
                        discouraged. Stand firm. Never abandon the right. But there is no necessity
                        for this exhortation.--The Democratic party never
                        dies. It has more vitality in this the hour of its defeat than the
                        Radical party has in the hour of its victory. Let us labor on; and wait
                        patiently.</p>
