<b>The Bond Question</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Responds to Republican charges that Democrats will repudiate bonds by using
                    greenbacks if elected. Accuses Republicans of doing just that and promises that
                    Democrats will follow the law in repayment of bonds. Goes into a lengthy
                    discussion of bond issues passed since 1861 and the merits of paying in coin or
                    greenbacks on the interest and principal of the bonds.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are charged by our opponents with intending to repudiate the debt of the
                        United States, because we maintain that the government bonds should be paid
                        in greenbacks, except where the acts of Congress authorizing their issue
                        provided that they should be paid in gold. This is the charge that is made
                        against us, but we presume there are very few sensible men in the ranks of
                        our opponents who believe it to be well founded. Even if it were true, it
                        would not very well become the Radicals to denounce us for it. Their own
                        hands are not clean of repudiation. Every intelligent man among them, in
                        this quarter of the country at least, is aware that under Gov. Curtin's
                        administration, and when there was a Radical majority in both branches of
                        our Legislature, the interest on our State bonds was paid in greenbacks,
                        although the act of Assembly under which the bonds were issued expressly
                        stipulated that the interest should be paid in coin. Here was a case about
                        which there could not honestly be any difference of opinion. The act of
                        Assembly was not silent about the kind of money in which the interest was to
                        be paid, as are the acts of Congress in relation to the payment of the
                        principal of the five-twenties. The act said the interest should be paid in
                        coin. That was the bargain. That was the express agreement between the State
                        and the bondholders. Nothing was left to quarrel about. There was no room
                        for dispute. It was down in black and white. Anybody who could read could
                        see it, and anybody whose head was lighted with a grain of sense could
                        understand it. Our Radical State authorities saw it and understood it. But
                        as if to show the world how little regard they had for right and justice--as
                        if to show how far they dared depart from honesty and fair-dealing--as if to
                        show with what brazen-faced effrontery they dared to repudiate the solemn
                        contract of the State when they had the power--they refused to comply with
                        the plain forms of the bond and compelled the bondholders to take greenbacks
                        or get nothing. This was done by their Governor and their representatives in
                        both branches of the Legislature. A more flagrant breach of contract, a more
                        barefaced act of repudiation, never was and never can be committed anywhere.
                        And yet it was sanctioned and defended and applauded by Radicals throughout
                        the State.</p>
                    <p>Dare the Radicals deny this? And if they cannot deny this act of repudiation,
                        committed by themselves, does it not become them to speak more modestly than
                        they are in the habit of speaking about the alleged intention of the
                        Democracy to break faith with the National bondholders? They charge us with
                            intending to break faith with the creditors
                        of the United States, which we deny. We prove that they have broken faith with the creditors of the State. which they
                        cannot deny.</p>
                    <p>Now what is it the Democracy propose to do about the bonds of the United
                        States?--We propose to pay them according to the terms of the several acts
                        of Congress under which they were issued. We propose to carry out the
                        contract entered into by the government on the one hand and the bondholders
                        on the other. Let the bondholders produce the various acts of Congress under
                        whose authority the several classes of bonds were issued, and if these
                        stipulate that the principal and interest of all
                        the bonds shall be paid in gold, we will insist that they shall be so paid.
                        Let us see how the matter stands.</p>
                    <p>We have before us a pamphlet on the outstanding "Bonds of the United States,
                        with a compendium of the acts of Congress under which they were issued."
                        This pamphlet was prepared and printed by the well-known Bankers DREXEL
                        &amp; Co., of Philadelphia, to whom we are indebted for a copy.</p>
                    <p>From this pamphlet we learn that the first bonds issued to carry on the war
                        were those authorized by the act of July 17, 1861. At this time specie
                        payment had not been suspended by the government, and nothing was said in
                        the act as to what sort of money either the principal or the interest should
                        be paid in. On the 25th of February, 1862, Congress passed an act
                        authorizing the issue of "five-twenty" bonds to the amount of five hundred
                        million dollars. This was the second batch of war bonds. A section of this
                        act made the interest on these and all other outstanding bonds of the
                        government payable in coin, but nothing was said about the principal. The
                        plain inference is that Congress did not intend to direct payment of the
                        principal in gold. If they had so intended they would have so said.</p>
                    <p>This view of their intention is corroborated by the terms of the act under
                        which the next batch of bonds was issued. This act was passed the 3d of
                        March, 1863, and by its express terms both the principal and interest of the
                        bonds issued under it are payable in coin. They must, therefore, be paid in
                        coin. That was the bargain, and the Democracy, if in power, will carry it
                        out. They will not follow the evil example of Gov. Curtin and the Radical
                        Legislature of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>The next bonds issued were the "ten-forties" and a small batch of
                        "five-twenties." This was a five per cent loan of two hundred millions,
                        about $3,882,500 of which were issued as "five-twenties" and the remainder
                        as "ten-forties." The act authorizing them, which was passed March 3, 1864,
                        says both principal and interest shall be paid in coin, and the Democracy
                        will stand by the bargain. They must and shall be paid according to the
                        terms of the contract.</p>
                    <p>Another issue of "five-twenties" was made in pursuance of an act passed the
                        30th of June, 1864. This act, like that authorizing the issue of
                        "five-twenties" in February, 1862, provides for the payment of the interest
                        in coin, but is silent as to the principal.</p>
                    <p>Another batch of "five-twenties" was authorized by an act passed the 3d of
                        March, 1865. The Secretary was authorized to make the principal or interest,
                        or both, payable in coin. If in coin, the interest was to be at the rate of
                        6 per cent, and if in currency, at 7. 3-10. By issuing 6 per cent bonds he
                        binds the government to pay the interest in coin, but no obligation rests on
                        it to pay the principal in coin, because no agreement to that effect was
                        made.</p>
                    <p>Now it is seen from the foregoing that under certain acts of Congress both
                        the interest and the principal on certain bonds were directed to be paid in
                        coin, whilst under certain other acts the interest alone on certain other
                        bonds was directed to be paid in coin. The bondholders contend that the
                        principal as well as the interest of all the bonds must be paid in gold. We
                        deny this, as did Thaddeus Stevens, and for denying it we are branded as
                        "repudiators."</p>
                    <p>If the Radical legislators who framed the laws under which the various
                        classes of bonds were issued intended that all of them should be paid alike,
                        why was it not so put down in the laws? The very fact that they distinctly
                        stated in some of these acts that both principal and interest were payable
                        in coin, and in others stated only that the interest was so payable, proves
                        beyond reasonable doubt that they did not intend that the principal of all
                        should be paid in coin. Did the Radical Congress lately in session hold to
                        coin-payment of all the bonds? If so, why did they not pass a bill directing
                        the payment of all in coin? They had power to do that. The question was
                        agitated while they were in session, and they could have settled it if they
                        had seen fit. But they did not settle it. They knew that the contract did
                        not require the payment of certain bonds in coin, and they were afraid to
                        saddle the people with the additional burden which an act directing their
                        payment in coin would have imposed. But after sneaking away from Congress
                        without passing a bill to settle this important dispute, they are not
                        ashamed (for there is no sense of shame in them) to mount the rostrum and
                        denounce us as "repudiators," because we propose to pay the bonds in exact
                        accordance with the laws under which they were issued.</p>
                    <p>But it is contended by some that inasmuch as it had been the practice of the
                        government to pay off its bonds in coin, the "five-twenties" should be so
                        paid, notwithstanding the absence of an agreement to that effect. There is
                        no strength in this position. The war changed many things, and among them
                        many time-honored practices of the government. Very few of these changes
                        were for the better, but it does not become the Radicals to repudiate them,
                        since it was they who made them. Among other things they changed was the
                            lawful money of the country. It had been "the
                        practice of the government" to recognize gold and silver only a
                        legal tender. But the Radical Congress, with the approval of the Radical
                        President then in office, changed this practice and made the paper money of
                        the government a legal tender. This gave us two sorts of lawful money, one
                        being coin and the other greenbacks. The latter became the common currency
                        of the country, and where there was no express agreement to the contrary,
                        all debts, public as well as private, were payable in them. On the back of
                        every Government Greenback it is plainly printed that "this note is a legal
                        tender for all debts, public and private, except duties on imports and interest on the public debt, and is receivable in
                        payment of all loans made to the United States." On the back of every
                        National Bank Note it is also plainly printed that "This note is receivable
                        at par in all parts of the United States, in payment of all taxes and
                        excises and all other dues to the United States, except duties on imports;
                        and also for all salaries and other debts and demands owing by the United
                        States to individuals, corporations and associations within the United
                        States, except interest on the public debt."</p>
                    <p>On both these sorts of notes, the reader will observe, it is distinctly
                        printed that they are not a legal tender for interest on the public bonds, but on neither of them is it printed
                        that they are not a legal tender for the principal. The inference is irresistible that they are a legal tender for the principal, except where
                        the act of Congress in express terms made it payable in coin.</p>
                    <p>And now is there a sensible man in all this section of country who will
                        permit himself to be driven off from the support of the Democratic
                        candidates by this dishonest Radical cry about "repudiation?" The Democracy
                        did not repudiate coin-payment of the interest on our State bonds when the
                        law called for coin, and they will not refuse coin-payment of the principal
                        of such United States bonds as the law said should be paid in coin. But they
                            will refuse to go outside of the plain terms
                        of the contract in order to draw five hundred or a thousand millions out of
                        pockets of the people and put it into the pockets of the bondholders. Always
                        the friends of the people, they will endeavor to save them from the swindle
                        which the Radicals propose to subject them to for the benefit of a few
                        wealthy individuals who hold the "five-twenty" bonds.</p>

<b>Curtin on Seymour</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Horatio Seymour is the object of incessant Radical assaults as a sympathizer
                        with rebels. He is denounced as having been an enemy to the Federal
                        Government. It is charged upon him that instead of seconding the efforts of
                        the National Government to crush the rebellion, he was at all times devising
                        ways and means to frustrate its designs and render its operations of no
                        effect. Those who make these charges are fully aware of their falsity. They
                        know that these statements are falsehoods manufactured for political effect.
                        It is strange, however, that they should be so reckless as to continue the
                        repetition of these assertions when they know that there is such an
                        abundance of incontrovertible testimony to the contrary. We have long since
                        ceased to defend our candidates by any statements of our own. They need no
                        defence at our hands. Even were we to produce Democratic testimony as "clear
                        as Holy Writ" to the unselfish patriotism which has invariable marked the
                        career of Horatio Seymour, Radical orators and Radical presses would not
                        hesitate to brand the proof as false and unworthy of credit. But they
                        certainly will not have the hardihood to deny the utterances of their own
                        favorite leaders. The compliments paid to Governor Seymour by Abraham
                        Lincoln and the flattering letters of praise written to him by Edwin M.
                        Stanton are well known to everybody and need not to be repeated here. The
                        official letter, too, of Governor Curtin, acknowledging the obligations
                        under which Governor Seymour had placed him during the war, is familiar to
                        our readers. But, perhaps, it may be forgotten that Governor Curtin, who is
                        known as "the Soldiers' Friend," and who, together with Colonel McClure,
                        owns one wing of the Radical party in Franklin county, in a public speech at
                        Harrisburg took occasion to do justice to Horatio Seymour at a time when he
                        spoke words of very dubious credit in relation to Pennsylvania's officers
                        and men. It will be remembered that when General Lee was about to invade our
                        State in 1863, Governor Curtin called for men to resist his progress. The
                        call was answered to a certain extent, but the men refused to be mustered in
                        until they would be informed how long they were to be
                            held, and where they would get their pay. Officers differed among
                        themselves and bad feeling was engendered among the troops. Meanwhile the
                        enemy was marching on. Governor Curtin telegraphed to Horatio Seymour, then
                        Governor of New York, to send on men for the defence of Pennsylvania. How
                        did Seymour respond? Did he say, "I am secretly anxious that General Lee
                        shall overrun Pennsylvania and thus gain a splendid victory for the Southern
                        Confederacy?" Not a bit of it. He went to work with all the energy of his
                        nature, and before a single Pennsylvania regiment was
                            organized, thirteen regiments of New York troops, at the command of
                            Governor Seymour, were on the groundat[sic] Harrisburg, ready for
                            action.</p>
                    <p>Governor Curtin went out to the camp to reconcile the differences and adjust
                        the difficulties among our men, and here is the speech which he made to the
                        Pennsylvanians on that occasion. Read it, and see what testimony "The
                        Soldiers' Friend" bore in the hour of need, to the standard bearer of the
                        Democratic party:</p>
                    <p>FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE VOLUNTEERS OF PENNSYLVANIA: I came here to-day to see
                        your officers, who ought to be here to make their complaints in form. I have
                        a right to expect the confidence of the volunteers of Pennsylvania, for I
                        have never broken faith with them. I assure you, you will be retained just
                        long enough to repel the present invasion--so long--no longer, be it sixty
                        days, or thirty, or ten. But we cannot draw your pay unless you conform to
                        the regulations of the army, and enter your names in regular form.</p>
                    <p>Look at the crowning of yonder hill! There are the troops of our sister New
                        York, defending our frontier, where you ought now to be, instead of
                        wrangling here about how you will enlist. Great
                        God! What are you doing? Thirteen regiments from New
                            York already on the ground, and in front, while not a regiment in
                            Pennsylvania is yet ready!</p>
                    <p>Not satisfied with this, the Governor then drove over to the ground on which
                        the New York troops were encamped, and, being cheered by the men, rose in
                        his carriage and uttered the following words of compliment to them and the
                        man who had sent them there:</p>
                    <p>SOLDIERS OF NEW YORK: Pennsylvania had a right to expect that her sister New
                        York would come to her aid, but she did not have the right to expect that
                        New York troops would be here on our soil, occupying the front of her
                        defence, before her own troops were on the ground. From the bottom of my
                        heart, I thank you for this generous alacrity. Bear my
                            personal thanks, as well as the thanks of Pennsylvania, to your
                            patriotic Governor for the promptness with which, through your presence,
                            he has replied to our need. On some future occasion, I will in
                        some more appropriate and formal manner, make known to him my grateful
                        appreciation of his prompt action in hurrying forward to our aid this noble
                        band of soldierly men! Again I thank you!</p>
                    <p>Is it not about time that the Radicals in this campaign should be doing
                        justice to Governor Seymour for his conduct towards Pennsylvania when her
                        Capital was threatened with destruction? One thing is certain, that whoever
                        among them is found traducing him for want of patriotism in that crisis, it
                        will not be Governor Curtin.</p>
                    <p>We give no Democratic vouchers for Seymour's patriotism and loyalty. They are
                        not needed when we have Lincoln, Stanton, and Curtin uniting to do him
                        justice. What next?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Gazette says the people of Bedford county in
                        favor of turning the Radicals out of office, met in the Court House, on
                        Monday evening, Sept. 7, in overwhelming numbers. Democrats and
                        "Republicans" from all parts of the county, were in attendance. The Court
                        room, and jury rooms adjoining, the aisles, the vestibule, and every
                        available inch of standing room, were occupied and many were compelled to
                        remain outside, not being able to effect an entrance.</p>
                    <p>HON. F. M. KIMMELL, the Democratic candidate for Congress, in this district,
                        was introduced to the meeting as the first speaker. Judge Kimmell proceeded
                        to show how Radicalism had forced Negro Suffrage upon ten States of the
                        Union, at the point of the bayonet, in a time of profound peace, at an
                        expense of nine hundred and fifteen millions of dollars for the army and
                        navy, one third of the public debt. He advocated the Democratic Seymour
                        doctrine of paying off the public debt as speedily as possible in greenbacks
                        where gold in not specified in the contract. He also advocated
                        the taxing of Government Bonds, and one currency for all, the laborer and
                        capitalist, the speculator and the farmer, the pensioner and the bondholder.
                        He dissected the extravagance of the Radical gold pen and pen-knife
                        Congress, until its corruptions and thefts of the people's money were
                        exposed to the gaze of every man who chooses to open his eyes and see. Judge
                        Kimmell's arraignment of the Radical leaders, was one of the most effective
                        efforts we have ever listened to. The Judge was frequently interrupted by
                        the plaudits of the audience, and when he retired from the stand, he was
                        greeted with such cheers as only Democrats know how to give.</p>
                    <p>HON. CHARLES H. SHRINER, of Union county, was then introduced to the
                        audience. He began by stating that he was one of those men who had voted for
                        Abraham Lincoln in 1864, and that his "Republican" friends would remember
                        that he made speeches for Andrew G. Curtin, in Bloody Run, Bedford and
                        Schellsburg, in 1863. But he was one of those Lincoln men who could not go
                        with Radicalism to its present extremes, and who intend to cast their votes
                        for the patriot statesmen, Seymour and Blair. He said that he had come to
                        this conclusion from the fact that the "Republican" party had violated every
                        pledge they made to the people during the war. They had declared that the
                        war was to be waged solely for the restoration of the Union, but at its
                        close, instead of receiving the conquered people of the South back into the
                        Union, they thrust them out, and for three years and a half have kept them
                        out, and intend to keep them out until they shall be willing to exchange
                        military despotism for negro domination. Was Negro Suffrage, Negro
                        office-holding, the object of the war? Did our soldiers shed their blood,
                        did our country waste its treasure, for the purpose of establishing a
                        military despotism over ten millions of Americans, and to deep up
                        a Freedmen's Bureau for the support of four millions of Negroes in idleness
                        and thriftlessness? No! Never! He and other "Republicans" had told the
                        people during the war that at least four millions of the Southern people
                        were as loyal and true to the Union as any of the Northern people. This kind
                        of talk suited the Radical leaders then, but it does not suit them now. He
                        remembered a song which was sung by the "Republicans" during the war,
                        descriptive of a scene in Tennessee, which would illustrate this point. The
                        idea of the song was, that an old slave-holder, who was a Union man, had
                        heard that the Union fleet was moving up the Tennessee river. He was very
                        feeble and his faithful slave carried him to the river side that he might
                        once more behold the exiled Stars and Stripes, the flag he so dearly loved.
                        When at last the banner of the Union came in sight, the old man
                        shouted,<br>"Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br>The old flag's back in
                        Tennessee!"<br> and handed his slave his emancipation papers. Now, said
                        Col. Shriner, the large class of Southerners of which this old Union man was
                        the type, are placed beneath the heel of a negro despotism, controlled by
                        bayonets, in the interest of carpet-bag political adventurers from the
                        north.</p>
                    <p>But want of space forbids a further report of this able speech. The whole
                        audience was thrilled by the appeal thus made to their sense of justice and
                        feelings of mercy, and we saw the big manly tear trickling down the bronzed
                        cheek alike of Republicans and Democrats. Col. Shriner sat down amid the
                        most vociferous applause.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic Torchlight procession in this place on Friday evening last,
                        was stoned at various points along its route by Radical scoundrels who
                        seemed to be acting by preconcert. Several Democrats--some of whom were in
                        the Procession and others merely looking on from the pavement--were struck.
                        The train which carried the Democrats of this borough to the meeting at

                        spirit is a good thing: but like other good things, too much of it is as bad
                        as none. Excessive forbearance encourages crime; and with the Democracy of

                        takes place, let a dozen or two of resolute men be supplied with stout
                        hickory sticks and be thrown out in various directions, to watch for the
                        sneaking scoundrels who heave bricks and stones out from hiding places, and

                        location for the Female College which it is proposed by the Presbytery to
                        put in operation met in this place on the 14th inst., and adjourned to meet
                        again on the 5th of October. We are so strongly impressed with the
                        advantages that would accrue to Chambersburg from the location of the
                        College here, that we feel like making a most earnest appeal to our citizens
                        to exert themselves to secure it. We know very well that many of our
                        business men are in straitened circumstances, owing to the losses they
                        sustained by fire and robbery, but still there are very few among them who
                        could not give something, and we all know that "every little helps." If
                            all should join in giving, a very little from

                        conspicuous, and attracts strangers to it and increases its population, must
                        of necessity add to the value of its property and increase its business.
                        Whatever confers pecuniary benefit directly upon a few business men,
                        likewise confers it indirectly upon every industrious citizen. Money
                        received over the counter of a Dry Goods, Grocery or Shoe Store does not
                        remain locked up there. It soon scatters out through the community and finds
                        its way into the pockets of all sorts of mechanics, laborers, dealers and
                        professional men.</p>
                    <p>Let it be borne in mind that this College is not to be a small affair, with
                        only a dozen or two of pupils. The large-minded gentlemen to whom the
                        Presbytery have committed the matter have in their thoughts an institution
                        that shall rival the great Vassar Female College at Poughkeepsie, New York,
                        which is attended by four hundred pupils. With the influence wielded by the
                        Presbytery the aspirations of these gentlemen may be realized. But suppose
                        they fall short one half. Suppose only two hundred young ladies come here
                        from abroad to be educated, and put the expenses of each at $300 per annum.
                        This will give $60,000 a year. Who will get this money? Not the officers of
                        the institution. Most of it may go into their hands, but it will not remain
                        there. It will be divided out to the farmer, the miller, the butcher, the
                        baker, the grocer, the dry goods merchant, the shoemaker, he
                        milliner, the dressmaker, and all sorts of tradespeople; and these, to turn,
                        will still further divide it, till a portion of it shall be found in the
                        pocket of almost every inhabitant of the town and neighborhood. Just think
                        what such an annual expenditure would amount to in the course of a few
                        years. Sixty thousand dollars a year would in the short space of ten years
                        amount to the great sum of six hundred thousand. And probably at or before
                        the end of ten years the amount disbursed annually through the College would
                        amount to one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
                    <p>What a great thing it would be for Chambersburg to
                        secure this institution. Why should we not secure it? Why can we not secure
                        it? All we have to do, in order to make sure of it, is to raise eight or ten
                        thousand dollars. Several other towns will probably raise that much, but we
                        have greatly the advantage of them in the property which we are able to
                        offer for the consideration of the Trustees. They have examined Col.
                        McClure's mansion and are delighted with it. This property can now be bought
                        for about one half the cost of the buildings and grounds, and in this fact
                        lies our advantage over all competing towns.</p>
                    <p>We have stated that the "Presbytery of Carlisle" propose to establish and
                        endow this College, but it must not be inferred from this that the
                        institution would be sectarian. Its influences would be religious but not
                        denominational. Children of parents belonging to all branches of the
                        Protestant Church could receive their education there, and yet adhere to the
                        religious tenets of their own denomination.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to our citizens not to let this College go elsewhere. A few
                        individuals have already subscribed one-third of the whole amount required
                        to secure it for us. These few have subscribed very
                            liberally. Let all do something. Let
                        the wealthy give their hundreds and those in poorer circumstances their
                        tens, and we shall soon rejoice in an institution of learning for females
                        which will stand without a rival in the whole State.</p>

                    <p>A young man named Lecrone, who was returning to his home near Waynesboro',
                        with a party of six or eight others, from the Democratic meeting at
                        Greencastle on Saturday night last, was shot and killed by a man named

                        Greencastle from the Republican meeting at Waynesboro'. Benner was lodged in
                        the jail of this place on Sunday morning.</p>
                    <p>An inquest was held on the body of the deceased on Monday forenoon, when the
                        following testimony was taken and the annexed verdict rendered:</p>
                    <p>Inquest held at the house of Samuel Lecrone, father of deceased, by D.B.
                        Russell, Esq.</p>
                    <p>Jurors.--H. Stonehouse, foreman; Jeremiah Gordon,
                        John Zody, Jacob Hershey, Samuel B. Snively and Henry Besore.</p>
                    <p>Physicians present.--Drs. E.A. Herring, John J.
                        Oellig and William Wright.</p>
                    <p>Drs. Oellig, Wright and Herring sworn--Made post
                        mortem examination; found that a pistol bullet had entered the frontal bone
                        1 1/2 inches above the left eye, passing obliquely through the brain,
                        striking the parietal bone near its centre, passing downward and lodging in
                        the base of the brain. There was extravasation of blood along the line of
                        the bullet. Portions of the inner table of the skull were found lying in the
                        anterior portion of cerebrum.</p>
                    <p>Franklin Miller sworn:--About 1 o'clock on Sunday
                        morning, the 20th day of September, I was returning from the Democratic
                        meeting at Greencastle along with deceased and others. At Jeremiah Gordon's
                        we met a party in a hack or spring wagon; four persons with torches, John
                        Adams driving. We cheered for Seymour; the party in the hack cheered for
                        Grant. I was driving in a buggy in front of the party shot at. Some one
                        struck at the lights; can't say who. The firing then commenced. Three shots
                        were fired. Saw the dec'd fall from his horse; saw the flash of pistol twice
                        from the hack. There were eight to our party--six on horseback and two in
                        buggy. The hack or wagon of the other party was not covered. I followed the
                        other party after Lecrone fell. A man on horseback came back from the wagon
                        to us. We told him Lecrone was killed. He said he would stop them. He rode
                        forward and the party in the hack increased their speed. I passed them at
                        Shull's and got to Greencastle in advance of them.</p>
                    <p>Jno. A. Nicodemus sworn:--Started from Greencastle
                        in company of deceased and others. Met various parties as we went along who
                        cheered for Grant while we cheered for Seymour. One of these parties stuck
                        out a torch and a banner in our faces. There were Oliver Besore, Frank
                        Miller, Otis Nicodemus and five Lecrones including the deceased. In front of
                        Jere Gordon's met party in a two-seated carriage; four in party; I think
                        they had four torches. We did nothing but cheer. When I had passed about ten
                        yards I heard three shots fired; saw the flash of two shots; they were level
                        shots. The flashes came from the carriage. Some one said one of our party
                        has fallen off. I dismounted, went back and found Lecrone lying on his face.
                        This was after 12 o'clock on Saturday. Turned deceased over; he gave a
                        groan. I then mounted and followed the party in carriage; overtook a man
                        riding; told him Lecrone was shot; he said he would see the party and bring
                        them back. He rode forward and we saw the party increase their speed. I
                        called to them frequently and loudly; was within fifty yards of them; they
                        paid no attention; Miller got ahead of them; they put out the lights. I then
                        overtook the party and Adams called me around the buggy and explained how it
                        happened. Adams stopped wagon and told me he had nothing to do with the
                        shooting; that he and his brother were sitting in front seat and knew
                        nothing until they heard the shots. Benner then said he had fired three
                        shots; he was much troubled, went on everlastingly, cried and said he would
                        rather have lost both arms than have shot him.</p>
                    <p>David C. Nicodemus, sworn:--Between 12 and 1
                        o'clock Sunday morning last, I was returning from meeting at Greencastle
                        with a party of 6 or 8, among whom was deceased. Part was on horseback and
                        two in buggy. At or near Jeremiah Gordon's, we met a party in a double
                        seated buggy.--There were 4 persons in the buggy, and I think they had 4
                        lights. Both parties cheered. One of the parties in buggy stuck his light at
                        me. I knocked it out. Did not hear deceased say anything. Very soon after
                        they fired 3 shots, one right after another. My horse scared and ran toward
                        Mr. Gordon's barn. I looked back and saw deceased fall from his horse. I saw
                        several flashes come from the carriage. Can't say which shot killed Lecrone.
                        I went back to deceased. We took him into Mr. Gordon's house. There were no
                        shots fired by our party. The only firing we had was when one of our party
                        emptied his pistol in the air on the other side of Shady Grove. The hack
                        drove on after the firing.</p>
                    <p>Oliver Besore sworn:--On Sunday morning, about 1
                        o'clock, our party, among whom was deceased, returning from
                        Greencattle to our homes, met a carriage containing 4 persons in
                        front of Jeremiah Gordon's. It was a 2 horse wagon with 2 seats. These
                        persons had lights. There was cheering on both sides. I saw a light knocked
                        out; then 3 shots were fired out of the wagon. Saw 2 flashes; they were
                        about level. I took side of wagon next Gordon's house; deceased took the
                        opposite side. Daniel Lecrone, I think, struck the light. I followed and
                        overtook them near Loose's. Night was not very dark; some stars shining.</p>
                    <p>Jacob Lecrone sworn:--Mr. Miller and I were in the
                        buggy ahead of our party coming from Greencastle; about 30 feet ahead of the
                        party. In passing carriage of Adams and his party we cheered and they
                        cheered. No words except the cheering were spoken by either party. The
                        firing commenced soon after.</p>
                    <p>Henry Lecrone sworn:--I was with party returning
                        from Greencastle to our homes. We met the party in spring wagon at Gordon's.
                        Both parties cheered. Otis Nicodemus and my brother knocked out lights that
                        were stuck out at them by parties in the wagon. I heard three shots and saw
                        Lecrone fall.</p>
                    <p>Verdict--Deceased came to his death at the County
                        aforesaid on the morning of Sept. 20, 1868, at 1 o'clock, from the effects
                        of a wound produced by a bullet fired from a pistol in the hand of a person
                        believed to be one George Benner, of the Borough of Green Castle, in said
                        County, said bullet striking the deceased in the forehead, penetrating the
                        skull, passing through the brain and lodging at the base thereof.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after the finding, the deceased was interred at the family burial
                        ground at Salem Church.</p>
