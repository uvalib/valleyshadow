<b>Crime in the North</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses shock and horror at the high rates of crime in the North. Claims
                    Radicals only concentrate on Southern outrages while morality and virtue decline
                    steadily in the North. Gives several vague examples of horrible crimes committed
                    in cities like New York and Philadelphia.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The increase of crime is frightful.--Murders are becoming a thing of almost
                        daily occurrence. Almost every newspaper contains an account of some
                        terrible tragedy whose details horrify the reader. It is not confined to the
                        South alone. Prior to the election, the Radical press teemed with
                        exaggerated statements of riots and murders prepared to a great extent for
                        the purpose of prejudicing the Northern mind against the Southern people. It
                        was charged that this condition of society was but the fruits of the
                        disloyal seeds that had been sown in the South prior to and during the war.
                        Every assault, every outbreak, every murder, was held to be entirely owing
                        to the rebellious spirit which, it was alleged, still held possession of the
                        Southern heart. The whole Southern people were denounced as unfit to be
                        recognized as the equals of the Northern people on account of their
                        unreconstructed condition. They were held up as fit objects for the hatred
                        of this section on account of their refusal to become civilized like
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Alas! alas! crime has not been confined to the South. The boasted
                        civilization of the North has been disgraced by the commission of the most
                        heinous offences in the catalogue of crime. New England, always on stilts on
                        account of her superior refinement and higher code of morals has been the
                        theatre for the perpetration of the most bloody and brutal tragedies of
                        which history gives any account. Numerous victims have been sacrificed to
                        lust and greed of gold. The young and the old, women and men have fallen
                        before the insatiable passions which spare neither age nor sex. At the very
                        "hub of the universe," the centre of civilization and refinement, where
                        loyalty is purer then is any other part of the Union, crime of all sorts,
                        runs riot.</p>
                    <p>In the city of New York, violence, rapine and murder have had full sway. And,
                        but a few days ago, amid the dreary mountains of the Empire State, one of
                        the most mysterious and atrocious murders was committed that has ever
                        shocked humanity.</p>
                    <p>Even in Philadelphia--the Quaker City--noted for the simple manners and
                        peaceful disposition of its people, the records of the Criminal Courts show
                        an appalling increase of crime. Shameful outrages are perpetrated in the
                        light of day, whilst others of darker hue are committed under cover of the
                        darkness of night. In the very heart of the city, within a fortnight, one of
                        the clumsiest, yet most atrocious deeds of blood has been perpetrated that
                        the mind of man ever planned. Prisons and penitentiaries are all filled with
                        lawbreakers. Our Houses of Refuge are crowded with ungovernable and
                        perfectly reckless boys and girls.</p>
                    <p>And yet, with all this fearful flood of crime sweeping over the North, its
                        people hold up their hands in holy horror at the intelligence flashed over
                        the wires from the South of some riot, or assault and battery in which a
                        negro has been injured or killed. We make broad our phylacteries and stand
                        on the street corners, utter long prayers and thank the Almighty that we are
                        better than the infernal rebels who plunged our beloved land into all the
                        horrors of a civil war. Our morality and piety are shocked at the idea of
                        enfranchising men who drew their swords against their country, and we
                        denounce them as fit truants only of those hot regions to which our loyal
                        hearts would willingly send them. And, all the while, in public and private,
                        in our places of business, in our halls of amusement, in our legislative
                        assemblies, the most open disregard of morality and religion is witnessed.
                        Vice is at a premium--virtue at a discount. We are guilty of almost every
                        offence in the whole catalogue of crime. We have gone up in guilt from the
                        pettiest to the most flagrant and heinous offences, and to-day murder is an
                        epidemic. Let us purge ourselves of our guilt and blood-guiltiness before we
                        set ourselves up as pinks of propriety and models in
                        morality and religion.</p>

<b>A Monument to Our Dead</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In very poetic language, announces a proposal from the Monumental
                    Association to erect a monument to the soldiers of Franklin County who fell in
                    the war. Urges all citizens to support it despite the grief which might arise
                    from memories of their fallen loved ones.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Each one of our subscribers in the county will find to-day enclosed in his
                        paper, an admirable address from a Committee appointed by the Monumental
                        Association. We bespeak for it a careful perusal. It may draw tears from the
                        eyes of many a father as it recalls to his mind sweet recollections of the
                        noble boy who laid down his life for the Union. Or, it may carry a pang to
                        the widow's heart as it calls up before her vision the manly form of him to
                        whom she plighted her troth and who was found "dead upon the field of
                        honor." Or, it may harrow up the feelings of orphaned children as they
                        remember the kind father who was their protector and their guide and who
                        fell beneath the starry banner upon "the perilous ridge of battle." Or, it
                        may pierce the inmost soul of the widowed mother who has stood beside the
                        open graves of both husband and only son, who breathed out their lives amid
                        the rattle of musquetry and the roar of cannon. Or, it may to
                        many, call up old friends of their youth to whom they were bound by golden
                        cords that were ruptured by the mailed hand of war.</p>
                    <p>But whilst, in reading this address, sad memory may throw the light of other
                        days around each and all of these, yet, into their disconsolate hearts must
                        steal the consolation that their friends, who have fallen, bore the national
                        ensign through many a bloody battle and came out without a stain upon their
                        honor. The thought must, to some extent at least, alleviate their anguish
                        that their beloved dead, when in life, performed their duty nobly on the
                        march, in the camp and on the field of battle. And if this be consolation,
                        what a thrill of joy should run through their hearts when they learn that,
                        in recognition of the patriotism and heroism of our gallant soldiery, a
                        grateful people propose to rear a monument to their memories! Here the
                        opportunity is afforded to pay a lasting tribute to those who went from our
                        county to rally round the flag wherever it should be borne.</p>
                    <p>How will their living friends and relatives respond?</p>

<b>The Negro in Congress</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that "by throwing out the vote of certain parishes" an
                    African American from Louisiana was elected to Congress. "From the ballot box
                    the negro stepped into the jury box, from the jury box into the State
                    Legislatures, and from the State Legislatures into Congress. The next step will
                    be into the United States Senate and then into the Presidential Chair. Who
                    wouldn't be a negro? What an unfortunate thing it is for a man's skin to be
