<b>President Moving on Stanton's Works</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Stanton does not find the War Department a bed of roses. True, he sleeps in
                        it, but not from choice. It is a matter of necessity. He fears that, if he
                        leaves it for a single night, he may find, at the dawn of day, some other
                        person in possession. The President is bent on "re-occupying and
                        repossessing" the war office. He has no idea of surrendering his
                        constitutional right to have a Cabinet of his own selection. He does not
                        intend to permit the Senate to encroach upon his privileges to the extent of
                        forcing upon him, as one of his Secretaries, a man whom he has already
                        suspended from the position, in whom he has no confidence, and between whom
                        and himself there are irreconcileable differences of opinion and
                        policy. Accordingly, he has issued an order removing Stanton. in so doing, the Radicals say that he has violated
                        the Tenure-of-Office-Bill, and has thus shown a disposition to resist the
                        Legislative Department of the Government. This,they say, renders him liable
                        to impeachment.</p>
                    <p>In suspending Stanton as Secretary of War, the
                        object of the President was to secure harmony and unity of action in his
                        Cabinet. He knew that "a house divided against itself, can not stand." A man
                        of sensitive feelings, a man of refinement, and one who possessed a keen
                        sense of honor, would have thought it the deepest degradation to remain in
                        such a position; when he was not wanted and when he could not harmonize his
                        views with the opinions of the other gentlemen composing the Cabinet. Not so
                        with Stanton, however. His conscience never troubled him upon this subject.
                        He showed no hesitation in acting the spy. He faltered not at the idea of
                        attempting to hold his place in defiance of the Executive will, and without
                        a single precedent in the history of this nation to sustain him. He,
                        therefore, refused to vacate the War Office, and only yielded "to superior
                        force" in the person of General Grant. Afterwards, he conspired with General
                        Grant to get possession of the office, and, through the damnable infidelity
                        of that officer, succeeded. Here, then, was the extraordinary case, for the
                        first time presented, of a person obtaining possession of one of the Cabinet
                        positions by a trick, without the knowledge and against the will of the
                        President, and claiming to hold it in absolute disregard of his wishes, and
                        open defiance of his authority. The President then determined that this question must be tested. He desired to
                        know whether or not Congress, in a moment of hot anger, could lop off from
                        the President the privilege of selecting his own Constitutional advisors. He
                        resolved that it should be decided whether he or Congress was to be the
                        judge of the propriety of the removal of a Cabinet officer. The
                        correspondence with Grant shows this fact conclusively, that the object of
                        the President in obtaining from Grant the promise not to surrender the War
                        Office to any one but himself, was to have the matter brought before the
                        Courts, so that the opinion of the highest judicial authority in the land
                        might settle the question for all time to come. We are of the opinion,
                        therefore, that the President in issuing the order removing Stanton was animated by the same purpose. He still
                        desires to have the question submitted to the Courts. In commanding Stanton
                        to surrender the War Office to Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas, he places
                        the matter in a position for judicial investigation and decision. If Stanton
                        persists in his refusal to vacate, the Adjutant General will, doubtless,
                        apply to the Courts for a , directing Stanton to deliver possession of
                        the War Department to him under the order of the President.--Stanton will
                        then plead the Tenure-of-Office-Bill as a defense, and the issue will thus
                        be made up.</p>
                    <p>Or, should the Adjutant General take possession of the office by bringing "a
                        superior force" to bear upon the mulish Stanton, he will of course yield
                        under protest, and may then apply to the Courts to redress his grievances.</p>
                    <p>We can not have any doubt as to what the decision of the Court will be.
                        Neither have the Radical leaders any doubt on this subject. They are afraid
                        to allow a decision. They feel assured that the Tenure-of-Office-Bill can
                        not stand the test of judicial scrutiny, judged by the standard of the
                        Constitution. Hence they will resort to every device in order to prevent a
                        decision by the Courts. And even should a decision be rendered by the
                        highest Court in the land against them, we believe that they are so
                        fanatical, and so desperate because of their fanaticism, that they would
                        counsel a resistance of its solemn decree. But let them beware. Perhaps it
                        is best for President Johnson to invoke all the forms of law to his aid
                        before he resorts to coercive measures. He seems inclined to do so. But
                        these Radical leaders can rest assured that, once the Court has decided that
                        he had a constitutional right to remove Stanton, Stanton
                            will be removed if it takes the whole military force of the United
                            States Government to do it. The people are in no mood to tolerate
                        insubordination and further infractions of the Constitution. The President
                        understands this, and threats of impeachment, therefore, carry no terror to
                        his heart. If he had served Stanton as he deserved, he would have ordered
                        the Adjutant General to seize him by the nape of the neck and the seat of
                        the breeches and pitch him into the street. Or, if President Johnson had
                        been inclined to indulge in the exercise of such arbitrary power as
                        characterized the administration of "the late lamented," he would have had a
                        little bell rung, and would have ordered the refractory Stanton to be
                        immured in the old Capitol prison, there to be fed on bread and water, and
                        left to wonder by what authority such summary process was enforced.</p>

<b>The Border Relief Bill</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses support for a bill pending in the Legislature which would
                    compensate losses suffered during Confederate raids. Gives precedents for such
                    action and hopes the Legislature will grant at least partial, if not full,
                    compensation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We stated last week, that the bill which contemplates payment for losses
                        sustained by the border counties during the war, had been reported to the
                        House by the committee to which it had been referred, and we expressed a
                        hope that the Democratic members of the Legislature "would show themselves
                        willing to do justice to the plundered citizens of the border, and let the
                        Radicals shoulder the responsibility of defeating this bill, if it is to be
                        defeated." But we hope the bill will not be defeated. We trust there is
                        enough generosity in the hearts of the people of that portion of the State
                        which escaped the ravages of the enemy, to impel them to "make others' woes
                        their own." They would never miss the little it would take from them, whilst
                        many a sufferer would be rescued from pecuniary ruin.</p>
                    <p>Precedents are not wanting for such action as we urge upon the Legislature.
                        During the Revolutionary war, the Continental Congress made an appropriation
                        for the benefit of the citizens of Portland, who had been plundered by the
                        British. During that same period, the Colony of Connecticut donated five
                        hundred thousand acres of land to the sufferers at New London, part of the
                        town and the shipping in the harbor having been burned by the British. And
                        within the last month or two, the State of Indiana has compensated her
                        citizens for the losses they sustained by Morgan's raid. We have, then, to
                        support the bill now before the Legislature, precedents established by the
                        Continental Congress and by one of the "United Colonies" in the days of the
                        Revolution, and by one of our sister States at the present time. But if no
                        precedent could be found, the appropriation ought still to be made, as being
                        right in itself and demanded by every consideration of justice and
                        benevolence.</p>
                    <p>It will not do to say that the finances of the State would be crippled by
                        this appropriation. The Governor in his Message and the State Treasurer in
                        his Report represent the Commonwealth to be in the most flourishing
                        condition financially. If what they have said officially be true, the State
                        Treasury would experience no embarrassment if drawn upon for the amount
                        appropriated by this bill.</p>
                    <p>We print the bill in another column. It will perhaps disappoint those
                        citizens of Chambersburg who suffered by the fire of the 30th of July, 1864,
                        inasmuch as they would receive nothing under its provisions. Our own view is
                        and always has been, that all the losses sustained ought to be paid in full.
                        But if compensation in full for all losses cannot be obtained at present, we
                        in Chambersburg who suffered by the fire, and to whom partial justice was
                        done by the appropriation of the 15th of February, 1866, ought to be content
                        to see something done for those who have heretofore received nothing. Let us
                        bravely bear up under our losses, and work on and hope that justice will
                        some day be done us. Citizens of the town who were plundered during the
                        various invasions, would come in under the bill. We regret that it does not
                        provide for the payment of all losses, but we presume the Representatives of
                        the border counties have satisfied themselves that an act so comprehensive
                        as that could not be passed at this time. "A half loaf is better than no
                        bread at all."</p>
                    <p>We see nothing objectionable in the bill, except that clause of the first
                        section which provides that the relief proposed to be granted "shall embrace
                        sufferers whose buildings with contents, were burned by deserters from the
                        armies or the draft."--These were acts of ordinary incendiarism, and if the
                        owners of such buildings had taken the precaution to insure them, the
                        Insurance Companies are bound to pay. If they were not insured, the fault
                        was their own and they are entitled to nothing for their negligence.</p>

                    <p>Brooklyn, Feb. 20, 1868</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--From a remark you made in your
                        paper of the 6th inst., you seem to think I have gone over to the Democratic
                        party, bag and baggage; but I have merely left the Radicals and joined the
                        Conservatives of the Johnson and Doolittle kind--Johnson being my choice for
                        the next President. If your party unite on him, the Conservative Republicans
                        will join you in electing him over any Radical that can be brought out. "A
                        word to the wise," &amp;c. Of course we would not join you should you
                        nominate a man of the Vallandingham stripe; in that event, if the Radicals
                        had Chase for their standard-bearer, we would go for him, as he is undoubtly
                        their best man, a statesman of ability, and one that will fill the office
                        with dignity and honor. The greatest objection we have to him is, that he is
                            sorely afflicted with the disease called
                            "nigger on the brain." I was not in favor of
                        Grant before, but since his correspondence with the President, am more
                        opposed to him than ever. He is asking too much of the people, to believe
                        his single statement before that of the
                        President, and four of his cabinet officers, and if he is a candidate he
                        will find out next November which side of the story the majority of them
                        believe. An unprejudiced person with half an eye
                        can see his duplicity in this whole matter and how he was playing into the
                        hands of the Radicals, and deceiving the President at the same time. After
                        this correspondence, Commodore Vanderbilt, a high-toned millionaire of New
                        York, dropped the General, as many others have done. The General is a young
                        man yet, and he had better tarry four years more at Jericho, until his beard
                        is grown longer; and if he improves his statesmanship and morale in that time, he
                        might be elected then; besides, his military reputation will likely gain
                        instead of lose by the delay. A President should be like Ceasar's
                        wife--above suspicion.</p>
                    <p>It is said John Morrissey could borrow $50,000 in Wall Street on his word of
                        honor alone, without the stroke of a pen; but I am afraid a celebrated
                        General could not get that amount in that way, as the lender might think
                        when pay day came around, perhaps, he would say, "I don't owe you anything,
                        say what you please to the contrary
                        notwithstanding."</p>
                    <p>A Southerner was once telling another of his great shooting exploits: that he
                        once shot a deer at a great distance through the hind foot, and through the
                        head at the same time. Of course, the listener was incredulous, and the
                        Southerner asked old Joe, his colored man, if it was not true. "Yes, massa,
                        you see de deer was not more den three miles from
                        us, and as massa fired de gun I saw a fly on de deer's dead, so he lift his
                        hind foot to scratch off de fly; and at de same time I saw de ball go
                        through de foot and de head--dat is a fact." But after his listener had
                        departed, old Joe took his master to task: "Massa, de next time you tell
                        such a story, don't put him so far apart; I had plaguy hard work to bring
                        him togedder."</p>
                    <p>So the next time the General tells a story, let him make it hang together
                        better.</p>
