<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>By Lieut. D.R.B. Nevin, 109th F.V.</p>
                    <p>It was always predicted by those conversant with military tactics, science
                        and strategy, that "Pope's men would be in Richmond before McClellan's." The
                        latter's movements, were said to have been tardy and phlegmatic, while those
                        of the former were animated, spirited, bold and dashing.</p>
                    <p>Pope's flaming manifesto on assuming command of the noble "Army of Virginia,"
                        indicated a vigorous policy, and a determination to be satisfied with
                        nothing less than a full view of ten thousand rebel backs, borne by twenty
                        thousand rebel legs in full retreat, every morning before breakfast. This
                        was a very fine programme, and it was successfully carried out in every
                        particular save one 'slight variation.' It was, this, (and it is so trivial
                        and unimportant as hardly to be worth recording), instead of seeing the
                        enemy's backs, the enemy invariably saw Pope's. The worse luck Pope had, the
                        more newspaper correspondents he lustily cried for, until it was unanimously
                        conceded on all hands, that if he was furnished with a good strong
                        regulation sword, a fast horse, and a brace of reliable telegraph operators. Major General John Pope could demolish
                        more rebels in a given time than any other man in the Army. Heaven protect
                        the Sioux's from his fearful sword! Again, while Banks was trifling away his
                        time about Warrenton, and Siegel and McClellan were securing new bases and
                        groping around in the dark, ninety-seven officers of Pope's command were
                        quietly and unostentatiously marching into Richmond. In that memorable march
                        no man was insulted and private property was duly respected. For his
                        invaluable services, the Administration which is always quick to perceive
                        and ready to execute, promoted the redoubtable Major General to the position
                        of St. Paul's, which is higher up than any other
                        officer has been advanced since the beginning of this very wicked rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The battle of Cedar, or Slaughter's Mountain as it is sometimes called, was
                        the initiatory step of Jackson's march into Maryland, and threatened raid
                        into Pennsylvania. It was rapidly followed up by a succession of rebel
                        victories at Carlett's Station, Manassas, and Bull Run number two. The
                        progress of the enemy's forces was promptly checked at the battle of
                        Antietam w[h]ere our brave troops won fresh laurels, and drove the ruthless
                        invaders back to their own blood stained and unholy soil.</p>
                    <p>The battle of Slaughter's Mountain was a huge mistake--a mammoth military
                        blunder. Government saw it, and rectified it as far as was within its powers
                        by the removal of the originator of it. I will not attempt a description of
                        that battle, but simply state, that it was acknowledged by the rebel press
                        of Richmond to have been the hardest contested engagement that had taken
                        place since the commencement of the present war. The losses on each side
                        were about equal. About seven o'clock in the evening I was captured by a
                        pair of young men attached to the cavalry company of the late distinguished
                        Col. Turner Ashby. A few moments after my arrest, I was brought before
                        General Jackson, who treated me kindly, and quickly asked me some short,
                        pointed questions in relation to the strength of Federal forces, and what
                        "corps" were engaged on our side in the contest. My replies, were not of the
                        most satisfactory character and the General quickly rode away, leaving me in
                        charge of the Colonel of the 33rd Virginia. I was soon relieved of my sword,
                        sash, and revolver, and in company with about ninety other unfortunate
                        fellow citizens, consigned to the mercies of a fierce looking Sergeant with
                        a very heavy guard under his control. About two hours after my capture the
                        sound of heavy artillery announced that our Batteries had renewed the
                        battle, and courted a reply from the enemy. Our guns happened to have the
                        exact range of the camp where we were, which was the old battle field of the
                        afternoon, and for a time caused great consternation, and sad havoc among
                        the enemy. The shrieking hissing shells flew thick and fast around us, until
                        the clarion voice of Jackson ordered us to fall back which was done
                        promptly, and very much to my own personal satisfaction I assure you. After
                        receding about a mile, a halt was ordered, and in five minutes after the
                        command I was soundly asleep in the middle of a large wheat field, perfectly
                        exhausted by the severe forced marches of the last three days, and the
                        terrible excitement of the afternoon's battle. The mental anxiety caused by
                        the stirring scenes of the bloody conflict developed itself during the night
                        by many of my comrades gasping, groaning, and utterly wild incoherent
                        sentences and exclamations.</p>
                    <p>When I awoke in the morning, the bright clear sunlight was shining on my
                        face, and the ragged confederate guards were pacing slowly around the group
                        of captives. It was a lovely holy Sabbath morning and all surrounding nature
                        seemed so sweet and calm and tranquil, as to exclude for a moment all
                        visions and reflections of grim visaged War. Our Sergeant promptly ordered
                        us to "fall in," and in a short time we were on our road to Orange Court
                        House, en route to Richmond. We passed over the battle field as we moved
                        slowly along, and such a sickening sight I never wish to gaze upon again.
                        Headless bodies! dismembered shattered limbs scattered in every direction
                        gave evidence of the fierceness of the struggle and the terrific accuracy of
                        our artillery firing. In one place, hundreds of dead bodies were piled up
                        like cord wood. As we moved further on, we found the enemy removing their
                        wounded as speedily as they could to the rear, in expectancy of a renewal of
                        the fight. Regiments were advancing quickly under the immediate supervision
                        of the ubiquitous and indefatigable Jackson who was calm, cool and
                        apparently hopeful of success. I had a fine close view of "old Stonewall" in
                        the morning as he hurried to and fro with a commendable systematic energy in
                        his every move, action, and command. His dress was plain, and unassuming,
                        and his general bearing unsoldier like. He wore gray homespun pantaloons, a
                        dark jean hunting shirt, and a light cross-barred summer cap and rode a
                        small sized but keen-looking bay horse. As is well known he is the idol of
                        the Virginia branch of the Confederate Army. Great complaint is however
                        frequently made on account of his marching his command too much and too
                        rapidly.</p>
                    <p>In advancing on our journey, we found the main and side roads crowded with
                        tens of thousands of rebel raggamuffins [sic], pressing eagerly forward to
                        reinforce Jackson. As we passed them they made but few remarks concerning
                        us, although occasionally some rude fellow ignorant alike of the rules of
                        civilized warfare and common decency, would perpetrate a coarse joke at our
                        expense. This army was part of the same which was punished by our forces
                        subsequently at South Mountain and Antietam and as I saw their serried ranks
                        moving onward I predicted in my own mind that as they had now passed the
                        Rubicon in the discomfiture of Pope, it would require almost superhuman
                        force to keep them from pressing into Pennsylvania. Had they succeeded, the
                        border counties of our State would have suffered worse than did the
                        beautiful valleys of the Rhine from the huge armies of Louis XIV at the
                        close of the Seventeenth Century, houses burned, crops ruined, churches
                        desecrated, and women and children outraged and insulted.</p>
                    <p>A march of ten miles brought us to Orange Court House which is an old
                        fashioned, but rather thrifty comfortable looking county town of about two
                        thousand population. We were placed in the yard fronting the country
                        building, and surrounded by a heavy guard. At 7 o'clock P.M. we were
                        furnished by our captors with some original 'Jeff Davis crackers' as they
                        were called, which were, if such a thing is possible harder and more
                        unseemly than our own Federal army crackers. This was the first morsel I had
                        to eat since four hours before the fight commenced on the previous day, and
                        the crackers did indeed taste delicious. After sleeping in the open yard all
                        night unprotected by any covering, we started in the morning to the depot to
                        await the arrival of the cars which were to convey us to Richmond. Presently
                        the train hove, in sight, consisting of twenty-one
                        cars, filled with the dead and wounded. This sight, appeared to
                        incense the miscellaneous crowd at the depot against us, and it would have
                        required but little to have raised a mob which would have disposed of us
                        very summarily. The commissioned officer who had charge of us, acted in a
                        very manly way, and silenced the crowd by swearing roundly and loudly that
                        he would shoot down the first man who dared to raise a hand against any
                        prisoner under his charge. The crowd roared out for a time that by Jeff
                        Davis's late proclamation we were not prisoners of war and would be 'strung
                        up' anyhow as soon as we reached Richmond, and that by hanging us on the
                        spot transportation might be saved. In a few moments however the train
                        started and in three hours we were in Gordonsville. Here, we were taken from
                        the train to the Provost Marshal's Office. That functionary was one Dr.
                        Boyle, a renegade from Washington, and about the seediest looking specimen
                        of pomposity I have seen for a long time. He volunteered a great deal of
                        impudent advice to us, informed us very politely "that he hadn't the least
                        doubt we would have our cravats very materially
                            tightened [sic] when we reached the Capital, and wound up
                        requesting his Sergeant to convey us to the guard
                        house. Thither we went, and found ourselves soon jammed into a small
                        dirty room, with a hundred or two of the filthiest wretches you ever beheld.
                        They were principally deserters, many of them from North Carolina
                        regiments--were very communicative, tried to be agreeable, in fact, appeared
                        to have tried a little of everything except soap and water. Their amusements
                        appeared to be very limited. They would sing 'My Maryland' and then take a
                            scratch, discuss the Partisan Ranger
                        question, curse Jeff Davis and Secretary Malory, and then take another scratch, roll on the floor and try to sleep, smoke
                        their nasty pipes, and make themselves most especially and generally
                        disagreeable and repulsive. For forty-eight hours we were confined in the
                        miserable loathsome cell, and during that time received
                            but four dry crackers to each man. After that time right glad
                        were we to have the sergeant of the guard summon us so get ready for
                        Richmond. As we marched to the cars, we passed Major General Stewart and
                        Staff. There is nothing peculiar, or particularly striking about his style
                        and manner, although as you are well aware he is a dashing horseman, and a
                        great favorite in the southern ranks. He is apparently a man of forty years
                        of age, with long red hair and beard and is remarkably tall, perhaps six
                        feet two or three inches. I also saw in Gordonsville, a man who had more to
                        do in bringing Jackson's forces into Maryland and along our border, than any
                        other man in the South. I refer to Col. Bradley Johnson, formerly of
                        Frederick, Md., as contemptible, and blatant a boaster and braggart as
                        treats the globe. In Frederick, he bore the reputation of a drunken
                        'rounder,' and by forming an alliance with the southern army was petted for
                        a time by men of some standing about Richmond, simply because he hailed from
                        the dubious and time-loyal state of Maryland.</p>
                    <p>He represented to them that an advance of their forces in to his State would
                        develope [sic] a tremendous uprising of the people, who would bail the
                        advent of the stars and bars with every token of delight. We all remember
                        his proclamation to the citizens of Frederick, when Jackson made his
                        unfortunate pic-nic excursion to that place. The infamous misrepresentations
                        of this man have redounded to his own discredit, and the Administration at
                        Richmond have publicly and righteously stigmatized him as a falsifier.</p>
                    <p>Leaving Gordonsville in a train of cattle cars at 8 o'clock P.M., after an
                        unpleasent [sic] ride of five hours we arrived at Richmond, and surrounded
                        by a strong guard were promptly marched along the dark, silent streets of
                        that famous and yet infamous reservoir of treason, to the celebrated Libby
                        prison. Our names were quickly registered in the office of the institution,
                        our clothes thoroughly searched, and the turnkey without speaking a word,
                        rudely pushed us into a room as dark as Erebus, turned the key, and left us
                        alone to our reflections[.] I stood perfectly still, lest by moving, I might
                        tread on some sleeping prisoner, for the deep breathing and heavy snoring
                        indicated that there was any quantity around me. I did not speculate on
                        matters long, but, tired, hungry and covered with dust, sat down on the
                        floor and was quickly sound asleep.</p>
                    <p>'Libby Prison,' which has acquired considerable notoriety, on account of
                        being the princidal [sic] depot in the South for the storage of Northern
                        prisoners, consists of three large three story brick buildings adjoining
                        each other. Each of these buildings has been used for the tobacco commission
                        business, and in their external and internal appearance differ but little
                        from a similar number of large business houses in any of our Northern
                        cities. The management of the establishment, is in the hands of Brigadier
                        General winder, Post Captain Wirts (an ugly customer), Adjutant W. Peacock
                        (an Englishman by birth, and a deserter from New York Ninth) and Commissary
                        Sergeant Hitchcock. The latter was kind and accommodating, and will never be
                        forgotten by our group, for his many little acts of courtesy and kindness to
                        us. Post Captain Wirts is an Austrian by birth; and for many years figured
                        as a turnkey in one of the most prominent prisons of Vienna. He is a
                        bilious, sallow, cross, disagreeable a man as I ever saw. Always scolding,
                        never smiling, every effort of his to be spiteful and revengeful was
                        invariably a most brilliant success. When the flag of truce boat would
                        arrive, bringing our letters from kind absent friends, and when we were
                        anxiously expecting to have them sent in, this man would expose them to our
                        view, handle them, and then return them to his pocket, for the sole purpose
                        of tantalizing us. This he would do day after day, after the arrival of
                        every boat, and our letters would never reach us until they had remained a
                        week or two in the hands of this incarnate fiend. Adjutant Peacock was one
                        of your harmless unpleasant men who took great delight in telling us all the
                        bad news he possibly could, without favoring us with even the smallest
                        possible allowance of good news. He openly boasted of his desertion and
                        justified it because our Government took no step to have him released when
                        he was captured by the rebels and thrown into prison at Salisbury, N.C.</p>
                    <p>Libby prison has many different apartments devoted to the various classes of
                        prisoners that are confined within its walls, such as Northern citizens,
                        wounded and sick Federal soldiers, Federal privates, McClellan's and
                        Burnside's officers, Pope's Hessians, and the
                        basement is appropriated to the northern negro servants. Of the several
                        classes enumerated, each party had a separate room of which I know but
                        little excepting the particular apartment appropriated to the commissioned
                        officers of General Pope, who by special proclamation of his Excellency,
                        Jefferson, the First were to be treated as felons and outlaws, and not as
                        prisoners of War.</p>
                    <p>The room referred to, and in which I spent six long and dreary weeks before I
                        recrossed its portals was eighty feet long, and forty wide the ceiling or
                        upper flooring supported by fourteen large pillars. The flooring was covered
                        with coarse thick matting of tobacco juice and dirt about an inch thick,
                        which could not be eradicated by the combined efforts of soap, water and
                        brush. The year of the room, faced on the canal and James river, the front,
                        on what had formerly been a prominent business locality, but which now
                        looked as deserted, as if infested by the Plague. This was the room into
                        which I was ruthlessly thrust on the night of my arrival in Richmond, and on
                        awakening in the morning I found it to contain a motely [sic] assembly of
                        about three hundred persons, consisting of sutlers, ambulance drivers,
                        sanitary committees, Brigadier Generals, Field Staff and Line Officers, with
                        a sprinkling of Richmond pick-pockets, burglars, and hotel-thieves. The
                        latter select representatives were inserted for the purpose of making Pope's
                        officers feel as disagreeable as possible, and I must say, the plot
                        succeeded remarkably well. The door of our room was always open, and
                        protected by a sentry. Another sentry figured in the ante-room, while a
                        whole chain of double guards completely encircled the entire building to
                        provide against any possible contingency of our escape. The position was a
                        most humiliating one, and in direct violation and contravention of all known
                        rules of civil[i]zed warfare throughout the world. The sentries were
                        generally rough illiterate fellows who had been readily taught to offer us
                        any indignity they possibly could, and as they patroled [sic] along would
                        frown on us as if we were so many assassins and horse-thieves.</p>
                    <p>Stately sentry! Stalwart sentry, <br>Pacing by yon massive gate, <br>Why
                        cast thy furtive glances <br>Of Vengeance and of Hate, <br>As you stalk
                        along so measuredly <br>Apast my prison gate?</p>
                    <p>We are no groveling felons, sir, <br>But
                        slandered by the name-- <br>We'll wear the loathsome stigma <br>Till
                        posterity and fame <br>Shall wipe it out and give to thee <br>A transfer
                        of its shame. <br>Thou art guarding, trusty sentry-- <br>Of the dark and
                        flashing eye, <br>Thou art guarding moral heroes <br>Who would rather
                        kneel and die, <br>Than compromise a bar or note <br>Of Freedom's battle
                        cry </p>
                    <p>In a late number of 'Blackwood,' there is an interesting, well written
                        article on the courtesies of war which I would commend to the Secretary of
                        War, of the great unrecognized Southern Confederacy. The manner in which we
                        were treated in many particulars, while inmates of the Confederate State
                        Prison, was shameful, and a disgrace to the age. Contrary to general belief,
                        I must state that the rations allowed us were of a very good quality
                        consisting of good bread, fresh meat, salt, vinegar and soap. I will quote
                        from my memorandum book a few instances of coarse brutality on the part of
                        the sentries, whose crimes were winked at by the prison officials, and
                        openly applauded by some of the Richmond papers. 'Aug't. 19th. Lieutenant
                        Campbell shot by the rear sentry--severely but not mortally wounded.' This
                        occured [sic] about 6 o'clock. A.M, Lieut C had been washing at the hydrant,
                        and while drying his face with a towel unthinkingly walked towards the
                        window to inhale the fresh morning air, the miscreant sentinal [sic], not
                        ten paces off, took deliberate aim at him and fired, the ball passing
                        through his left side, and the fleshy part of his left arm. Five hours
                        afterwards, the Rebel Surgeon came in to dress his wounds. Lieut. Campbell
                        is attached to the regular army, and his family reside in Pittsburg [sic].</p>
                    <p>Aug. 21st Lieut. Fisher, U.S.A., heavily ironed by Post Captain Wirts for
                        using the word 'rebel' in one of his letters. Lieut. F. was a delicate
                        sickly officer, and for using the word rebel
                        instead of confederate, was sent for by Wirts,
                        who upbraided and damned him most unmercifully and then sent him to our room
                        heavily ironed.</p>
                    <p>Sept. 5th, Sutler Higgins, of Philadelphia, shot through the heart by Sentry
                        Owens, Co. E Elliot's City Battery. Higgins was a fine looking respectable
                        man, and was reclining on his cot reading at the time he was shot. He
                        expired in five minutes.</p>
                    <p>Sept. 18th 9 o'clock P.M. A citizen prisoner from an adjoining room was shot
                        by the guard in attempting to escape. The report of the firing soon caused a
                        miscellaneous excited crowd to congregate in front of our room, armed with
                        shot guns, revolvers, axes, &amp;c. It was with the greatest difficulty
                        this mob was restrained from breaking in and butchering us in cold blood. We
                        were unarmed, and of course could make no resistance.</p>
                    <p>Among the papers in Richmodd [sic] that were anxious to excite public wrath
                        and indignation against us, none figured more energetically and
                        surreptitiously to attain that end than the "Dispatch."</p>
                    <p>Day after day this blood thirsty editor who controls that infamous sheet,
                        would exaggerate the ou[t]rages of the northern soldierey [sic], and call
                        upon the Administration to lopp of[f] the heads of a few of Pope's officers.
                        At every act and order of Butler in New Orleans, or Hunter in the
                        south-east, this coarse brutal demon would point the excited public eye
                        towards us and roar lustily for more blood!</p>
                    <p>The amiable Post Captain Wirts allowed a Sutler to come into our quarters
                        three times a week, of course, he had nothing to
                        do with a division of the huge profits made off by the Yanks.' We exchanged
                        our funds for confederate money, receiving forty
                        per cent premium for the same. The sutler furnished us with a variety of
                        vegetables &amp;c., at the following reasonable rats, which in justice
                        to him I will state, were but a fraction higher than the actual prices paid
                        for the same by the citizens of Richmond I open market. Potatoes eight dollars per bushel, Tomatoes, Onions, apples,
                        peaches and cigars, one dollar per dozen, sugar
                            seventy-five cents per pound, coffee, three
                        dollars per pound, and matches seventy-five cents
                        per box.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally, Post Captain Wirts fearing that reading the morning papers was
                        entirely too much of a luxury for us, would prohibit their introduction. And
                        when we did receive them it was at twenty-five
                        cents each. At one time anterior to this unholy rebellion the
                        'Examiner, Enquirer and Whig, were as ably edited papers as could be found
                        in the country. Now they are pale, sickly, billious [sic] looking
                        half-sheets, filled with low scandal and substitute advertisements; a good substitute brings from ten to fifteen hundred
                        dollars. Our amusements while in prison were meagre. The bone-ring business
                        soon lost its charms, and the peach stone trade became stale and
                        uninteresting. When we would hear bad news (and Heaven knows we heard enough
                        of it within those hateful walls.) we would go to bed. When we heard good
                        news from the North, we would innocently ask the Post Captain 'if there was
                        anything up,' and serenade him with the 'red white and blue,' and old John
                        Brown.'</p>
                    <p>Our stay there made us quite conversant with the culinary and laundress
                        professions, and it was no uncommon sight to see at one view, a portly
                        Colonel peeling potatoes, a dashing Aid de-camp stewing tomatoes, and some
                        tasteful young Lieutenant hanging over the fire, with a face as red as a par
                        boiled lobster, cooking 'hash' and such 'ash'! may I never look upon its
                        like again! We had our jokes, our songs and our puns 'ad Libby-tum.' We had
                        Cribbage, muggins, draughts and [illegible]ack straws; we were restricted of
                        course, but yet we had more license than one
                        would suppose.</p>
                    <p>During our entire imprisonment no one in our body bore himself more like a
                        soldier and gentleman than Brigadier General Prince of the Regular Army. He
                        had no complaints to make, and only smiled contemptuously at the indignities
                        which were attempted to be heaped upon a man of his rank and position. The
                        battles in Maryland had much to do with our release, and on the 26th day of
                        September after an incarceration of forty-two
                        days in a semi-dungeon as loathsome as the Bastile [sic], we were hurried
                        away early in the morning to escape the mob. We engaged carriages at five dollars a seat, and in two hours reached our
                        flag truce at Varina. Ragged, hungry, weak and dejected, can I describe to
                        you our feelings as we approached our little vessel with the old stars and
                        stripes floating gaily from its flag-staff. As we boarded her, we made the
                        very welkin ring with three times three, and a tiger that made the little
                        craft fairly shiver at her moorings.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The election is over and has resulted gloriously for the Democracy. We have
                        elected our candidate for Congress in this district, the State Senator and
                        both members of the Legislature. On the County ticket we have elected the
                        Sheriff, District Attorney and Director of the Poor, and on the balance of
                        the ticket are boaten [sic] but a few votes. Well done for Franklin County,
                        which gave a majority of one thousand against us last year.</p>
                    <p>The result in the State has been equally glorious and cheering for the
                        Democracy. We have elected a majority of members of Congress and a majority
                        of eight or ten of the lower branch of the State Legislature, which gives us
                        a majority on joint ballot and secures the election of a Democrat to the
                        United States Senate in place of Hon. David Wilmot. The vote on the State
                        ticket is close, but it is generally conceded now, that Messrs. Slenker and
                        Barr, the Democratic candidates for Auditor General and Surveyor General are
                        elected by small majorities.</p>
                    <p>Thus has the glorious "old Keystone State" spoken in favor of the
                        Constitution and Union, as they were made and transmitted to us by our
                        revolutionary ancestors, and against the many arbitrary and tyranical [sic]
                        acts of the party in power, against the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the loyal States, against the
                        arrest of peaceable citizens without warrant or authority of law and their
                        confinements in Forts and Bastiles without being allowed a hearing, against
                        the unconstitutional proclamation of the President, proclaiming freedom to
                        3,000,000 negroes in the South, to be turned loose upon the country, to
                        enter into competition with white men and eat out their substance, and
                        against fanaticism, bigotry, tyrrany [sic] and despotism in all their
                        different phases and forms.</p>
                    <p>In Ohio and Indiana the verdict in favor of the eternal principles of
                        Constitutional liberty , as maintained and defended by the Democratic party
                        has been still more emphatic and decisive. Will Mr. Lincoln listen to the
                        voice of the people, as expressed through the ballot box? Will he now cut
                        loose from those radical and dangerous men, whose mad counsels he has lately
                        followed? Will he retrace his steps, discard radicalism, plant himself
                        firmly on the broad principles of the Constitution, adhere to the old
                        landmarks and make an honest effort to save the Government from destruction?
                        If he will do this all may yet be well. If he will do this the Democratic
                        and Conservative masses will rally to his support as one man, in a vigorous
                        prosecution of the war for the suppression of this unholly [sic] rebellion
                        and the restoration of the Union as it was and to maintain the supremacy of
                        the Constitution, with all the rights of the citizen under it, remaining
                        unchanged and unimpaired.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Lincoln will thus steer the ship of State, in the course indicated by
                        the people at the ballot box, we repeat, all may yet be well. If he will not
                        do it and refuses to be governed by the voice of the people at the ballot
                        box, we repeat, all may yet be well. If he will not do it and refuses to be
                        governed by the voice of the people, we will be launched out on a sea of
                        chaos without either rudder or compass to steer the old ship, and the best
                        Government ever devised by the wisdom of man we fear, will be totally
                        destroyed for want of a proper helmsman, and with it constitutional liberty
                        on this Continent. Will he heed the warning?</p>

                    <p>This filthy and disgusting vehicle of lies and blackguardism, in its issue of
                        the 15th inst., copies a short account of the Rebel Raid into this county,
                        from our local columns, and says:</p>
                    <p>"The above is all a Breckenridge organ could utter in reference to the
                        outrages of the rebels in Chambersburg, while it devotes a whole page of the
                        same number to the abuse of the loyal government, now struggling to put down
                        rebellion, &amp;c."</p>
                    <p>It is scarcely necessary to make any reply to the Telegraph. It has become so mean and despicable as to be beneath
                        the notice of respectable people and consequently harmless. It is owned by a
                        miserable Hessian and is edited by a hired mercenary.</p>
                    <p>We had previously announced that our paper would be issued on Saturday, and
                        all our matter was prepared with that view. On Friday night the rebel horde
                        came down upon us, rendering it impossible to carry out our intention. The
                        short account we published was written hastily on Monday morning while the
                        forms were closing and contained all the facts in
                        relation to this humiliating invasion. We had neither time nor inclination
                        to write a column or two of sensation stuff, containing little else than
                        falsehood--we leave that to the Telegraph--and
                        contented ourself with giving the truth in a small space.</p>
                    <p>The Telegraph lies deliberately, and wilfully
                        [sic] lies when it charges us with devoting any space to the abuse of the government. We never
                        have abused, and never will abuse our government.
                        We love it with our whole soul, and will always stand up for and defend it
                        against the assaults of its enemies be they Abolitionists or Secessionists.
                        Yet we must be permitted to dissent from a number of the acts of the present
                        Administration, which our judgment cannot approve. We have supported, and
                        will always support, the Administration in a vigorous and energetic
                        prosecution of the war for the suppression of this infernal rebellion, but
                        when it urges measures destructive of that end we will raise a warning
                        voice, and so far as we can, endeavor to stay the mischief.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a future raid into Cumberland Valley, should the rebels
                        succeed in penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Bergner will not be found this
                        side the Canada line, and we much doubt if the Telegraph will contain either a long or short account of it, until
                        they have retired, or been driven back as far as Richmond.</p>

                        Correspondence of the Spirit and Times.
                    </p>
                    <p>Camp Near Sharpsburg, Md. <br>October 18th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: In a letter from Virginia during
                        the first rebel invasion of Maryland, your correspondent stated that he had
                        concluded to write a few lines, although he felt uncertain whether
                        "Stonewall" Jackson would allow you to publish them; week before last,
                        however, the most stringent orders being left by Gen. Stewart (as he passed
                        through our lines, on his small pleasure excursion through Franklin County)
                        positively forbidding newspaper correspondence, on pain of confinement in
                        the "Libby" prison; and, at the same time, several of our Generals having
                        expressed a desire that the important military movements then on foot, (and
                        which no doubt completely took you all by surprise) should not be made
                        known; and also bearing, from "a most reliable gentleman, just from the scat
                        of war," that the Valley Spirit office was burned
                        to the ground, your correspondent concluded to await patiently "the
                        development of events." And this is why you received no letter last week.
                        Strange to say, we of the army of the Potomac, who had gone forth, with so
                        many loud words about protecting our firesides from the ruthless tread of
                        the invader, first learned of the Rebel occupation of Chambersburg, through
                        a stray copy of the Philadelphia Inquirer which
                        reached camp by way of Harper's Ferry; and you may easily imagine the
                        excitement that one paper produced. Never before had that journal been so
                        successful in its role of a "sensation"
                        newspaper. A hundred men wanted to read at once, and those who read aloud
                        were only greeted with cries of "louder! louder!" from the unfortunate ones
                        on the outer circles of the crowd that assembled almost in the twinkling of
                        an eye. Some doubted, some disputed, and, I am sorry to say, some few swore,
                        despite the general determination to keep up the reputation of the regiment
                        which seems so prevalent since our water-melon spree. But there it was in
                        black and white: Col. McClure and "Provost Marshal Stimmell" had done the
                        work, and Chambersburg was part and parcel of the dominions of Jefferson D.
                        In fact many had already begun to discuss the questions of
                        allegiance--Chambersburg has united her fortunes with the Rebel States, is
                        it our duty to go to the South also or to remain with the North. Thus we
                        reasoned, and after several days deliberation, we concluded to adopt the
                        former alternative, and, on Thursday morning, the 12th, in company with a
                        number of other Pennsylvania Regiments, boldly marched out of their camp,
                        crossed the Potomac--all the hills to their rear covered with frowning
                        cannon--passed a short distance beyond Shepherdstown, and their laid down
                        their arms--for a few moments rest. What else they did I will record further
                        on.</p>
                    <p>I would not be considered estimating lightly the seriousness of the late
                        Rebel raid. We felt the mortification and disgrace keenly, anxious
                        countenance could be seen amongst us for many dreary and uncertain days, and
                        we now sympathize deeply with those who have suffered by this daring
                        movement; but the consequences are so much lighter than we believed them to
                        be, that we all console ourselves by laughing away our "blues," and treating
                        the affair as a very good joke, as it certainly is upon us, who marched to
                        the Potomac to defend our homes.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday night, we received orders to prepare two days cooked rations and
                        to be ready to march at daylight--where, we knew not. Soon after gaining the
                        road, however, our faces were turned towards Dixie, and expectation was at
                        once on tip toe. We crossed the canal and river, the water being two or
                        three feet deep, and the morning sufficiently frosty to render the cold bath
                        exhilarating. After passing through Shepherdstown, where we saw but a single
                        manifestation of Union feeling several companies were deployed to the right
                        and left as skirmishers, among which were company A. Capt. Doebler had
                        orders to follow and keep in sight of a company of the 91st Penna. The
                        Captain of this company, being rather incautious, exceeded the rule always
                        to keep wit[i]n sight of your regiment, and led us quite a distance from the
                        road. In the mean time our whole Division had halted, but we kept on until
                        we came near a battery which had opened up and was doing some heavy firing,
                        thinking it was ours. When within a distance of two or three fields of it,
                        the Captains ascended a little knoll, to get a better view of it, when, lo
                        and behold! it was firing directly towards our main body! This was deemed
                        strange conduct for a Federal battery and we were just beginning to fall
                        back on to safer ground, when around turns one of the guns upon us, and
                        "whiz-z-z--bang" goes a shell within thirty feet of us. "Forward! Double
                        Quick!" is so promptly obeyed, it needs no repetition--and then comes
                        another shell still closer. Ugh! it sounds as if it was coming directly
                        towards your head. But no, it strikes the ground and is buried--no
                        explosion; boys you are safe! Now make the ravine as soon as possible. You
                        are in the rebel lines; get out of the range of those guns, and you may get
                        safely back, if there are no cavalry on your track. We did reach the
                        ravine--the gunners lost sight of us--and there was no cavalry on your
                        track. We did reach the ravine--the gunners lost sight of us--and there was
                        no cavalry in pursuit. So we live to record the adventure.</p>
                    <p>After regaining the regiment, our whole Division was formed in line of
                        battle. The Eleventh Regulars to the right of the main road, the 126th
                        immediately in their rear; the Fourteenth Regulars to the left and the 91st
                        Penna. in their rear. The others following in solid column. After advancing
                        in this way, for several miles, the cannonading to our front became
                        deafening, and the shells whistled by us or exploded in the air over our
                        heads. We draw near the junction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the
                        Shepherdstown and Winchester turnpike; the Regulars cross the hill: "Halt!
                        Ground Rest." More terrifically roar the cannon, and suddenly the rattle of
                        musketry breaks upon the ear, sounding like pop guns or the crackling of a
                        large fire beside the deep voiced Parrott guns. Look sharp, boys, the
                        Regulars are at it, and we come next. The Regulars are at in good earnest,
                        too, firing a volley and advancing with a cheer. There comes an Aid, now is
                        our time: "Attention Batallion [sic], shoulder arms, forward march!" is
                        quickly and firmly given and as quickly and firmly obeyed. Into the hollow
                        we go, and up the next hill; on before us go the Regulars; and away
                        "skedaddle" the Rebels--leaving us in possession of the field, and five of
                        their dead. Our loss was confined to the regulars--and amounted to one
                        killed, one mortally wounded, who died the same night, and a half dozen
                        slightly wounded. The rebel position was well chosen, the country being very
                        hilly and so thickly wooded that but a few hundred yards were visible at any
                        one time. Their force consisted of a Battery, two regiments of Infantry and
                        a battallion of Cavalry.</p>
                    <p>It was almost dark, and our cavalry having reported the enemy still
                        retreating, our officers deemed it best to go no further; and we retired a
                        mile or so from the railroad and encamped for the night. We had taken no
                        extra luggage with us but our overcoats and two days rations, and it rained
                        heavily nearly all night. So you may imagine, we had a dreary time of it.</p>
                    <p>Early next morning we were on the march, after the retreating few. He did not
                        care, however, to give us battle, though his cavalry generally kept in
                        sight. We had started out, with a force of about ten thousand, to make a
                        reconnoisance in force as far as Leetown, and to return if possible by the
                        end of the second day. We reached the vicinity of this place, nearly ten
                        miles from Shepherdstown, about noon, and, after halting an hour for dinner
                        and rest, started on our homeward march. We had succeeded in opening
                        communication with McClellan from Harper's Ferry. But we had heard nothing
                        from the Williamsport reconnaisance and it was reported that a heavy rebel
                        force was advancing upon us from that direction. It was therefore desirable
                        to reach the river before dusk, and we marched the whole distance at quick
                        time, with but a single rest of a few moments, and reached camp by ten
                        o'clock at night, wet, sore and almost exhausted. Passing through
                        Shepherdstown, on our return, the regiment sang the Star Spangled Banner,
                        Hail Columbia, and other patriotic airs, for the especial edification of its
                        rebel population. So ended the reconnoisance from Conrad's Ferry, which was
                        pronounced by Gen. Porter to be the most successful of any of the war.</p>
                    <p>To-day Gen. Thomas, Assistant Secretary of the State of Pennsylvania,
                        presented the 126th, 129th and 134th Regiments with their State flags, in a
                        neat address. Gen. Humphreys, in handing them to their respective regiments,
                        expressed the wish that they should never be given up to the foe unless he
                        directed it; if they complied with this request they would take them home
                        with them without a stain of dishonor.</p>
                    <p>I take pleasure in recording the fact that Major Austin has been reinstated.
                        His friends felt confident that an investigation of his case would see him
                        righted. He has not yet joined the regiment but is expected here in a few
                        days.</p>
                    <p>Strange as it may seem to you, we had an election in Camp, last Tuesday,
                        despite the decision of the Supreme Court against the constitutionality of
                        the army vote. And stranger yet not a single Democrat dreamt of an election
                        being held, until noon of Monday, when the papers were sent to the Captains
                        of Companies, yet these same papers had been in camp, together with a
                        bountiful supply of Republican tickets, more than
                        a week. There not being a single printed Democratic ticket at hand, those of
                        that persuasion at first determined not to vote, but, on Tuesday morning,
                        some of us concluded to do so, merely to give an expression of our opinions
                        for we attached no consequence to the result of the army vote. Had we had
                        tickets and a days more time, we could with a little exertion, have polled
                        at least forty more votes that we can now count. I give you the returns for
                        some of the principle offices, which will no doubt be a matter of interest
                        to some of your readers.</p>
                    <p>Election Returns, 126th Regiment, P.V.</p>
                    <p>The eight Franklin County companies give a majority of about 141 for the
                        Republican State ticket.</p>
                    <p>No doubt many of your Franklin County "par-excellence patriots" will try to
                        account for the recent Democratic victory by alleging that all the
                        Republicans have gone to the war, and the Democrats remained at home to
                        vote. You can readily give the lie to the assertion by refering [sic] to
                        these returns. There are but one hundred and forty one more Republican
                        voters than Democratic voters in the eight companies from Franklin, while
                        the Juniata companies have given very respectable majorities for some of the
                        Democratic candidates. All told these were but 208 Republican votes polled.</p>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Philadelphia Inquirer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A great deal has been said about the "cowardice" of the Chambersburgers. It
                        is said they might have repulsed and routed this attacking force one
                        thousand cavalry with very little trouble, or at least scared them away, as
                        did the farmers of Adams county. Certain it is there was a strong desire
                        evinced by the Home Guard of Chambersburg to meet the enemy in battle army.
                        There were fifteen hundred stand of arms, and accoutrements and ammunition
                        there sufficient to have protected the place, but it is said no one would
                        give permission to distribute these arms and accoutrements.</p>
                    <p>We copy the above from the Harrisburg correspondence of the Philadelphia
                            Inquirer of the 13th inst. We are at a loss
                        to know how this truthful correspondent got his
                        information. The "Home Guard" mustered exactly forty-eight men, with
                        muskets. The rebels numbered about 1500 men with carbines and four pieces of
                        rifled cannon. Had our Home Guard and citizens tried to scare them "as did the farmers of Adams county," it would have
                        required no Prophet to predict the result. The "fifteen hundred stand of
                        arms" numbered four hundred packed away in boxes in a ware house around
                        which a rebel guard was placed before one fourth of our citizens knew that
                        the Philistines were upon us. It would have been an act of madness to have
                        made resistance under the circumstances, and would have involved the total
                        destruction of the town. The people of our town are as brave as any people.
                        It is usually the habit of cowards to stigmatise others with "cowardice."</p>
                    <p>We intend organizing a Brigade of Scarers to
                        operate in case of future raids, and would like to get those "Farmers of
                        Adams county" as veteran scarers to join. The position of Brigadier will
                        remain open for the correspondent of the Inquirer. He is the right man for the position.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are informed by a gentleman residing in the Southern part of this township
                        that, a few evenings since, three big, ugly, black female niggers came to a
                        farm house in his neighborhood and asked to stay all night. But they were
                        told they could not stay.</p>
                    <p>A few moments after the arrival of the wenches--the "contras" having the
                        affair all arranged--there came a second lot, consisting of four big, ugly,
                        black male niggers. The family became still more frightened at this new
                        feature in 'politics,' said they could give them their supper, but could not
                        possibly accommodate them through the night.</p>
                    <p>The darkies, thinking there was no 'millenium' [sic] about that kind of talk,
                        spoke up all about the same time and all in about the same strain, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>'O yes, dat's de way we am served; you white people in de Norf told us to run
                        away from our masters, an' would treat us like brudders an' dis am the way
                        we am treated.'</p>
                    <p>A lively war of words here ensued--in fear on the part of the white family,
                        but in an insolent and determined manner on the part of the niggers.</p>
                    <p>They took the supper; and not only that; but they staid all night against the
                        remonstrance of the proprietors of the house, and never said so much as even
                        'thanky.'</p>
                    <p>The beauty of the thing is, however, the whole of this white family, who were
                        slaves to the nigger on this occasion, had been pretty well abolitionized,
                        arose the next morning with the dawn, most effectually cured of
                        abolitionism, and about as good Democrats as that ism generally makes--and
                        it makes them when it does make, most awful sound!</p>
                    <p>This is only the beginning. Before a great while these runaway blacks will be
                        among us as thick as five in a bed.--Perry County
                        Union.</p>

                    of Harper's Ferry. He had, in fact, urged its evacuation and the occupation of
