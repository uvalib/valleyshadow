<b>Correspondence from Camp Curtain</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    <p>Letter from Camp Curtin.</p>
                    <p>
                        Correspondence of the Spirit and Times.
                    </p>
                    <p>Harrisburg, Aug. 9, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors. According to promise, I intend to chronicle and transmit to
                        you, weekly, such items of information as will be of general interest, in
                        reference to the brave boys who have recently left Franklin county, in
                        defence of the honor and the flag of the country, under the recent call of
                        the Governor.</p>
                    <p>The first Company on the ground from our county, and the first full one in
                        Camp Curtin, under the three months call, was the "Chambers Infantry."
                        Escorted to the Depot by hundreds of their fellow citizens, their whole
                        route was a complete ovation--at all the way-stations large crowds has
                        assembled cheers welcomed the volunteers, and the air was filled with
                        fluttering cambric. On their arrival at Harrisburg the Company were marched
                        to the "mustering" office of Cpt. Lane, then dismissed for dinner, and
                        subsequently marched to Camp Curtin, a distance of a mile and a half, under
                        a broiling hot sun. This tried the endurance of the delicate young "infants"
                        considerably for the first day's experience in soldiering. One of the
                        Company, from whom the perspiration was rolling profusely, drolly remarked:
                        "If this continues much longer I am afraid I'll meet a watery grave." As the
                        remark was considered unpardonable in a veteran, he was politely requested,
                        by a companion in arms, to "dry up," which, however, he positively refused
                        to do until he reached the shade. After reaching Camp Curtin, the Company
                        underwent a medical examination, when, with one exception, all were passed.
                        The examining surgeon is Dr. Miller, of the vicinity of Greencastle. He is a
                        very clever gentleman, and has the reputation of being a thorough master of
                        his profession. After the examination, we drew our camp equipage and
                        rations, and proceeded to pitch our tents, and we all congratulated
                        ourselves on doing very well for the first attempt. We have the Sibley tent,
                        roomy, high and round, quite an improvement on the old fashioned tent, and
                        by placing board floors in them, have rendered them as comfortable and
                        healthy as the driest house.</p>
                    <p>The Companies thus far in camp from Franklin county, with their commissioned
                        and non-commissioned officers, as far as they have yet been chosen, are as
                        follows:</p>

                        appointed.</p>
                    <p>Franklin Rifles--Captain, John H. Reed; 1st
                        Lieut., Jeremiah Cook; 2nd Lieut., J.C. Hullinger.</p>
                    <p>St. Thomas Company--Captain, James G. El-Elder
                        [sic]; 1st Lieut., John Walker; 2nd Lieut., Josiah W. Fletcher. A
                        McConnellsburg and Greencastle Company combined--Captain J.C. Austin; 1st
                        Lieut., Henry M. Hoke; Second Lieutenancy vacant.</p>
                    <p>There has been no movement yet, towards regimental organizations. It was at
                        first suggested and hoped that we should secure Capt. David McKibben of the
                        regular army, as our Colonel; but I now understand that the Government will
                        not consent to the arrangement; after Capt. McKibben. I think Major Elder of
                        St. Thomas is the unanimous choice of the regiment for the colonelcy. There
                        seems now to be no doubt but that all Franklin county companies will be
                        thrown into one regiment. We already have eight companies here, and Capt.
                        McKnight's and Capt. Crouse's companies are expected to-morrow. If this
                        arrangement is consummated, it will make the associations of the Camp much
                        more pleasant for us all.</p>
                    <p>Troops are literally pouring into Camp. We now number about twelve thousand,
                        and by Sunday evening expect to have fifteen thousand here; which with the
                        men already at Philadelphia, Lancaster and Pittsburgh will make at least
                        twenty-five thousand men, that Pennsylvania will be able to furnish for nine
                        months, under the first call. If all portions of the State had responded as
                        nobly as did Franklin county, we would have had twice this number by this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>As far as I have learned, all are delighted with camp life. The weather has
                        been fine, though excessively warm during the day--the nights however, are
                        moonlight, cool and pleasant. The kind friends at home should not picture to
                        themselves dreary scenes of the camp, and imagine that their "brave soldier
                        boys" are in the least low-spirited or discontented, for a more jolly set
                        were never seen. Wit and pleasantry rule the hour, and everything goes as
                        "merry as a marriage bell." Speaking of marriage, some of our young
                        gentlemen, concluding to take time by the forelock, have already been united
                        in the "holy bonds." Doubtless you have already heard of this at home. They
                        have the hearty congratulations of all their friends.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we have not the remotest idea when we will leave this. It may be
                        weeks hence. But the camp ground is now so filled with tents that there is
                        no drill ground at all, and some of us may soon be "shipped" to make room
                        for the others.</p>
                    <p>Letters, for the present, should be directed to the care of the captains of
                        the several companies, Camp Curtin, Harrisburg.</p>
                    <p>Camp is now under command of Capt. Tarbutten. Lieut. Welsh of our Company is
                        acting as his adjutant.</p>
                    <p>There have been so few incidents of interest or importance, that I fear this
                        letter will not prove as interesting as I had hoped. Good bye until next
                        week.</p>
                    <p>K.</p>

                    <p>Messrs Editors: Sirs. I had the pleasure a few
                        days ago to get my hands on your valuable paper of the 16th of July, and was
                        surprised to see my Thompkinsville letter meet with such good success, as to
                        find a place in your columns, as it was my first attempt at newspaper
                        correspondence.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors permit me in the first place to correct an error in my last
                        letter. It being David H. Piper, who died at Gallatin Tenn. Martin Piper is
                        now at home on furlough, and Jonathan Piper is at home as a paroled

                    <p>When this letter reaches you the news of our "skedaddle" from Thompkinsville
                        will be old and stale.</p>
                    <p>After enjoying a month's rest at Thompkinsville, during which, time glided
                        smoothly along, until Court commenced on the 7th of July, the citizens
                        anticipating some trouble during court, Major Jordan was reinforced by Co.
                        E., 2nd Batt., (Lt. Sullivan), in order to quell any disturbance, increasing
                        his force to about 250 effective men.</p>
                    <p>That same night (Monday) Maj. Jordan made an excursion over the Cumberland
                        river to Celina, to see if there was any rebels lurking around there. Seeing
                        none, he marched back to camp, where he arrived at 1 P.M. Tuesday, having
                        seen no signs of the enemy, we felt rather secure that night, having no idea
                        that while we were crossing and recrossing the river at Celina, Morgan and
                        his thieving band were crossing at Bennet's Ferry, a few miles above.
                        Wednesday the 9th, at daylight, our pickets were driven in by Morgan's
                        advanced guard, which rather surprised us. We had barely time to dress,
                        saddle up and form into line, when the enemy charged upon us. Although there
                        was 8 to 1, we gave them a warm reception. Morgan's force was 2,000 with 3
                        pieces of artillery, a Georgia regiment, a Tennessee regiment, and the Texan
                        rangers who were defeated near Munfordsville, by part of the 32nd Indiana,
                        last winter. We gave them "Hail Columbia" until the shells commenced
                        dropping around us, when Maj. Jordan ordered a retreat, which was
                        accomplished in good order till we got into the woods, when we were met by a
                        volley from the Texan rangers. By turning to the left we succeeded in
                        getting through a space they had not yet closed. Although hardly pressed by
                        the Rangers, our little band of patriots kept well together until the poorer
                        horses began to lag behind. We were pursued about 5 miles, the Rangers
                        succeeding in wounding the Major's horse in the shoulder and taking him
                        prisoner, and killing Lieut. Sullivan of Co. E.</p>
                    <p>We retreated by way of Burkesville to Albany, where we arrived about 10 P.M.,
                        and bivouacked in the courthouse yard. And instead of finding the protection
                        there that we expected, from the 60th Indiana, Col. Owen, and Maj. Brown
                        with Co. K. of the 9th Penna., we learned to our regret that they too had
                        skedaddled, on the strength of the report that we had been cut to pieces by
                        a large force who were advancing on Albany. We left Albany at sunrise,
                        Thursday, and overtook Col. Owen near the Cumberland river, which we
                        recrossed and bivouacked for the night. That evening we got a light supper,
                        after a fast of 48 hours and a skedaddle of 60 or 65 miles.</p>
                    <p>The result of the enemy calling on the "Pennsylvania Dutch" at such an
                        untimely hour, should convince them that the "Keystone boys" do not like to
                        be disturbed before breakfast, as their loss was 30 killed and Col. Hunt of
                        Georgia, mortally wounded, who has since died. Our loss was 4 killed, Lieut.
                        Sullivan of Butler county, Corp'l McClintoch of Perry county, and 2 unknown
                        to me; 7 wounded and 20 prisoners, who were paroled, Jonathan Piper of
                        Franklin, being among the paroled prisoners.</p>
                    <p>The officers and men of the 3rd Batt., 9th Reg't Pa. V.C., conducted
                        themselves most gallantly. The most remarkable for coolness and bravery was
                        Capt. Longsdorf of Company I. At no time during the action did he seem to be
                        at a loss, until the Major gave the order to retreat which he seemed not
                        comprehend the meaning of, as he only taught his men to fight and not to
                        retreat. During the fight he was in front of his company, and in the retreat
                        he was found in the rear urging on the slower ones to make their escape,
                        occasionally riding forward to get horses for them, and urging them onward.
                        Which was the cause of killing a fine blooded horse for him. Although a
                        strict disciplinarian, he asks nothing of his men only what it is their duty
                        to do. And in returns [sic] does all for them that is in his power to do.
                        Consequently the boys think they have the best Captain, and he thinks he has
                        the best company in the regiment.</p>
                    <p>Our 3rd Batt., lost everything except what they put on in a hurry, amounting
                        to a loss of about 10,000 to the government.</p>
                    <p>Although we felt uneasy for the welfare of friends who were left behind, we
                        still had some amusement on the road. For the first 10 miles there was any
                        amount of hats and caps to be seen, the bushes would pull them off and the
                        boys would not stop to get them. So also revolvers. To show the hardships
                        that some endured that were so unfortunate as to be unhorsed on the way, I
                        will relate a single circumstance: Sergeant Blain of Company C. was taken
                        prisoner twice and escaped. C.J. Eckenrode was unhorsed on the way, and in
                        trying to escape the pursuing rebels fell in with Sergeant Blain, and they
                        did not catch up till Saturday night, having walked 42 miles that day, and a
                        corresponding number each of the other days.</p>
                    <p>The most diabolical act committed during the present (accursed) rebellion,
                        was done by one of the Texan Rangers while pursuing us.</p>
                    <p>They stopped at a house to get a drink, and after the young lady had
                        satisfied their thirst, one asked her if she had seen any of "Lincoln
                        hirelings" passing. She replied that she had not, but that she had seen some
                        Union soldiers passing. He then asked her which way they had went, and she
                        said she did not know, and if she did know she would not tell him, when he
                        fired his gun at her and lodged a bullet and eight buckshot in her breast,
                        lodging in her, visible through the skin. She lingered two days and died a
                        martyr to the Union.</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Batt., and Company E of the 2nd, with the 60th Indiana, arrived here
                        on Monday the 15th of July. We rested till Friday when we drew fresh horses
                        and new clothing, and at noon started in pursuit of Morgan. At Danville we
                        were reinforced by some of the 7th Kentucky cavalry, and a company of Home
                        Guards. And at Richmond, which we took without firing a gun, we were joined
                        by Col. Williams with the balance of the Lochiel, except Company G. We
                        continued to pursue Morgan at a safe distance, till near Somerset, when we
                        were ordered back to Lebanon. At Richmond (not Va., but Ky.) we were just 1
                        day behind Morgan, and though we had to take his leavings, we were most
                        hospitably entertained by the loyal citizens. In fact everywhere we go here
                        in Kentucky, we are treated very kindly, and sustain a good reputation. We
                        have been here now about ten days and feel pretty well recruited. Most of
                        the missing at the fight have rejoined their respective commands. We are
                        under marching orders all the time. Going so far once as to cook two days
                        rations, and saddle our horses, which we had the pleasure to unsaddle again.
                        We are how under Gen. G. Clay Smith.</p>
                    <p>For fear of wearying the patience of your readers, I will bid you and them
                        adieu for the present.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following interesting article we copy from the last number of the Lutheran Observer. It will be found interesting to
                        many of the citizens of this community, and is from the pen of the venerable
                        Dr. Kurtz, who was at one time pastor of the Lutheran congregation of this
                        place.</p>
                    <p>Though we are not quite "three score and ten," nearly all our contemporaries
                        have passed into another state of existence. Here and there we hear of one
                        or another, silvered with age and worn down with infirmity, still lingering
                        on this side of "death's cold stream," but expecting to launch away at every
                        change of the season, and indeed liable, on each returning day, to be
                        summoned on the impending transition. But these vestiges of a past age are
                        so "few and far between," that they may be fitly compared to "the gleanings
                        of the olive tree, two or three on the topmost branches."</p>
                    <p>Of the scores and hundreds who constituted the large Lutheran congregations
                        at Hagerstown when we took charge of it, but a solitary one, so far as we
                        can ascertain, remains, viz., "Father Shryock,"
                        who, in that day, was an active, pious young man, known by the name of
                            "Captain Shryock," as he had just returned
                        from the war of 1812 with Great Britain on the grave question of "Free Trade
                        and Sailor's Rights," in which war he commanded a company of volunteers from
                        Hagerstown. He alone loiters with us in the rear, the great bulk having from
                        year to year "gone the way of all flesh." Thus, the third and fourth
                        generations now compose for the most part the existing Lutheran congregation
                        of that place. The first generation consisted of aged men and women; the
                        second we received into the church, and now constitute, so far as they in
                        small number still survive, the second; and their children and
                        grand-children the third and fourth, who now fill up the same pews occupied
                        by their forefathers a half century ago.</p>
                    <p>The last time we administered the Holy Supper as pastor of that church, we
                        had upwards of five hundred communicants, now,
                        (thirty years having elapsed) the number scarcely reaches three hundred! What has become of the thousand subsequently admitted by our faithful
                        successors? A large portion emigrated to Ohio, or further west, and became
                        the nuclei of Lutheran churches there; another
                        proportion have been transferred to heaven, we trust, and the remnant are
                        dispersed sparsely in Maryland, but chiefly in trans-alleganean regions.</p>
                    <p>What we have said in relation to Lutherans at Hagerstown applies, in a good
                        measure, to those in Chambersburg, Pa. We took charge of that church in the
                        summer of 1831. Those who were the fathers and main-stays at that period
                        have nearly all disappeared. The Hecks, Decherts, Suesserott, Radesbaugh,
                        Hutz, Eyster, Smith, Wunderlich, Miller, Rudisill, and numerous others whom
                        we might mention--where are they now? Almost all are gone to their long
                        home, scarcely a remnant yet lingering and trembling on the verge of the
                        grave! Oh, the heartless doings of death! What desolation among the children
                        of men!</p>
                    <p>But their places have been supplied. In that pastorate, too, God favored us
                        with a mighty and glorious (ruinous!!!) revival.
                        Scores were awakened and converted, and some still remain to tell with
                        wonder and grateful admiration of the triumphs of divine mercy during that
                        season of gracious visitation. How many were added to the church we have
                        forgotten, but the number was great beyond all precedent in the history of
                        that congregation. Among those then brought into the Lutheran church were a
                        number of Presbyterians, the elite of the town, and also Frederick Smith,
                        Esq., a lawyer of extensive practice. He had been Speaker of the House of
                        Representatives of Pennsylvania, and was within an ace of becoming Governor
                        of the State. During the revival, God's grace laid hold of him with great
                        power, and he became a deeply penitent sinner and subsequently a very
                        consistent and exemplary christain [sic]. As we required all our converts to
                        attend a course of catechetical lectures, Mr. Smith applied for admission
                        into the class. We directed him to procure a Lutheran catechism and study it
                        carefully; but as he was a highly intelligent as well as converted man, we
                        remarked to him that, though we wished him to attend the instruction, yet he
                        need not take his seat among the young catechumens and repeat the catechism
                        to us in rotation with them. His reply was: "No, sir; I ask for no
                        exemption; I wish to pass through the same ordeal, and enter the church
                        visible in conformity to the established usage and precisely as others do."
                        We felt somewhat rebuked by his manly and noble reply; assured him it was
                        highly gratifying to us, and he should carry out his purpose; which he
                        faithfully did, never omitting a single lecture during the whole course,
                        which lasted two or three months.</p>
                    <p>But our pious brother Smith, some two or three years ago, like others, have
                        exchanged the church militant for the church triumphant. Indeed, the doings
                        of the relentless monster-tyrant have been particularly extensive and
                        desolating in Chambersburg during the last few years. A week or two ago the
                        departure of D Dechert, Sr., was recorded in the Observer; a short time anterior, that of Mr. Snyder, Mrs.
                        Berlin, &amp;c. But a few lines from brother Steck, the present worthy
                        and faithful pastor, will here very opportunely answer our purpose. Under
                        date of July 22, 1865, he writes:</p>
                    <p>"Rev. Dr. Kurtz, Dear brother: Enclosed you will
                        find still another obituary notice, which you will please have published in
                        the Observer. I trust the Lord's hand will be stayed ere long, and that it
                        may not be necessary for me to send such communications so frequently in the
                        future. This church has been much afflicted of late in the death of its aged
                        members. Within a few years, George Eyster, Maj. Heck, Mrs. Flack, Mrs. U.
                        Washabaugh, F. Smith, Charles Hutz, Elizabeth Weiser, George Polmer, Mrs.
                        Berlin, Jacob Etter, Mr. and Mrs. Snider. Daniel Dechert, Sr., and Mrs. Fry,
                        have all died; the last eight all within the last six months. Our church is
                        looking young on account of frequent deaths among the aged members. My
                        prayer is, that it may not lose the vigor of youth, while it has its
                        appearance."</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Berlin, named above, originally a Miss Dechert (by a first marriage Mrs.
                        Suesserott, and mother of Professor Suesserott) was emphatically a
                        whole-souled and devoted Lutheran. Decidedly pious, intelligent and
                        consecrated with all her heart to the best interests of the church, her
                        house was ever open to Lutheran ministers, and her activities were always
                        employed in behalf of spiritual Lutheranism. She was an eloquent advocate
                        and unconditional friend of everything good, and while nothing grieved her
                        more than to hear any report unfavorable to the clerical character, she
                        would make no compromise with any minister who habitually walked unworthy of
                        his calling. She was "a great talker," and more than once we reproved her
                        for it, which, however, she kindly received, and really tried to restrain
                        herself. But her fluent conversation was not only tolerable, but always
                        interesting and instructive, because it was so perfectly easy and natural to
                        her, spiced with so much good sense, and ever on the side of sound
                        principle, correct deportment and genuine piety. If ever we had a devoted
                        friend, Mrs. B. was one, and while memory endures we shall cherish, in
                        grateful remembrance, her numerous kindnesses. Her faithful husband, now
                        descended far down the vale of life, still survives. He must, we presume, be
                        more than four score and four years of age. A truer friend than Philip Berlin the Lutheran church in general, and
                        especially in Chambersburg, could never boast. Once he was wealthy, and then
                        he gave his money as well as his prayers and labors freely and liberally for
                        the good of the church, whose welfare lay as near to his heart as any
                        interest on earth. We always esteemed him highly, and do so yet, and pray
                        God to shed increasing light upon his declining path, and smooth his
                        downward passage to the tomb! Oh, how terrible are the doings of inexorable
                        death; what countless myriads have been swept away, and are being constantly
                        hurried into the grave; and how soon the places that know us now, shall know
                        us no more forever. We feel as if we had a much larger number of friends and
                        acquaintances among the living ransomed of the Lord in heaven than we have
                        among the dying probationers of earth. May He by his Spirit stir us all up
                        to die unto the world and have our conversation in heaven; yea, to die daily
                        as the Apostle did, that, like him, we may rise hereafter to an "inheritance
                        incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away."</p>
                    <p>We cannot close this effusion of the heart without relating an anecdote in
                        reference to our old friend, Daniel Dechert, whose demise in the 83d year of
                        his age was recently reported in the Observer. When, with family, we removed
                        to Chambersburg in 1831, we arrived in the afternoon, tired, jaded in mind
                        and body, our family partly sick, and we ourself unwell and full of anxiety.
                        The family had eaten but little that day, and that early in the morning.
                        Everything in the house was still packed up, and no convenience for
                        preparing even a frugal meal. Without fire, without pot or pan at hand, or a
                        single convenience for cooking, we began to cast about for something to eat.
                        In the midst of our wants and our cares, a friendly neighbor appears, a fine
                        broad honest face, a bright countenance lighted up with smiles, an eye
                        beaming with good nature, bearing with him loads of provision nicely cooked,
                        including the best of coffee, and all smoking hot, with compliments from his
                        wife, and a request that as we could not yet be in a condition to prepare
                        food, we would be pleased to accept of what he spread out before us. Here
                        were meat, and bread, and butter, and vegetables, &amp;c., just what was
                        needed, and rarely more needed, more opportunely presented more gratefully
                        received, nor with greater zest enjoyed. This neighbor was our good old,
                        unwavering friend, Daniel Dechert. The impression made on us and our family
                        by this timely deed of benevolence, was deep and indelible, and can never be
                        erased from the tablet of memory. Acts of kindness are always praiseworthy,
                        but when thoughtful and opportune, they are doubly so. "Blessed are the dead
                        who die in the Lord, for their works do follow them." "To do good and to
                        communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As previously announced the Valley Spirit and
                            Times newspapers have been consolidated under
                        the joint proprietorship of the undersigned, and with this number commences
                        the publication of the united paper under the title of the "Valley Spirit
                        and Times." The union of the two papers we conceive to be calculated to
                        promote the interests of the Democratic party, and as far as the influence
                        of our paper may extend, the welfare and prosperity of our beloved country.</p>
                    <p>The books of the Valley Spirit office commencing
                        with the first day of January last, have also been transferred to the new
                        firm, which will avoid the necessity of any change in the business relations
                        of that establishment with its patrons, and the business will be conducted
                        as heretofore under the name and style of B.Y. Hamsher &amp; Co.</p>
                    <p>Having thus briefly explained the nature of the change consummated, in a
                        business point of view, we deem it necessary to say a few words in regard to
                        the course we intend to pursue in the future conduct of this journal and the
                        principles which shall govern us in our future editorial career.</p>
                    <p>We intend our paper to be thoroughly Democratic and devoted to the
                        dissemination of Democratic principles, believing, as we do, that those
                        principles eminently conduce to the happiness and prosperity of the people
                        and the perpetuity of our noble form of government. It will advocate a
                        vigorous prosecution of the war for the suppression of the existing wicked
                        and monstrous rebellion, and urge as the duty of the government to call out
                        the strength and resources of the nation immediately, to an extent
                        sufficient to crush out this gigantic insurrection, to the end that our
                        glorious Union may be maintained and the Constitution and laws vindicated.
                        It will maintain that the safety of our republican institutions lies in the
                        paths of conservatism and constitutional liberty, aloof, alike from the
                        wicked heresies of the Secessionists of the South, and the dangerous and
                        destructive doctrines of Abolitionists in the
                        North. It will ardently sustain all the measures of the present
                        administration, necessary to restore the Union as it was--the Constitution
                        as it is, and extend the authority of the Government over every foot of
                        territory bequeathed to us by our revolutionary ancestors, and acquired by
                        the blood and treasure of the people.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the proprietors of the papers whose separate existence has been
                        extinguished by the union effected, we return their heartfelt thanks for the
                        generous support extended to them separately, and bespeak a continuance of
                        it to our present enterprise.</p>
                    <p>With these remarks we submit our paper to the public, hoping to receive a
                        liberal share of patronage, which we shall at all times endeavor to merit.</p>

                    against the Bank of the U.S., and its support for Lincoln in the face of the
                    attack by the South on the "government of their fathers." However, most
                    Democrats still believe Lincoln's platform was sectional and they oppose the
                    policies urged on him by radical members of Congress. They especially object to

                    witness, they were not black but "quadroon," about one-fourth black and
                    three-fourths whites, born of white fathers and quadroon mothers. At that time,
                    says the story, these people were "a respectable class possessing some property,
                    and owning slaves themselves. They do not associate with the blacks."<br>

<b>Confiscation</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues against confiscation of Confederate property, stating that it would
                    do more to punish the innocent rather than the guilty. The majority of the
                    people in the South, argues the writer, did not support secession but were
                    forced into it by an armed minority. The government should not punish their
                    treason if it cannot protect their loyalty. If the loyal men of the South were
                    given a chance to come back on fair terms, they would do so.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Louisville Journal</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are no advocate at all, says the Louisville Journal, for that rosewater policy that would use no severity
                        against the guilty in this rebellion. On the contrary, we do not think there
                        is any punishment they do not deserve. Injustice, however, is not policy in
                        any case. There is nothing but evil in it. Hence we are utterly opposed to
                        all confiscation bills, as they punish more of the innocent than of the
                        guilty. For this reason corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during the
                        lifetime of the convicted, are forbidden in our Constitution. If the
                        Constitution imposed no restriction on the power to punish treason, still
                        the reasons against confiscation remain. The late bill applies only to
                        future acts; but it applies to all who are in arms sixty days after a
                        proclamation by the President. Now, if men South were free, there might be
                        some reason in that; but they are under a de
                        facto Government, a military despotism; and what right has a
                        Government to punish a man for treason if it does not protect him in his
                        loyalty? Men South are driven into the army, and have no choice in the
                        matter, they can't obey proclamations if they would. The application, of
                        such a law, therefore, is exceedingly unjust. It is well known that no State
                        went out of the Union by the vote of her people. An armed organization
                        silenced the loyal sentiment in Tennessee. We may rail at a majority that
                        allowed a minority to play the despot over the State; but men armed and
                        organized can hold in terror any community unarmed and unorganized. Indeed,
                        a measure so palpably unjust will always defeat itself. It will never be
                        executed. We have said a Government can't punish disloyalty unless it can
                        protect the loyal. We often hear that no loyal sentiment appears in many
                        sections of the South which our armies pass through. We are not surprised at
                        it. The citizen knows that any demonstration on his part friendly to the
                        Government will be watched and punished if the army leaves, and consults
                        only his self-preservation by silence. After the sixty days allowed by the
                        law expire, then what is the citizen to do? He can have no motive to come
                        back to the Union; but the strongest that can operate upon the human heart
                        to resist to the last extremity. We asked a Union man from Alabama if the
                        people of that State would come back to the Union. His reply was, that we
                        gave them no chance to come back; we offered them only the halter and
                        confiscations. Such laws, then, only operate as scare-crows to scare men
                        into the Confederate armies, whilst they don't reach the guilty at all; and
                        hence they will not be sustained by the moral sense of mankind. The great
                        mass have been driven into rebellion by intimidation. The leaders care not
                        for confiscation bills. They dare the penalty of death, and deride
                        confiscation, which only serves to fasten into their service all who are in
                        the power of their de facto Government.</p>

<b>Important from Harrisburg</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes that Pennsylvania's share of the two recent calls for troops, at
                    300,000 men each, will total 92,841 men, which will have to be met by a draft if
                    the quota is not reached by August 15. Thus far, over 20,000 men have
                    volunteered under the new call, and the author is confident that the state will
                    fill its quota, "though it will take every third able-bodied citizen in the
                    State." There is an effort being made to appoint the national tax collectors
                    from among the ranks of the war wounded, rather than giving the positions to
                    political partisans.<br>
