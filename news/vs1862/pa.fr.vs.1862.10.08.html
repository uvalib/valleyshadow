<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from a correspondent in the 126th Reg't Penn. Volunteers, from
                    near Sharpsburg, MD, dated October 4. He relates the presentation to Company E
                    of a flag made by the ladies of Waynesboro. The flag was presented by Hon.
                    Edward McPherson. The troops were recently reviewed by President Lincoln and
                    General McClellan. Corporal Emanuel Forney discovered a buried Confederate
                    cannon in a field. A number of men were left at hospitals in Washington then
                    sent to a "convalescent camp" in Virginia, which is reputed to be a terrible
                    place. Captain W. W. Walker has been detailed to report to the Provost Marshal
                    of Pennsylvania in order to arrest deserters, and the regiment has suffered
                    heavily from desertion.<br>(Names in announcement: Corporal Emanuel Forney,  Abraham Huber,  J. Henry Hutton,  J. G. Lindsay, Capt. W. W. Walker, Hon. Edward McPherson,   Cleverstone)</blockquote>

                    <p>Camp Near Sharpsburg, Md. <br>October 4th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors: An interesting ceremony transpired
                        in camp on Wednesday last, consisting of the presentation of a stand of
                        colors to Company "E." (Capt. W. W. Walker's) by the ladies of Waynesboro,
                        quite a number of whom were present on the occasion. The Presentation Speech
                        was made by Hon. Edward McPherson, who spoke in substance as follows:</p>
                    <p>Officers and Men of Company "E," 126th Regiment Penna., Vols: It has been
                        made my welcome duty, by the Ladies of Washington Township, a delegation of
                        whom are here to enliven this occasion, to present you a beautiful Stand of
                        Colors, in token of their personal regard and the lively interest they feel
                        in the glorious cause in which you are enlisted.</p>
                    <p>Soldiers! You have volunteered in the army of the Union! You have grave
                        duties before you. The honor of the community from which you come, the honor
                        of the State you represent, are in a great measure, reposed in your hands.
                        The safety and honor of the Republic is to be tested on the coming fields of
                        battle. The problem of the nations existence is there to be solved. On those
                        bloody fields, if you are permitted to do so, you are to carry this flag.
                        Let it never be dishonored. Let it never be trailed in the dust. It is in
                        itself a beautiful flag--bearing on converse sides the arms of the Union and
                        the arms of Pennsylvania--the Nation and the Keystone of the Federal Arch,
                        forming a grand combination; and more than this, it comes from those who
                        will watch your advancing footsteps with breathless anxiety, and who will
                        pray for your safety with earnest hearts.</p>
                    <p>You are portion of a "grand army" of Pennsylvania; and you and we will have
                        cause to be proud of our State. The grand outpouring of her hundreds of
                        thousands has astonished the nation and made its enemies quail.</p>
                    <p>Take this flag; bear it in front of your columns; and when you return home,
                        as God grant you may, bring it back with you and let it be cherished and
                        preserved, and handed down to posterity, as a valuable relic.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Colonel Rowe responded on behalf of the Company: Sir--Company "E" have
                        delegated me to thank you, and though you the Ladies of Waynesboro, for the
                        present they have made us. This flag has been presented from Waynesboro.
                        That name calls up a thousand pleasant recollections! It comes from home. That word alone would be sufficient to
                        recommend it to our care and guardsmanship. It comes from a place called
                        after the immortal revolutionary hero "Mad Anthony," and his noble example
                        will teach us that, having gone forth to battle for liberty and right, we
                        must do or die. Its presentation to day seems to revive the days of
                        chivalry. With this flag at its head, Company "E" will go forth, to battle
                        not only for the honor of the state and nation, but also for the honor of
                        its lady loves.</p>
                    <p>The ladies of Waynesboro have always been formest [sic] in their works of
                        benevolence and of patriotism. They have furnished invaluable aid to the
                        Sanitary commission--and food and conveniences and delicacies to the sick.
                        As their last act of patriotism they present this flag; and on our part we
                        pledge our lives that it shall be brought back from the wars, if not with
                        honor, at least without dishonor. Company E, is the color company. Its
                        members came to fight for the honor of the nation's flag, and although this
                        is a company flag, it is still the Stars and Stripes.</p>
                    <p>We take this flag, with grateful acknowledgments, and when we return home,
                        how proudly will it wave, as we march through your streets! We will then be
                        again at our homes with your approving faces around us, and we will bear
                        that flag through your midst without a blush of shame.</p>
                    <p>We had a grand review, on Friday, by President Lincoln, Generals McClellan
                        and Porter, and a number of other military celebrities. Our Division and
                        those in our immediate vicinity were ordered under arms about nine o'clock
                        in the morning, and there they lay under a broiling hot sun, until between
                        one and two in the afternoon, when the customary salute, twenty-one guns,
                        fired by the division next below us, announced the approach of the
                        Presidential party. The President, in citizen's dress, rode a black charger
                        (a remarkably hard trotter, by the way, of which fact "father Abraham"
                        seemed painfully conscious); on his right, rode General Humphreys, Division
                        Commander. They were followed by Generals McClellan and Fitz John Porter,
                        riding side by side, the remainder of the party following in double file.
                        They simply rode in front of the different regiments, the men being at a
                        "present," the drum corps discoursing their very choicest, the officers
                        saluting, and the colors drooping, as they passed. The President seemed much
                        fatigued, and had no doubt been engaged in the same occupation since early
                        in the morning, and had several hours' more hard riding and reviewing before
                        him, before the day closed. The general impression seems to be that this
                        tour of inspection of the President's looks to an immediate forward
                        movement. Two facts he has no doubt had impressed upon his mind--that the
                        army is anxious to move at once, and that General McClellan, above all
                        others, possesses its confidence. The President must have had in view some
                        such object as is above indicated, for he is not the man to travel around,
                        at so much inconvenience and loss of time, merely for a little glory and
                        display. One thing is certain, we have generally had good results from Mr.
                        Lincoln's visits to the army; it does him good, occasionally, to cut loose
                        from the politicians and have a few days' honest chat with the soldiers.</p>
                    <p>On Friday, company A captured, or perhaps I should say found a magnificent twelve pound Parrot gun, which had been
                        buried by the retreating rebels in a field near our camp. Corporal Emanuel
                        Forney happened to be crossing this field and discovered what he supposed to
                        be portion of a shell or round shot. On kicking it with his foot, he soon
                        discovered it to be the knob on the breach of a large cannon. Our little
                        friend is somewhat excitable, and withal a great humorist; so you may
                        imagine he cut some strange antics. He summoned some of company A to his
                        assistance, and they soon exhumed the rich prize, and carried it to head
                        quarters, where there was great exultation over the "capture." This is the
                        first of the enemy's cannon company "A" have taken, and the boys say they
                        are determined it shall not be the the [sic] last. Since the discovery there
                        has been a perfect furore after buried canon, and the neighboring fields
                        stand a good prospect of being dug down all over to the distance of several
                        feet. It is reported that several soldiers have already by reason of
                        scarcity of spades and picks, worn away their nails to the quicks. it is
                        astonishing how reports become exaggerated. The first rumor your
                        correspondent heard of the cannon finding, was to the effect that "Mawny
                        Forney had found six twelve pound Parrott guns, and had just carried them
                        all into camp." The corporal, it will be remembered, is five feet two, and
                        weights something near a hundred. The report did
                        sound rather improbable, but as Forney is capable of almost anything, we
                        followed the crowd and soon learned the true state of the case.</p>
                    <p>Abraham Huber and J. Henry Hutton of Co. A, J.G. Lindsay of company D
                        and--Cleverstone of company G, who were left at the Hospitals in Washington,
                        and afterwards sent to the "Convalescent Camp," in Virginia, have again
                        reached the regiment, in good health. They all speak of this "Convalescent
                        Camp" as a wretched place. There are about eighteen thousand men there, of
                        whom scarcely the slightest care is taken. A late Washington paper says:
                        "Language is inadequate to portray the miserable, filthy, neglected and
                        starving condition of these men. Those who visit here are compelled to
                        exclaim, "can it be possible that these are human beings to be thus treated,
                        in a christian land, by a nation professing christianity." It is sincerely
                        to be hoped that the proper authorities will give this matter their
                        immediate and earnest attention.</p>
                    <p>I have heretofore made it a rule, and shall continue to observe it in future,
                        not to refer to those who have been sent to the Hospital, for the reason
                        that this is frequently done for but slight illness, and a notice of the
                        fact might cause much needless anxiety among friends at home. Cases of
                        serious illness or accident however, I will notice.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of sick and wounded rebel prisoners in the hospitals near
                        camp. Many of them talk very fairly, and are anxious to see the war closed
                        on any terms; but some are still vindictive in the extreme and laugh at all
                        idea of the South returning to her allegiance. They all seemed very
                        a[n]xious to see McClellan, the other day; and several of them stated that
                        his ability was fully conceded in the Southern army. The mortality among
                        them is very great; from the one hospital, in our camp, from three to six
                        are buried daily; and in all there were scarcely more than fifty there, when
                        we came. The government provides for all their wants; but their own men,
                        left in charge, seem to take poor care of them. They are interred in an
                        adjoining field, and small wooden head boards are placed to their graves,
                        bearing their names.</p>
                    <p>The Railroad bridge at Harpers Ferry is completed; the first train crossed it
                        to-day. we will now be able to establish a basis for supplies on the
                        Virginia shore, as soon as we make our advance.</p>
                    <p>A few days since, I paid a visit to the Reserves and the 107th. They lay on
                        our right, about three miles distant. They have suffered severely in the
                        late engagements. The 107th made a most gallant charge at the battle of
                        South Mountain, and was highly complimented on the field, by Gen. Durvea. As
                        it charged up the mountain, the General sat upon his horse, and turning to
                        some New York Regiments, spoke at the top of his voice: "Look at those
                        gallant Pennsylvanians! They are brave boys! Their State may well be proud
                        of them! Now, New York, do your duty!" During this charge, the 107th passed
                        the Reserves, who had expended all their ammunition. The reserves sat up a
                        tremendous cheer, and the enemy thinking at least ten thousand men were
                        charging upon them, broke and ran and were driven by at least two miles by
                        the "gallant Pennsylvanians!"</p>
                    <p>A member of the Regular Cavalry, not a citizen of our State, remarked to me,
                        the other day, that Pennsylvanians had fought well before, but, since the
                        threatened invasion of their State, they had done as much execution as if
                        fifty thousand more men had been added to their ranks. But their reputation
                        has been dearly bought, as many a sad fire-side circle will testify.</p>
                    <p>Capt. W. W. Walker has been ordered to report to the Provost Marshal of
                        Pennsylvania, and to arrest all deserters from this Division, who may be
                        found. He will have plenty of work to do in Franklin county. We have already
                        lost heavily by desertion.</p>

<b>From the Army in Kentucky</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A correspondent stationed in Louisville, Kentucky writes that after reading
                    a copy of the Transcript, he recalled how thin the Unionism of some Republicans
                    were. When this soldier was at home last summer, he was accused of being a
                    "Secesh," for no other reason than attending the Democratic convention and
                    arguing with radical Republicans. However, he claims, several of the "Union"
                    party men were none too anxious to enlist, and one left almost as soon as he got
                    to Harrisburg.<br>

                    <p>Messrs. Editors Spirit and Times:--I had the
                        pleasure a short time ago to get my hands on the Transcript, which one of my messmates received and was amused to
                        see an account of the "Union" County Convention of delegates for nominating
                        county officers. I should not have noticed the meeting if it had not been
                        styled the "Union Party" of old Franklin. I think I can prove that some of
                        the delegates are only Union as far as talk goes. Last summer while I was at
                        home, my friends had the pleasure (if pleasure it was) of hearing me spoken
                        of as a d----d Secesh; for no other reason than attending the Democratic
                        County Convention, and giving the radical Republicans a hearing whenever I
                        got a chance. Last summer, when the boys, in Sulphur Spring district, were
                        trying to raise a squad of men to go to Harrisburg to enlist, one of the
                        delegates to the above named "Union" Convention, got very cross at them for
                        trying to persuade his boys to enlist. Another of the delegates went along
                        to Harrisburg. After laying around and boarding a few days on U. Sam, he
                        went back, taking a few of the hardest crackers he could find with him,
                        which he carried about as a show. Now, I think it is hard when such men
                        represent the "Union" sentiment of the county, and those who fight for the
                        Union, but do not exactly coincide with the Administration, are styled
                        Secessionists.</p>

<b>History of McPherson's Military Career</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This writer lampoons the military service of Capt. Edward McPherson, the
                    congressman from the 16th District of Pennsylvania. In 1861 McPherson raised a
                    company in Adams County, but then, according to the writer, neglected to
                    accompany his men on any of the duties they performed in training and in
                    guarding Washington. He subsequently resigned from his command to take a
                    position as an aide to General McCall. McPherson, according to the writer, has
                    spent more time working on his re-election than he has in service to the
                    country, while trying to play his military credentials for political benefit.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. Edward McPherson)</blockquote>

<b>The Danger--The Remedy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial urges the voters to realize the twin dangers represented by
                    Southern secessionists and Northern fanatics. While the secessionists are fought
                    on the battlefield, the abolitionists in the North, who threaten the
                    Constitution and civil liberties, may be fought through the ballot box. A
                    "consolidated, central military power" run by abolitionists poses a great danger
                    to the nation.<br>

<b>The No-Party Meeting</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors stopped by the Court House to hear a speech by Hon. Edward
                    McPherson. They claim that the hall was not full at all. The speech was heavy,
                    dull, and spiritless, and nobody seemed to have any enthusiasm for it. The
                    editors recommend that Democrats and conservatives go to the polls and vote for
                    General A. H. Coffroth "in order to afford Mr. McPherson time to attend to his
                    'military duties.'"<br>(Names in announcement:  Edward McPherson)</blockquote>
<b>The Election</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors lay out what they believe is at stake in this election. A

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We would call upon every Democrat in the county to consider well the
                        importance of the approaching election. It is, in our opinion, the most
                        important one that has occurred in the history our country. The baneful
                        spirit of Abolitionism has been let loose upon the land, and unless crushed
                        by the mighty power of the Democracy at the polls, will most inevitably
                        prostrate the rights and liberties of the white man in a vain attempt to
                        elevate the black. Democrats, we warn you to be vigilant and active. Your
                        country needs your services. Upon you depends the safety of our beloved
                        country. Abolitionism threatens the overthrow of the Constitution, the
                        disruption of the Union and the elevation of the negro to an equality with
                        the white man. This is not only a contest for civil and political rights but
                        also to maintain the social and political supremacy of the white race over
                        the black. Let not therefore the excitement occasioned by the war, withdraw
                        your attention from the importance of the approaching election. Whilst the
                        army of the Republic is crushing out Secessionism in the field, do not
                        forget that you have a duty to perform by voting down Abolitionism at the
                        Polls.</p>

<b>How Shall I Vote at the Ensuing Election?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial asks voters to consider under which administrations the
                    Union was more prosperous and to remember which party promises to restore the
                    Union as it was, and to vote accordingly.<br>

<b>The Political Campaign</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks the Republican Party for claiming to be non-partisan while
                    simultaneously assaulting the loyalty of the Democratic Party. Republicans have
                    tried to curtail civil liberties and have infected their followers with
                    "anti-American and anti-christian ideas." The "conservative and truly loyal
                    elements of the North" must band together at the ballot box to teach the
                    Republicans to respect the rights of others.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The True Issue</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors predict dire consequences, including the loss of hope of ever
                    restoring the Union, if the Republicans are continued in power. This is not an
                    idle fear, they claim. If the warning had been heeded years before, the country

<b>Unreasonable Complaints</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that recent complaints of inhospitality on the part of
                    Chambersburg residents to the Pennsylvania militia are entirely unfounded. The
                    citizens of the town went out of their way to accommodate the troops, and it
                    can't be expected that they could have provided for all 30,000 when the state
                    authorities had responsibility for their provision. The editors also note that,
                    while the militia came with the charge to protect property, they actually ended
                    up destroying quite a lot.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the return to their homes of the Militia, who were ordered to this
                        section of our State, to resist an invasion of the soil of Pennsylvania by
                        the Rebels under Lee and Jackson, we have noticed, in several of our
                        exchanges, charges of inhospitable treatment made against our citizens.</p>
                    <p>These complaints are entirely uncalled for and unjust. Ever since the
                        breaking out of the rebellion the people of our town, rich and poor, have
                        vied with each other in their efforts to minister to the comfort of the
                        soldiers passing through the town. Not a car-load of men in uniform could
                        pass through, but they were surrounded with men, women and children with
                        baskets filled with provisions to relieve their hunger. Not a sick or
                        wounded soldier entered the borough but was taken by the hand and his
                        necessities relieved. Money and time were lavished without stint, their
                        houses thrown open and their beds surrendered to the noble men who were
                        fighting the battles of our country. To some extent, they have had their
                        reward for these self-sacrificing acts of kindness and charity, be feeling
                        better about the region of their hearts, and in hearing the warm "God bless
                        you" of the war worn veteran as he limped forth from their hospitable doors.
                        Even now the Hospitals in our midst are thronged with the wives, mothers and
                        daughters of our citizens, smoothing the pillows of the sick and wounded,
                        and lightening to some extent the long hours of sickness and pain.</p>
                    <p>Yet notwithstanding all our people have done and are doing, they are charged
                        with a lack of hospitality by a portion of the Pennsylvania Militia who were
                        ordered here, as they say, "to defend the property of the people of this portion of the Cumberland Valley." We would
                        like to know if these men, were ordered here for the purpose of protecting
                        our property alone, or whether they were not protecting their own homes as
                        well, by advancing to the Border of the State and even into the State of
                        Maryland. It would indeed have been a Herculean task for our citizens to
                        have entertained and fed some thirty thousand men, if even it had been
                        necessary; but as no such necessity existed, inasmuch as the State
                        Authorities had made ample provision for their subsistence, it was asking a
                        little too much to expect our citizens to provide delicacies for so numerous
                        a company. In fact they never dreamed that these men came here to feast, but
                        to meet the foe in battle and drive him back.</p>
                    <p>A word or two in relation to the "protection" given to property here. The
                        farmers living along the [Ha]gerstown road dread, but little more, the
                        advent of a Rebel army--as far as the destruction of property is
                        concerned--than another advance of the Pennsylvania Militia. Fences burned
                        for fuel, young timber wantonly destroyed, whole fields of growing corn cut
                        down and carried away, and numberless other vandalisms attest the kind of
                        "protection" their property received.</p>
                    <p>We cannot but admire and applaud, the patriotism that prompted these men to
                        leave their homes for the purpose of repelling the Rebel hordes from
                        Pennsylvania soil, yet at the same time, we must be permitted to denounce
                        the conduct of some of them who say they came to save property, but instead
                        wantonly destroyed it.</p>

<b>Geo. Francis Train on the Abolitionists</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprint of a speech given in Boston by George Francis Train, in which he
                    traces abolitionism to a plot by the British to derail Southern protective
                    tariffs. He goes on to argue that the black man should not be freed, as he has
                    "always been a hewer of wood and a drawer of water and he would always remain
                    so." He concluded by exhorting Irishmen to oppose Charles Sumner. If they
                    didn't, freed blacks would come North and compete for jobs with the Irish.<br>
