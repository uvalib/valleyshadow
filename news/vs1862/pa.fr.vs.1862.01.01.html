<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It seems, says the Police Gazette, as though we
                        are never to get rid of the everlasting nigger, but that he is to be dished
                        up to us morning, noon and night, in such form and shape as our tormentors
                        think best adapted to their malignant purposes. The President is evidently
                        just and conservative in his policy, which does not suit these fire eating
                        Abolitionists, and they are determined, if possible, to drive him to
                        following their plans. To this end they are holding caucuses, offering
                        resolutions in Congress, making speeches and cutting up various other antics
                        characteristic of the race, but they are destined to disappointment as we do
                        not believe that President Lincoln will ever submit to become a party to
                        their insane plans. Congress has no authority whatever to abolish slavery in
                        any State; and if they should pass an act to that effect it would be void in
                        itself, and we would be sure to elect men to the next Congress that would
                        wipe the illegal enactment from the statute book. It is full time that
                        something was done with these incendiaries, for they are really doing more
                        injury to the country than the Secessionists, and if the President would
                        direct his Marshals to take charge of one Lovejoy and one Stevens, who have
                        obtained seats in Congress, and also about two or three hundred of their
                        co-conspirators outside of Congress, and give them a berth at Fort Lafayette
                        or Warren, he would do the country more good than could be accomplished by
                        an army of fifty thousand men. These are the men who have been instrumental
                        in plunging the country into war, and now they are doing everything in their
                        power to prolong it, and to add to its horrors. They do not enlist either as
                        soldiers or officers, for they fear to meet a hailstorm of leaden bullets;
                        but they stay at home, seek for contracts or fat offices, and then occupy
                        their leisure time in concocting schemes that must result in making the
                        strife more sanguinary than the most blood-thirsty could desire. There must
                        be an end put to their operations, and that soon, or more evil will
                    ensue.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR: It is an old saying, but true, "strike when the iron is hot." The
                        zeal you manifested for several months after the Railroad Convention in
                        Harrisburg, PA., in May 1860, if now applied in your paper, as it was there,
                        might do a great deal of good. We are now engaged in a civil war, and when
                        it is to end none but JEHOVAH knows. The Government must have facilities for
                        transportation. Some are turning their attention to a road from Washington
                        to Hagerstown, to connect with the Franklin Railroad, and then unite
                        Washington with Philadelphia and New York by the roads already made, but we
                        belive [sic] the citizens of Hagerstown are so indifferent to this immense
                        interest to their town and County, that as yet, they have taken no action on
                        the subject. Shame! shame! where they have property to advance in price,
                        they surely ought to strike "while the Iron is
                        hot." If a road were made from Washington to Hagerstown, then the Franklin
                        Railroad could be used as far as Greencastle, then strike for Mercersburg
                        and the Cove Gap, at Seylar's Foundry. This would enable them to have along
                        the base of the mountain, until Cowan Gap, a very easy grade. This it is
                        true would leave Chambersburg fourteen miles to make to intersect at London,
                        and twenty miles to grade to Thadeus Stevens Tapeworm, and six more miles to
                        lay with rails to Gettysburg, to be connected with Baltimore.</p>
                    <p>Our Congressman, Hon. E. McPherson, has brought the subject before Congress
                        to have an Air Line from Washington through Gettysburg to the cities of New
                        York and Philadelphia, and we give him credit for attending to his own
                        interests as well as the Governments; for if the citizens of Washington
                        County, Md., are too indifferent to attend to their own interests, we hope McPherson will prevail, with this addition,
                            strike out the Air Line and insert
                        Chambersburg, Broad Top and Somerset, ending at Pittsburg [sic], Pa. Then
                        Washington, Baltimore and our Steam War Vessels would be easily supplied
                        with the Broad Top coal, the products of Pennsylvania, and the great west,
                        without being annoyed with Rebeldom.</p>
                    <p>The stigmas cast in this communication upon Hagerstown, may be equally
                        applied to the citizens of this Town and County, and will fall with more
                        force on us, than it can possible do on them, if we seriously reflect on our
                        relative positions. What are we doing while the "Iron is hot," nothing and
                        Echo answers, nothing. We have friends at court that we believe they have
                        not. First, the Hon. Thos. A. Scott, Deputy Secretary of War, the road would
                        pass his birth place. Second, Hon. McPherson. Third, Hon. Thadeus Stevens,
                        an old resident of Gettysburg. Fourth, the Hon. Simon Cameron, now Secretary
                        of War, may not forget his youthful days when he gamboled along the streams
                        and sported in the woods of Franklin County, Pa, and now when in possession
                        of power and influence in the National Government, and to aid that
                        Government in economizing her resources, favor the county where his youthful
                        days were spent, if his attention was properly called to the vast amount of
                        money that could and would be saved to the United States if this road was
                        made to Broad Top and Pittsburg [sic].</p>
