<b>The Imbeciles</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial arguing that the Lincoln administration has consistently bungled
                    the prosecution of the war. Because of its incompetence and the mixing in of the
                    "nigger question"--i.e. abolition--the Lincoln administration has alienated
                    potential allies in foreign countries and sympathizers in the border states and
                    the south. The article also cites an article in the Philadelphia Daily News, a
                    Republican paper, questioning the military competence of the administration.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We ventured to remark, several months ago, that the Administration had shown
                        its entire incompetency to conduct the present war. We regret to be
                        compelled to reiterate this opinion, but the sad experience of every day has
                        not only confirmed it, but demands, in the name of our beloved Union, that
                        the Press of the country speak out and spare not. It is undeniable that
                        every move our army has made has been a blunder, our naval expeditions
                        proved failures, and our battles resulted in defeats; with the exception of
                        the brilliant little affair at Drainsville--the only bright spot in the dark
                        and bloody panorama before us. Can any man say that this wicked rebellion is
                        any nearer being crushed out today than nine months ago, although millions
                        upon millions of dollars have been expended and thousands of valuable lives
                        lost in the unnatural conflict. When this rebellion broke out we had the
                        respect and sympathy of the whole world on our side. We could procure loans
                        of money from the great powers of Europe, and buy up, in their markets, any
                        quantity of munitions of war our country might need. By the bad management
                        of the Administration all these advantages have been upset--we cannot now
                        obtain from Europe a dollar, a cannon, or a pound of saltpetre; and those
                        who we reckoned as friends have been made the allies of our enemies up in
                        arms against us. Canada, our nearest neighbor, that tendered a regiment of
                        lancers to fight in our behalf, have now eighty thousand men who have
                        volunteered to fight against us! We might overlook--nay, despise--all this
                        and still maintain our self-respect and restore the Union, had not the
                        Administration cast a fire-brand among the combustible material in the
                        country by agitating the nigger question in its councils, at a time it had
                        no business there, and thereby driving off its Union friends in the South
                        and border States, and injuriously dividing public sentiment in the North as
                        to the objects of the war. When we add to all this the peculations, and
                        downright robbery, by officials high and low under this Administration, we
                        have a gloomy picture from the contemplation of which every honest and loyal
                        man must turn with horror and dismay. Public opinion is every day demanding
                        in louder and louder tones that this Administration give up the ghost or the
                        Union is irretrievably lost. It has shown its incompetency to conduct the
                        war successfully so far, and gives no promise for any better results in the
                        future. We are not alone in expressing these opinions. Honest Republicans do
                        not hesitate to give vent to the same doubts and fears as to the ability of
                        this Administration to conduct the war. The Philadelphia Daily News a rabid Republican paper, says, unless something is
                        done speedily to retrieve it, "the administration of Mr.
                            Lincoln will prove to be the worst failure which the world has ever yet
                            witnessed." We republish the article from the Daily News, of Saturday, which taken in connection with the
                        recent speech of HON. THADDEUS STEVENS, to be found in another part of our
                        paper, on the imbecility in the management of the war, indicates pretty
                        plainly that confidence, in LINCOLN'S Administration, even in its own
                        household, is about expiring. Mr. STEVENS concludes his remarks by begging
                            "for Heaven's sake not to go on piling mountains
                            upon mountains of debt and taxation until the nation itself is destroyed
                            in the operations of this war." No people can, or will longer
                        stand Millions of Taxes and Hundreds of Millions of Debt without some
                        results for the honor and good of the country to show for it.</p>

                    <p>For several months past, Cotton Goods and Groceries have been tending upwards

                        in the cities at wholesale less than fifteen cts per yard, and shilling
