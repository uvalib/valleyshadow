<b>The Constitution of 1789</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Senator Sumner of Massachusetts is as guilty as Southern
                    secessionists of advocating disunion. Sumner's argument that the North can stand

                    tacitly accepts that the South had a right to secede. This acceptance
                    legitimizes the Confederate cause. The Constitution of 1789, formed by judicious

                    <p>The Republicans are in a desperate strait for a hero. Since the collapse of
                        Jim Lane, they are bleating about like sheep without a shepherd. Their first
                        hero in this war was Fremont. He achieved the defeat of Lyon, the surrender
                        of Lexington, the "freedom" of a few niggers, and squandered millions of
                        public money. We hardly know which exploit most commended him to their
                        favor. When Fremont was retired from command in disgrace, they fixed their
                        hopes upon one Simon, surnamed Cameron, who, it has been said, "was a thief
                        from the beginning," and did not hesitate to sell his country for a few
                        pieces of silver. But Simon wanted the niggers set at liberty--he wanted
                        arms put in their hands so they could butcher the women and children of the
                        South. This exalted him in the eyes of the Republicans and they loved him as
                        their own souls. But Simon is dismissed from the council table which he had
                        disgraced. Just then Jim Lane turned up and the Republican journals turned
                        their eyes upon him and saw that he was good at stealing niggers, and they
                        proclaimed that he was to do wonderful things in that line--it just suited
                        him. But General Jime [sic] is suddenly "squelched"--his "expedition"
                        vanished, and he is left before the public a miserable charlatan, a dirty
                        jack that has brayed his own fame, a fit object of scorn and anathema from
                        all patriotic people. Who will be the next hero of the Republican
                            journals?--Exchange.</p>

<b>The Union Cause</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that information from Washington indicates that General McClellan
                    is very nearly ready to move on the enemy. When he does, says the article, the

                    not disproved at Bull Run, as some Southerners claimed, but papers such as the

<b>Treason and Loyalty</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks the Transcript for defining Democrats as inherently treasonous.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>That brilliant legal and political luminary, the Transcript, says treason is "the lowest of crimes." If the
                        editor will search his law books, he will probably learn that treason is one
                        of the highest of crimes. Our neighbor evidently don't know much about
                        treason. If he were called upon to define it, he would probably
                        say--"Treason consists in being a Democrat and adhering to the
                        Constitution." Loyalty, in his opinion, consists in being a Black Republican
                        and selling bad horses to the government. The purchase of linen pantaloons
                        and straw hats, with government money, is also a proof of loyalty in our
                        neighbor's opinion. If BRIGHT, in place of foolishly writing a letter of
                        introduction to JEFF DAVIS, had formed a partnership with CAMERON and
                        swindled the government out of a few millions, what a patriot he might
                    be.</p>

<b>Alarm Among the Renegades</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    disloyal and criticizes the Chambersburg Times for its support of Forney's

                    they point out the burden of taxation that the war has brought on or when they
                    argue that compromise could have avoided they war. However, people like Forney
                    do not do anything when Republicans attack McClellan or condemn the Union for
                    failing to embrace abolition. The article also attacks the Times for accusing
                    the Valley Spirit of disloyalty while at the same time supporting "His Satanic
                    Majesty," radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens.<br>(Names in announcement:  John W. Forney)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>That renegade and political cut-throat, JOHN W. FORNEY, has, for some time
                        past spurted his venom against the Democratic party with an unusual degree
                        of vindictiveness. There is no depth of meanness, no matter how low it
                        requires him to stoop, to which he will not descend to injure and revile the
                        Democratic party. He is evidently fearful that the Democracy will make a
                        clean sweep of the State, at the next October election, and these
                        apprehensions have filled him with fears and alarms, and excited his
                        petulancy equal to the scolding capacity of any rebel beldam. Every
                        fabrication, no matter how monstrous or how ridiculous, that he can invent,
                        he puts in circulation to create prejudice against the Democracy. He is
                        continually telling us that Democrats are disloyal, and all his small imitators throughout the State take
                        their cue accordingly, and join in the hue and cry against the Democracy,
                        carping at every move the party makes with the impudent
                            interrogatory--"Is this loyalty?" The
                        Chambersburg Times is a paper of this stamp. It
                        imitates FORNEY to a crotchet, and gives him all the aid it can, in its
                        feeble way, to cry down the Democratic party and keep it divided for the
                        benefit of the Republicans. It keeps up a continual howl about "sympathizers
                        with treason" but those persons who are "traitors" in its very loyal
                        estimation are always sure to be Democrats. The Republicans may condemn the
                        war because it is not made an Abolition war, and assail MCCLELLAN, and other
                        Union Generals, and aught is not said against it, but let a Democratic paper
                        undertake to show the enormous taxation with which the people will be
                        burdened, and which might have been avoided if COMPROMISE, in place of
                        shedding each others blood, had been adopted, and it is at once set down as
                        "disloyal." To show the hypocritical meanness of the Times which professes to be ready to immolate any Democrat who
                        will presume to talk in favor of compromise, or against the taxes which have
                        been piled up on the people by the plunderings under this administration, we
                        have only to refer to its last issue. In one column it copies a garbled
                        extract from the Spirit and rolls up its eyes in
                        holy horror over it and exclaims--"If this is loyalty, God preserve us from
                        treason." In the very next column it pats His Satanic Majesty--THADDEUS
                        STEVENS--very lovingly on the back and says "We do not
                            accuse Mr. Stevens of disloyalty," and to make it more emphatic
                        it reiterates in the same article "Our object is not to
                            charge Stevens with disloyalty." Oh! No, never mention it! It
                        would never do to charge a Black Republican Abolitionist with "disloyalty,"
                        but the Valley Spirit is fair game for every
                        whelp to snarl at. How exceedingly anxious the Times is to screen Republicans and condemn Democrats, but in this it
                        is only carrying out the dictation of its master FORNEY, who has recommended
                        that "immediate steps be taken for the purpose of consolidating such a party
                        at the next election as will put down the secession sympathizers forever."
                        Meaning, of course, the Democrats, for that is the manner in which FORNEY
                        speaks of the whole Democratic party. The Times
                        is playing its part of the programme, in a small way, to perfection. Here is
                        the convincing sample of its treachery. We give an extract from the Valley Spirit which the Times pronounces "disloyal," and an extract from a speech of
                        THADDEUS STEVENS, delivered in congress a few weeks ago, whom the Times will "not accuse of
                            disloyalty." We ask Democrats to compare them and then say if
                        there is any honesty in the Times. We give the
                        extracts without another word of comment:</p>
                    <p>
                        From the Valley Spirit as garbled in the Times.
                    </p>
                    <p>"We have a war which, no matter how soon it may end, will leave on our
                        shoulders a debt of at least one thousand millions of dollars. This is the
                        lowest amount we can escape with. The interest on this debt, at 7.80, the
                        present treasury rate, will be seventy-three millions per annum. If the
                        country is kept together and the Southern States are made to pay their
                        proportion, Pennsylvania will have about one-tenth of this sum to raise--say
                        seven millions of dollars a year. If the South gets off, Pennsylvania will
                        have about one-sixth of it to make up--say twelve millions of dollars a
                        year. Can the people of this State stand the grinding of additional taxes
                        out of them to the amount of twelve millions per annum? Can they pay even
                        seven millions over and above their present State, County, School, Borough
                        and township taxes? We don't see how it is to be done. Perhaps those who
                        would have no compromise with traitors' can tell me."</p>

                    <p>"The Committee of Ways and Means will have to report a deficiency bill, even
                        after Congress appropriating $818,000,000 last July. We shall have to
                        appropriate from one hundred and sixty to two hundred and fourteen million
                        dollars more to make up the deficiencies for this fiscal year. We shall also
                        have to report a bill making an appropriation of $413,000,000 for next year.
                        We will then have to appropriate more than six hundred million dollars,
                        without the addition of a single dollar beyond what is estimated for. Now,
                        sir, that in itself is alarming. I confess I do not see how, unless the
                        expenses are greatly curtailed, this Government can possibly go on over six
                        months. If we go on increasing expenses, as we have been doing, and as we
                        propose to do by this the whole country must give way, and the people will
                        be involved in one general bankruptcy and ruin. For Heaven's sake do not let
                        us go on piling mountains upon mountains of debt and taxation, until the
                        nation itself is finally destroyed in the operations of this war.</p>

                    power in the army there is hope that the extremes of Northern "fanaticism" and
                    Southern "treason" can be buried and sectional hate and animosity may be
                    banished.<br>

                    <p>Headquarters Department Of Missouri,</p>
                    <p><br>ST. LOUIS, February 23</p>
                    <p>The Major-General Commanding the Department desires to impress upon all
                        officers the importance of preserving good order and discipline among their
                        troops as the armies of the West advance into Tennessee and the Southern
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Let us show to our fellow citizens in those States that we come merely to
                        crush rebellion, and restore to them peace and the benefits of the
                        Constitution and the Union, of which they have been deprived by selfish and
                        unprincipled leaders. They have been told that we come to oppress and
                        plunder. By our acts we will undeceive them. We will prove to them that we
                        come to restore not to violate the Constitution and the laws. In restoring
                        to them the glorious flag of the Union, we will assure them that they shall
                        enjoy under its folds the same protection of life and property as of former
                        days.</p>
                    <p>Soldiers! let no excess on your part tarnish the glory of our arms!</p>
                    <p>The order heretofore issued in this Department, in regard to pillaging and
                        maurading, the destruction of private property, and the stealing or
                        concealment of slaves, must be strictly enforced. It does not belong to the
                        military to decide upon the relation of master and slave. Such questions
                        must be settled by the civil courts. No fugitive slave will therefore be
                        admitted within our lines or camps, except when specially ordered by the
                        general commanding.</p>
                    <p>Women and children, merchants, farmers, mechanics, and all persons not in
                        arms, are regarded as non-combatants, and are not to be molested either in
                        their persons or property. If, however they aid and assist the enemy, they
                        become beligerents, and will be treated as such. As they violate the laws of
                        war, they will be made to suffer the penalties of such violation.</p>
                    <p>Military stores and the public property of the enemy must be surrendered, and
                        any attempt to conceal such property by fraudulent transfers or otherwise,
                        will be punished but no private property will be touched unless by order of
                        the General commanding. Wherever it becomes necessary to obtain forced
                        contributions for the supply and subsistence of our troops, such levies will
                        be made as light as possible, and to be so distributed as to produce no
                        distress among the people. All property so taken must be receipted and fully
                        accounted for, as heretofore directed.</p>
                    <p>These orders will be read at the head of eve[r]y regiment, and all officers
                        are commanded to strictly enforce them.</p>
                    <p>By command of <br>MAJOR GENERAL HALLECK. <br>W. H. McLean, Adjutant
                        General.</p>

<b>Shall the Union be Saved?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Journal of Commerce attacks the New York Evening Post for its
