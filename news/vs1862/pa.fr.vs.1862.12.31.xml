                    <p>Headquarters Army of the Potomac. <lb/>Falmouth, Dec. 19, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Major General H. W. Halleck, General-in-Chief, United States Army,
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>General--I have the honor to offer the following reason for moving the army
                        of the Potomac across the Rappahannock sooner than was anticipated by the
                        President, Secretary of War or yourself, and for crossing at a different
                        point from the one indicated to you at our last meeting at the
                        President's:--</p>
                    <p>During my preparations for crossing at the place I had first selected I
                        discovered that the enemy had thrown a large portion of his force down the
                        river and elsewhere, thus weakening his defences in front, and also thought
                        I discovered that he did not anticipate the crossing of our whole force at
                        Fredericksburg; and, I hoped, by rapidly throwing the whole command over at
                        that place, to separate, by a vigorous attack, the forces of the enemy, on
                        the river below from the forces behind and on the crest, in the rear of the
                        town, in which case we could fight him with great advantage in our favor.</p>
                    <p>To do this we had to gain a height on the extreme fight of the crest, which
                        height commanded a new road lately made by the enemy for purposes of more
                        rapid communication along his lines, which point gained his position along
                        the crest would have been scarcely tenable, and he could have been driven
                        from them easily by an attack on his front in connection with a movement in
                        the rear of the crest.</p>
                    <p>How near we came to accomplishing our object future reports will show. But
                        for the fog and unexpected and unavoidable delay in building the bridges,
                        which gave the enemy twenty-four hours more to concentrate his forces in his
                        strong positions, we would almost certainly have succeeded, in which case
                        the battle would have been, in my opinion, far more decisive than if we had
                        crossed at the places first selected. As it was, we came very near success.</p>
                    <p>Failing in accomplishing the main object, we remained in order of battle two
                        days--long enough to decide that the enemy would not come out of his
                        strongholds to fight us with his infantry--after which we recrossed to the
                        side of the river unmolested, without the loss of men or property.</p>
                    <p>As the day broke our long lines of troops were seen marching to their
                        different positions as if poing [sic] on parade. Not the least
                        demoralization or disorganization existed.</p>
                    <p>To the brave officers and soldiers who accomplished the feat of thus
                        recrossing the river in the face of the enemy I owe everything.</p>
                    <p>For the failure in the attack I am responsible, as the extreme gallantry,
                        courage and endurance shown by them were never exceeded, and would have
                        carried the points had it been possible.</p>
                    <p>To the families and friends of the dead I can only offer my heartfelt
                        sympathies; but for the wounded, I can offer my earnest prayers for their
                        comfortable and final recovery.</p>
                    <p>I will visit you very soon and give you more definite information, and,
                        finally, will send you my detailed report, in which a special acknowledgment
                        will be made of the different grand division corps and my general and staff
                        departments of the Army of the Potomac, to whom I am so much indebted for
                        their support and hearty co-operation.</p>
                    <p>I will add here that the movement was made earlier than you expected, and
                        after the President, Secretary and yourself requested me not to be in haste,
                        for the reason that we were supplied much sooner by the different staff
                        departments than was anticipated when I last saw you.</p>
                    <p>Our killed amounts to eleven hundred and fifty-two; our wounded, to about
                        nine thousand, and our prisoners to about seven hundred, which last have
                        been paroled and exchanged for about the same number taken by us.</p>
                    <p>The wounded were all removed to this side of the river, and are being well
                        cared for, and the dead were all buried under a flag of truce.</p>
                    <p>The surgeons report a much larger proportion of slight wounds than usual,
                        1,632 only being treated in hospitals.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to represent the army at the present time in good condition.</p>
                    <p>Thanking the government for that entire support and confidence which I have
                        always received from them, I remain General, very respectfully, your
                        obedient servant,</p>

                    McClellan, who even Burnside noted was a good commander of his troops, is
                    ultimately to blame for the disaster which occurred at Fredericksburg.</summary>

                <summary>President Lincoln's address to the Army of the Potomac is reprinted by the
                    editors. While the address blames the losses at Fredericksburg on accidents and
                    not the lack of bravery of the troops, and claims that the losses were
                    comparatively small, the editors argue that both are ridiculous claims and that
                    the people of the country can see right through them.</summary>

                    incompetency for the position. President Lincoln and his Abolition advisers are
                    the guilty parties. They and they alone are responsible for the wholesale murder

                    implicates Lincoln and General Halleck in the defeat. Lincoln is to blame for
                    removing McClellan, who Burnside says could have done more with the army than
                    any other man, while Halleck is implicated in the failure of the pontoon bridges
                    to reach the army on time, thus allowing Lee to mass his troops at

                    <p>Col. Elder was removed to Acquia Creek Landing this morning, and will be sent
                        from thence home. He appeared in good spirits and confident hopes are
                        entertained of his recovery. In a conversation with Geo. Humphrey last
                        night, he assured him that he did not consider his services to the country
                        yet fully completed, and expressed the determination to be again with his
                        command as soon as his condition would permit. His brother officers speak in
                        the highest terms of his courage. The proof of this and his pure patriotism,
                        he bears upon his person.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieut. Harry Clay Fortericus, Co. "G," was the only officer killed in
                        the Regiment. He met his death just previous to "the charge," a ball
                        striking him in the head killing him instantly. He was a brave and gallant
                        young man, and gave his life for his country just as he was about
                        unsheathing his maiden sword in her defence. He was a Philadelphian by
                        birth, but for some years past resided in Chambersburg. In the three months
                        campaign he acquitted himself well as a Sergeant to Captain Housum's Co.
                        "A," and was an efficient and useful officer of the company to which he was
                        attached at the time of his death. The dreadful carnage around where he fell
                        rendered it impossible for his comrades to recover his body. Peace to his
                        ashes.</p>
                    <p>With the privates who were killed I had but a slight acquaintance. Their fate
                        seals the question as to their bravery in battle, and their fidelity in a
                        noble cause.</p>
                    <p>On the evacuation of Fredericksburg, our Brigade was the last to pass over
                        the river. They moved at once to the ground occupied by them the night
                        before the battle, about one and a half miles from the city. I went at once
                        to greet them. Of the entire Brigade, scarcely a man escaped injury in some
                        way. They bore wounds of every conceivable character, in the head, body or
                        limbs. Instances too of miraculous escapes were almost numberless. Some had
                        their clothes nearly riddled with bullets or torn in rags by shell, without
                        personal injury; while the lives of many were saved by a lucky button or
                        some article they carried with them which failed to be pierced. It was a
                        mournful sight, and one that none present will soon forget. It is due our
                        physicians to say that their attentions to the wounded were unremitting.
                        They were on duty early and late endeavoring by every possible means to
                        alleviate the sufferings of all under their charge. Our Regimental Surgeon,
                        Dr. Nugent, detailed temporarily as Brigade Surgeon, a man possessing a
                        heart overflowing with gentleness and kindness, and whose skill in his
                        profession is unquestionable, was unceasingly employed performing operations
                        and dressing wounds. He fully merits the high esteem we all bear for him,
                        and if possible strengthens our regard by his noble, generous conduct on
                        this occasion.</p>
                    <p>Soon after breakfast the Brigade was ordered to return to their old camp
                        ground two miles distant, the wounded being left behind under care of the
                        Surgeons. We reached it after an hours walk and commenced fitting up our
                        Quarters. Since then the officers have been busy making out their reports
                        and preparing for new and efficient service.</p>
                    <p>The aggregate loss of the Brigade is as follows:</p>

                    <p>I fear from reliable reports that have reached me, that the brave and
                        courageous Col. Chas. T. Campell, will hardly survive the terrible wounds he
                        received while fighting at the head of his Regiment on the left. He was
                        wounded in the shoulder and bowels, and his right arm was dreadfully
                        shattered. He is lying near Gen. Sumner's Head Quarters and is being
                        carefully nursed. A braver officer does not live nor has died than one own
                        "Charley," and I trust he may be spared to his family and friends, and
                        wearing the honors of his recent promotion to a Brigadier General ship, the
                        country may continue to have the benefit of his skill and gallantry.</p>
                    <p>In the fight on the Left fell private Isaac S. Noel of Co "I," 107th
                        Regiment, youngest son of my excellent friend Mr. John Noel, of
                        Chambersburg. He had passed through three hard fights unscathed, but at last
                        death claimed him as he was moving bravely forward in the charge near
                        Fredericksburg. I have had ample testimony of the bravery of this noble
                        soldier on that occasion. "Colonel" he shouted "let us charge." The cry
                        passed along the line and before the command could be given the whole
                        Regiment were rushing on a Rebel battery with fixed bayonets. They were met
                        by a galling fire, and among the first to fall was Isaac. I can remember
                        when months ago the writer of this penned many very affectionate lines to
                        that boy, dictated by his aged and loving mother. Hardly a week passed but
                        Isaac was assured of her enduring love and made the recipient of some little
                        article conducive to happiness and comfort. But the darling of the mother is
                        now gone forever and his body is perishing upon the battle field. With
                        sadness and woe, and unspeakable affliction that mother's heart is crushed,
                        but still may she be proud in the thought that her idol met a hero's death,
                        and rely hopefully that the God of Battles has provided a place for him in
                        his own house, the abode of the good and the blest.</p>
                    <p>To many a household does the bloody hand of war bring gloom, and sorrow and
                        lamentation. Many a mothers check is even now be dewed with tears and her
                        heart ready to break as the intelligence comes to her of the death of her
                        cherished son on the gory field of battle. The father's pride is gone and he
                        bows his head in grief. They joyous spirits of the sisters have forsaken
                        her. The keen arrow of affliction pierces her heart, and gloom and sadness
                        surrounds her being. And then the agony of the loving wife as she hears
                        "among the killed" her husband. Husband, father, protector gone and forever,
                        his life a sacrifice upon the altar of his country. He was brave. He was
                        true, he was a hero. But the thought of these cannot remove the grief or the
                        anguish of that devoted woman. The voice of love and the smile of gladness
                        are gone never more to greet her presence, and the bloody sods of the battle
                        field cover the body of him who was her most cherished object on earth. And
                        when we think of the magnitude of the late conflict and the enormous loss of
                        life--not less than 20,000 on both sides--we can partially realize the
                        desolation and distress which prevail through the land.</p>

                        been sorrow stricken and filled with mourning. And now how great is the
                        affliction which our own section is made to bear. The honored list which you
                        publish with this, speaks for the valor and fidelity of Franklin county's
                        sons, but still will hearts be rent and refuse to be comforted and yet this
                        infernal war is to go on. More brave spirits are to be relentlessly
                        slaughtered, or fall victims to the diseases of the camp. And are our
                        exertions in yield no fruits of triumph? Is this magnificent army complete
                        in the minutest details, and composed of as brave men as ever walked the
                        earth, to fall in its grand purpose of restoring the government and crushing
                        Rebellion. Is all our millions of treasure expended daily to go for naught?
                        And lastly, is this splendid fabric of liberty to go down in disgrace? Two
                        years have nearly passed since the embers of Rebellion were rekindled, and
                        it is not to be disguised that our gain has to that time poorly compensated
                        for the outlay. There is woful [sic] mismanagement somewhere, imbecility and
                        the veriest stupidity could not be guilty of worse. Where it is, is not for
                        me to say, I will not place on record here the names of those to whom the
                        responsibility attaches, ere long a fearful account will have to be rendered
                        to the people, and woe be to the fame of those who will stand at the bar.
                        Nor can the historian fall in after time to commit to immortal infamy the
                        names of those who have permitted their selfishness, ambition and pride to
                        rule paramount to the existence and glory of their country. Every patriot
                        earnestly desires and hopes for our success, but hope and confidence become
                        well nigh extinct in the heart with such butcheries as there was [sic] at
                        Fredericksburg and before it. Affairs must wear a new and more reliable
                        aspect before we can expect to succeed. Let us have competency and ability
                        not imbecelity [sic] and stupidity, patriotism not speculation, sobriety not
                        drunkness [sic], merit rewarded and ignorance dismissed, and we may have
                        some sure guarantee that our lives and treasure are not expended in vain.</p>
                    <p>In my next letter I shall endeavor to give you some interesting incidents
                        during the three days we were engaged with the enemy and perhaps furnish you
                        a diagram of the position of our Brigade, when they were about to make the
                        charge in the fight, also the very excellent. Report prepared by Brigadier
                        General Tyler.--</p>
                    <p>The wounded have nearly all been sent to Washington to day where, I learn,
                        more than ten thousand victims of the Fredericksburg tragedy are suffering.
                        Maj. Todd of the 91st Reg. our Brigade died to day. He had suffered
                        amputation of right leg.</p>

                    <p>The natal day of the Saviour of the World was as usual, desecrated in this
                        place by scenes of drunkenness and riot.</p>
                    <p>The previous night was made hideous by drunken rowdies brawling through the
                        streets of our town, uttering blasphemies and imprecations that would have
                        shocked a Hotentot and made a Root digger Indian blush from every shame.
                        Christmas day, sacred to every christian, for the inestimable boon of a
                        Saviour to a lost and ruined world--was devoted by young America (!) to the
                        consumption of large quantities of bad whiskey, miscellaneous swearing, and
                        a free fight in the Public Square, under the very eyes of the moral and
                        religious portion of our community. How long do our citizens intend
                        tolerating this kind of thing? Do they intend yielding up the town to rowdy
                        control? We merely ask for information. We would like to know whether our
                        citizens are willing to submit to these outrages any longer. If they are, it
                        is all right, as far as we are concerned, but if they wish to arrest this
                        growing and intolerable evil we would suggest that each, peaceable, orderly
                        citizen make it his special business, on these occasions, to see that every
                        disorderly character is promptly arrested and properly punished. During the
                        disorder on the Diamond we saw but one Peace officer, who made any effort to
                        preserve the peace. He deserves and will receive the thanks of the community
                        for his efforts.</p>
