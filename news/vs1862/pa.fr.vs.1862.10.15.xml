                    <p>General Order Issued by Gen. McClellan.</p>
                    <p>General Order No. 163.</p>
                    <p>Head-Quarters Army of the Potomac, Camp near Sharpsburg, October 7.--The
                        attention of the officers and soldiers of the Army of the Potomac is called
                        to General Order No. 132, War Department, September 29th, 1862, publishing
                        to the army the President's proclamation of September 22d.</p>
                    <p>A proclamation of such grave moment to the nation, officially communicated to
                        the army, affords the General Commanding an opportunity of defining
                        specifically to the officers and soldiers under his command, the relation
                        borne by all persons in the military service of the United States towards
                        the civil authorities of the Government.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution confides to the civil authorities legislative, judicial and
                        executive powers, and the duty of asking, expounding and executing the
                        Federal laws. Armed forces are raised and supported simply to sustain the
                        civil authorities, and are to be held in strict subordination thereto in all
                        respects. This fundamental rule of our political system is essential to the
                        security of our Republican institutions, and should be thoroughly understood
                        and observed by every soldier.</p>
                    <p>The principle upon which, and the objects for which armies shall be employed
                        in suppressing Rebellion, must be determined and declared by the civil
                        authorities, and the Chief Executive, who is charged with the administration
                        of the national affairs, is the proper and only source through which the
                        views and orders of the Government can be made known to the armies of the
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>Discussions by officers and soldiers concerning public measures determined
                        upon and declared by the Government, when carried out beyond the ordinary
                        temperate and respectful expression of opinion, tend greatly to impair and
                        destroy the discipline and efficiency of the troops by substituting the
                        spirit of political faction for that firm, steady and earnest support of the
                        authority of the Government which is the inherent duty of the American
                        soldier.</p>
                    <p>The remedy for political errors, if any are committed, is to be found only in
                        the action of the people at the polls. In thus calling the attention of this
                        army to the true relation between the soldiers and the Government, the
                        General Commanding merely adverts to an evil against which it has been
                        thought advisable during our whole history to guard the armies of the
                        Republic, and in so doing he will not be considered by any right minded
                        person as casting any reflection upon that loyalty and good conduct which
                        has been so fully illustrated upon so many battle-fields.</p>
                    <p>In carrying out all measures of public policy this army will, of course, be
                        guided by the same rules of mercy and Christianity that have ever controlled
                        its conduct towards the defenceless.</p>
                    <p>By command of Major General McClellan. <lb/>James A. Hardie. <lb/>Lieut. Col.
                        A.D.C., A. Assist. Adj. Gen.</p>
                    <p>This general order, says the <emph rend="italic">Constitutional Union</emph>,
                        is characteristic of the gallant man who issued it. It assumes no
                        dictatorial tone; but, in temperate, respectful and conciliatory language,
                        counsels--not orders--submission; and deprecates discussions which might
                        possibly impair and destroy the discipline and efficiency of the troops. It
                        also points to the remedy!</p>
                    <p>"The remedy for political errors," (says the order) "if any are committed, is
                        to be found only in the action of the people at the polls." Well said, noble
                        "Little Mac!" That is the remedy, and the people are about to apply it to
                        the wounds which have been inflicted upon our country, our Constitution and
                        our laws. God be thanked, that while Abolition zealots would deny free
                        speech--imprison without cause and without hearing--set truth and justice at
                        defiance, that there is yet a remedy left us. The people yet remain. The
                        glorious privilege of the right of suffrage is, for a while at least,
                        guaranteed us, and that privilege will be exercised in its fullest, broadest
                        and most significant sense on Tuesday next. Prudential reasons may properly
                        draw forth General McClellan's order No. 163, and prudential reasons will
                        draw forth thousands on Tuesday next to vindicate the laws and the
                        Constitution of the Union.</p>

                <summary>A reprint of Gen. McClellan's order to the army relating President
                    Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. McClellan emphasizes that it is not the
                    army's place to criticize public policy, but notes that "The remedy for
                    political errors, if any are committed, is to be found only in the action of the
                    people at the polls." The editors applaud McClellan's gallantry and urge voters
                    to go to the polls and correct the errors of abolitionism.</summary>

                    the Democratic candidates, are plain, unassuming, honest working men -- men of
                    common sense and sound judgement, whose interests are identical with those of
                    the Farmer and the laboring man, and are just the kind of men to represent us in
                    the next legislature."</excerpt>

                    military force being here, able to resist, the town was surrendered on the terms

                    <p>On Friday evening last, our citizens were much surprised and considerably
                        excited by reports of the advance of a large force of Rebel Cavalry by way
                        of Mercersburg. Men arrived on horseback who had been hotly pursued by them
                        to within three or four miles of Town.</p>
                    <p>About 7 o'clock a company of them appeared in the Public Square carrying a
                        flag of truce and demanding a surrender of the place. No military force
                        being here, able to resist, the town was surrendered on the terms that
                        private property would be respected and citizens be unmolested. They then
                        took full possession of the place, and on the next morning took their
                        departure to the direction of Gettysburg leaving a guard to fire the Depot
                        buildings. The Depot House, the Machine Shops and the Warehouses of the
                        Messrs Wunderlich and Nead were entirely consumed with a considerable amount
                        of Government stores and other property. The Rebel force numbered about 1500
                        Cavalry and Artillery under Generals Stuart and Hampton. They have stolen
                        about 1000 Horses in this County, but from last reports and the preparations
                        made for their capture, we feel confident that the whole force will be
                        captured and the stolen property recovered.</p>
                    <p>We are hurried in getting to Press and can give no extended notice of this
                        humiliating Rebel invasion of Pennsylvania soil.</p>
