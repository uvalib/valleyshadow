<b>The Abolitionists Preparing to Abandon the Union</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Cites a statement from an anonymous letter that supposedly represents the
                    views of an abolitionist. The article observes, on the basis of the letter, that
                    abolitionists would prefer to stay separate rather than recreating the Union on
                    any terms which accept the institution of slavery. It argues that abolitionists
                    believe that Northern Democrats are trying to engineer such a reunion. The
                    article emphasizes that Northern Democrats are in fact more loyal to the Union
                    than abolitionists are, despite accusations to the contrary.<br>

<b>Victory or Defeat</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that, with the war nearly a year old, there does not appear to be a
                    speedy solution in sight. However, it warns, the war will be much longer and
                    deadlier if it is prosecuted on the terms of abolitionists, which require
                    emancipation and, in the eyes of this author, a complete surrender of the rights
                    of the state. A more conservative goal would be allowing the South to admit the
                    futility of its cause and working toward a quick reunion.<br>

<b>Indiana Democratic State Convention</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprint of selected resolutions passed by the Indiana State Democratic
                    Convention, most of which blame the Republican Party for bringing on the war and
                    for disregarding civil liberties in the prosecution of the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"There was gratifying evidence in the Convention of a willingness to
                    forget former divisions, and to unite for the sake of the Union, upon the
                    conservative and patriotic principles of true Democracy."<br>

<b>The Democracy and The President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises Lincoln for the stand he has taken against abolition, arguing that
                    he is essentially adopting Democratic doctrines. If Lincoln continues on this
                    path, the Valley Spirit argues, he might save the country from the horrors of a
                    radical Republican party in power. The editorial puts the blame for the war on
                    abolitionists, not on slavery, and argues that there is absolutely no
                    constitutional ground for abolition. If abolition were to become a war aim, the
                    editorial concludes, it would invalidate the Congressional declaration of war
                    and would betray the slave-holding Unionist border states. It would also erase
                    any trace of unionist sentiment in the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Blowing Hot and Cold</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Pokes fun at the Dispatch for its attempt to defend abolition while
                    simultaneously claiming that the Dispatch's editor is not an abolitionist.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Southern News</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Several articles published by southern newspapers, one accusing northern
                    papers of fabricating stories about the war in order to manipulate the stock
                    market; another exhorting all Southerners to volunteer unless they desire to
                    live under Northern tyranny.<br>
