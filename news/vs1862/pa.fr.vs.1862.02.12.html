<b>Letter from Hon. A.S. Diven</b><br> (Column l)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from one Congressman to another. A.S. Diven, the author of the
                    letter, delineates the differences between them regarding the ultimate aims of
                    the war. The author seeks to restore the Union and to maintain all the rights of
                    the Southern states prior to secession, namely, slavery. He views secession as a
                    plot by a few leaders that misled thousands of Southerners. In the author's eyes
                    his correspondent, an abolitionist, would unjustly deprive the South of its
                    legitimate property and would make the region dependent on the other states.<br>(Names in announcement: Hon. A.S. Diven, Hon. James Dunn)</blockquote>
<b>Republican Humiliation--Democratic Triumph</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes that President Lincoln has put a Democrat, Edwin Stanton, in the
                    place of a Republican as Secretary of War. With McClellan, a Democrat, at the
                    head of the Army, the article claims that Democrats have been vindicated from
                    the accusation of being traitors. Democrats have in fact proved themselves more
                    loyal to the Union than anti-slavery Republicans.<br>

                    of people asking for consideration, each of whom, from the telling of the story,

<b>Let Us Be Consistent</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The White House gave a ball last Thursday, which the Valley Spirit views as
                    the pinnacle of bad taste. Since Lincoln had campaigned against Buchanan on the
                    grounds of waste, corruption, and extravagance, the editors accuse Lincoln of
                    engaging in the same practices he condemned. The Spirit also criticizes the
                    Lincoln administration's handling of the Trent affair and argues that if it had
                    exhibited the same willingness to compromise with the South that it showed with
                    Britain, the war might never have happened.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>What Ails Him?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Pokes fun at the editor of the Dispatch, whom they continue to accuse of
                    flip-flopping on his position on abolitionism.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Changing Front</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Accuses the abolitionists and Britain of being in collusion, but claims
                    that ironically, Britain is planning an invasion from Canada into New England,
                    manned by contraband slaves brought north by the Underground Railroad.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Congressional Proceedings--Expulsion of Mr. Bright</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of the Senate debate over the expulsion of Senator Bright of
                    Indiana on the grounds of disloyalty. The majority of the transcript is Bright's
                    statement defending himself. He argues that he has always voted for peace over
                    sectional interests. Now that he is faced with expulsion, however, he realizes
                    he can no longer serve with the likes of Senator Sumner of Massachusetts or
                    Senator Clark of New Hampshire.<br>
