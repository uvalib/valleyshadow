                <summary>A letter to Lincoln in which the author argues that the end of abolition
                    can be practically accomplished through confiscation of slaves in Confederate
                    territories, without attempting to outlaw the institution itself. Such a policy,
                    the author points out, avoids what he sees as an extraconstitutional assumption
                    of authority which a general abolition policy would bring about--in that it
                    would deny slaveholders in the border states of property unjustly.</summary>

                <excerpt> "Hosea should be forthwith cannonized [sic] a Saint, and we suggest to
                    them that they should alter their pass-word from "where does Abe live and

                    pair--the country is safe in their hands!--" </excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Harrisburg <emph rend="italic">Patriot and Union</emph> calls upon us for
                        information relative to Hosea Carpenter, the father of the Loyal Union, or
                        Union League, which that paper exposed a week or two since. We will give the
                            <emph rend="italic">Patriot</emph> and the public the benefit of what
                        information we can gather with reference thereto.</p>
                    <p>Hosea Carpenter is a resident of Greenfield, this county, and is decidedly a
                        specimen brick. He is now from forty to forty-five years of age, and we
                        cannot learn that he ever distinguished himself previous to embarking in the
                        Union League business, save as Captain of the "Greenfield Greens," a
                        military company the organization of which, we believe, has been disbanded,
                        since the war broke out at least. He was the President of a Know Nothing
                        Lodge during the palmy days of that order, and says that he still adheres to
                        the principles of that order--that while his party left him <emph
                            rend="italic">en masse</emph> for the Republican party, he remained firm
                        and steadfast till Lincoln was nominated, when he too joined the fortunes of
                        the rail-splitter.</p>
                    <p>He was in Wilkes-Barre all last week, hard at work in the business of his new
                        order. The <emph rend="italic">expose</emph> of the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Patriot and Union</emph> reached him here, much to his own
                        mortification and the chagrin of his followers whose names appeared with his
                        papers published by the <emph rend="italic">Patriot</emph>. For some days he
                        was very quiet, pretending to know nothing of the order of the League, or of
                        its existence. Finally, however, the waters broke loose and Hosea found
                        himself unable to restrain them. About as often as he approached men for the
                        purposes of leading them within the <emph rend="italic">sanctum
                        sanctorum</emph> of the order, he found that they betrayed him. Enough were
                        ready to examine his "cards," but when he came to the oath, before informing
                        them where "Abe lived and travelled," they generally backed out and promised
                        to see him again. Finally, several copies of his documents found their way
                        to the public--Longstreet, the Chairman of the Republican County Committee,
                        and others whom he vowed were High Priests of the order, seeing the
                        ridiculous position in which they were placed, turned their backs upon him.
                        He wrote an article in defence of the order against the <emph rend="italic"
                            >expose</emph> of the <emph rend="italic">Patriot and Union</emph> and
                        took it to Miner the editor of the Republican organ, who refused to publish
                        it telling Hosea that he had made a great fool of himself and was ruining
                        the Republican party by his indiscretions in allowing the thing to be
                        exposed. Hose told Miner and Longstreet, according to his own story, that
                        they were renegades, and threatened them with expulsion from the order. He
                        also says that he was threatened with personal violence if he did not leave
                        town. Nevertheless he kept on at his work, much to the amusement of the
                        Democrats and the mortification and annoyance of the Republicans. On
                        Thursday he made the "cards," constitution and pledges public to every one
                        that he approached, keeping secret on the oaths, pass words, grips and names
                        of members of the order. He exhibited a list of over thirty Lodges in this
                        county, and declared that through the Legislative Union at Harrisburg about
                        one-half the counties of the State were already organized; that he should
                        first attend to a sufficient number of counties to make up two-thirds of the
                        State, and then he should travel through Maryland and other States for the
                        purpose of organizing them. all persons who oppose the order or refuse to
                        subscribe to its tenets, are to be reported to head quarters as traitors and
                        "spotted" accordingly.</p>
                    <p>He admits that the constitution as printed in the <emph rend="italic">Patriot
                            and Union</emph> is correct--says that it was printed at the office of
                        the Harrisburg <emph rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>, and was stolen from the
                        desk of Mr. Capron, Assistant Clerk of the House, who drew it up, and was
                        handed over to the <emph rend="italic">Patriot and Union</emph> for
                        publication. He threatens Bergner with the terrors of the order if he dares
                        to recant the faith or turn his back upon the order as Longstreet has.
                        Failing to procure the publication of his defence, he endeavored to get the
                        Court Room, on Thursday evening, for the purpose of personal explanation,
                        but he says the Commissioners refused. So on Friday morning Hosea left town,
                        saying that he should go to Harrisburg in a few days to look after the
                        interests of the order there, punish the <emph rend="italic">Patriot and
                            Union</emph> and make Bergner stand up to his work. So the <emph
                            rend="italic">Patriot and Union</emph> may expect to see the illustrious
                        personage soon.</p>
                    <p>Of the names published by the <emph rend="italic">Patriot and Union</emph> as
                        the Committee of the League to Luzerne county, all are leading Republicans,
                        and most of them, if not all, members of the Republican County
                        Committee--S.P. Longstreet, Chairman. Four of them are Post Masters under
                        Lincoln's appointment, among the very best offices in the county, viz.: D.
                        N. Lathrop, Carbondale; J.T. Fellows, Hyde Park; D.H. Jay, Scranton; and
                        D.G. Driedsbaugh, Beach Haven. C.J. Baldwin was late Clerk of the Courts of
                        this county. Northrup and Strong are influential and active Republicans, but
                        hold no office. Longstreet is a lawyer, and aspires, we understand, to the
                        place of Mr. Ketcham in the Senate. Carpenter says that he had considerable
                        trouble to get Senator Ketcham into the ring, but he finally yielded. The
                        Senator aspires to be the next candidate for Congress from this District on
                        the Republican side.</p>
                    <p>In conversation with several gentlemen when here, Carpenter stated that he
                        got the idea of the order from the Know Nothing organization, the books and
                        papers of which belonging to the Greenfield Lodge he still has. The truth
                        is, he is more crazy than foolish on this subject, and we judge from all the
                        circumstances and facts we can gather, that after hitting upon the idea of
                        forming the order, he confided it to party friends who seized hold of it
                        with the intention of running the machine themselves, not giving him full
                        honors as its founder. Becoming elated with the prospect of success in the
                        enterprise, he will not give it up and relinquish the honors to others; and
                        not having the capacity nor shrewdness to carry it on himself, he has
                        spoiled the whole affair by his indiscretions, running the craft clean
                        ashore, and leaving the politicians who embarked in it as another edition of
                        Know Nothingism, promising like fruits, high and dry on the beach. The poor
                        fellows are to be pitied. What next will they get up in this transformation
                        state of their party? Hosea should be forthwith cannonized [sic] a Saint,
                        and we suggest to them that they should alter their pass-word from "where
                        does Abe live and travel," to that of <emph rend="italic">Hosea</emph> Abe
                        and Hosea--a glorious pair--the country is safe in their hands!--<emph

                    known as the Loyal Union League. He has been disavowed by Republican papers, but

                <summary>Reprint of the closing remarks of Crittenden on the confiscation bill
                    before the House of Representatives. Crittenden opposes the bill, claiming that
                    not only is it unconstitutional, but that it would release a horde of penniless
                    blacks into the North and force the country to go even deeper into debt to
                    support them. He proclaims that while Lincoln has won him over to his side, if
                    the President insists on following what Crittenden sees as a partisan course, he
                    will relinquish his place in history.</summary>

                    <p>As much as the Democratic party desire to see an end put to this horrible and
                        unnatural war, and peace again restored to the country, it would not have
                        our Government humble itself before an armed rebellion, or accede to terms
                        that would be dishonorable, or in contravention to the Constitution upon
                        which our institutions are founded, <emph rend="italic">merely for the sake
                            of peace</emph>. We want no peace short of a restoration of the Union.
                        Our Flag must again float over every inch of our former territory, and be
                        honored and respected as in days past, before the war can end. Let the war
                        be pushed vigorously forward to attain that end, and when that is
                        accomplished, and the friendship of the Union men of the South regained and
                        their confidence in the Government reassured, the war ought to terminate and
                        life and property be spared. Our Government should leave nothing undone to
                        reassure the Union men of the South that their rights under the Constitution
                        will not be trampled upon for to them it must look for aid in
                        re-establishing the Union and maintaining and administering the laws when
                        the war ends. We see how well this is working in Tennessee under Hon. Andrew
                        Johnson, and the same good results are manifesting themselves every day,
                        under the lead of Southern Union men, in other parts of the rebel States.
                        Nobly have the Union men of the South stood side by side with the Democracy
                        of the North and battled all through these trying times for the Union, the
                        whole Union and nothing but the Union. The Southern Union men have risked
                        all--suffered all--to show to the world that they were honest in the
                        principles they professed of being as much opposed to a <emph rend="italic"
                            >sectional</emph> party South as they were to a <emph rend="italic"
                            >sectional</emph> party North. It matters not whether that party take
                        the name of "Secession" or "Abolition," or is marshaled under the leadership
                        of Jeff. Davis in the South or Abraham Lincoln at the North, its aim is
                        disunion and its fruits Civil War, but while the Democratic party is true to
                        itself its hellish purposes can never be consummated. Jackson said--"The
                        Union must and shall be preserved," and <emph rend="italic">his words</emph>
                        will ever find a response in the heart of every true Democrat.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party has heartily supported the Administration, as the
                        representative head of the Government, in all its just efforts to put down
                        the rebellion and re-establish the supremacy of the laws over the entire
                        country. It knows no other issue than the restoration of the Union upon the
                        eternal principles of justice, and a regard for the constitutional rights of

                        Democratic party is pouring out its best blood on our battle-fields. To
                        fight to establish negro equality, or to back up the Administration in its
                        abolition schemes, is no part of the programme of the Democracy in the
                        present war, nor can it be held in any way accountable for the enormous
                        taxation imposed upon the people to cover up the corruptions and pay the
                        expenses of the plunderings and extravagance of this Administration.</p>

                <summary>This editorial argues that the Democratic Party is in full support of the
                    Lincoln administration's efforts to put down the war. However, it argues that
                    the government should promise the Union men of the South that their rights will
                    be preserved after the war, and the editors point to the administration of
                    Andrew Johnson in Tennessee as an example of how this might work. Beyond
                    supporting Lincoln's prosecution of the war, however, the editors refuse to
                    support his abolition goals or condone the corruption they discern in his
                    administration.</summary>

                <excerpt>"Why should honest men with honest aims seek to conceal their movements and
                    avoid the discussion of their sentiments in open day?"</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We published in our last issue an <emph rend="italic">expose</emph> from the
                            <emph rend="italic">Patriot</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Union</emph>,
                        of a new <emph rend="italic">secret</emph> political organization, gotten up
                        by political tricksters and broken down <emph rend="italic">Horse
                            Contractors</emph>, to save the sinking fortunes of the Abolition
                        Republican party. It seems that this new scheme to cheat the honest portion
                        of the people out of their votes, was first started in this State by a
                        certain Hosea Carpenter, of Luzerne County. This enterprising individual we
                        are informed, having organized a <emph rend="italic">League</emph> in his
                        own county, came to Harrisburg during the winter, and with the assistance of
                        a number of Abolition Senators and Representatives, organized a "<emph
                            rend="italic">Legislative Loyal Union League</emph>," which deputized
                        him to travel the State and organize a <emph rend="italic">League</emph> in
                        every country at the rate of <emph rend="italic">five dollars</emph> each.
                        This is a new dodge but it wont win. The people were sufficiently dosed with
                            <emph rend="italic">secret</emph> political parties in the rise and fall
                        of "Know Nothingism" to last them half a century. "Where does Abe live and
                        travel?" will meet the same fate at the hands of the people that was meted
                        out to that somewhat classic salutation of "How's Sam?" The people in this
                        enlightened nineteenth century, living under a Republican form of
                        government, will not tolerate a set of midnight conspirators who must resort
                        to dodging into lanes and alleys after nightfall, and climb up dark
                        stairways with the aid of dark lanterns in order to carry out their
                        nefarious purposes. If there is one thing more than another that citizens of
                        a free country should guard against and denounce, it is a <emph
                            rend="italic">secret</emph> political party, no matter what name it may
                        assume, whether "Know Nothing," "Loyal League," or "Knights of the Golden
                        Circle" or any other, the danger is the same. There is nothing so dangerous
                        to the liberties of the people as the secret machinations of designing and
                        corrupt politicians, and hence we raise our warning voice against them in
                        all their forms and phases. Of this the people may feel assured that it is
                        not their good these men have at heart, but the accomplishment of <emph
                            rend="italic">their own</emph> selfish and ambitious ends. Why should
                        honest men with honest aims seek to conceal their movements and avoid the
                        discussion of their sentiments in open day? Or why should honest men, like
                            <emph rend="italic">robbers</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                            >counterfeiters</emph>, seek out some out of the way place to hold their
                        meetings and take upon themselves extra-judicial oaths, pledging themselves
                        not to reveal any thing that transpires there, and even to utter positive
                            <emph rend="italic">falsehoods</emph> if necessary, to prevent
                        themselves from being detected and exposed to the public? These are
                        pertinent questions, and no political ingenuity can answer them
                        satisfactorily. Such doings are so utterly at variance with the spirit and
                        genius of our free institutions, that we cannot for the life of us
                        understand how sensible and intelligent men, having the smallest grain of
                        patriotism in their hearts, (not to say anything of self respect,) can have
                        anything to do with them. This movement of Hosea Carpenter &amp; Co. we
                        look upon as the last shift of a set of desperate trading politicians to
                        keep themselves from sinking, and to obtain a new lease from the people to
                        plunder the government and rob the treasury a little while longer. We are
                        much mistaken, however, if the people will gratify the wishes of these <emph
                            rend="italic">patriotic</emph> politicians. No, gentlemen, your doom is
                        sealed; your day of grace is fast drawing to a close, your speculations in

                        reached and the people cry <emph rend="italic">enough</emph>. The thunder
                        tones of the people will ring in your ears about the second Tuesday of next
                        October and cause you to skulk back to your <emph rend="italic"

                    question of slavery should be left to the states, and that abolition would throw
                    thousands of blacks into competition with white laborers.</summary>
