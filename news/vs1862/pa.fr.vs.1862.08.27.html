<b>Correspondence from the "Army of Virginia"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Two letters from the same correspondent, one dated August 22 and the other
                    dated August 23, detailing the movements of the 126th Reg't Penn. Volunteers as

                    their preparation to move to Manassas. Conditions are reported to be good,
                    though they have been marching a good deal, and all the men are excited to put
                    their courage to the test. The author hopes, though, that the generals will be
                    wise enough not to throw green troops straight into the fighting, but will
                    instead detail them to ditching or trenching work.<br>

                    <p>Camp Stanton, Near Alexandria, Va.,</p>
                    <p><br>Friday, August 22d, 1862</p>
                    <p>
                        Correspondence of the Spirit and Times
                    </p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors: Yesterday morning early we were ordered to strike our tents
                        and prepare for a still farther march into Virginia. We had not proceeded
                        far, however, before we came to a halt in a beautiful little valley, skirted
                        by woods, about a mile from our former camping ground. Here we again took up
                        our temporary abode, and commenced at once to decorate our "streets"' with
                        trees and arbors, making the whole camp look like some tastefully arranged
                        grove. Some of the more aesthetically inclined of our youths suggested that
                        we should procure some tame canaries and squirrels to render the illusion
                        complete. But all these visions of comfort were soon dissipated by the news
                        that to-day we were to move to Alexandria, there at once to be brigaded and
                        put into active service; and it is now certain that we will move sometime
                        today, everything being now in readiness, except a sufficient number of
                        wagons, which will be here this morning. We may be left, for a short time on
                        provost duty at Alexandria, there being a well drilled Pennsylvania three
                        years regiment now stationed there, which will likely be at once sent into
                        the field. But if we join Gen. Sturgis' command as is now generally
                        expected, the probability is we will be marched farther South, or go by
                        water to Acquia Creek, within a very few days. Gen. Sturgis, it will be
                        remembered, is from Cumberland County and achieved quite an enviable
                        reputation for himself in Missouri; he is personally acquainted with many of
                        our officers and men, and we feel highly honored to learn that he personally
                        requested that our regiment be attached to his brigade. If he should be our
                        commander, he will find himself at once very popular with at least this
                        portion of his command.</p>
                    <p>This is the first rainy day we have had in camp, and it is much more pleasant
                        than you would at first imagine, especially to those who can remain "within
                        doors." Some one of our poets has enlarged upon the pattering of the rain
                        upon the house-roof, but he certainly never slept under a well stretched
                        tent-cloth during a refreshing shower. There is something very attractive
                        about it; and in fact there is something very attractive in all the features
                        of the soldier's life. A meal never tastes so sweetly as after a day's
                        fasting. One never sleeps so soundly as after an eight miles march. Water
                        never proves more grateful than when drank out of some gurgling little
                        stream, by the roadside, during one of the "rests" that come so acceptably.</p>
                    <p>Cloud's Mills, Va. <br>Saturday Morning, August 23d.</p>
                    <p>Just where I stopped above, the order came to strike our tents again; and we
                        took up our line of march for Alexandria, a distance of three miles, and
                        thence South to this place (Cloud's Mills), a still further distance of five
                        miles. We made this long march with only two "rests," and many of the men
                        were almost given out. We encamped here over night, and already the order
                        has come for our division (Sturgis') to prepare at once to take the cars for
                        Manassas. Pope is falling back to that place. Burnside has landed at Acquia
                        Creek. McClellan's army has been passing by us yesterday and to-day, in
                        almost one continuous train of cars, also bound for Manassas. Jackson has
                        already been reinforced by almost the entire rebel army from Richmond, and
                        has crossed the Rapidan; and the indications are that the severest battle of
                        the war will be fought in this vicinity, in a very few days. There seems to
                        be great need of men, and in all probability we will take an active part in
                        the approaching engagement. This seems the more probable, as each man is to
                        be furnished with one hundred and forty rounds of
                            cartridge, to be carried in his knapsack and cartridge box. The
                        men are all in the highest spirits and anxious to have their courage put to
                        the test; though there seems to be a general regret that they are not better
                        drilled. Yet all have confidence in their officers and each other. If the
                        worst must come, you may rest assured Franklin County will never be
                        disgraced by the "One Hundred and Twenty Sixth." We are all determined to do
                        our duty, under whatever circumstances we may be placed; and no more can be
                        asked from us.</p>
                    <p>There has been continued and heavy skirmishing between the advanced lines of
                        the two armies, for several days. And even while I am writing, we can hear
                        the steady and unremitting war of heavy artillery, which evidently is not
                        more than twenty miles distant. On our road to this place we passed long
                        lines of ambulances, conveying sick and wounded soldiers to the hospitals in
                        and around Alexandria, and we nearly all came to the conclusion that it
                        begins to look very much like war in this vicinity.</p>
                    <p>From this point we will be compelled to leave our tents behind, but our guin
                        blankets are so constructed that four of them, laced together, form a very
                        good and commodious shelter. The men are already throwing away many of the
                        little conveniences they brought with them from home. It is utterly
                        impossible to carry them with us on our long marches. Our knapsacks have to
                        be lightened as much as possible of everything not absolutely necessary,
                        especially when they have to contain one hundred rounds of cartridges in
                        addition to their ordinary contents.</p>
                    <p>Although we go to the field of action, my individual opinion is that, unless
                        it is absolutely necessary to throw us into battle, by reason of the
                        inferiority of our forces in point of numbers, we will be detailed for
                        ditching and trenching or some such work for which we would be better
                        qualified than for maneuvering on the battle field: Yet it is very
                        significant, that we are the farthest advanced of any of the new regiments
                        and nearly all the men in Gen. Sturgis command are veterans compared with
                        us. Of course all this is conjecture, but it is reasonable to suppose that
                        no wise General would throw green troops into battle, if he had a sufficient
                        force of disciplined men at his disposal.</p>
                    <p>If anything of interest or importance occurs I will let you hear of it at the
                        first opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Our post office address remains unchanged--"Company--126th Regiment P.V.,
                        Washington, D.C."</p>
                    <p>The general health of our Regiment is most excellent, much better, indeed,
                        than it was the first week of our service, and it is no exageration [sic] to
                        say that, despite all their long marches and hardships, the men are all in
                        higher spirits than they were wont to be at home.</p>

<b>Party vs. Patriotism</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that partisans have often used patriotism to achieve their political
                    goals. When John Brown's raid and the anti-fugitive slave law agitation began in
                    the North, the editors argue, Southerners were the most patriotic people one
                    could find. Similarly, now, Northern abolitionists are super-patriots, as they
                    try to transform the war into one that will accomplish their partisan goal of
                    destroying slavery. The preservation of the Union is not the ultimate goal for
                    either party, and Democrats and conservatives need to condemn the abolitionists
                    as the election season draws near.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The President's Reply to Greeley</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises President Lincoln's reply to a critical letter written by Horace
                    Greeley, in which Lincoln seems to reject entreaties to make abolition the goal
                    of the war. The editors warmly thank Lincoln for the letter and urge him to make
                    similar pronouncements, predicting it will win him ten friends for every enemy
                    he makes.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Maintaining the Constitution</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors praise what seems to be Lincoln's determination to "adhere to a
                    strictly constitutional policy" in carrying out the war and his implicit
                    condemnation of abolitionist goals.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Indiana and Negro Soldiers</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors publish a denial by the military secretary of Indiana of the
                    rumor that officials of that state had offered two black regiments to the
                    service of the Union. Indiana would not tolerate arming blacks, claims the
                    official.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Speech of Hon. John B. Haskin</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Haskin, a former Congressman from New York, gave a speech regarding the
                    willingness and ability of blacks to fight. The thrust of the speech is that
                    most blacks are actually happy in the South. The contrabands he saw when in the
                    South, he said, had only run away because their masters had left to fight the
                    Union, abandoning their slaves. If blacks had really wanted to help themselves,
                    he asks, why did they not form themselves into Union companies in the South?
                    Because most are contented in their position, he argues. Why bother agitating on
                    the "nigger question" when it just alienates the Southern unionists and doesn't
                    even give the blacks what they want?<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Vagaries of the Brain</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Americans often get caught up in believing that we have a
                    higher destiny for our country and that we hold our own destiny in our hands. At
                    times, the editors claim, this leads people to unrealistic hopes of reformation
                    that go against the grain of history. This is the case with abolitionists, say
                    the editors, who seem to believe that all the evils that face the country will
                    be erased with the abolition of slavery. This is not the case, conclude the
                    editors--the country would do the slaves more harm then good by freeing them, as
                    in their present condition they are better off than the white workers who starve
                    within sight of plenty.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Beaufort, S.C., July 30th, 1862</p>
                    <p>We are quite conscious of, and fully appreciate the fact, that many persons
                        throughtout [sic] the loyal States are making great sacrifices for the cause
                        of our beloved country, and are doing much for the physical comfort and
                        spiritual welfare of our soldiers.</p>
                    <p>Much has already been accomplished by the generous donation of tracts, papers
                        and other religious publications. And the hallowed influences thus exerted
                        for the religious culture of the soldier are very great. Eternity alone will
                        reveal their blessed results.</p>
                    <p>Yet, both our experience and observation clearly demonstrate to us, that, in
                        connection with our religious services in camp, Christian correspondence
                        from Home is doing more for the morals and spiritual advancement of our men
                        in the army, than any other instrumentality employed.</p>
                    <p>The soldier, whether officer or private, old or young, will read a letter who
                        would not read a tract or religious paper.</p>
                    <p>First, Because it is addressed immediately to him,</p>
                    <p>Second, Because it is written by one personally in his welfare.</p>
                    <p>Even, the least paper or tract enclosed to a soldier, by the kindred or
                        friend addressing him, with the request to read it, will incline him to read
                        and re-read it, until its truths are indelibly impressed upon his heart.</p>
                    <p>The letter, with its contents thus addressed to him will be carefully folded
                        and placed in his pocket for future reference; so that, when out on picket
                        duty or during his leisure moments, he will have something to read and
                        occupy his mind. The impressions made by such letters are like bread cast
                        upon the waters to be found after many days.</p>
                    <p>We would say then: Parents, write to your sons; wives, write to your
                        husbands; sisters, write to your brothers; children write to your parents,
                        write often, cheerfully and encouragingly. Let your letters abound in words
                        of cheer, and breathing the spirit of Christian sympathy and love.</p>
                    <p>Kindly admonish your friends to shun the evils incident to camp life. Urge
                        them to lay hold of the sure promises of the Gospel, which will purify,
                        strengthen and save the soul.</p>
                    <p>In the name and by the authority of the "Great Captain of our Salvation," we
                        say to pastors and people, write messages of love to our soldiers. We do not
                        ask for long and studied letters, but for simple, home-like cheerful
                        Christian letters.</p>
                    <p>Christian young ladies, write. Write to all your friends and acquaintances,
                        who have gone forth to battle for our country. Let no feelings of false
                        delicacy deter you in the matter. And in writing, seek to blend the
                        endearments of home and the occurences [sic] of the neighborhood with the
                        story of the cross.</p>
                    <p>You will thus strew the rugged pathway of the defenders of our country, with
                        flowers of immortal bloom and accomplish much good for the salvation of
                        souls and the glory of God.</p>
                    <p>"The seed that, in these few and fleeting hours <br>Your hand unsparing and
                        unwearied sow, <br>Shall deck your graves with amaranthine flowers <br>And
                        yield you fruits divine in heaven's immortal bowers."</p>
                    <p>Yours, Truly <br>W.D.C. Rodrock, Chap. 47th Reg. P.V. <br>J.C. Emerson, "
                        7th N.H.V. <br>C.T. Woodruff, " 9th Conn. <br>H.A. Philbrook, " 8th
                    Maine.</p>
