<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Small Politicians in Council.</p>
                    <p>A few weeks ago we wrote and published an article under the caption of "Small
                        Politicians," which seems to have caused quite a flutter in the camp. The
                            semi-weakly man considering himself one of the class to which we alluded, immediately
                        called his associates together in solemn council to deliberate upon what was
                        best to be done. After a great deal of "fine metaphysical reasoning" upon
                        the subject, and having first consulted all their standard works, such as
                        the New York Tribune, SUMNER's speech on the
                        "Barbarism of Slavery" and the "HELPER Book," a reply was determined upon.
                        The article in the Spirit being construed into an
                        attack on working men, (though nothing could have been further from our mind
                        when we wrote it,) the semi-weakly man was
                        selected to write the reply, for the reason that he had once announced
                        himself to the people of Franklin County, as the "working man's candidate"
                        for a county office, and after his election, either through laziness,
                        incompetency or some other cause, he "farmed" the office out on the shares
                        and gave his personal attention to talking "small politics" on the street
                        corners, in shops and stores, and in places where small politicians "most do
                        congregate." This being arranged the Council adjourned to meet again at the
                        call of the chairman, and the semi-weakly man
                        commenced operations on the reply. After about ten days of severe labor and
                        hard study, during which time frequent reference was had to the aforesaid
                        standards, he produced something he thought would do.</p>
                    <p>The council was then re-assembled to examine the production, and after it was
                        properly revised, improved, condensed, dilated, punctuated and its false
                        syntax corrected, the semi-weakly man was ordered
                        to "let her rip." In correcting the false syntax the following sentence
                        which appears in the production was unfortunately overlooked: "What right
                            has greasy mechanics and mudsills to talk
                        learnedly of this measure and of that measure and of entering into any fine
                        metaphysical reasoning?" The semi-weakly man
                        would say emphatically, "they has no right." The
                        article as revised, improved, condensed, dilated, punctuated and corrected
                        made its appearance in the semi-weakly dispatch
                        of last Friday morning, just ten days after the appearance of the article in
                        the Spirit to which it is intended as a reply.
                        And what a reply! One half of it made up of brackets and exclamation points, and the
                        other half of nonsense. In it the semi-weakly
                        man, as usual, indulges freely in the use of his favorite terms of "greasy
                        mechanics" and "mudsills" when speaking of that highly respectable class of
                        the community known as mechanics and working men. He is the only newspaper
                        conductor in this town who has never applied these terms to that class of
                        the community, to our knowledge, and the honest, hard-working mechanics and
                        laboring men should certainly feel under obligations to this half-crazed
                        fanatic for such complimentary notices.</p>
                    <p>As the semi-weakly has been bidding for a notice at our hands ever since our connection with
                        the Spirit office, we concluded to give it this one gratuitously, and if it will agree to pay
                        us according to our usual rates of advertising patent medicines we will give
                        it another when convenient. We had scarcely taken possession before we were
                        assailed by this contemptible eight by ten sheet in a spirit of mean,
                        bitter, dastardly, fanatical vindictiveness, perhaps never before equaled by
                        any newspaper publisher towards others entering upon the same business. We
                        do not wish, however, to be understood by our readers as dignifying the
                            semi-weakly concern with a reply in defence
                        of ourselves, for we need no defence against charges from that source, but what we have written has simply
                        been done for the reason that it occasionally becomes necessary to give a
                            Cur a kick to get rid of his annoyance.</p>

<b>The Congressional Apportionment</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Details the gerrymandering of congressional districts in Pennsylvania under
                    the new apportionment bill passed last Wednesday in the Pennsylvania House. The
                    editors note that in the 1860 gubernatorial election, Republican Curtain beat
                    Democrat Foster by 262,250 to 230,00, and that that ratio indicated the relative
                    strength of the two parties. However, under the apportionment, Democrats are
                    given four safe districts while Republicans received nineteen safe or likely
                    Republican districts. This was accomplished principally by illegally overloading
                    Democratic districts and making skimpy Republican districts.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Trailer: </font>"We have said enough to show that this apportionment is a most disgraceful
                    gerrymander. We trust that it will not inure to the benefit of the tricksters
                    and apostates who are responsible for its enactment and that the people in
                    October next will teach a wholesome lesson to its authors."<br>

<b>Franklin County Soldiers in the Great Battle at Pittsburg Landing</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    participate in the Union assault on April 7. The regiment suffered only eight

                    <p>Among the troops who participated in the great victory won on Monday, the 7th
                        of April, 1862, at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, were the 77th Pennsylvania
                        Regiment, under command of Col. F. S. STUMBAUGH. On the battle-field this
                        regiment formed part of a Brigade commanded by Col. Kirk, of the 24th
                        Illinois, attached to Gen McCook's Division. It will afford a high degree of
                        gratification to our citizens to learn that Col Stumbaugh's regiment
                        displayed such daring bravery on the battle-field as to win universal
                        admiration. A writer in the Pittsburg Chronicle
                        gives the following account of the part taken in this terrible battle by the
                        77th. The writer says:</p>
                    <p>"The Seventy-seventh regiment, Colonel Stumbaugh, was attached to M Cook's
                        Division, and played a most conspicuous part in the fight. The brigade left
                        their camp on Sunday morning, and marched twenty-three miles to the scene of
                        the engagement, over the most horrible roads, arriving at Savannah about 9
                        P. M. The battlefield was reached that night, and the men lay down in the
                        mud and rain until daylight, when they joined in an attack on the enemy,
                        which was conducted in gallant style. The Seventy-seventh made a brilliant
                        bayonet charge, and covered itself with glory. The entire division
                        complimented them for their steadiness and bravery, and dashing manner in
                        which the charge was executed. M Cook's division was badly cut up, but the
                        Seventy-seventh, though in the thickest of the fight, had but five killed
                        and ten wounded. Our correspondent gives a description of the sickening
                        spectacle which the battle field presented after the fight. Hundreds of
                        bodies and the carcasses of horses innumerable lay festering in the sun,
                        while the air seemed black with buzzards, attracted thither by the stench
                        which filled the atmosphere for miles around."</p>
                    <p>A correspondent of the Louisville Democrat writes
                        to that paper from the battlefield that the fight waxed extremely warm and
                        the result doubtful until M Cook's division came to our relief with a force
                        that proved a telling effect upon the ranks of the enemy. The enemy fought
                        with a valor and a heroism worthy a better cause.</p>
                    <p>The writer adds:</p>
                    <p>"From this time till night the slaughter was immense on the part of the
                        enemy, while we lost very few. Taken as a whole, it was the most sanguinary
                        battle of modern times. The battle-ground covered twenty-five square miles;
                        and the number of slain and wounded on both sides, cannot be less than
                        25,000."</p>
                    <p>Another correspondent in the Cincinnati Gazette
                        thus alludes to the 77th as the regiment "from the army of the Potomac."--</p>
                    <p>"Meanwhile M Cook, with as magnificent regiments as ever came from the army
                        of the Potomac or from any army of volunteers in the world, was doing
                        equally well toward the center. His division was handled in such a way as to
                        save great effusion of blood, while equally important results were attained.
                        Thus the reserves were kept as much as possible from under fire, while those
                        to the front were engaged. Thus the lists of killed and wounded will show
                        that while as heavy fighting was done here as anywhere on the right or
                        centre, the casualties are fewer than could have been expected."</p>
                    <p>The following description of a charge made by Col Kirk's brigade, to which
                        the 77th belongs, we find in the same paper:</p>
                    <p>"Kirk's brigade advanced to meet them, coming out of the woods into an open
                        field to do so. They were met by a tremendous fire which threw a battalion
                        of regulars in front of them, (under Major Oliver, I think), into some
                        confusion. They retired to reform, and meanwhile down drops the brigade flat
                        on the ground. Then as the front is clear, they spring up, charge across the
                        open field--never mind the falling--straight on, on to the woods--under
                        cover, with the enemy driven back by the impetuous advance."</p>
                    <p>Colonel E. N. Kirk was wounded in this charge in the shoulder and breast and
                        is now in the hospital at Louisville.</p>
                    <p>The battery attached to the 77th Regiment was not in the fight. It was left
                        at Columbia.</p>
                    <p>The first information received here that the 77th participated in the Great
                        Battle at Pittsburg Landing was contained in the following note written on a
                        part of an old letter with a lead pencil:</p>
                    <p>ON THE BATTLEFIELD AT PITTSBURG LANDING,<br>TENNESSEE, Tuesday Morning,
                        April 8th.</p>
                    <p>EDITOR VALLEY SPIRIT:</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir--We had a terrible battle yesterday. The
                        77th was in the fight eight hours; the men done nobly. We routed the enemy and drove them back to their
                        fortifications. It was a hand to hand contest all day. Some regiments
                        suffered severely. Our loss will not exceed eight wounded, some of them, I
                        regret to say, will die. Col. Stumbaugh is in command of the 5th Brigade
                        to-day. All the other Colonels in the Brigade wounded. None of the officers
                        in the 77th killed or wounded. Will send you the names of our wounded as
                        soon as they can be ascertained.</p>
                    <p>Yours in haste, P. B. HOUSEM</p>
                    <p><br>Lieut. Col. 77th Reg't P. V.</p>
                    <p>We have the pleasure of laying before our readers several interesting
                        paragraphs extracted from letters written by Col. Stumbaugh on the Battle
                        Field immediately after the fight:</p>
                    <p>CAMP ON THE BATTLEFIELD.</p>
                    <p><br>Near Pittsburg Landing, April 9th.</p>
                    <p>The Battle of the 6th and 7th is over and the Rebels routed. Grant's forces
                        were repulsed on Sunday. That day we marched 23 miles to Savannah, throwing
                        aside everything but guns and blankets, that could impede our march. We
                        reached Savannah in the night and took boats for Pittsburg Landing where we
                        arrived at daylight on Monday morning and went right into battle. Gen.
                        Buell's troops fought eight successive hours and routed the Rebels
                        completely. McCook's Division to which we belong stood the blunt of the
                        heavy fighting all day and nobly did every man in the Division sustain
                        himself. I will say for the men of the 77th that they fought like tigers.
                        Not one leaving the ranks except those ordered to take the wounded or the
                        prisoners to the rear. We have some men wounded, not many, two, I think,
                        mortally. None of the officers of the 77th were killed or wounded, and none
                        of the men from Chambersburg, so far as I now know, injured, though many
                        made narrow escapes. Our Brigade lost some fifty in killed and, perhaps, 250
                        wounded. All our Colonels wounded except myself. I am now in command of the
                        Brigade. The Battle Field is literally covered with the dead and wounded.
                        The Rebels suffered awfully in the fight. Our men are now engaged in
                        gathering up the wounded and burrying [sic] the dead. We had the bodies of
                        the dead piled up in placed like cord wood. It was the most terrific battle
                        ever fought in this country. We expect to go forward to Corinth to-day.
                        Reinforcements are pouring into our army from every quarter until its
                        numbers can scarcely be estimated. Yours,</p>
                    <p>F. S. STUMBAUGH</p>
                    <p><br>Col 77th Reg't P. V.</p>
                    <p>BATTLE FIELD, Pittsburg Landing,.</p>
                    <p><br>April 10, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Our army in the late battle sustained a heavy loss in killed and wounded, but
                        the Rebel loss is at least three to our one. The 77th escaped miraculously.
                        We were under a terrific fire for 8 hours and only 2 or 3 mortally wounded
                        and some 8 or 10 wounded slightly. The battle of Monday was the most
                        terrible ever fought in the country. On Sunday the Rebels under Beauregard
                        over 100,000 strong attacked Gen. Grant's forces numbering about 100,000 and
                        drove Grant back out of his camp, clean to the river, some 5 or 6 miles. In
                        the evening Gen. Buel's [sic] advance came up and saved Grant from an awful
                        defeat, and, perhaps, an unconditional surrender of his whole force. On
                        Monday morning early we reached the battle field, after seven days forced
                        marches, and went right in and fought all day driving the Rebels inch by
                        inch back over the battle ground of Sunday, until they broke and fled
                        leaving their dead and wounded on the field.</p>
                    <p>Our men have been two days busy burying the dead and are not half done yet.
                        The battle field extends over a space of ten miles square.</p>
                    <p>We may have one fight more out here, but that I am inclined to think will be
                        the last stand the Rebels will make.</p>
                    <p>We have not seen a tent for eight days--marched in the rain, laid in the
                        water and eat anything we could get, and still the men are in good spirits
                        and seem perfectly content.</p>
                    <p>Yours, F. S. STUMBAUGH,</p>
                    <p><br>Col. 77th Reg't P. V.</p>
                    <p>The latest account we have from the scene of conflict is contained in a
                        letter written by Col. P. B. Housum, dated April 12, 1862. The Colonel
                        writes:</p>
                    <p>"We are still encamped on the battle ground where many of the dead Rebels are
                        yet unburied. Some of the most horrible sights are to be seen here that
                        could possibly be imagined. We were in the battle all day Monday until the
                        Rebels retreated. The balls flew thick and fast around us, some of them
                        whistling unpleasantly close to our ears. We only had eight men in our
                        regiment wounded, none of them from Chambersburg. The only wonder is that we
                        were not all killed. God and right must be on our side. We left Columbia on
                        the Monday previous and when about 14 miles back from Savannah we heard the
                        thunder of battle and were ordered to hurry up. We took five days rations,
                        one blanket, left our wagons and came on to Savannah at 9 o'clock that
                        night. Here we were detained until 3 o'clock on Monday morning before we
                        could get aboard the boat. The 29th Indiana and Terrell's battery were on
                        the same boat with us. We landed about 7 o'clock next morning and were
                        marched at once to the battle field about half mile off. When we arrived on
                        the ground the firing of artillery and musketry was deafening and the most
                        awful sights presented themselves on every side; dead men lay strewn around
                        and piled up in heaps so that I could barely ride along. Dead horses without
                        number were scattered over the field, and trees cut off by cannon balls
                        obstructed the march. Our first position was within range of a rebel battery
                        where the cannon balls flew thick and some of them struck within a short
                        distance of us. We still advanced and came within range of musket balls when
                        the first of our men was wounded and carried to the rear. During the day we
                        were detached from our Brigade to support the 4th Brigade and after a while
                        we were left alone at some distance from the main body of troops, with three
                        rebel regiments of infantry, one of cavalry and a battery in front of us. We
                        are now without tents and it rains nearly every day and is quite cold. This
                        is to our advantage in one respect; if it was hot weather we could not stay
                        here on account of the smell of the dead bodies. I suppose there are about
                        1000 rebels still unburied strewn over the ground.</p>
                    <p>Col. Stumbaugh is in command of the 5th Brigade. All officers above him were
                        wounded on Monday, consequently I am in command of the 77th Reg't.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c., P. B. HOUSUM <br>Lieut Col. 77th Reg't P. V.</p>
