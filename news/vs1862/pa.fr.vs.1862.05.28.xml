                <summary>A reprint of a speech given on March 11 by Congressman C. A. Wickliffe of
                    Kentucky on the subject of the emancipation proposal that President Lincoln sent
                    to Congress. Wickliffe questions the constitutionality of the measure, inquires
                    of its sponsors what they intend to do with the millions of free blacks, and
                    hints that its ultimate consequence will be the elevation of blacks at the
                    expense of whites. However, he dismisses the possibility that Kentucky would
                    secede and join the Confederate states should they prove to be victorious.</summary>

                <excerpt>"The idea of a rebel army coming northward is absurd, and our people need
                    have no fears on that score."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The unexpected and startling news of the retreat of Gen. Banks' division of
                        the army from Strasburg to Winchester, and from thence to Martinsburg and
                        Harper's Ferry, before an overwhelming force of rebels under Generals Ewell
                        and Johnson, threw our community into a high state of excitement on Monday
                        last. We do not consider that the rebels have gained any permanent advantage
                        by this little flash of victory for them. It only goes to show the
                        desperation of their cause, and that finding that they cannot successfully
                        oppose the advance of the Union army upon their Capital, have made this push
                        of offensive operations to avoid acknowledging a defeat. This movement on
                        their part cannot in any way affect the operations of General McClellan or
                        General Halleck. These Generals will move on with their victorious columns
                        as though nothing of the kind had happened, and a very few days will give us
                        the glorious news of the fall of the rebel Capital, and the defeat of
                        Beauregard's army at Corinth, and we will then wonder at our excitement and
                        laugh at our fears. The idea of the rebel army coming northward is absurd,
                        and our people need have no fears on that score. In the first place they
                        have not the means of transportation sufficient to move a large army
                        northward with such rapidity as would enable them to accomplish any
                        important object and then make a safe retreat; and in the next our army in
                        their rear would effectually cut them off and leave their bones to bleach
                        upon our hill-sides, did they make the attempt, and not one would return to
                        tell the story of their folly.</p>
                    <p>The enemy may at this time have a sufficient force in the Valley of
                        Shenandoah to force Banks' small army across the Potomac, and they may,
                        perhaps, again destroy a portion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and
                        burn a bridge or two, but that will be the extent of the injuries they can
                        accomplish before they, in their turn, are driven back. Banks has already
                        been heavily re-inforced and but a few days will suffice to regain all the
                        ground lost. The advantage gained by the rebels is only temporary while much
                        permanent good must result from it for the Union cause. It has thoroughly
                        aroused our people and convinced them that nothing but heavy blows, struck
                        in rapid succession, can bring this rebellion to a speedy end. We trust that
                        this Administration will now more than ever see the necessity of laying
                        aside all side issues, that can in any manner distract the Union sentiment
                        of the people, and bend all its energies and resources to crushing cut this
                        wicked insurrection speedily and effectually, and restoring peace to the
                        whole country and re-establishing the Union and Equality of States. The
                        great Democratic party demand this--nothing more and nothing less--and will
                        to a man stand by the Government in accomplishing it.</p>

                    to the Transcript's accusation that the Spirit's recent citation of Henry Clay's
                    speeches is hypocritical, since the Spirit would not have supported Clay in the
                    1840s. The editors admit as much, but state that both parties at that point
                    agreed that slavery should be left to the states, the position, they argue, that
                    the Valley Spirit holds today.</summary>

                <summary>Reprints the resolutions adopted by the General Synod of the Evangelical
                    Lutheran Church, recently held at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The third resolution
                    interprets the war as a "righteous judgement of God, visited upon us because of
                    the individual and national sins of which we have all been guilty," but goes on
                    to say that domestic slavery is the more proximate cause, and calls for the
                    abolition of slavery. The editors protest this resolution, pointing out that it
                    was the same debate which split the Methodists in two, and says that ministers
                    have no right to speak on what is properly a political question.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Monday last was a day of excitement in this place. The news of the massacre
                        of Col. Kinley's First Maryland Regiment and the defeat of Gen. Banks,
                        excited our people to a degree not witnessed before during this war. At an
                        early hour in the morning the drums were out and large crowds of people were
                        collected on all the corners, and at public places reading the extras, and
                        circulating the order issued by the Governor calling out the militia and
                        Volunteers. Many of our most patriotic citizens at once commenced getting up
                        volunteer companies to proceed to Washington for the protection of our
                        National Capitol, or to march to any point for the defence of the border. A
                        most commandable [sic] spirit was evinced by our young men generally to
                        enroll themselves in these companies. We saw several lists with quite a
                        respectable array of names attached.</p>
                    <p>During the afternoon a fine body of men arrived here from St. Thomas under
                        command of Capt. Elder. This company already numbers over sixty and will be
                        joined by many others. They are as hearty and able-bodied set of men as we
                        ever saw, and will make a most excellent and serviceable company. The
                        Government should secure their services by all means. They will remain at
                        this point waiting orders and transportation, and are ready and anxious to
                        march to any point where there is a chance for active service. We must say
                            "<emph rend="italic">bully for Campbellstown!</emph>."</p>

                        claimed to belong to the First Maryland Regiment, and said they were going
                        to Baltimore. Later in the day several passed through on horseback having

                    <p>Report of Col. Stumbaugh, commanding 77th Regiment, P.V., at the battle of
                        Shiloh, on the 7th ult., made to the Acting Assistant Adjutant General of
                        the 5th Brigade:</p>
                    <p>H.Q. 77th Reg't P.V., Field of Shiloh. <lb/>April 9, 1862.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Capt. S.T. Davis, A Ass't Adj't General, 5th
                        Brigade</emph>--</p>
                    <p>Sir: I have the honor to submit the following Report of the part taken by the
                        77th Reg't P.V. in the action of the 7th inst.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to Col. Kirk's order, the Regiment moved from Pittsburg Landing to
                        the scene of action, about half-past 7 o'clock, a.m. and took position in
                        reserve for the 34th Ill., moving only as the first line moved, until about
                        11 o'clock, when I received Col. Kirk's order to go to the support of the
                        4th Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Roussean, which we did under a severe
                        fire of musketry from the enemy, until about fifteen minutes before 12
                        o'clock.</p>
                    <p>Gen. McCook then ordered me to take up a position on the extreme left of his
                        Division and repel the assaults there being made to turn his left flank. We
                        immediately engaged the enemy, and after some ten minut[e]s severe fighting
                        the enemy concentrated their forces to the right of us. We discovered a
                        battery of six guns of the enemy on our left, throwing shot and shell in the
                        direction of the 5th Brigade, (77th excepted,) which were slowly advancing
                        under a most terrific fire of the enemy. Immediately changing front forward
                        on the 8th company, we poured a deadly fire into the battery, killing 6 or 8
                        men and all their horses, except 6, harnessed in one of the caissons, which
                        made their escape unharmed. At this time we were in quite an isolated
                        position, separated from our Brigade and Division, and the enemy's cavalry
                        supported by infantry, steadily advancing upon us, and the infantry pouring
                        a galling fire at us. We continued to move forward through an open field,
                        under their fire, when their cavalry came down upon us twice, and twice were
                        they repulsed with heavy loss. Following them up closely, they retreated
                        rapidly through the lines of their infantry, who joined them in their
                        flight.</p>
                    <p>Col. Battles, of the 20th Tennessee (rebel) regiment, was here taken
                        prisoner. His horse being shot from under him, he was not able to keep out
                        of the hot pursuit of our skirmishers.</p>
                    <p>After receiving his sword I returned to him again. At this point, whilst we
                        were still advancing in pursuit of the enemy, Gen. Buell came up and ordered
                        me to halt.</p>
                    <p>I restrain from giving special instances of daring, coolness and courage,
                        which came under my observation during the day, on the part of both officers
                        and privates, as, all behaved gallantly: and yet, without wishing to detract
                        from the soldierly conduct of any of the other officers of the Regiment, I
                        mention Captains McKesson and Rose, who were most of the day with their
                        commands deployed in front as skirmishers.</p>
                    <p>I take pleasure in bringing to the notice of my superiors, Lieut. Col. P.B.
                        Housum and Maj. Stephen N. Bradford, whose services, during the whole day,
                        were invaluable to myself and command. Also Dr. Franklin Irish, Regimental
                        Surgeon, though not with the Regiment the day of battle, performed very
                        efficient services in the hospital at Pittsburg Landing, that day and night
                        and next day after the battle, being ordered to do so by his superior
                        officers.</p>
                    <p>The meagre loss in the regiment is, in my opinion, owing to the manner in
                        which they performed the duty assigned them respectively.</p>
                    <p>The casualties of the regiment are as follows: None killed; 1 mortally
                        wounded; 8 severely wounded.</p>
                    <p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>
                    <p>Very Respectfully Yours, &amp;c., <lb/>F.S. Stumbaugh. <lb/>Col. 77th
                        Regiment P.V.</p>

                <summary>Reports a rumor from Washington that some senators and representatives of
                    the border slave states intend to resign their seats. The conduct of the
                    abolitionists in Congress and the violation by President Lincoln of pledges not
                    to disturb slavery have driven them to consider this option.</summary>
