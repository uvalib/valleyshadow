                <transcript>
                    <p>The united effort of the loyal men of the nation is needed to meet and
                        suppress this Rebellion. What tends to preserve the Union is salvation to
                        the country, but what tends to break in upon it, is fraught with danger! The
                        sole common bond of the Union is the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>If we look at the border line of this terrible struggle--to Maryland,
                        Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, there is really but one opinion among the
                        Union men. They ask nothing of the General Government but fidelity to the
                        national compact; absolutely nothing but what every United States officer is
                        sworn to observe. Eighty thousand men in the field; the Home Guard larger
                        still, to keep at bay the secession tiger that prowls about their homes; the
                        language of their Representatives and Senators in Congress--all attest the
                        sincerity of their unionism. All speak of a patriotism worthy of the olden
                        time; and implore an infatuated radical majority, in the name of all that is
                        dear to country, to desist from the atrocious and bloody revolutionary
                        programme of emancipating the four millions of slaves at the point of the
                        bayonet; but, in good faith, to stand solidly by the Constitution, and thus
                        restore the Union as it was: that is, revive the social, commercial,
                        religious, political intercourse that endeared our several political
                        communities in the sacred relations of one nation.</p>
                    <p>But the radicals start up and insult common sense by representing a return to
                        this Union as it was, as a restoration of Jeff. Davis and his compeers to
                        power; and, in promoting their one scheme of emancipation, make nothing of
                        overriding Constitutional barriers. If there be one principle settled
                        distinctly by the Constitution, it is that to the States exclusively belong
                        the determination of their local institutions. All this, however, goes for
                        nothing with the radicals. They seem to care nothing for fundamentals. Now,
                        of themselves, they are of little account. But the Secessionists at the
                        South, at this hour get hold of this Abolition stuff, and reproduce it in
                        their newspapers and speeches, falsely magnify it, charge it on the whole
                        north, and thus succeed in arraying the Southern people in solid phalanx
                        against what they term the "Abolition Lincolns." This is the constant
                        testimony from the South. The last evidence is from a relative of a loyal
                        Union man who has been in South Carolina all through the Rebellion, a son of
                        Alderman Wilson, of Brooklyn, New York. His words are: "the Abolition policy
                        of Congress does more to embitter the feelings of the Southerners towards
                        the North than all the military expeditions that could be fitted out," and
                        he relates how <emph rend="italic">now</emph> the proclamations of Fremont,
                        Hunter and Phelps, and the articles in the New York <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune</emph>, are used to inflame the public mind. The people have
                        become desperate. With them it is a matter of life and death. Other
                        witnesses say the same thing. It is the constant object of the rebel leaders
                        to hold up the idea that this is an Abolition war, and it seems to be the
                        constant object of the radicals to keep them well supplied with detestable
                        material to use as proof. If it was their object to create two
                        confederacies, they could not work more effectually to do it than they are
                        now doing.</p>
                    <p>Now, the remedy for all this is only in the people and through the
                        ballot-box. It is no time for any other party than the party of the country,
                        of the Union and the Constitution; and at this time all who override it, are
                        unworthy of confidence. The good and true men of the country must unite
                        against the reckless demagogues who seek to destroy confidence in all but
                        Abolition Generals, like Fremont, and the abolition plan of emancipation;
                        and must insist that their public servants, sinking the negro question,
                        shall address themselves to the sole work of meeting and suppressing this
                        rebellion. Before this gigantic work, how pitiful appear the questions of a
                        race of mere shallow demagogues! Look at Sumner, blating out about Military
                        Governors before he ever knew the facts; look at Lovejoy, with the negro
                        eternally on his lips; look at the set about the army, who start such
                        pitiful issues as that about the White House which Gen. McClellan has so
                        scorchingly rebuked. What can be worse than the partizan caucus and the
                        partizan schemes of the radical members of Congress? What can be worse than
                        the partizan appeals of such portions of the Republican press as represented
                        by the New York <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> and the Chicago <emph
                            rend="italic">Tribune</emph>? It is enough to say that such schemes as
                        Sumner doggedly presents in the Senate, and the presses that go with him
                        continue to urge, tend directly to divide the loyal men, paralyze
                        recruiting, and thus do detriment to the sacred cause of the country.</p>
                    <p>Let all true Patriots pledge themselves anew to stand by the Constitution and
                        the Union, and to direct their utmost efforts to the preservation of the
                        one, inviolate, and to the restoration of the other just as the statesmen
                        and heroes of the Revolution transmitted it to us. This is a noble work, and
                        appeals to the most exalted feelings that can move man to effort. To strive
                        for this result by all the means in the power of the Government--by the war
                        power as well as that of the Legislature--is one thing; to inaugurate
                        revolutionary measures for which there is no warrant in the Constitution, is
                        quite another matter. The one object is to restore, and bring back peace,
                        fraternity and prosperity; the other is to destroy, and inaugurate
                        interminable civil war.</p>

                    new regiments that Franklin County is called on to supply. The editors argue
                    that it is much more patriotic and noble to volunteer than to be drafted, and
                    that the large number of young men who have not yet volunteered should put aside
                    their excuses and do so.</summary>

                    <p>We visited, on Friday last, the Associate Reformed Church, which is occupied
                        during the week by the Ladies Aid Society. We found the room pretty well
                        filled with ladies, engaged in the noble, patriotic and christian duty of
                        providing clothing, and other comforts, for our sick and wounded soldiers.
                        We might say much in praise of our ladies, but this is an age in which noble
                        deeds bring their own reward. We will say this much, however, the ladies of
                        Chambersburg will compare with any in existence, in their efforts to provide
                        for the wants, and relieve the suffering of our sick and wounded in the
                        army. They have enlisted in the good cause their nimble fingers and their
                        noble, warm and patriotic hearts with a will. All honor then to our ladies
                        who have thus nobly evinced their patriotism and vindicated that judgment
                        which the poet has pronounced upon their sex, and which the world has
                        applauded.</p>

                <summary>The Ladies Aid Society, working out of the Associate Reformed Church, has
                    been occupied with the "noble, patriotic and christian" task of providing
                    clothing and other goods for sick soldiers. The editors praise them highly, and
                    argue that the ladies of Chambersburg will compare favorably to those of any

                    <p>The call for nine-months volunteers is being responded to in this county with
                        patriotic alacrity. The people of the towns throughout the county are
                        holding War Meetings and using every means to encourage enlistments. The
                        necessity for reinforcing our army is felt, and appreciated, by every man in
                        the county, for should this rebellion be allowed to go on much longer our
                        neighborhood cannot escape the horrors of war if the threats of the rebels
                        mean anything. There are scores of men ready and willing, in every section
                        of the county, to serve their country but they are waiting to be asked. That
                        is not the way to show their patriotism--they must come forward voluntarily
                        at the tap of the drum.</p>
