<b>The Late Elections</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors claim that the results of the recent election prove that voters
                    have finally woken up and repudiated the Republican party, which has helped
                    drive the country apart. Both abolitionist and secessionist leaders are to
                    blame, the editors claim, for creating the crisis of disunion, with the
                    abolitionists riding a "storm of fanaticism" in the North that resulted in
                    Lincoln's election. Southern secessionists then manipulated public opinion and
                    abused the doctrine of state's rights to secede from the Union, while
                    conservatives in both sections were brushed aside. But conservatives in the
                    North supported the prosecution of the war to put down the rebellion, even as
                    Lincoln has gone further and further toward abolitionism. Now, the editors
                    claim, the South must repudiate its fanatical leaders in the same way that the
                    North has.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>"Stand by Burnside as you have stood by me"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors praise the nobility of General McClellan's parting speech to
                    his troops, in which he advised them to "Stand by Burnside as you have stood by
                    me, and all will be well." Despite all the persecution he has suffered, they
                    note, McClellan left his command with grace and without a word of
                    dissatisfaction. His reputation, the editors conclude, will be treated far
                    better by history than those of his enemies.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Return Judges and the Army Vote</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors attempt to summarize the events surrounding the refusal by the
                    election returns judges not to count the votes of the 126th Regiment for the
                    Franklin County elections. As the judges were counting ballots after the
                    election, the prothonotary arrived with ballots from the 126th. The judges
                    decided not to count these returns for county offices, though they reconvened in
                    early November to reconsider that decision. At that meeting, claim the editors,
                    the majority of judges decided that the returns were illegal, since the Supreme
                    Court had ruled against soldiers' right to vote and since Governor Curtain had
                    not called for a military vote. However, after the majority adjourned, a
                    minority of Republicans reconvened and counted the votes. The Spirit attacks the
                    editor of the Transcript for claiming that the judges were attempting to
                    disfranchise the soldier, particularly in relation to the contested election of
                    Mr. Downey as Commissioner.<br>(Names in announcement:   Downey)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is not our purpose to go into an argument as to the legality or illegality
                        of the Army Vote. That question has been decided by the highest legal
                        tribunal of the Commonwealth, in the case of Chase vs. Miller, which
                        decision was followed by Judge Allison, in the case of Thompson vs. Ewing,
                        in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia. Both these cases were decided adversely
                        to the Democratic candidates. Our intention is simply to give a statement of
                        the facts, in relation to the refusal of the Return Judges to count the vote
                        cast by the 126th Regiment.</p>
                    <p>The Return Judges met at the Court House, in this place, on the Friday
                        succeeding the October election, according to the law and proceeded to
                        perform the duty incumbent on them, when the Prothonotary appeared before
                        them and presented a number of papers purporting to be the returns of an
                        election, held in the camp of the 126th Regiment, then located near
                        Sharpsburg, in the State of Maryland. The Judges decided not to count the
                        returns thus made for any county office, and proceeded to sum up the legal
                        votes, cast within the county, and issued their certificates of election to
                        the candidates entitled to them.</p>
                    <p>After performing this duty, some of them being undecided as to the course to
                        be pursued in relation to the military vote, they adjourned until the 2d
                        Tuesday of November, the day fixed by law for counting the military vote. In
                        the interim many of them became fully satisfied of the illegality of this
                        vote and determined not to engage in counting votes, clearly illegal when
                        they again met.--When they reassembled, on Tuesday last, the majority of
                        them knowing that the Supreme Court had decided the law, under which it was
                        cast, unconstitutional and void--that the returns had not been legally
                        certified to them by the Prothonotary; that the Governor had issued no
                        proclamation for an election in the military camps, and that the election
                        was a rascally attempt at fraud, gotten up in a sneaking, clandestine manner, decided to adjourn without
                        counting the vote, and did so adjourn. The majority did not "secede," but adjourned, when the minority composed of five or six dyed-in-the-wool
                        Republicans, reorganized and counted the returns.</p>
                    <p>The "legal advice" that was "most positive and emphatic" as to the duty of
                        the Judges to count the vote, did not seem to strike them with greater force
                        than the legal advice they had received from as sound lawyers, as the
                        gentleman whose advice was so kindly tendered. The Judges acted properly in
                        this matter and deserve the thanks of every man who desires to preserve the
                        purity of our elections.</p>
                    <p>In a labored article in the last issue of the Repository
                            and Transcript, the editor of that paper in alluding to the
                        contested election of Mr. Downey, as Commissioner, characterizes it as an
                        attempt to disfranchise the soldier. We cannot imagine on what grounds the
                        gentleman comes to that conclusion. A number of sick and wounded soldiers
                        are brought here to the Hospitals, some of them reside and have domicils
                        [sic] in other counties of this State, and in the States of New York and
                        Massachusetts, and although we may regret that under existing laws, our
                        soldiers cannot exercise the right of suffrage, yet we are unwilling that
                        citizens of the States of New York and Massachusetts, and the counties of
                        Adams, Lancaster and others in this State, shall elect a Commissioner for
                        Franklin county, in direct violation of all law.</p>
                    <p>We have no doubt whatever, that when the case of
                        Fickes vs. Downey, comes before the learned Court, "whose duty it will be
                        first to construe the law," it will be decided according to the laws of the
                        Commonwealth, and without regard to the opinions expressed by partisan
                        newspapers.</p>

<b>General McClellan Again Removed from the Command of the Army</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writers decry the removal of General McClellan from his command. The
                    people will punish this vacillation by the political leaders of the country,
                    argue the writers, and this particular change is no doubt a sign of "radical
                    influences" being brought to bear at the highest levels of government.<br>

                    they were under the impression that they would be forced into the old regiments

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has made the following decisions: When

                    is assessed. Marriage certificates must have a ten-cent stamp. Each carriage of
                    a livery stable is subject to separate tax. The general principle of the Excise
                    Law is that manufactured items are taxed at their value, even if the materials
                    from which they have been made have already been taxed (for instance, shoes and
                    leather). Merchant tailors are required to take out manufacturers licenses, but
                    do not need a license as dealers if they sell from their establishments, unless

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In Camp Near Warrenton, Va. <br>November 11th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>With three days provisions in our haversacks we left Snicker's Gap, on
                        Wednesday morning, and proceeded on our march as "the advance" of Porter's
                        corps, and after journeying about sixteen miles, bivouacked for the night.
                        Early next morning we were a [sic] again in line, and at 3 P.M. arrived at
                        White Plains, a distance of twelve miles more. Here we pitched our shelters
                        and lessened considerably the proportions of some large bay stacks to supply
                        us with bedding. The night was exceedingly cold, forming the first ice of
                        the season in this region. Awaking in the morning we found the earth covered
                        with snow and a fierce, searching wind prevailing. The entire day was one of
                        the most disagreeable we had yet experienced. White Plains is a village on
                        the Manassas Gap Railroad, some fifty odd miles from Washington. At this
                        time it derives importance from being a point of supplies for the army.
                        Saturday morning, at 10 o'clock, we continued our march to New Baltimore,
                        twelve miles distant, and went into camp. At half past eight next morning
                        (Sunday) we moved three miles further, and encamped at this point. The
                        aggregate distance we have traveled thus far from our old camp at
                        Sharpsburg, is about ninety miles and through four counties in this State,
                        namely, Jefferson, Loudon, Clark and Fauquier. The portion of country we
                        have passed over is mostly of a mountainous character, difficult to travel,
                        but exceedingly attractive in scenery. The land is evidently fertile but
                        could be made much more valuable and productive. Well built stone fences are
                        most invariable the enclosures of the fields. From Harper's Ferry to this
                        place we saw but very little grain. Agricultural interests seem wholly
                        crushed by the terrible ravages of war. If this section is a fair sample of
                        Virginia tilled land, next year's crop will not afford subsistence
                        sufficient for half the population. The war seems to have absorbed nearly
                        every pursuit of life. Desolation and distress are visible on every hand.
                        The grown male inmates of nearly every home seem to have lain down the
                        implements of industrial life, and leaving the endearments of the family,
                        the interests of business and the comforts of the domestic fire side, have
                        entered the Southern Army. In lazy attitudes, about each homestead, you see
                        the unemployed and wretchedly clad negro.--Little children seem to be
                        indifferent to the flaunting banners, gay uniforms and inspiring music of
                        our hosts; and the wives and daughters flee at our coming and hide
                        themselves from our gaze. The great number of buildings in ruins astonish
                        us, and residences once, perhaps, the abiding places of happy hearts and
                        scenes of festive joy, are deserted, and sealed to friend and foe. And thus,
                        briefly, do we see some of the calamitous effects of war. Thus does
                        Virginia, after sowing to the wind, reap the whirlwind. Thus does the
                        hallowed soil of patriots and statesmen become a land of sorrow and
                        desolation, the just fruits of her perfidy and treason.</p>
                    <p>For the last three days the great Army of the Potomac has been massing at
                        this point. It might seem a piece of arrogance and absurdity for me to name
                        its numerical force. Two hundred thousand men is vast number, but I believe
                        they are here to that extent. For miles around one sees hill and valley
                        covered with tents. Drums are beating in a general mix, "the Girl I left
                        behind me," "the Bold Soldier Boy," "Yankee Doodle," and other popular airs,
                        while the trumpet's blasts are a conglomeration of "calls," "rests" and
                        "signals." Flags, national and State, float proudly to the breeze from the
                        headquarters of every regiment. Richly atired [sic] officers and plainly
                        uniformed privates, on and off duty, are seen in every direction. Orderlies
                        with big envelopes, sealed orders perhaps of grave import, speed over the
                        road and through the camps with telegraphic rapidity. Wagoners are cursing,
                        mules kicking, whips cracking, trains creaking and a grand confusion of
                        anything and everything, which goes to make up the pride, pomp and
                        circumstance of glorious warfare, is visible on every hand. Such an army in
                        discipline, numbers and appointment, this world has seldom seen. Marvellous
                        [sic] in the rapidity of its creation and strength it may seem, but it is
                        the gift a people strong in the faith of liberty; pure unselfish in their
                        devotion to the law; and true to the sacredness of perpetual union. It is
                        upon the fidelity and patriotism, the bravery and activity of the army, that
                        the people hang their hopes of success in a righteous cause, and human
                        freedom looks for the preservation of its great exemplar. Let us fondly
                        trust that it may accomplish its great work and then that the Government is
                        safe from rebellion and treason for all time.</p>
                    <p>But as I write these lines, a solemn and profound sadness pervaded this army.
                        There are many, very many hearts of sorrow among us, almost inconsolable,
                        and which time can scarcely heal. The announcement that Gen. McClellan's
                        command of this army had ceased fell like a dark pall on the cherished hopes
                        and bright anticipation of his devoted followers. His brief but impressive
                        and affectionate farewell, was read at the head of each Regiment yesterday
                        morning. It was an event wholly unexpected, and could scarcely be realized.
                        The affection of the men for their Commander is well known, was unbounded.
                        Amid all the asperity and calumny which was heaped on his devoted head, and
                        notwithstanding the bitter animosity of which he was the victim, his army
                        stood around him as one united mass, the defenders of his fame, the
                        pre-eminent object of their love. Political brawlers and scoundrely
                        speculators, whose patriotism is synanamous [sic] with money, the
                        prolongation of the war, and the destruction of the Union, were the style of
                        men who worked unceasingly and devotedly to ruin McClellan in the eyes of
                        the army and the country. Him they regarded as the chief obstacle in the
                        pathway of their schemes. They could not endure the brilliancy of his rising
                        star, and to tear it from its place, and to crush it beneath their feet was
                        the grand object they desired to obtain.--No doubt they are now gloating
                        with joy and satisfaction at their success. At this stand point, and at this
                        moment, I am unable to say whether the President yielded to the
                        importunities of McClellan's enemies, or was actuated by motives of public
                        interest to make the change. I have had an abiding confidence in the
                        patriotism of Mr. Lincoln, and I believe most of the embarrassments he has
                        had to encounter, have been caused by a class of men whose love of country
                        is of a very dubious character. Although these parties may now be satisfied,
                        I trust that at this juncture in our affairs, it may not be charged upon him
                        that it was to appease their clamors he sacrificed McClellan. The cause of
                        it thus far seems studiously concealed; but be that cause what it may the
                        loss of General McClellan is working most serious consequences. I have no
                        admiration for the man who says he loves McClellan first, and next the cause
                        of his country. Such a character is scarcely better than a traitor. But when
                        officers and men who have had ample opportunities to know their leader, his
                        skill as a tactician and commander, and whose personal conduct has impelled
                        them to love him, they recognize in his success the success of their cause,
                        and I do not wonder at their indignation when they are firm in the belief
                        that it was scheming politicians who accomplished his removal. A vast number
                        of Officers have sent in their resignations since yesterday morning. They
                        say if this war is to be carried on for the pecuniary and political
                        advancement of certain individuals, they have neither a heart to cheer, nor
                        a hand to raise for it. Privates too entertain and express these sentiments,
                        and it is due all concerned both for the welfare of the cause and the
                        reputation of McClellan as well as for the efficiency of the army, that the
                        reason for the Presidents apparently summary action be explained.</p>
                    <p>Instructions were given us Sunday evening to be prepared for a grand review
                        by General McClellan at an early hour next morning. The hour arriving, we
                        put on our best "bib and tucker" and were promptly assembled at the place
                        appointed near camp on the road leading to Warrenton. A more beautiful and
                        propitious morning for such an occasion could not have favored us. The sun
                        shone brightly and warm, the sky was clear, and the air balmy and
                        delightfully invigorating. The programme commenced by the reading of General
                        McClellan's Farewell Address, and the Introductory Address to his new
                        command of General Burnside. Soon after General McClellan, riding a
                        magnificent charger made his appearance. He was followed by Major Generals
                        Burnside, Porter and a host of other officers of every commissioned rank,
                        and a large portion of his favorite body guard. It was a brilliant yet
                        impressive scene. Delight mingled with sadness was upon every countenance.
                        The army hailed the presence of the chief they loved, but sorrowed at the
                        thought that he was with them for the last time. The grand salute to a Major
                        General Commanding were givan [sic], and the party proceeded to New
                        Baltimore to review General Sigel's Corps. It was 3 o'clock, P.M., before
                        the ceremonies of the day were concluded. Repairing to Headquarters at
                        Warrenton. General McClellan, his officers and a number of invited friends
                        sat down to an elegant dinner. Then came the parting scene. The young
                        chieftain with tears coursing down his cheeks affectionately embraced all
                        around him, and soon after the Grand Army of the Potomac faded from his view
                        as he proceed on his way to Trenton, where he was ordered to report.
                        McClellan still holds the high rank of Major General in the Regular Army and
                        he may be assigned to some important duty. However at present, everything
                        respecting his future movements is mere conjecture.</p>
                    <p>I to-day had the pleasure of meeting at their quarters five miles from our
                        camp, our friends Dr. Lane and Capt's Brand and Carman, Lieut. Col. McAllen,
                        Lieut.'s Cook and Rhodes and a number of other familiar faces. Time was
                        precious with us, and it would really have amused you to hear us talk, each
                        one endeavoring to convey a knowledge of a dozen different subjects in the
                        same breath. We all had something new to say each other, and each one seemed
                        anxious to make it known. These meetings are some of the sweet, pleasurable
                        incidents of soldiering. They don't come often, but when they do come you
                        see the warm heartfelt, earnest greeting, somehow, very different from what
                        we witness under other circumstances as we move along the pathway of
                        peaceful life. The Reserves and the 107th had marching orders when I arrived
                        and broke camp before my departure. All the troops South of Warrenton are on
                        the move to-day, destination Richmond. As yet no
                        marching orders have reached us but we are momentarily expecting them.</p>
                    <p>And now mid-way between the historic "Antietam" and the evil heart of the
                        Rebellion, whose name will soon be added to our victorious banners,
                        "Richmond," I close this lengthy and hastily written letter. SHENANDOAH.</p>
