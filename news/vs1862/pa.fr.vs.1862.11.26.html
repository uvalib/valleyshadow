<b>The "Transcript" on the Removal of McClellan</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors attempt to refute, point by point, an editorial in the
                    Repository and Transcript that justifies the removal of McClellan. To the
                    Transcript's accusations that McClellan would not move on the rebels when at
                    Washington, the editors argue that his plans had been revealed to the
                    Confederates; when the Transcript compares McClellan's inaction to Union
                    victories in the west, the editors claim that McClellan, as General-in-Chief,
                    deserves credit for those victories; when the Transcript accuses McClellan of
                    stopping short of Richmond, the editors blame the "treachery and deception" of
                    political leaders in Washington for undercutting McClellan; when the Transcript
                    appears to be both praising and criticizing McClellan's organizational
                    abilities, the editors point out this inconsistency; and when the Transcript
                    interprets the President's move as a response to the elections, which indicated
                    a desire for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, the editors point out that
                    before the election the Transcript had said that a Democratic victory would mean
                    a repudiation of the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"In the last issue of the Repository and Transcript appears a lengthy
                    and labored editorial on the removal of Gen. McClellan from the Army of the
                    Potomac. It abounds in inconsistencies and absurdities that are really amusing."<br>

<b>A Suggestion</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A sarcastic editorial that asks where the 900,000 soldiers that Horace
                    Greely promised the President, if he signed the emancipation proclamation, would
                    be. The editors also suggest that McClellan's local critics should take command
                    of troops since they seem to know military tactics better than McClellan did.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Now since the radicals have forced the President to surrender the management
                        of the war into their own hands; and since they have determined that the war
                        shall be carried on for the abolition of slavery rather than for the
                        restoration of the Union, and have already commenced the work of dismissing
                        all conservative Generals from their commands in the army, so as to get the
                        army under abolition control, we suggest that they also dismiss the
                        conservative soldiers from the ranks and that Greeley's 900,000
                        abolitionists be called into the field at once.</p>
                    <p>Greeley promised the President 900,000 abolition soldiers if he would issue
                        an emancipation proclamation. "Old Abe" complied with Greeley's request and
                        now we want Greeley to fulfil [sic] his part of the contract. We want him to
                        trot out his 900,000 abolitionists minus the man
                        that enlisted from Boston some time ago, leaving a balance of 899,999 for
                        Greeley to furnish yet.</p>
                    <p>The men being furnished, we suggest to the President to appoint Greeley
                        Commander-in-Chief with the rank of Lieutenant General. The different corps
                        and division commanders to consist of such military geniuses as Wilson,
                        Wade, Stevens, Lovejoy and "blood-letting" Chandler.</p>
                    <p>The reserve corps of this grand army we want placed under the command of the
                        citizen of this place, who was at the battle of Antietam and saw just where Gen. McClellan made the mistake which
                        enabled the rebel army to escape being "bagged." His extensive knowledge of
                        military tactics would enable him to detect any blunder which
                        Lieutenant-General Greeley might make in any future engagement and retrieve
                        the fortunes of the day by leading his corps into the breach.</p>
                    <p>Sumner we would assign to the command of a negro corps, division or brigade
                        as the case may be. The size of his command will depend upon the number of
                        "darkies" he can get to enlist. In this department of the service we would
                        earnestly demand a place for our neighbor of the Dispatch. He might be authorized to recruit a company of the
                        "sable sons of Africa" from among the "denizens of Wolffstown." This would
                        no doubt diminish "Um's rent" somewhat, but being a patriotic man, the old
                        gentleman would willingly sacrifice something for the good of the country.
                        His company being mustered into Sumner's command, our neighbor would stand
                        an excellent chance for promotion among his "colored brederen" whose cause
                        he has served so long and faithfully.</p>
                    <p>With this magnificent army in the field, backed up by "Old Abe's"
                        proclamation, "secesh" would certainly have to "go under." We hope father
                        Abraham will see to it that Greeley don't back out of his part of the
                        contract.</p>

                    criticize McClellan's slowness to move, as it took Halleck two months to move
                    the 12 miles from Shiloh to Corinth.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer reports rumors in Washington that General Lee has written to
                    General Halleck regarding the emancipation proclamation, which is due to take

                    of a servile war" is not discussed in any book on military tactics, and must be
                    regarded in the same light as poisoning wells, abusing prisoners or women and
                    children; and second, that if the proclamation is not withdrawn, any women or
                    children murdered by "infuriated negroes" will be avenged by the execution of an

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Washington, Nov. 21.</p>
                    <p>A report is current here, and very generally believed, that Gen. Lee, of the
                        rebel army, has recently addressed a formal communication to Gen. Hallock
                        touching the proposed issue of an emancipation proclamation on the first of
                        January next. It will be remembered that after the exciting debates in the
                        rebel Congress as to the propriety of retaliation, the whole matter was left
                        to the discretion of the President of the Confederate States, with
                        instructions to take such measures as would compel the withdrawal of the
                        proclamation, or bring home to the northern troops some of the evil it
                        threatens against the southern people. It is stated that Gen. Lee's letter
                        is exceedingly elaborate, and discusses the question from every point of
                        view. The points it is said to contain are as follows:</p>
                    <p>First, The unwarrantable nature of the proclamation, so far as the recognized
                        measures of military warfare are concerned. The fact is pointed out that in
                        no work on military law is the instigation of a servile war recommended,
                        indorsed [sic] or even mentioned; that, as General Hallock himself never
                        thought of it in discussing the various means that might be used by
                        belligerent enemies, the threat of servile war and insurrection is clearly
                        not a proper military procedure; that, being outside of military law, the
                        southern people are justified in regarding it as coming under the brutal and
                        savage expedients of a barbarous people, and resenting it as such; that the
                        enemy that will use it does an act as unjustifiable as the poisoning of
                        wells or of food, the maiming and murdering of prisoners, and the outrage of
                        women. On this ground it is demanded that the proclamation be withdrawh
                        [sic].</p>
                    <p>Second, it is further urged by Gen. Lee that in case the proclamation is not
                        withdrawn the Confederate military authorities, sorely against their will,
                        but strong in the justice of their position, will be compelled to retaliate
                        in the sternest manner upon all the Union prisoners that fall into their
                        hands. It is not specified what punishment will be inflicted, but it is
                        distinctly intimated that if, through the instigation of the Federal troops,
                        any women or children are murdered by infuriated negroes, an equal number of
                        Union troops will be promptly put to death. On this matter the Confederate
                        government wishes the Federal government to understand that it is very much
                        in earnest, and will do even more than it threatens.</p>
                    <p>Accompanying this document, and adressed [sic] to other members of the
                        government, it is stated that a letter from a high member of the Confederate
                        government is now in Washington for members of the cabinet, arguing the
                        question as to the property of rescinding the objectionable proclamation.
                        Its addition to the military arguments urged by Gen. Lee, an argument drawn
                        from the recent elections in the North is made use of by the Confederate
                        statesmen. If the Union shall be restored, this document urges, it will be
                        better not to have this gulf of blood between the North and South, and even
                        should the South succeed in their efforts there would be fewer unpleasant
                        memories to rankle.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these communications, it is still asserted here to the
                        proclamation, and to carry out the radical programme to the bitter end.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these communications, it is still asserted here that Mr.
                        Lincoln is determined to adhere to the proclamation, and to carry out the
                        radical programme to the bitter end.</p>

<b>The Borough Treasury</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors agree with the Transcript's criticism of the borough
                    authorities for not repairing the bridge over the spring by Washabaugh's. "The

                    argue that if an accident were to occur the borough authorities should be held

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday morning last, a somewhat singular looking specimen of the feminine
                        gender made her appearance in town, by way of the Western turnpike, mounted
                        on a grey steed of venerable appearance, bearing evidence of hard service
                        and a short allowance of provender. The lady, from her dress, general
                        appearance and "getting up" was evidently a stranger in this section of the
                        country. On alighting and securing her gallant grey to an awning post on
                        Main Street, she proceeded to several of our Drug Stores and engaged
                        extensively in the purchase of Quinine, Morphine, Opium, &amp;c.
                        Suspicion being excited that she was purchasing these articles for the use
                        of Uncle Sam's enemies in the land of Dixie, she was arrested by order of
                        Capt. Ashmead, A. Q. M., and on being searched, several hundred dollars
                        worth of these Drugs were found concealed in secret recesses of her dress.
                        The previous night she passed at the Tavern of Mr. Josiah Allen, three miles
                        west of this place, where she stated that she was in search of several
                        Horses, taken by the Rebels from her father in Virginia, and having heard
                        that a number had been turned loose by Stuart's Cavalry, in this section she
                        thought that she might possibly find her fathers among them. She had in her
                        possession a Pass from General Banks dated about a year ago. We are informed
                        by a citizen, who recognized her, that her name is Sloan, and that she
                        resides near Winchester, Virginia. For the present, she occupies apartments
                        in "Fort Brandt" and the Philistines across the border will shake considerable before they get that quinine.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors praise the recent improvement done to the newly renamed "Union

                    and with the increasing number of patrons, added on a story to the front
                    building and erected a large three-story building in the rear. The story in the
                    front adds eight "spacious and well-furnished chambers." The improvements make
                    it one of the largest Public Houses in the borough.<br>(Names in announcement: Mrs. Rebecca Fisher,  John Fisher)</blockquote>
