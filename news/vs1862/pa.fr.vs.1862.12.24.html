<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The ill-advised precipitation of our troops upon the almost impregnable
                        position of the rebels having resulted in a bloody repulse, and being now
                        acknowledged as such, the Army of the Potomac has marched back over the
                        Rappahannock, and taken up its old quarters at Falmouth. The number of our
                        soldiers sacrificed by this movement is very large, but accurate details
                        cannot, of course, be ascertained for several days yet, and the public will
                        do well meantime to give no heed to the exaggerated rumors which have been
                        so freely put in circulation.</p>
                    <p>As we suspected yesterday, the report that Gen. Banks has landed at Winton
                        [sic] N.C., is the purest fiction. Intelligence received from Port Royal,
                        S.C., fixes beyond a doubt the fact that he is now in the Gulf, making for
                        some point as yet unknown.</p>
                    <p>The army of the Southwest seems to have come to a stand-still. Gen. Hovey's
                        expedition has returned to Helena; the army of Gen. Sherman has gone back to
                        Memphis, and Gen. Grant still rests at Oxford, Miss.</p>
                    <p>:From Fortress Monroe we have a report that a large fleet was recently seen
                        entering the Cape Fear river, North Carolina.</p>
                    <p>One of our river steamers having been burned by a band of guerrillas at
                        Concordia, Ark., on Monday, a week ago, a U. S. Naval despatch boat went to
                        that town the next day and set fire to forty-two houses. The citizens of
                        Concordia claim that they did every thing they could to prevent the
                        destruction of the steamer. They had sent to Helena for protection, but
                        before the return of the courier their town was laid in ashes.</p>
                    <p>The ubiquitious [sic] Alabama returned to Martinique on the 26th ult. and
                        took in coal from a British brig lying off the harbor.</p>
                    <p>A letter from Suffolk, Va., written Sunday says that several days since Gen.
                        Wessel left that place with his brigade for a point on the Chowan river.
                        North Carolina, whence he effected a junction with Gen. Foster, with whom he
                        is now concerned in an important movement against the enemy. The same letter
                        gives an account of a heavy skirmish on the Blackwater river, at a point a
                        mile below Zuni. The reconnoissance, for such it properly was, revealed the
                        enemy in large force, and our men after some very plucky fighting, were
                        compelled to fall back to Suffolk.</p>
                    <p>Intelligence received at St. Paul, Minn., on Thursday last, from Fort
                        Randall, Dakota Territory, is to the gratifying effect that the prisoners
                        carried of by Little Crow, have been rescued from captivity, and are now at
                        Fort Pierre, where they will be well cared for until an opportunity is
                        afforded of sending them home. A party of friendly Indians went to the
                        Sauntee Camp, on Beaver Creek, where they found the White Lodge and Sleepy
                        Eyes, with seven white prisoners, five girls and two men, one a daughter of
                        Jacob Price, of Illinois. They offered seven horses for them. The Sauntees
                        refused to sell thinking they had been sent by the whites. The friendly
                        Indians told them it was either a fight or a trade--if they were not
                        delivered up they would fight and take them and their horses. This is the
                        story of the Indians, but it is most likely they got the prisoners without
                        much difficulty and conducted them to Fort Pierre.</p>
                    <p>The guerilla Morgan, is again taking his walks abroad, is now reported near
                        Jackson, Tenn., at the head of a considerable force.--Our men are said to be
                        ready for him.</p>
                    <p>The latest reports of the battle of Prairie Grove, Ark., place the rebels
                        loss at 2 700, to which are to be added 600 deserters. An important campaign
                        is reported to be on the tapis in this region.</p>
                    <p>The Alabama was last seen at Dominics, whither she had chased a poor little
                        schooner, which slipped into that harbor for protection.</p>
                    <p>The rebels have appeared in Loudon Co., Va., making it extremely unsafe for
                        Union refugees to return to their homes there.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Burnside has succeeded in withdrawing his men from their false and
                        perilous position in a masterly manner. The pickets of the enemy were kept
                        in ignorance of our departure until the very last moment of our
                        trans-Rappahannock stay. Gen. Burnside in his despatch to General Halleck,
                        states that the movement was executed without loss of life or property.
                        Tuesday was spent in the grievous task of burying the dead. Accurate lists
                        of our losses have not yet been forwarded. The rebels yesterday moved down
                        into the city and extended their pickets to the river bank. The day was
                        passed in comparative quiet.</p>
                    <p>December 19. <br>Yesterday the rebels sent General Burnside a flag of truce
                        with a request that he would send men over the river to bury our dead.--This
                        was of course done. During the truce the chief of Longstreet's artillery
                        told some of our officers that he considered the rebel position impregnable,
                        and that it could not be taken by half a million of men, when defended as at
                        present. The rebel loss on Saturday was small, they being under cover most
                        of the time. Our loss, too, is being reduced by the arrival of stragglers.
                        The enemy took 800 prisoners, who have been paroled.</p>
                    <p>From Cairo we learn that the gunboat Cairo was blown up by a topedo [sic], 21
                        miles below the mouth of the Yazoo river, on Friday last. The boat
                        irredeemably sunk, but no lives were lost.</p>
                    <p>By a private letter we learn of a repulse of our troops at Kingston, N.C., on
                        the 13th inst. Gen. Fyster attacked that place with 15,000 men, but is said
                        to have been driven back to his gunboats.</p>

<b>The Battle at Fredericksburg</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report the defeat of Union troops at Fredericksburg, arguing
                    that it is yet another sign of the mismanagement of the war by Stanton, Halleck
                    and Lincoln, in line with their removal of McClellan from his command.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It becomes our painful duty to-day to record another humiliating disaster to
                        our national arms, resulting through the intrigues and mismanagement of the
                        War Office, as Washington. In utter disregard of the opinions of the best
                        military minds of the country, Gen. Burnside was peremptorily ordered to
                        cross the Rappahannock and fight the enemy in his stronghold. The result was
                        a disastrous defeat and the slaughter of thousands of as brave troops as
                        ever fired a musket, who fell a sacrifice to the imbecility that reigns at
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>This seems to be the crowning set of folly committed by the incapables at
                        Washington since they have undertaken to control our military destinies.
                        Commencing with the division of the Army of the Potomac into corps d'armee, and the depriving of Gen. McClellan
                        of his position as Commander-in-Chief; the detention of McDowell's corps in
                        the neighborhood of Washington when it should have followed McClellan to the
                        Peninsula as had been agreed upon; the subsequent refusal to permit McDowell
                        to reinforce McClellan at Hanover Court House, when, as McClellan solemnly
                        swears, "Richmond could have been taken within a week;" the disasters of
                        Pope and his retreat to the fortifications at Washington and the removal of
                        McClellan from his command when in hot pursuit of the enemy and offering to
                        give him battle with every prospect of success, having previously defeated
                        him in two engagements and driven him out of Maryland, we have a series of
                        blunders and disasters which needed only this last reckless sacrifice of
                        human life at Fredericksburg, to stamp the military authorities at
                        Washington with everlasting infamy and disgrace.</p>
                    <p>No one blames Gen. Burnside, for all agree that he did all that mortal man
                        could do. He, therefore, is not responsible, his brave corps commanders are
                        not responsible, his noble army, almost an army of martyrs, is not
                        responsible for the awful disaster. Ordered peremptorily to cross the fatal
                        stream to the sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>The people of the country, with an ominous unanimity, have this time located
                        the responsibility in the right quarter and on the right parties. Two
                        California lawyers, Edwin M. Stanton and Henry W. Halleck are the prominent
                        actors in the bloody drama, and a weak and vacillating President, controlled
                        and influenced by a treasonable faction of radical Abolitionists is the
                        guilty party, who will be held responsible for the misdeeds of his
                        subordinates before God and the country.</p>
                    <p>The people have thus far borne patiently the burdens that have been imposed
                        upon them by the necessities of the times. They never murmured as long as
                        they saw any hope for the country, but when they see their treasure wasted
                        and the resources of the country exhausted in fruitless expeditions around
                        the outskirts of the rebellion, and their brothers and sons murdered in cold
                        blood through the incompetency of imbeciles at the head of the Government,
                        they begin to cry enough. They demand a radical change in the policy of the
                        Government. They call upon Mr. Lincoln to reorganize his administration on a
                        sound, national, Constitutional platform, around which the loyal people of
                        the whole country can rally. They demand of him to rid the departments, and
                        especially the war department of all dibblers and fanatics who are ruining
                        the country, and call to his aid men of sense and of patriotism--STATESMEN,
                        who will have wisdom to comprehend the exigencies of the nation and capacity
                        to devise means to overcome them.</p>
                    <p>Henceforth the administration will hear plain talk. The people will speak out
                        boldly, fearlessly and to the point. There is no time left to weigh words or
                        mince sentences. Let them cry aloud and spare not until the cry pierces the
                        ears of our rulers at Washington and compels them to stop in their career of
                        madness and folly which has already imperiled the nation almost beyond the
                        hope of recovery. Perhaps our beloved country may yet be rescued from the
                        brink of ruin to which it has been brought by political fanatics and
                        military charlatans. God save the Republic.</p>

<b>Prophesy of Gen. Jackson</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors quote a statement by Andrew Jackson shortly before his death
                    that the abolition party was disloyal and would bring civil war to the Union.
                    They then turn to statements by Thaddeus Stevens that he would never consent to
                    a restoration of the Union with slavery. All the more proof, the editors say,

                        4.</p>
                    <p>A blood-red moon, ominous to the old soldier of succeeding battle, and a gory
                        field illuminated the heavens on Wednesday night. During the day it became
                        well understood that on the following morning active [illegible] operations
                        would be commenced. No written orders were issued for the movement but the
                        word was quietly passed around verbally. By the time "the taps" beat we had
                        our rations prepared, knapsacks packed and every thing ready to march at
                        command. At 4 o'clock in the morning "the reveillie" summoned us to duty. At
                        5 o'clock the sounds of terrific cannonading reached our ears. It seemed one
                        incessant roar along the banks of the Rappahanock for miles and echoed from
                        the surrounding hills. At 7 o'clock we fell in line and moved off. General
                        Humphrey commanding Division, taking the head of the column. We were brought
                        to a halt about a mile and a half distant for further orders. At this point
                        we spent the night. The next morning (Friday) we were ordered to move
                        forward to within about a mile and immediately in front of the city. We
                        encamped in a woods and remained until Saturday morning. Your correspondent
                        being detached on special duty with Gen. Tyler, here left the column and
                        assumed his place with the Brigade Headquarters of the Army, formerly
                        occupied by Gen. Sumner as his special position, but to-day taken by
                        Generals Burnsides, Hooker and Sumner, as their main point of observation
                        and communication. The building they occupy is a very handsome and extensive
                        brick cottage and commands a view for many miles surrounding. Hundreds of
                        orderlies were moving about it, arriving and departing, and the plains
                        around, as far as the eye could reach, were covered with artillery, cavalry,
                        and infantry. At various localities convenient the supply and ambular trains
                        were parked. Prof. Steiner, with his balloon "Eagle," was near by making
                        frequent ascensions. The signal corps had their quarters and apparatus
                        stationed on a high prominence, and their flags were continually in motion,
                        and the telegraphic communication as kept up over wires from Headquarters to
                        the quarters of the Right and Left Divisions on the field and to Aqua Creek
                        Landing. During Thursday and Friday, our artillery kept up a [illegible] and
                        almost ceaseless fire on the city.--Nearly two hundred guns were brought to
                        bear on it at one time. Finally the engineers and constructing corps
                        succeeded, after may fruitless efforts in throwing across the pontoon
                        bridges, and the various Grand Divisions commenced crossing. Friday night we
                        had possession of nearly the entire town. That a terrible battle would be
                        fought the day following was evident to every one.</p>
                    <p>Saturday morning, long before day break, the cannonading commenced again with
                        greater fury. From this side the city was scarcely distinguishable on
                        account of the tremendous clouds of smoke arising from the batteries, and
                        the dense fog prevailing. It was ascertained that the enemy's works were of
                        a formidable and almost impregnable character. He had three lines of
                        batteries on successive elevations and a stout and almost impregnable wall
                        of stone and earth erected miles in length. The first line of batteries were
                        within about three-fourths of a mile of the town, and in front of this,
                        batteries commanded the streets of the town itself and points accessible of
                        easy attack. Thus it will be seen that our gallant men had heavy, hot and
                        most terrible work to perform.</p>
                    <p>At 10 o'clock our Division moved towards the city. Reaching a position near
                        Headquarters, I noticed Gen. Humphreys riding up to Gen. Hooker who was
                        stationed with General Burnside, on the roof of the portico making
                        observations, and after some conversation retired to his command, and
                        proceeded at once to the scene of action. The glorious fellows were in
                        excellent spirits, not an expression of fear escaped them. They moved off,
                        giving cheer after cheer, and fully determined to do their duty as gallant
                        and brave men. Presently I noticed General Burnside leap in his saddle and
                        leave for the field at a rapid gait, he passed the boys and was instantly
                        recognized. Cheers for Burnside then rent the air, and on they moved with a
                        firm tread, their glorious colors floating proudly to the breeze and their
                        bugles blowing blasts to victory.</p>
                    <p>General Burnside was soon followed by gallant "fighting Joe," there was the
                        ruddy glow as usual on his cheek and his eye was as sparkling and
                        penetrative as ever. Several times during the day I saw these two chieftains
                        riding from and too [sic] Head Quarters.</p>
                    <p>The whole day long, on the right centre and left, the battle raged. The roar
                        of the cannon and the sharp cracking of the musketry was awful, beyond
                        description. It seemed as if all the demons of the infernal regions had
                        broken loose in a grand carnival over some gigantic conquest. As night
                        approached the blaze from the cannons appeared through the smoke like forked
                        lightning in a howling storm. Deeper and deeper grew the thunder of the
                        artillery, and quicker and sharper the volleys of musketry. Just as the Sun
                        was lowering behind the distant hills, the gleam of thousands of bayonets,
                        and the double quick of the men became visible. It was a gallant but
                        desperate charge on a line of battle. The sacred heart to hope could alone
                        refuse the utterance of a prayer for their success. But the work could not
                        be accomplished. From the top of the wall ran one [illegible] stream of
                        fire, sending forth death to every one who approached it. And among the
                        brave undaunted spirits who moved forward to the capture of the works, was
                        one whole Division, Generals Humphrey's and Tyler's in the lead. In front of
                        our own, a Belgade had been placed in a lying position and obscured by the
                        smoke, our men got in among them, and were for a time almost unable to
                        extricate themselves. An order was then given, supposed to be authorized to
                        fall back, when the whole mass moved on a retreat. This misunderstanding
                        seemed extremely difficult to correct. Finally order prevailed and the men
                        again moved forward, but were compelled to abandon their position before the
                        terrible fire of shell and bullets pouring into them. It was not until some
                        time after dark that the battle ceased. During the night there was
                        considerable heavy skirmishing, and a renewal of the fight was looked for
                        this morning. The days operations resulted in no special advantages to
                        either army on the centre. Franklin on the left, is said to have pushed the
                        enemy a considerable distance and gained a partial success. Sumner on the
                        Right made no progress of value, but maintained his ground. I have heard no
                        estimate of the casualties. Our number of killed wounded and missing is
                        undoubtedly far greater than the Rebels, they being protected by the stone
                        walls and earth works and we continually exposed to a sweeping distructive
                        [sic] fire. On the left, Franklin took it is reported three thousand
                        prisoners. About five hundred of them passed me this evening on their way to
                        the Railroad, to be sent North.--I am informed on what I deem reliable
                        authority, that the aggregate of killed wounded and missing of our Brigade,
                        is about nine hundred and seventy-five. It is with unfeigned sorrow that I
                        record the death of Second Lieutenant Henry Clay Fortescue, of Co "G" in our
                        Regiment. Col. Elder supposed to be mortally wounded, but was living
                        yesterday evening.--Capt. Deebler, Co "A" is wounded in the arm. In Co. "H"
                        Capt. Walker and Lieut. Mackey were shot in the right breast, and Lieut.
                        Fletcher in the thigh, neither of them dangerously. Sergt. Pumroy same
                        company, reported killed. Col. Gregor of the 91st Regiment was shot in the
                        hand, Major Todd, same Regiment shot in the leg and suffered amputation of
                        the limb yesterday.</p>
                    <p>I have been making every exertion, to give you a full list of casualties in
                        our Regiment for this letter, but have met with poor success.--There is no
                        getting across the river, and in fact, positions there at present are
                        neither inviting or desirable. My informant of those named is Lieut. Dull,
                        Aid-de-Camp to Gen. Tyler, who made a narrow escape, a bullet struck the
                        upper button of his coat, almost forcing it through. I saw the indentation,
                        and can easily imagine the value of that button to the owner. Gen. Humphreys
                        had two horses horses [sic] shot under him, and Gen. Tyler was shot in the
                        breast by a spent ball.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to the expectations, there has been no general resumption of the
                        fight to-day. To night as I write there is a brilliant display of the Aurora
                        Borealis, the whole heavens seem to be illuminated.</p>
                    <p>SHENANDOAH. <br>December 15, 1862.</p>
                    <p>P.S.--I have just been among our wounded. Our Regiment has been terrible
                        decimated, those who were not killed or wounded are entirely exhausted, and
                        suffering from excitement and general debility. Some of the wounded are
                        greatly lacerated in all parts of the head, body and limbs. Lieut. Fortescue
                        was killed instantly. David Washabaugh and Frank McLaughlin, Co "A" killed
                        in the begining [sic] of the fight. There is a hope that Col. Elder will
                        recover, he is very badly wounded but not so bad as at fire reported.
                        Captains Walker and Deobler, Lieuts. Mackey and Fletcher and a large number
                        of our wounded have been sent to Washington. Whenever I can rejoin Gen.
                        Tyler, I will sent you a full list of our losses and his official
                    report.</p>

                    <p>Through the kindness of a friend, we have been furnished with the following
                        extracts from a letter, received from a member of the 107th Regiment, P. V.
                        This regiment participated in the recent battle near Fredericksburg, and, as
                        in all previous ones in which it was engaged, distinguished itself.</p>
                    <p>Camp Near Falmouth, Va., <br>December 17, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Dear _________ : Another battle has been fought on the south side of the
                        Rappahannock. It occurred on Saturday last. It was a great struggle but was
                        not decisive in its results, and as our position was put a good one we
                        recrossed the river last night. Our Brigade was in the fight. The 107th took
                        the point to which they were ordered by Gen. Gibbons, but could not hold it
                        on account of not being supported and we were compelled to fall back. We
                        were exposed to two heavy fires on going in, and coming out, and our loss is
                        heavy. Isaac Noell is killed Sergeant Thomas Myers wounded. There were two
                        wounded in our company but none killed. The Captain and myself--thank
                        God--are safe once more but made narrow escapes. We are now about two miles
                        from the river and I expect will remain for some time. The Rebels must
                        evacuate this point, strong as it is. The 107th is much praised for its
                        gallantry by all who saw it engaged.</p>

<b>From Fredericksburg--The Crossing of the Rappahannock</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article detailing the aftermath of the battle of Fredericksburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Headquarters Army of the Potomac, <br>December 17th.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning, when daylight appeared, the enemy seemed to be, as they no
                        doubt were, perfectly astonished that our army had succeeded in returning to
                        this side of the Rappahannock.</p>
                    <p>We returned without losing a single man or a gun in the retrograde movement.</p>
                    <p>A few soldiers, who had straggled off, made their appearance on the river
                        bank after the pontoon bridges had been removed, but they were brought over
                        in small boats.</p>
                    <p>A few cavalrymen, who were guarding a house inhabited by a private family,
                        were not, during the night, aware of our crossing, but in the morning they
                        safely swam the river.</p>
                    <p>The pickets of the contending armies being separated by only a few yards,
                        rendered it necessary that everything on our part should be conducted with
                        the utmost caution. Those on the outpost were unaware of the movement until
                        just before daylight, when an officer went to each individual man, and in a
                        low tone ordered him to fall back. After they got sufficiently far off to be
                        out of danger they were ordered to quicken their pace and reach the bridges.</p>
                    <p>At about 9 o'clock yesterday morning the enemy advanced their skirmishers
                        along the entire line, and by noon had established their pickets near the
                        river bank.</p>
                    <p>We had a large number of dead on what was regarded as neutral ground, and as
                        soon as it was known that our forces had evacuated, the soldiers of the
                        enemy commenced robbing the lifeless bodies. This was plainly seen through a
                        field glass, as well as indistincly [sic] with the naked eye.</p>
                    <p>About 10 or 11 o'clock females, neatly dressed, were seen walking the streets
                        of Fredericksburg. They had doubtless been concealed in their houses during
                        the time the city was occupied by our troops, and had availed themselves of
                        the first opportunity to make their re-appearance.</p>
                    <p>On Monday the pickets in front of the left wing agreed upon an armistice
                        among themselves, and freely intermingled, exchanging their dead comrades
                        who lay on neutral ground. During the time a general of our army rode by and
                        put a stop to these proceedings. The result was that both parties
                        immediately commenced firing, when nine of our men were killed. After the
                        general had left the friendly relations of the pickets were renewed, and
                        butternut and blue uniforms freely mingled.</p>
                    <p>About this time Gen. Franklin dispatched a flag of truce, which the enemy
                        immediately recognized, and the exchange of dead bodies was resumed and
                        continued until completed.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon Gen. Lee sent a flag of truce to Gen. Burnside, asking
                        him to detail men to bury his dead in front of Gen. Fumner's grand division.
                        This was done.</p>
                    <p>The wounded, with the exception of those whom the enemy obtained, have all
                        been brought to this side of the Rappahannock, and as rapidly as possible
                        are being sent to Washington.</p>
                    <p>During the flag of truce, Gen. Stuart, of the rebel cavalry, in answert [sic]
                        to a question, stated that Banks' expedition had gone, South, but he did not
                        seem to know exactly were [sic].</p>
                    <p>The entire army is now encamped on the same ground which they previously
                        occupied. They are as comfortable, for the present, as they can be in
                        shelter tents.</p>
                    <p>Our army has been considerably reinforced since the battle, and no danger
                        whatever is attached to their present position.</p>
                    <p>It is the opinion of military men that, had we even succeeded in taking the
                        first ridge of works, the opportunity for slaughter by the enemy would have
                        been far greater than previously.</p>
                    <p>Our men, it may be repeated, behaved with the greatest gallantry, but no
                        troops in the world could withstand such a concentrated fire of heavy or
                        [illegible] and musketry, [sic] cover of their fortifications.</p>
                    <p>Dispatch from Gen. Burnside. <br>Washington, Dec. 16.</p>
                    <p>The following dispatch from Gen. Burnside to Gen. Halleck was received at 9
                        o'clock this evening:</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army of the Potomac, <br>Dec. 16 - 6 P. M.</p>
                    <p>Major General Halleck, Commander in Chief:</p>
                    <p>The Army of the Potomac was withdrawn to this side of the Rappahannock river,
                        because I felt fully convinced that the position in front could not be
                        carried, and it was a military necessity either to attack the enemy or
                        retire.--A repulse would have been disastrous to us under existing
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The army was withdrawn at night without the knowledge of the enemy and
                        without loss, either of property or men.</p>
                    <p>Ambrose E. Burnside.</p>
                <br>
