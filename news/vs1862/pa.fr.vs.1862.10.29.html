<b>The London Times on the Battles in Maryland</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A report from the London Times of October 2, relating the details of the
                    battle at Sharpsburg. The correspondent describes the Federal victory as a
                    surprise and credits it to McClellan's willingness to engage the enemy. Until
                    now, the Confederates had outfought superior Union armies, but the fight now
                    seems to be about equal.<br>

<b>Penalty for Refusing to Serve When Drafted</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors relate the penalties for evading the draft, which are a fine of
                    not more than one years pay and not less than one month's pay, and, on refusing
                    to pay, an imprisonment at the rate of one month for every five dollars owed.
                    The penalty was set out in an act of Congress in 1795.<br>

<b>To Democrats</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors claim that the Democratic party has been more "traduced and
                    vilified" than any other. Now that the Democrats have triumphed in the recent
                    elections, the editors urge them not to retaliate against those who have
                    persecuted them.<br>

<b>Infamous Proscription</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors claim that all employees of the Philadelphia Arsenal who did
                    not vote Republican in the election were fired, and they argue that abolitionist
                    leaders are willing to discard white workers.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Constitutional Union</blockquote>
<b>Hurra for the People!</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors interpret recent Democratic victories as an indication that
                    Northern voters have endorsed the Democratic policy of "the Constitution as it
                    is and the Union as it was." Such a policy should be encouraging to the average
                    citizen of the South, the editors believe, as it promises a return to the Union
                    with all their rights intact. However, the editors conclude, Confederate leaders
                    are still determined to fight, and a strong show of force will be necessary to
                    discredit these leaders.<br>

<b>The Recent Election: Will Abraham Lincoln Listen to their Teachings?</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer takes issue with the Philadelphia Inquirer's interpretation of
                    the election as an endorsement of President Lincoln. In the Pennsylvania
                    congressional delegation, Democrats gained nine seats, with fifteen Democratic
                    congressmen and nine Republicans. Democratic control of the Pennsylvania House
                    of Representatives gives Democrats a majority on the joint ballot, which will
                    give them enough power to name David Wilmot's replacement in the Senate. A
                    number of prominent Pennsylvania abolitionists were defeated at the polls. Ohio
                    and Indiana show similar results. Voters have "peaceably notified" Lincoln that
                    they are tired of emancipation, tired of "Abolition treason," tired of criticism
                    of McClellan, and tired of the suspension of habeas corpus. The editors wonder
                    if Lincoln will hear the voters' message.<br>

<b>The Drafted Militia</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors praise the quality of the recently drafted soldiers from
                    Franklin County and claim that they are of even higher quality than the
                    volunteers from the area. They editors believe the draftees will most likely be
                    stationed within Pennsylvania, and they ask for a detail to be placed in

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We think that we never saw a finer body of men, physically, than the drafted
                        men that appeared in our town on Tuesday last. They are much superior, as a
                        general thing, to the volunteers, and judging from appearances will make as
                        good, if not better, soldiers, than any that this County has already sent to
                        the "tented field." Universal good humor prevailed amongst them and every
                        man we conversed with expressed a determination to "pitch into" the Rebels
                        as soon as they got a chance.</p>
                    <p>It is highly probable that the drafted men of the border counties, will go
                        into camps, near the state line, for the protection of the Old Commonwealth
                        from future incursions of horse thieves under Stuart and Hampton. The
                        government should, by all means, establish a camp near this place and send
                        here several batteries of artillery, so that if the enemy again makes an
                        inroad, in this direction, we may be able to give him a warm reception.</p>

                        For the Spirit and Times.
                    </p>
                    <p>Battle Field of "Antietam," <br>October 20th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors: I have thought it due my my [sic]
                        company to give some expression of my regard for them, and state some
                        matters connected with our movements, through the public prints. The company
                        designated "G" in the 126th Regiment, Penna. Vols, was among the first
                        reported at Harrisburg, for the Nine Months service. We left Harrisburg on
                        the 15th of August and crossed the Beng Bridge at Washington into Virginia
                        the following day. Since that period we have occupied various camps near
                        Washington and Alexandria and this section of Maryland. We have marched
                        fully two hundred miles afoot, and a portion of our late principal march,
                        namely, from beyond Frederick, to Antietam Battle Field about 27 miles over
                        two mountains, and by night, in 14 hours was certainly one of the most
                        remarkable of this war. It is now nearly three months since we were mustered
                        into the U.S. Army, and I am proud to say that at this date I have every man
                        of the original number yet in my command. A few are sick in the hospital and
                        from the same cause one or two are absent with leave. None, however, are
                        seriously ill. Not one of my men have "deserted," or been arrested for any
                        dishonorable act or for any flagrant violation of the Regulations of the
                        Army. I accept their past conduct as a guarantee for the future in this
                        respect. At this time the roll of my company exhibits as many men for active
                        duty as any other in the Regiment.</p>
                    <p>It affords me no little pleasure to be enabled to speak in commendatory
                        language of the general conduct of my company. I can say frankly and
                        candidly that they are always prompt and faithful in the discharge of any
                        duty assigned them. To the officers they are respectful, courteous, and
                        obedient. In their intercourse with one another, on and off duty, they are
                        kind, generous and forbearing. Their persons they keep as clean as it is
                        possible to do in camp, and their quarters evidence order and neatness. They
                        have given proof that they are ready at any time to engage actively in the
                        business of their organization, namely fighting for the Stars and Stripes
                        and the glorious cause of their country. Arriving on the day following the
                        battle of Antietam, but before it was certain that that sanguinary contest
                        had ended, they were full of enthusiastic ardor, and ready to march into
                        position with the rest of the army at the word of command. Again, when
                        notified by Gen Tyler, the brave Commander of this Brigade, on the next
                        Saturday, that they would certainly face the enemy in conflict within a very
                        short time, they were ready without flinching for the order to move. On the
                        late reconnaissance over and several miles beyond the Potomac into the
                        enemy's country, and which was fraught with danger at every step they
                        proceeded bravely and determinedly. The enemies shells and bullets came
                        towards them thick and fast, but they still advanced boldly over rough roads
                        and newly furrowed fields, climbing rocks and high fences and pushing
                        through almost impenetrable woods. They did all this without a murmur or
                        faltering in the least.</p>
                    <p>I make this record of my command after three months intimate association with
                        them for the simple purpose of indicating to their relatives and friends,
                        their past conduct and what we may all hope for in the future. I have spoken
                        of them with no intention to disparage the claims of my fellow officers and
                        their companies, in this regiment, or to undervalue their services, for we
                        are all associated and united in a common purpose and a sacred cause.</p>
                    <p>It may be of interest to the families of my men to know that the 31st of the
                        present month is the date fixed for the appearance of the Paymaster, when
                        each man will be paid the amount due him for three months services.</p>
                    <p>George L. Miles, <br>Capt. Co. G. 126th Regt., Pa. Vols.</p>
