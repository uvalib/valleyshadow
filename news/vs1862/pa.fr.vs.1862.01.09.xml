                <excerpt>"We have little doubt that such influential men as Sumner, Wilson, and
                    others of like stamp, are again plotting disunion, and that when their plans are
                    ripe for execution they will be developed. Their hearts are not in this war for
                    the Union as it was. They cannot be counted upon. But Democrats and conservative
                    citizens must disregard their disloyal machinations and discourage the first
                    intimations that the Union can in any event be abandoned."</excerpt>

                <summary>Cites a statement from an anonymous letter that supposedly represents the
                    views of an abolitionist. The article observes, on the basis of the letter, that
                    abolitionists would prefer to stay separate rather than recreating the Union on
                    any terms which accept the institution of slavery. It argues that abolitionists
                    believe that Northern Democrats are trying to engineer such a reunion. The
                    article emphasizes that Northern Democrats are in fact more loyal to the Union
                    than abolitionists are, despite accusations to the contrary.</summary>

                <excerpt>"Victory to be followed by a long and desolating invasion can only be
                    wished for by those who hate slavery and slaveholders more than they love the
                    Union. It becomes the conservative men of the North to stand firm in their
                    principles, and be ready to welcome the first voice of allegiance from the
                    revolted States."</excerpt>

                <summary>Argues that, with the war nearly a year old, there does not appear to be a
                    speedy solution in sight. However, it warns, the war will be much longer and
                    deadlier if it is prosecuted on the terms of abolitionists, which require
                    emancipation and, in the eyes of this author, a complete surrender of the rights
                    of the state. A more conservative goal would be allowing the South to admit the
                    futility of its cause and working toward a quick reunion.</summary>

                    or have a peaceful Union, while that question [emancipation] is being agitated.

                <summary>Praises Lincoln for the stand he has taken against abolition, arguing that
                    he is essentially adopting Democratic doctrines. If Lincoln continues on this
                    path, the Valley Spirit argues, he might save the country from the horrors of a
                    radical Republican party in power. The editorial puts the blame for the war on
                    abolitionists, not on slavery, and argues that there is absolutely no
                    constitutional ground for abolition. If abolition were to become a war aim, the
                    editorial concludes, it would invalidate the Congressional declaration of war
                    and would betray the slave-holding Unionist border states. It would also erase
                    any trace of unionist sentiment in the South.</summary>
