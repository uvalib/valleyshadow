                    <p>The Excitement in the Army.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, Army of the Potomac. <br>Warrenton, Nov. 9, 1862.</p>
                    <p>The removal of General McClellan from the command of the army has occasioned
                        the wildest excitement. Officers and men unite in denouncing the order as an
                        outrage upon the army, and while they express no objection to General
                        Burnside as an officer, they protest against the measure most earnestly.
                        Many have prepared their resignations, and distinguished officers of rank
                        assert that they will no longer serve in the army if the order be not
                        rescinded.</p>
                    <p>General McClellan received the announcement of his removal with perfect
                        equanimity. He has not been heard to utter a word of complaint, nor has he
                        made any allusion to the subject in the presence of his staff, other than to
                        mention the surprise occasioned by the reception of the despatch. It was
                        equally unexpected to General Burnside, who at first positively declined to
                        accept the position.</p>
                    <p>General McClellan leaves the field for Washington tomorrow, accompanied by
                        his personal aides-de-camp, that portion of his staff connected with the
                        various departments of the army remaining.</p>
                    <p>General Burnside, of course, assumes command immediately.</p>
                    <p>Intense Excitement in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Washington, Nov. 9, 1862.</p>
                    <p>The removal of General McClellan has produced the most intense excitement in
                        this city. It is almost the sole topic of conversation everywhere.</p>
                    <p>The radicals assert that this removal is based upon a report made by General
                        Halleck representing that General McClellan has persisted in disobeying
                        orders and misrepresenting the condition of his army in regard to supplies
                        of clothing and subsistence. The friends of General McClellan declare that
                        his removal was agreed upon before the recent elections, and is a part of
                        the programme of the radicals to obtain the control of the armies in the
                        field.</p>
                    <p>It is unfortunate for the administration that this removal has been made at
                        this time without a promulgation to the country of sufficient reasons for
                        it.</p>
                    <p>It is asserted that upon every occasion when General McClellan was upon the
                        eve of a decisive battle--one which would to a great extent settle the whole
                        question now in issue between the Government and the rebels--he has been
                        prevented from striking the blow by the interference of the government. In
                        this instance he was certainly pushing forward with unwonted rapidity, and
                        actually astonishing the country by the promptness of the movements on his
                        army and the celerity of its progress.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that a general and decisive engagement must occur very soon,
                        and may take place at any moment, and the removal of the General in command
                        under these circumstances without any apparent reason therefoe [sic], except
                        political manoeuvres, has aroused a feeling in the community which is
                        portentous.</p>
                    <p>All accounts from the army in Virginia represent that a similar feeling
                        exists there, and it is feared even by those who have hitherto been violent
                        opponents of General McClellan, that without a satisfactory explanation of
                        his removal a very serious demoralization of the forces lately under his
                        command will ensue.</p>
                    <p>The intensity of the excitement here cannot well be described. It extends to
                        all classes of people, and manifests itself in a sternness of determination
                        which forebodes a terrible expression of public indignation. It is said by
                        those who are presumed to have opportunities of knowing, that this bold act
                        of the administration is but the beginning of the end, and that what is to
                        follow will be still more startling.</p>
                    <p>Many express the opinion that a disruption of the Cabinet will immediately
                        ensue. There is reason to believe that the removal of General McClellan was
                        without the sanction of either Mr. Seward or Mr. Blair, and that it has
                        inaugurated a conflict between the conservative and radical portions of the
                        Cabinet which must terminate in the withdrawal or expulsion of one or the
                        other party. This result is anxiously looked for, and the expectation of
                        greater events is perhaps all that serves at present to prevent some open
                        expression of popular dissatisfaction.</p>
                    <p>The recent despatch hence to the Tribune, that all
                        General McClellan's communications were to the President, and not to the
                        Secretary of War and to General Halleck, was not much credited, because it
                        was known that before Gen. McClellan left here for the campaign in Maryland
                        General Halleck had a protracted interview with him at the house of the
                        former, and that Mr. Stanton, after a like conference, expressed so much
                        pleasure that he invited General McClellan to his own mansion. So, also,
                        Senator Wilson visited General McClellan twice in one evening, and said he
                        was willing to agree to anything to save the country. It seems, however,
                        that the supposed entente cordiale between the
                        generals has really been disturbed; and, therefore, some persons think that,
                        such being the case, successful military operations by Gen. McClellan could
                        hardly be anticipated. It is suggested that the President has acted in this
                        view. Though Colonel Forney's official organ here has lately thrown out the
                        idea that the season is too far gone for effective land movements against
                        the Richmond, it states to-day that new energy is to be infused into the
                        army of the Potomac, which means, it is believed, that General Hooker is to
                        take command. At the same time speaks of the seizure of the Gaps Blue Ridge,
                        by the masterly movment [sic] of McClellan towards Gordonsville, as
                        important strategic points. Colonel Forney's organ in its issue of to-day
                        impeaches the faithfulness of Gen. McClellan by an inuendo [sic]. Hence it
                        is concluded that he is to be court-martialed as well as other generals that
                        have been indicated by the radical organs. If such is to be the case, then
                        other major generals must be selected to serve in the Army of the Potomac;
                        and hence the understanding that General Hunter's departure for the South is
                        to be temporarily suspended. It may be that General McDowell is also to be
                        assigned to the command of a corps d'armee, as
                        General Hooker had a very long conference with Secretary Chase to-day.</p>

<b>To Our Patrons</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors give notice of a price increase for subscriptions, which will
                    now cost two dollars for the year. This price hike is due to increases in the
                    past ten days of twenty-five percent in the costs of printing and paper. In
                    addition, the cost of "Breadstuffs, provisions &amp;c. have advanced in like

<b>Gen. McClellan Removed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors protest the removal of General McClellan from his command,
                    claiming it is the latest in an escalating series of moves by power-hungry
                    abolitionists. They note that after McClellan had been removed last time,
                    Lincoln was forced to ask him to come back after the Union defeat at Second Bull
                    Run. If McClellan had not come back, they surmise, Washington D.C. might have
                    been conquered and Lee and Jackson would be quartered on the soil of
                    Pennsylvania.<br>

<b>The Conservative Men</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    claim that conservative voters had persevered through intimidation to cast their
                    votes for the Constitution and the Union. Now, the writers urge, conservative
                    men must try to educate other voters to bring them into their political
                    organizations and to teach them "the principles of the fathers."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the hour of triumph we need most of all to guard ourselves. When the Roman
                        general was borne in procession through the City of the Seven Hills, and
                        greeted with the splendor of a Roman triumph decreed by the Senate, there
                        was a slave standing in his chariot, constantly reminding him of his
                        mortality.</p>
                    <p>We have no idea that the conservative men need any such reminder. They have
                        not acquired power with their victory, and they have therefore the
                        consciousness that what they have done is but the expression of an opinion,
                        the rebuke of a rampant radicalism that was plunging us into perdition. Had
                        the army been with us to vote, we should have made such a victory in numbers
                        as would have astounded the world. As it is, we have contested with a fierce
                        enemy--a party that declared bitter personal enmity to us--and we have won
                        the contest by cool and unwavering determination. It is a victory of
                        principle over madness; of Americanism over fanaticism. We never saw men
                        vote with such solemn countenances. Behind every ballot box stood police
                        officers, with books and pencils, noting the names of voters. No human being
                        could tell by what right they were there, and no one doubts that the intent
                        in placing them there was to deter loyal men from exercising the right of
                        the citizen. But their presence produced no more effect than had the
                        previous attempt to brand us all as traitors. Men voted the conservative
                        ticket with a sense of the necessity of every vote to save country. Old men,
                        numbers of them who had not voted for many years, came up to the polls and
                        waited in the cue for their turn, and voted in silence, vowing their love to
                        the grand old Union.</p>
                    <p>And now let conservative men understand that their work is not done. We have
                        commenced the great work and it must go on. We advise practical work now for
                        the Constitution and the Union. Keep up all your organizations. Hold
                        frequent meetings. Invite lecturers and speakers to address public meetings
                        on the Constitution. Teach the people correct political ideas. Open halls
                        for such lectures through the fall and winter. Men of the highest ability
                        will stand ready to accept your invitations and to address the people on the
                        correct doctrines of American constitutional law and policy. Continue to
                        circulate documents. Keep up your committees in every village and school
                        district. Raise small sums of money among yourselves, and send for documents
                        like pamphlet of Judge Curtis on Executive power, and the opinion of Judge
                        Hall in the Benedict case, and others of the kind which will be furnished
                        this fall and winter. Thousands who voted the Wadsworth ticket are to-day
                        ready to take their stand with the conservative party, convinced that is not
                        only loyal, but that it is the only Constitution-loving and Union-saving
                        party. Keep up your organizations for the sake of bringing these persons
                        into them. Let the coming autumn and winter be devoted, by those who remain
                        at home, to the study of the Constitution, to increasing love for it, to
                        reading and teaching the principles of the fathers, and to the restoration
                        of a healthy mind to all the people.--Journal of

                        profitably on the Potomac between Sharpsburg and Shepherdstown. We were
                        blessed with most delightful weather, rejoiced in the presence almost daily
                        of loved and respected friends from home, and lived on fare unknown to the
                        soldier through the Commissariat of Uncle Sam. Of course we were pleased
                        with this state of life and tired to enjoy it to the full, anticipating that
                        it might be of short duration and that our future would furnish us abundant
                        hard labor, severe privation and very limited gratifications. Our breaking
                        camp was both interesting and amusing. Men get a little sensitive and do
                        considerable growing when expedition is necessary, and one witnesses as much
                        confusion and confounding as characterizes the inevitable April moving day
                        at home. Lifting the shelter tents from their frame work there is a general
                        exposure of household and kitchen affairs. Pots, kettles, pans, boxes,
                        &amp;c., &amp;c., the accumulation of six weeks in a camp of a large
                        number of men, makes a pretty big pile, I assure you, and the largest
                        portion of these notwithstanding their value or usefulness to their owners
                        have to be left behind, for the reason that Uncle Sam wont [sic] haul them
                        and it is impossible to carry them. The frames of the tents covering a large
                        space of ground present a queer sight too. Their dimensions for shelter
                        purposes are very contracted and you would really think you were looking
                        upon the skeleton habitation of a village of dwarfs. Every available fence
                        and piece of timber in the neighborhood is used for constructing these
                        frames, and while one pities the good Union farmer who sustains loss by
                        these seeming depredations, it is a consoling reflection that the
                        Secessionist too is made to suffer for the aid and comfort his utterances
                        and actions render the enemy in this war.</p>
                    <p>We moved from Camp at 3 P.M., heavily loaded with knapsacks, ammunition,
                        &amp;c., and two days rations in haversacks. Beyond Sharpsburg we took a
                        road, and a very rough and narrow one, leading to Harper's Ferry. There was
                        nothing of peculiar interest occurred as we passed along. After a march of
                        about eight miles we were ordered to halt. Our Brigade bivouacked in a
                        beautiful woods of tall and majestic oaks, such an one as would readily have
                        inspired Bryant when he penned his grand and magnificent "Forest Hymn." A
                        thousand fires were almost instantly ablaze and around the boys gathered to
                        prepare their simple meal of hot coffee and "Hardees," another name by the
                        way for army crackers. This over, the "taps" beat, blankets were spread and
                        sleep that sweet restorer, especially of the fatigued and exhausted soldier,
                        was soon upon us. The usual quietness of the old woods seemed again to reign
                        supreme.</p>
                    <p>At daybreak we were again summoned to ranks and proceeded on our march. 12 M.
                        we reached Harper's Ferry and crossed the Potomac and Shenandoah on Pontoon
                        bridges. I need hardly digress here to describe the magnificent scenery at
                        this point. Most of our best author travellers have made it familiar to
                        nearly all American readers. Seeing it, one can readily appreciate the
                        feelings of Thomas Jefferson when he wrote in his "Notes on Virginia" that
                        it was hardly surpassed in granduer [sic] and that it would amply repay a
                        journey from Europe to see it. The Ferry is now the important base of the
                        supplies of the Army of the Potomac, and you may imagine that at this time
                        there is no little life and business about it. Across the Shenandoah our
                        travel continued over a rough and precipitous mountain road. About five
                        miles from the Ferry at 8 P. M., we halted at 10 o'clock the various
                        Regiments were mustered in for pay. This consists of a rigid examination of
                        the muster and pay rolls. Every man is required to be present and answer to
                        his name, or his absence must be satisfactorily accounted for. This is all
                        only preliminary to the payment of the men. The rolls are forwarded to
                        Washington, where the calculations of pay are made by the Paymasters and
                        they then pass through the hands of other officials for approval. When the
                        gentleman with the "Greenbacks" will make his appearance is very uncertain,
                        I presume it will be some weeks yet. During the afternoon of the same day
                        there was a general inspection of arms and accoutrements. Sunday morning we
                        resumed our march, and arrived at Snicker's Gap at 4 P. M. We prepared our
                        suppers and were about making ourselves comfortable for the night when the
                        order to move again came to us. Off we started, passing from the Gap up the
                        mountain, a distance of three miles. Here we were brought to a rest for the
                        night. Our Company "G" were at once sent out on picket which added no little
                        to our fatigue and sufferings. We were relieved in the morning and brought
                        with us some fine fresh veal; as to how we got it we desire no questions to
                        be asked. During the day fresh supplies of meat came in for several
                        companies without cost to "Uncle Sam", and at this writing the boys are all
                        getting along pretty well.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon there was some terrific firing below us, and we were ordered
                        under arms. It soon ceased however. I have not heard what the result of it
                        was.</p>
                    <p>The weather is very unpleasant. Chill November's surly blasts are upon us in
                        earnest.</p>
                    <p>But I must hastily close, as I know of but a single chance to send you this,
                        and I must avail myself of it.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c., <br>Shenandoah.</p>

                        much injustice--unintentionally no doubt--to the Surgeons in charge of the
                        Military Hospitals located in our town. These gentlemen, since they have
                        been amongst us, have gained many friends by their close attention to their

                        upon guard duty and consequently, discipline amongst the men is somewhat
                        lax. We know that the Surgeons have endeavored to prevent inmates of the
