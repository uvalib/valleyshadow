                <excerpt>"There has never been anything like the same amount of fanatical
                    persecution or government interference with the people for opinion's sake, as
                    has prevailed in the few months of this so-called Republican dynasty.... It is
                    negro freedom they wish to establish, even though the success of the project
                    involves the curtailment or destruction of white liberties."</excerpt>

                <summary>The writers decry the Lincoln administration for its restrictions on civil
                    liberties and for its pursuit of emancipation at the expense, as they see it, of
                    white civil rights. The recent elections, they claim, have broken the power of
                    the Republicans. The Democrats will now demand the restoration of all
                    "constitutional rights and privileges of the States and citizens," including
                    letting the South regulate slavery itself.</summary>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt>"But all this, as we said before, was intended as a mere covering up of the
                    real cause of the removal of General McClellan from his command. The real cause
                    is back of all this, and is political and not military as given out at this
                    time."</excerpt>

                <summary>The editors accuse the administration of trying to soften the blow of the
                    news of McClellan's removal by releasing a letter by General Halleck the same
                    day, as well as the findings of the Harper's Ferry commission. Despite Halleck's
                    explanations, the editors do not believe that McClellan should have been
                    obligated to move his army on a particular day chosen by political leaders--this
                    has no parallel in military history, they claim. The real reason for McClellan's
                    dismissal, they assert, was a purge by radical members of Lincoln's cabinet
                    aiming to get rid of the conservative generals in the army.</summary>

                <summary>The editors poke fun at an editorial in the Transcript and Repository,
                    which claims that those who support slavery are "only rushing upon the thick
                    bosses of Jehovah's buckler." The emancipation proclamation, the editors note,
                    was issued by Lincoln with no claim of divine guidance, but perhaps, they
                    assert, the President had talked to the editor of the Transcript and received
                    the word "through the medium of our inspired neighbor."</summary>

                    <p>In Camp Near Fredericksburg, Va., <lb/>November 25th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>We remained in Camp at Warrenton one week. During this time, Major-General
                        Fitz John Porter was relieved of his command of our corps and Major-General
                        Hooker was appointed in his place. The latter officer is also the senior in
                        command of the Grand Centre Division of the army and ranks next to General
                        Burnside. Monday morning the 17th we took our departure. About 4 P.M. we
                        reached Warrenton Junction which at the time was a new base of supplies for
                        the Army. Here our esteemed Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Niccolls took his departure
                        for home, the period of his official engagement with us having expired. A
                        large number of sick of the Division were forwarded also from this point to
                        the hospitals in Alexandria. Tuesday we marched sixteen miles to a place
                        near Richland Creek. Wednesday we came to within four miles of
                        Fredericksburg where we remained until Saturday when we moved and encamped
                        at this point after marching over a "curcumbendibus" route of eight miles.</p>
                    <p>The weather throughout the entire week was of the most cheerless and
                        disagreeable character. From the time we broke camp near Warrenton until
                        Friday noon it rained almost incessantly. The roads were rendered very
                        nearly impassable, by reason of the mud, to either man or beast. The
                        services of the pioneer force were almost constantly required in clearing
                        new roads through woods, and building temporary bridges over rapidly rising
                        streams. Our progress under the circumstances was considerably impeded
                        though we managed to make our destinations each day. The boys suffered
                        considerable from the cold and wet and many a wish was expressed for a rapid
                        expiration of their term of soldiering. In camp, matters were no better. The
                        rain pelted through the thin fabric of our shelters and blankets, clothing
                        and haversacks underwent a complete soaking.</p>
                    <p>On our last day's march we passed the vestiges of a camp occupied last summer
                        by the Pennsylvania Reserve corps. The whole arrangement was of a beautiful
                        and attractive character. Shelters, square and semi-conical, made of green
                        sod and with every appliance get-atable to make them comfortable, were
                        ranged along the streets: arches, wreaths and festoons of evergreen appeared
                        at various points handsomely arranged, and rustic seats were erected
                        wherever they seemed desirable. No little genius and good taste had been
                        expended in the execution of all this work. It certainly surpassed anything
                        in the way of a camp we have every yet seen and I can imagine the hilarity
                        and joy which prevailed among the Reserve boys in their beautiful embowered
                        homes.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Reed and Lieut. Jeremiah Cook returned to their command on Friday. They
                        received a very kind and cordial reception. In their absence Lieut.
                        Hullinger had charge of the company and devoted himself closely to its
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>We had the pleasure of shaking by the hand on Saturday the brave and gallant
                        Col. Charles T. Campbell, of the 57th P.V. His command is encamped a mile or
                        so from here.</p>
                    <p>The Grand Army of the Potomac have been moving to this point for some days.
                        At present its base of supplies is Acquia Creek about 12 miles from here.</p>
                    <p>Fredricksburg is occupied by the Rebels. Their and our pickets occupy either
                        side of the Rappahannock. There is nothing new astir and I do not see any
                        indication of hostile operations shortly.</p>

                <summary>The Grand Jury of Lehigh County, in a report to the Court, recommended that
                    the county commissioners provide support for the families of drafted men in
                    destitute circumstances, as they do for enlistees. The editors urge Franklin
                    County to adopt such a policy.</summary>

                <summary>The editors warn of counterfeit five-dollar treasury notes in circulation.
                    They note that they are well-made and not obvious to a casual glance. However,
                    they are slightly longer, made of harsher paper, the signature shows more
                    plainly, and the shading of the engraving is darker.</summary>

                    <p>It gives us much pleasure to record the fact that this day was observed in an
                        appropriate manner by our citizens. The stores and places of worship and
                        returned thanks to the Almighty Ruler of the Universe for the many blessings
                        He has bestowed upon us as a nation, and as individuals. Through the efforts
                        of the ladies connected with the different churches, the sick and wounded
                        soldiers in the Hospitals, were provided with a sumptuous thanksgiving
                        dinner, and it was pleasant to behold the way in which the gallant defenders
                        of our country disposed of the good things furnished.</p>
                    <p>It has been the case too frequently, heretofore, that days of this kind have
                        been desecrated by scenes of drunkenness and riot, but the last thanksgiving
                        day is a cheering indication of improvement in this particular. It is
                        gratifying to be able to chronicle the fact that not a single instance of
                        drunkenness or disorder occurred, and that the day was observed by all in a
                        proper manner.</p>

                <summary>Superintendent Thomas H. Burrows has issued a notice to all county
                    superintendents to notify him if they insist upon holding school on Saturdays.
                    Many superintendents, the story notes, have been demanding of their teachers
                    twenty-two or twenty-four days a month, preventing them from attending District
                    Institutes. The teachers need the exposure to these institutes, the editors
                    claim, in order to improve themselves and thus their students.</summary>

                <summary>Reports that the Thanksgiving dinner given to the inmates of the two
                    military hospitals in the area was a success. Many families went without for
                    their own meals in order to supply the soldiers with a feast. There was so much
                    food that it took care of the soldiers' needs for the rest of the week. The
                    soliders wrote a card of thanks to the "Ladies of Chambersburg," signed by the
                    above men plus 75 others who were not listed in the article.</summary>

                    newspaper which complained that the public schools did not provide religious
                    training for pupils; McElwain commented to the effect that "religious
                    inculcation of religious creeds is very properly left to others, instead of the

                    an expression of sorrow for those who have fallen fighting the "demon
                    Rebellion," and one decrying the irregular attendance of students at school. J.
