<b>Emancipation and its Consequences</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that, since the separation of the races is in accordance with
                    natural law, the emancipation of the slaves would only worsen social problems.
                    The North could not handle the influx of free blacks, who if they stayed in the
                    South would simply relapse into slavery, and colonization is too expensive an

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Lincoln has turned the war into one solely to free the slaves,
                    and that his abolition of slavery in Washington D.C. has turned the city into a

                    the wounded. Colonel P. B. Housum related this incident, and would have written

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Capt. H.S. Wishart, Company F., 77th regiment Pa. Volunteers, made a short
                        visit to our town on Friday last. The Captain was obliged to return home on
                        account of the condition of his health, which has somewhat improved, since
                        his return, and he hopes to be able to join his regiment in a few days. The
                        Captain led his company into battle at Pittsburg Landing, at 6 o'clock on
                        the morning of April 7th, and remained with it in the thickest of the fight
                        until 1 o'clock in the day, when he was promoted to the position of Surgeon
                        of the regiment--Previous to going into battle Gen. McCook desired that all
                        the medical men, no matter what office they might hold, be detailed to take
                        charge of the wounded. Col. Stumbaugh communicated this order to Capt.
                        Wishart, who is a regular physician, and desired him to act as Surgeon of
                        the 77th. The regiment was then about entering battle without a Surgeon--Dr.
                        Irish the Principal Surgeon was back with the ambulances, and did not arrive
                        upon the field until the battle was over, and his Assistant, Dr. Potter, had
                        been left in charge of an Hospital at Columbia. Capt. Wishart,
                        notwithstanding the position in which the regiment was left in regard to a
                        Surgeon, requested to be allowed to remain with his company, to which the
                        Colonel reluctantly agreed, and he continued in command of the company until
                        1 o'clock, when the first man shot down in the regiment was a member of his
                        own company. Capt. W still continued with his company for over one hundred
                        yards in advance of where the man was shot, when he received a peremptory
                        order from the Colonel to take charge of the wounded and perform the duties
                        of Surgeon of the regiment for the remainder of the day. In obedience to
                        orders, as well as promoted by a feeling of humanity, and knowing too that
                        his 1st Lieutenant was a brave and skilful [sic] officer, and would lead the
                        company gallantly through the battle, Capt. Wishart transferred his command
                        to Lieut. West and assumed the duties of Surgeon, which he performed
                        skilfully [sic] and humanely until the regular Surgeon arrived and took
                        charge of the wounded. Capt. Wishart speaks in the highest terms of praise
                        of Lt. West, as well as of all the men under his command. We have the
                        principal facts in the above statement not from Captain Wishart, but from
                        Colonel P.B. Housum who would take pleasure in corroborating them over his
                        own signature was he not prostrate on a bed of sickness.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Nip Scott an individual of the kullered persuasion, who held the
                        distinguished position of private commissary to the colonel of the 77th
                        Pennsylvania regiment, returned from the wars last week covered all over
                        with glory. Nip is quite a lion among the wolves of Wolfstown while fighting
                        his battles o'er again and recounting his hair-breadth escapes on field and
                        flood. Nip called to see us and gave a "gleamy" account of our boys in
                        Tennessee. He considers the 77th the crack regiment of the army--that it did
                        all the fighting, took all the prisoners and killed all the rebels at
                        Pittsburg Landing he is quite sure. It would excite Nip's belligerent
                        propensities to a very unsafe degree to say anything against the 77th in his
                        presence. Nip has one trait about him that we admire--his modesty, and it would be worthy of imitation by all who have
                        seen the elephant. We inquired of Nip if he was in the battle?</p>

                    <p>"I'd radder you wouldn't ax me anything more 'bout dat."</p>
                    <p>"You did'nt [sic] retreat I hope?"</p>
                    <p>No S-ar. Dat is not de word we use out dar--I retired, sa in good order."</p>
                    <p>"Did the Colonel get nothing to eat all day?"</p>

                    <p>Discretion is evidently the better part of valor in Nip's estimation, and it
                        would be as well for all those who have a natural
                            aversion to smelling powder to "acknowledge the corn" as frankly
