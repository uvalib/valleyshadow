<b>The Abolition Schemes of Negro Equality Exposed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a speech in the U.S. House of Representatives by Cong. W. A.
                    Richardson of Illinois on May 19, 1862. In it Richardson cites a number of
                    documents which purport to demonstrate the efforts of the Lincoln administration
                    to place blacks on an equal social and economic footing as whites. Included
                    among these are the provision of rations for "contraband" blacks in Washington
                    D.C., the employment of blacks in D.C. as teamsters (to the exclusion of whites,
                    claims Richardson), and the employment of blacks in the Navy as laborers.
                    Richardson concludes by arguing that the superiority of the white race is a
                    God-given fact, and that any attempt to equalize them has "always degraded the
                    superior race."<br>

<b>Party Affiliation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the radical Republicans oppose the stated war goals of
                    "preserving the Constitution as it is and restoring the Union as it was," and
                    that if the Confederates were to surrender, the Republicans would refuse it.
                    This is because, argues the article, the Republicans fear losing power more than
                    they desire the restoration of the Union. The President is being driven toward
                    abolitionism by the need to keep the party together, and the authors argue that
                    he should disregard his party and spare himself embarrassments such as General
                    Hunter's abolition order.<br>

                    same troopers assaulted the owner of the flagpole, Michael Hanstine. The editors

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There was a period in the history of our country which has been very
                        appropriately called the "Reign of Terror." It was during the Presidency of
                        old John Adams, when Federal troopers were sent
                        through Pennsylvania to chop down the Liberty
                        Poles erected by the Jefferson Democrats.</p>
                    <p>Pennsylvania is experiencing another "Reign of Terror." Troopers in the pay
                        of the Federal government--but, to the credit of the President be it spoken,
                        not sent by him on their infamous errand--have been prowling around, cutting
                        down Union Poles and attempting to murder
                        peaceable citizens.</p>
                    <p>We respectfully call the attention of the War Department to the fact that a
                        portion of Horner's Cavalry, led by a Lieutenant or other officer of the
                        company, have chopped down a pole erected expressly to bear the Flag of the
                        Union, and which had borne that flag, though it was not flying at the time
                        when the act was committed. These troopers still further disgraced the
                        uniform they wore, by attempting to murder Mr. Michael Hanstine, the owner
                        of the pole, who carried the "Stars and Stripes" in his hands at the time.</p>
                    <p>These outrages were perpetrated two weeks ago at the town of Waynesboro', in
                        this county. The civilians who participated in them will in due time be
                        looked after by the civil authorities, and it is to be hoped that the
                        troopers will receive their deserts from the War Department. Recent events
                        have proved conclusively that the government can get all the men it needs
                        for the suppression of the rebellion. It can therefore well afford to drum
                        out of its service those who run away from the enemy and exercise their
                        valor only against inoffensive poles and peaceable citizens.</p>

<b>The Resolutions of the Lutheran General Synod--Another Test of Loyalty</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Valley Spirit responds to accusations by the Transcript that the
                    Spirit's criticisms of the resolution in support of abolition by the Lutheran
                    General Synod was aimed at impeaching the loyalty of the Synod. The editors
                    claim that their main argument was that the church should not meddle in
                    politics, and not that the Lutherans were disloyal. The Spirit attacks the
                    editor of the Transcript for his inability to discern the difference between the
                    two.<br>

<b>How the Tribune Cheers Our Brave Troops</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints part of an article from the New York Tribune that declares the
                    battle at Chickahominy Creek outside of Richmond was a warning for the Union.
                    The editors of the Valley Spirit protest what they see as sneering at the
                    efforts of the Union troops and as an attempt to discredit General McClellan.
                    The Tribune admitted that overall the battle was a Union victory, but that it
                    had been poor planning to leave Union positions so exposed. The Valley Spirit
                    argues that the sole reason that the Tribune takes this position is that
                    McClellan is not an abolitionist, and they accuse the Tribune of demoralizing
                    people with that sort of coverage.<br>

                        through the thickest of the fight, and won for her a wreath which may, with
