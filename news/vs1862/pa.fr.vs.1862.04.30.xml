                <summary>A letter from Hiram Treher, a soldier in the Fifth Ohio, to his father John
                    Treher, of Loudon. It describes Hiram's participation in fighting around
                    Winchester, Virginia, in late March.</summary>

                <summary>Complains about the influx of freed blacks into Kansas and Philadelphia.
                    The article argues that there is little enough work for white laborers, and
                    nothing for blacks. Freed blacks thus have become a burden on these towns.
                    Moreover, the Louisville Democrat argues, the proposal for a tax to support
                    colonization of blacks will simply burden working whites with the support of
                    blacks who won't work for themselves. These consequences of abolition need to be
                    considered by Congress, the article concludes.</summary>

                    Telegraph and the Chambersburg Transcript, which took issue with the Spirit's
                    reporting on the lack of a unanimous vote of thanks for Speaker of the House
                    Rowe. The editors deny any personal animus toward Rowe but declare their
                    political enmity, as they feel that Rowe sold out by declaring himself a "Union"
                    candidate and defeating the regular Democratic nominee, Capt. Wishart.</summary>

                    obtain abolition at the expense of the Constitution. The emancipation of slaves
                    in the District of Columbia proves that Lincoln is as bad an abolitionist as the
                    rest of the Republicans, all of whom seem intent on strengthening the rebel
                    cause and alienating the border states.</summary>

                    <p>A Philadelphia corespondent of the New York <emph rend="italic"
                        >Herald</emph>, gives the following account of the arrival, in Philadelphia,
                        of a company of nearly one hundred runaway negroes:</p>
                    <p>"Philadelphia, March 28, 1862.</p>
                    <p>At five o'clock this morning ninety-seven fugitive slaves reached this city
                        by the Baltimore Railroad, and were marched immediately to the Volunteer
                        Refreshment Saloon, at the foot of Washington street, by a deputation of
                        police officers of the First district. An immense crowd followed the
                        contrabands, shrieking, mimicking and tormenting them. At the saloon they
                        were plentifully fed at the tables where a hundred thousand soldiers have
                        been refreshed. The crowd meantime surrounded the shed or stable wherein
                        they were feeding, and at their reappearance made the air clamorous with
                        their cries. Some intensely ludicrous scenes were here enacted, and the
                        negroes were by turn filled with fear and merriment. About a hundred
                        Philadelphia blacks had in the meantime heard of the arrival of their
                        brethren, and a committee of these were allowed to enter the saloon and
                        consult with the fugitives. The interview is said to have been exceedingly
                        humorous and ended in the acceptations by the distinguished strangers of
                        sundry invitations to lodge with our negro citizens.</p>
                    <p>The wealthy negro families here have generously sheltered the Ethiops, and it
                        is probable that a number will remain in the city. The abolitionists are
                        using every endeavor to secure the employment of blacks in the arsenals and
                        navy yards. Memorials of this description are being circulated in this city,
                        and certain Congressmen are pledged to agitate the matter in Congress.</p>
                    <p>The negroes who have arrived are dressed in the coarsest garb of hemp, and
                        those that stray around the city are singled out for universal criticism and
                        laughter. Most of these contra-bands have been engaged with Banks' division,
                        repairing railroads on the Upper Potomac. They have brought their
                        grandmothers and children, away, and we saw among the arrivals one woman
                        upwards of a hundred years old, who stated that she had more than twenty
                        children.</p>
                    <p>Three of these negroes were the property of ex-Senator Mason, and two of Hon.
                        C.J. Faulkner.</p>
                    <p>Three hundred Fugitives expect to get here next week.</p>
                    <p>Our citizens are, in the main, incensed at the appearance of these people,
                        and the laboring people are particularly chagrined. Several of the men have
                        money, and one negro had Treasury notes to the amount of a hundred dollars.</p>
                    <p>Here now, we have a practical demonstration of the effect of the efforts of
                        the insane abolitionists to free the negroes. They already begin to come
                        North in gangs of one hundred at a time, bringing along their children and
                        Grand-mothers, to be supported by the people of the North. "Three hundred
                        more are expected next week!" So we are told--and their good friends, the
                        abolitionists, are trying to "secure them employment in the arsenals and
                        Navy yards!" Pleasant prospects for the Irish, German and American laborer!
                        Sambo to get all the work: poor white men to be thrown out of employ to make
                        room for the niggers, and to be well taxed to make up Sambo's pay. Glorious
                        prospects, ahead!</p>
                    <p>What do our mechanics and laboring men, particularly those who put the
                        Republican party in power, think of this state of affairs? Does not this
                        prove that the Democrats were right, when they contended that the effect of
                        abolition principles proving triumphant, would result in having the whole
                        North overrun with worthless negroes, to come into competition with the
                        white laborer? When the Democratic papers predicted that this would be the
                        case, they were [r]idiculed and scoffed at by the Republican paper.</p>
                    <p>This is but the beginning of the evil. They are now coming by the hundred,
                        and if abolitionism is not crushed out and put down, by the potent influence
                        of the ballot box, after a while they will come by the thousand! As these
                        blacks are willing to work cheaper than white men, our white laborers will,
                        as a matter of course, be thrown out of employment, to the extent that these
                        people are introduced into our midst. That will be the inevitable result.
                        Pennsylvania being a border State, we will get more than our share and may
                        expect to suffer more than others.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party is in favor of letting these negroes <emph rend="italic"
                            >remain in the South</emph> and earn their living on the plantations
                        where they have been reared. We do not want them here, to throw our white
                        laboring population out of employment, to steal from our Farmers and to fill
                        our Poor Houses and Prisons. We have as many colored people here as we need.
                        Let the Southerners take care of the hundred year old women and young
                        darkies, themselves. Unless this thing is checked by some means, it will
                        prove a serious evil and an intolerable nuisance.</p>

                <summary>Notes the arrival in Philadelphia of over one hundred former slaves, who
                    were met by a crowd of taunting whites and eventually by a welcoming committee
                    of local blacks. It is rumored that some abolitionists will try to get them
                    employment at the local navy yard. The author protests this action, saying it
                    puts blacks in competition with white mechanics. He argues that the freed blacks
                    should stay in the South to work on plantations.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Any one who walks the streets of Harrisburg may see, at almost every corner,
                        a promiscuous crowd of white and black boys playing together, wrangling
                        together and practically carrying out the Abolition doctrine of perfect
                        equality between the races. It not unfrequently happens that, in these
                        assemblages, fights occur, in which white boys get unmercifully whipped by
                        the blacks, who are not slow to avail themselves of their superior size and
                        strength, and who carry out the natural law which gives right to might.</p>
                    <p>Now, what can you expect from a white boy who is in the habit of free and
                        equal intercourse with black boys, whose home and street education every one
                        of our citizens understands?</p>
                    <p>Can the white boy who has been kicked and cuffed by a negro entertain the
                        self-respect and sense of shame calculated to restrain him from low and
                        immoral habits?</p>
                    <p>The aphorism that "evil communications corrup[t] good manners" was never more
                        fully exemplified than in the present case. We wonder that parents do not
                        interpose to correct an evil so demoralizing to the rising generation, and
                        which, unfortunately, is one of the bitterest fruits of the turbid stream of
                        Abolition speeches, essays and tracts sown broad cast over the land by
                        fanatics whose morbid sympathy for the blacks prepares the degradation of
                        the whites!</p>
                    <p>How long will the people suffer in their midst these howling dervishes whose
                        sole object seems to be, to pull down the whites to the level of the blacks!
                        Whose cant is, "<emph rend="italic">the dignity of white labor</emph>, by
                        the introduction in our midst of thousands of runaway slaves, who will enter
                        into competition with our white laborers, reduce their wages, and degrade
                        occupation!</p>
                    <p>The white boy who is now seen cheek by jowl with a negro may probably be seen
                        in after life mating with a colored wench, and thus become the willing
                        instrument of practical amalgamation.</p>
                    <p>The city of Harrisburg now presents a few such shameful examples. The
                        juvenile admixture of blacks and whites of which we now complain may
                        hereafter increase them to such a degree as to disgrace the community and
                        deteriorate our race!</p>
                    <p>Parents! look to your children and remember that "just as the twig is bent
                        the tree's inclined." Let it not be forgotten that ours is a Government, of
                            <emph rend="italic">white</emph> people, and that all inter-mixture with
                        inferior races degrades our own, producing a motley rabble unfit for
                        self-government, as we see examplified [sic] in distracted Mexico.</p>
