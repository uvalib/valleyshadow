                    <p>Alexandria, Va., Sept. 6th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors: The rumors that reach us from the different corps of our
                        grand "Army of Virginia" are so conflicting and unsatisfactory, that we are
                        compelled to have recourse to the daily papers of New York, Philadelphia and
                        Washington, if we would get any idea at all of the present condition of
                        affairs; and even then the meagre [sic] information they contain only serves
                        to render the "confusion worse confounded." As a matter of course, the great
                        engagement of the war has concluded, as all battles must have an end, but
                        exactly how and why it was brought to a close, we have not yet been
                        informed. Of two things, however, there can be no doubt--our army has fallen
                        back within range of the cordons of Forts that guard the approaches to
                        Washington from the Old Dominion--and, during the recent engagements, we
                        have lost most severely in killed, wounded and prisoners, as well as guns,
                        amunition [sic] and stores captured by the enemy. The wounded and prisoners,
                        as well as guns, amunition and stores captured by the enemy. The wounded
                        still continue to be brought to town, filling all the old hospitals to
                        overflowing, while new ones are being prepared and fitted up as rapidly as
                        possible. Some of the newspapers estimate our loss at 15,000 in killed,
                        wounded and missing; and you may rest assured the figures are none too high.
                        But while we have suffered thus too severely, it must be remembered that the
                        enemy did not escape unscathed. They failed in their main purpose, that of
                        attacking and totally routing our separate commands in detail, then of
                        reaching the Potomac and making an attack upon the Federal Capital or a raid
                        into Maryland or Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>The 107th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, chiefly from our county,
                        participated in three of the severest days fighting, and behaved most
                        gallantly, their loss has been very heavy. Out of nearly five hundred
                        officers and men who went into the battle, only two hundred and twenty-five
                        or fifty have yet reported themselves. I have made every endeavor to get a
                        list of the killed and wounded from members of the Regiment met in town, but
                        have yet met with very poor success. Brave Captain Dick fell, shot through
                        the heart, with a minie ball, while gallantly leading on his company. He had
                        taken the musket of a private shot down near him, and was doing good service
                        in the country's cause when the fatal messenger of death laid him low. He
                        never spoke after he fell. His musket was found by his side shatterd [sic]
                        to pieces. I have heard, from more than one mouth, the expression "Captain
                        Dick was as brave as a lion, that day;" and all who knew the man will
                        readily believe that he was "bravest among the brave." His body was secured
                        and buried, and would have been sent home had this not been strictly
                        forbidden. Captain Brand is also spoken of in the highest terms. He engaged
                        in a hand to hand contest at one time, and succeeded in making his adversary
                        bite the dust. His company (K), being on the left of the Regiment, and the
                        Regiment on the extreme left of the line, they were the last to leave the
                        battle-fields of Saturday. Company K went into battle with fifty men, and
                        came out with but eighteen--though it is expected that more still yet reach
                        camp, and a number taken prisoners have already been paroled. Among the
                        killed is--Stoutegle, whose friends, I believe, reside in or near
                        Chambersburg; and among the wounded are Jacob Monat, wounded in the thigh,
                        not dangerously; John Darnfeldt, wounded in the breast; and--Lanch, from
                        near Greencastle. Darnfeldt was struck with a ball, in the right side,
                        immediately below the shoulder--the ball passing entirely round the chest,
                        scarcely an inch below the skin, and yet doing but little injury.
                        Lieutenants Williams and Norris were taken prisoners, but have since been
                        paroled. There are others from our vicinity on the fatal list; and as soon
                        as I can learn their names I will send a more detailed and correct report.
                        The 107th is attached to Gen. Duryea's Brigade and is now under command of
                        Col. Thos. F. McCoy. Lieut. Col. McAllen arose from a sick bed to
                        participate in Saturday's fight, and was highly complimented for his
                        coolness and courage.</p>
                    <p>The various companies of our regiment have returned from guard duty, along
                        the Manassas road, and our whole Brigade has now been brought in to the
                        vicinity of Fort Ellsworth, about three miles from town. We are now attached
                        to Gen. Slocum's Brigade. Gen. Franklin's Division; and in a day or so we
                        expect to take up our march for Chain Bridge, above Washington. We may move
                        still further up the river, before many days, and get nearer home. It seems
                        to be generally anticipated that Jackson may yet pay Pennsylvania or
                        Maryland a visit, unless he is resisted by a strong force.</p>
                    <p>Just while I am writing a train of Ambulances, reaching out beyond our
                        camp--doubtless three or four miles long--is passing through town towards
                        Washington, with wounded from the battle-field of Friday, (Manassas). Some
                        of the drivers say there are yet any quantity left on the field, and on
                        their way in they met a train as long as theirs going out for a similar
                        purpose. These gallant fellows have been lying on the field for a whole
                        week, suffering and enduring; and we are now compelled to go through the
                        enemy's lines to get them. Two full Regiments were sent within the enemy's
                        lines to-day to bury the dead.</p>
                    <p>The wharf of Alexandria presents a lively appearance--almost equal to that of
                        New York. The river is crowded with transports, and with their loading and
                        unloading--the creaking of windlasses and derricks--the braying of mules,
                        the hallooing and swearing of drivers--the jostling of men running hither
                        and thither--the energetic steaming up and down of the indefatigable little
                        tugs--and a hundred and one other noises and as many different odors--you
                        may imagine the bustle, confusion and unpleasantness of the place. The upper
                        part of the town, however, is clean and healthy and contains many really
                        splendid mansions, principally occupied by "secesh" or used as hospitals.
                        The females of the town have learned to behave pretty respectably, though
                        some of them still insist on turning up their noses or lifting their dresses
                        after the Union soldiers pass. It is almost the "wee [illegible] hours
                        beyond the twal" and I must close.</p>

                    <p>Through the kindness of a friend we are permitted to publish the following
                        interesting letter received by him from a private in Captain Doebler's
                        company.</p>

                    <p><lb/>Sept. 3d, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Gents: I have now a few leisure moments which I will devote to writing to
                        you. I presume that you are aware of our movements from Harrisburg to this
                        place through other sources. Therefore I will not go further back, as the
                        last few days have been so replete with adventures that it will employ all
                        my present time to relate them. On last Thursday about 12 o'clock we were
                        ordered to strike tents, which we did, and was ordered, it is generally
                        believed, to the front (Manassas). They sent our trains on , but we still
                        lay at Camp waiting orders to move. But night came on and no orders, we were
                        then formed into line ready for an attack as it was thought we might be that
                        night. Morning dawned without anything but the chilly night air to disturb
                        our sleep. Our tents were ordered back to camp and pitched. On Sunday,
                        Company A got orders to guard an ammunition train to the front, as did
                        company B, and 8 companies of the 129th. We moved along the Alexandria and
                        Centreville Turnpike through a drenching rain, the sand being about 4 inches
                        deep made it very fatiguing. At first we got along pretty well, meeting
                        nothing more than a dead horse about every 1/2 mile, then a few teams, then
                        938 rebel prisoners, who were the most God-forsaken looking wretches that I
                        ever saw, and began to think that they were <emph rend="italic">not</emph>
                        "Foeman worthy of our steel," and that it would be a disgrace for white men
                        to honor the rascals so much as to fight them. After this the wagons and
                        ambulances began to get thick, and by the time we got to Fairfax Court House
                        there was a perfect jam, seemingly a regular skedaddle, but it was not the
                        case for they were loaded with wounded soldiers, how many I would not
                        pretend to say, but it is useless for me to attempt to describe the scene,
                        every available vehicle from Washington was used to carry the wounded, and
                        still there were thousands of wounded walking. Thousands of soldiers who
                        were lost or their regiments were cut up, with any quantity of negroes, all
                        trying to get to Washington. It was a sight, I assure you. We pulled our way
                        about 3 miles beyond Fairfax, w[h]ere we lay until almost night when we were
                        again ordered to move towards home which we did. After we had gone about a
                        mile a rebel battery opened on the spot we had just left, supposing we were
                        still there. They shelled a house and stable there, leaving them a perfect
                        wreck, but we were safe. Next morning we started home arriving there very
                        tired. Yesterday the news came that Gen. Pope was falling back, so we were
                        ordered to go back and are now encamped about one mile from Alexandria. Last
                        night Gen Franklin's whole division arrived at Alexandria the rest having
                        taken some other course. Things begin to look a little squally. It is
                        reported that Gen Kearney is killed.</p>

                    <p>I am yours, &amp;c. <lb/>D.A.N.</p>

                <summary>A letter from a correspondent stationed in Alexandria, Virginia. In it he
                    confirms that, despite conflicting reports, the Union army did suffer a setback
                    in territory and a major loss of arms and men. He notes that the 107th Reg't
                    Penn. Volunteers was directly involved in the fighting, and suffered heavy
                    losses--among those killed were several Franklin County men. The writer promises
                    a more detailed list in the next letter. He reports on conditions in camp and
                    describes a three or four-mile train of ambulances passing through town from the
                    front on the way to Washington.</summary>

                    assume that no man can be loyal without resigning his freedom to pass upon the

                <summary>A response to the address by the Republican State Central Committee to the
                    "loyal men of Pennsylvania," in which the Republicans define loyalty in terms of
                    unquestioned support for the administration, support for the measures of
                    Congress in fighting the war, and in seeing the Confederacy and its allies as
                    the "enemies of civilization and liberty." To define it as such, say the
                    editors, is merely a partisan effort to squash individual expression.</summary>

                <excerpt>"There is much reason to apprehend that there exists to some extent not

                    <p>Does the question startle anyone? We pray you, gentlemen of the loyal State
                        of Pennsylvania, gentlemen of all the loyal States, be calm, be not at all
                        startled or alarmed at <emph rend="italic">any</emph> question. In the South
                        there are papers that do not hesitate to proclaim that Jefferson Davis <emph
                            rend="italic">is</emph> a Dictator; that he exercises Dictatorial
                        powers. And what of it? Are not these military times? And what are civil
                        laws and constitutional restrictions and guarantees more than cobwebs when
                        military power lords it over us? Be not surprised at anything. If the times
                        will not accommodate themselves to us, let us act the part of philosophers,
                        and accommodate ourselves to the times. When Xantippe was rude and treated
                        Socrates to an unpleasant shower bath, the philosopher contented himself
                        with the remark that thunder was always followed by a storm. This is the
                        temper in which we should all now act. Here, in the North, none have yet
                        ventured to say we have a Dictator--but if some foolish or insane fellow
                        should, one of these days, suffer his blood to get hot enough to force such
                        a declaration from his tongue, don't be scared, but treat it as the chimera
                        of a distempered fancy. Of course we have no dictator; but, if things
                        pertaining to the civil and military administration of the Government should
                        get a little more muddled; if a few more reverses should befal [sic] our
                        army, and a little trouble should occur in financial matters; if the machine
                        should not apparently work as smoothly as desirable in its old gearing, for
                        want of <emph rend="italic">power</emph>, as (some Republicans seem to think
                        may be the case--then, and in that event, we put the question: "Are we to
                        have a Dictator?" There is much reason to apprehend that there exists to
                        some extent not only a desire that we should have, but a design to make the
                        attempt to establish a Dictatorship when, in the judgment of the
                        conspirators, the hour shall have arrived to make the effort safe, if not
                        successful. The idea has already been started by the Cincinnati <emph
                            rend="italic">Gazette</emph>, a leading Republican paper, and has been
                        substantially endorsed by the New York <emph rend="italic">Evening
                        Post</emph>, a paper of very high standing and of the same politics--even in
                        this State it has been faintly foreshadowed by the Philadelphia <emph
                            rend="italic">Press</emph>. The subject is thus broached by the <emph
                            rend="italic">Gazette</emph>:</p>
                    <p>"Many are <emph rend="italic">willing to invest the President with a military
                            dictatorship</emph>, so that <emph>one mind, without so much distracting
                            counsel, shall infuse new and terrible energy</emph> into the measures
                        to put down the rebellion. A day or two since I attended the ceremonies of
                        raising a flag over a new hospital, a mile east of the Capitol. Dr.
                        Sunderland, chaplain of the Senate, and pastor of one of the largest New
                        School Presbyterian churches in Washington, was the orator. He boldly
                        proclaimed <emph rend="italic">the sentiments of the loyal North</emph>,
                        that a new war policy must be inaugurated, or the rebellion never could be
                        put down. He advocated a <emph rend="italic">military dictatorship in the
                            person of the President."</emph></p>
                    <p>Even now, when acts and deeds committed in utter defiance of the
                        Constitution, and in contempt of the rights guaranteed to ever[y] citizen;
                        and when too many, perhaps the majority, not only countenance, but <emph
                            rend="italic">approve</emph> these glaring wrongs, such a paragraph as
                        the above cannot but astound every old believer in the sufficiency of
                        democratic institutions, whether for a time of war or peace.</p>
                    <p>The Bridgeport <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph> asks: Can one realize
                        that such sentiments are enunciated in the free and independent United
                        States of America; and that there is to be found among the descendants of
                        the iron men of '76 who suffered, endured, struggled and won, after many
                        years of toil, the priceless boon of liberty and independence, one recreant
                        son who is willing to submit himself and his country to a military
                        dictatorship? The <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> tells us there are
                        many.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the effects produced by Abolitionism. It has poisoned the
                        fountain of American intelligence; blinded the understanding of its
                        devotees; frozen up their patriotic impulses, their love of liberty and
                        independence; palsied the efforts of thousands and tens of thousands of
                        brave men--and now in abject cowardice and craven submission, it is ready to
                        surrender up the remnant of our liberties to a dictator. God save the
                        republic and us all, when such insidious and base counsels are either
                        covertly endorsed, or receive the silent approbation of the dominant party
                        of the country.</p>

                        name of Washington and his compe[e]rs are syllabled by thousands of the true

                        handful of venerating and undaunted freemen. Not while a party remains,

                    <p>"<emph rend="italic">the Union as it was</emph>," who will recognize no

                        magistrate. If we have nothing else left, let us maintain that the barren
                        pretence [sic] of sovereignty still rests in the people. While that remains
                        we have still some hope for our country--once lost, freedom will never be
                        regained. All history declares it; we may be sure we shall prove no

                    <p>To the Rescue--Freemen of Franklin County.</p>
                    <p>The darkest hour of our Country's history is upon us. Gen. Pope's army in
                        Virginia, after the most terrific fighting, has fallen back to the
                        fortifications around Washington, and the Nation's Capital is again
                        threatened by an insolent foe. The invading hosts of the enemy have pressed
                        the soil of Maryland, and our own beautiful valley may at any hour become
                        the victim of a similar invasion. Citizens of Franklin county, the enemy is
                        at the very threshold of your homes, your altars and your firesides. Will
                        you not instantly respond to the call of your Government in this the day of
                        your country's peril? Let not the wisest, the best, and most glorious
                        Government ever devised by the wisdom of man, be despoiled and overthrown by
                        armed traitors, when you have the power to prevent it. Let it not be said
                        that the Government failed to enforce its authority and punish rebellion by
                        inaction on our part. Come one, come all, who are able to bear arms, and
                        enrol [sic] your names in some one or other of the companies that are now
                        forming in different parts of the county, and thus show that the patriotism
                        of Franklin county is equal to any emergency. The draft has been postponed
                        until the 20th, which affords another opportunity for Franklin county, to
                        fill her quota of men by voluntary enlis[t]ments.</p>
                    <p>Gen. McClellan is again at the head of the army. His appointment seems to
                        have inspired the army and the people with renewed confidence and
                        enthusiasm. He is not alone the defender of the Capital, but to-day, as
                        never before, the eyes of the nation are fixed on him as the Defender of the
                        Union. In the language of a contemporary, "let the people of the North awake
                        now, if they have never before been awake to the stern realities of this
                        hour. Let every nerve be exerted, every pulse quickened, every heart roused
                        to the necessities which demand our utmost efforts. Let us have done with
                        all manner of bickering and quarrelling [sic] here. Let us send hosts into
                        the field as fast as they can crowd the avenues to the Capital. Let us
                        present to the rebel hosts in front of Washington the vision of a whole
                        people pressing to the field, giving their fortunes and their lives,
                        pledging their loyalty and their honor to the cause of the greatest and best
                        of governments, the Union that has made us what we are.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to the gentlemen who have heretofore so bitterly opposed the young
                        General. We beseech them to believe that the army of the Union know the man,
                        and that the cheers with which the dying men on the battle field have
                        greeted his appearance speak a deeper knowledge of his soldierly virtues, a
                        more thorough acquaintance with his heart and his head than any can boast of
                        who have not fought under his leadership. We bespeak for him the prayers of
                        the people, that the trust reposed in him may be safely kept, and a good
                        account rendered by him to the people of his country and the God, on whom
                        all his and our confidence rests.</p>

                <summary>Praises and briefly describes the Democratic ticket for the county
                    elections: Jonathan Jacoby of Antrim for assemblyman, Samuel Brandt of
                    Chambersburg for sheriff, William D. McKinstry of Mercersburg for associate
                    judge, Josiah Fickes of Lurgan for county commissioner, Samuel Secrist of Quincy
                    for director of the poor, Daniel Gelwix of Letterkenny for county auditor, Jacob
                    Cook of Montgomery for county surveyor, and Dr. James Crawford of Concord for
                    coroner. The editors urge Democrats to resist the "low partisanship of the
                    opposition that would impeach your loyalty" and to vote the Democratic ticket on
                    the second Tuesday of October.</summary>

                <excerpt>"We are without any authentic account of the operations of the army near
                    the Capital during the past week, army correspondents having been excluded from
                    the field, and what the daily papers publish are mere rumors, flying about the
                    streets of Alexandria and Washington, set in motion by runaways, sutlers,
                    teamsters, and other hangers on about the army, collected and embellished by
                    newspaper correspondents with highly excited imaginations. Nobody can gather
                    anything from the telegrams sent over the country, and as for the mass of
                    nonsense published in the city dailies, it is worse than useless to attempt to
                    read it."</excerpt>

                <summary>The editors report that what had appeared to be a Union victory at first
                    outside of Washington was actually a defeat, and that General Pope has been
                    outmaneuvered and Washington is threatened. The Confederates have been on the
                    offensive in the west as well, and they now threaten Cincinnati. The editors
                    hope these setbacks will awaken those in authority to the seriousness of the
                    situation, but urge its readers not to lose hope, "that the darkest hour is just
                    before dawn."</summary>

                    <p>It is rendered certain, by our latest advices, that the enemy has crossed the
                        Potomac in heavy force, at Edwards Ferry. Should he succeed in defeating our
                        army in Maryland and advance into Cumberland Valley, let us be prepared to
                        meet him, but at the same time let us keep cool and deliberate in making
                        those preparations. Let there be no dismay, no panic among us. Let us call
                        to our assistance men having the requisite military knowledge, and arm and
                        organize for any emergency and in a short time we can have force sufficient
                        to drive back any band of maurauders that may attempt a foray in this
                        direction. We are satisfied that there is enough of the fighting element, in
                        this valley, if properly organized and armed, to cope successfully with any
                        force that the enemy would be able to spare for a raid into this section of
                        the State. We think that the Executive should take the necessary steps to
                        effect a complete re-organization of the Militia of the border counties.
                        Individuals cannot effect an organization of magnitude sufficient to be of
                        much service, it should be done under and by the authority of the State
                        government.</p>

                <summary>It is now nearly certain, say the editors, that the enemy has crossed the
                    Potomac in force at Edwards Ferry and, if they defeat the army in Maryland,
                    could advance into the Cumberland Valley. The editors call for local
                    organization to resist invaders, and for the state government to re-organize the
                    militia of the border counties.</summary>

                    <p>From the 107th Penna. Regiment.</p>
                    <p>Through the kindness of our friend Dr. Reid of this place, we are permitted
                        to make the following extract from a letter he received a day or two ago,
                        from his nephew, a Lieutenant in the 10th Regiment P.V.</p>
                    <p>"What times we have had since I last wrote to you--marching every day and
                        night since, fighting our way through all the time in the late battles. I
                        was in three of them. Those on Friday and Saturday were terrific. Our 2nd
                        Lieutenant is lost and 13 men. At Thoroughfare Gap, I was appointed to
                        command Co. C. the color company, its Captain and 1st Lieut. being absent
                        and sick. I still command the Company. I lost 16 men, killed, wounded and
                        missing. I think about one half of our Regiment is missing. Capt. Dick was
                        killed. Col. McAllen is safe, although sick. I am safe, thank God for it. I
                        had my revolver shot off my sword belt, and was knocked over once by the
                        explosion of a shell while urging on my men."</p>

                <summary>An extract from a letter to Dr. Reid of Chambersburg from his nephew,
                    Lieut. J. A. Carman of Company C, 107th Reg't Penn. Volunteers. Carman's company
                    marched nearly every day and night the past week, and fought in three battles,
                    and those on Friday and Saturday were very fierce--his company lost its 2nd
                    Lieutenant and 13 men, and the Captain and First Lieutenant are sick, and thus
                    Carman is in command of the company. He estimates that over half the Regiment is
                    missing, and Captain Dick was killed. Carman had his revolver shot off his sword
                    belt and was knocked over by the explosion of a shell, but was otherwise
                    unharmed.</summary>

                    service, those who enlisted in the three-months regiments, or those serving as

                    is reprinted from a Republican paper, but when it was read in by the pastor of
                    the Presbyterian Church last Sunday it aroused some dissension and several

                <summary>The editors call the reader's attention to the estate sale administered by
                    Caroline Radebaugh of Samuel Radebaugh's estate. The real estate for sale, the
                    editors note, is some of the most valuable in the county and "affords a rare
                    chance, to capitalists, for a safe and profitable investment."</summary>

                    <p>Washington, Sept. 6, 1862</p>
                    <p>As was surmised in The Inquirer a few days since, a portion of the Rebel
                        forces, under <emph rend="italic">command of </emph> Jackson, <emph

                        consum[m]ated the invasion of Maryland. This despatch, it will be
                        remembered, was the subject of much newspaper ridicule among our
                        contemporaries, but the action of the Rebels on yesterd[a]y and to-day <emph
                            rend="italic">fully corroborates the accuracy of our knowledge</emph>.</p>
                    <p>On Friday a large force of Rebel Cavalry made its appearance on the Virginia
                        side of Potomac river, opposite Edwards' Ferry, having reached this point by
                        the road leading from Leesburg, and endeavored to effect a crossing. So soon
                        as the design of the enemy was perceived dy [sic] our troops stationed on
                        the Maryland side of the river, a battery was immediately posted upon the
                        river bank, and a heavy and effective shelling of the Rebel force
                        commenced." The firing was continued for some time, when the enemy
                        perceiving that all further attempts to cross the river would prove futile,
                        hastily withdrew.</p>
                    <p>At half past two o'clock this morning a second attemp[t] to cross the river
                        by the fords of Elward's, Conrad's, Nolen's and Smith's ferries was made,
                        and under the cover of darkness proved successful. These ferries are all
                        situated east of Point of Rocks, and the former ferry (Edward's) is five
                        miles south-west of Poolesville, and some forty miles distant from
                        Washington. The Rebel force upon this occasion consisted of between two and
                        three regiments of cavalry, and as soon as Poolesville was invested, our
                        pickets hastily communicated with our troops in the rear, whose numbers
                        being numerically small, thought it best to beat a retreat. Some fifteen or
                        twenty soldiers belonging to the first Maryland regiment are among the
                        missing, and are supposed to have been captured.</p>
                    <p>Our force at Poolesville, at the time, consisted of the Infantry regiment,
                        already named the First Massachusetts Cavalry and a detachment of the
                        Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry.</p>
                    <p>From this point the Rebel Cavalry proceeded to Darnestown, a little town
                        situated on Seneca creek, nine miles distant from Poolesville, in a
                        southeasterly direction and communicating in a direct route with the
                        district of Georgetown, D.C. This point was reached at about half-past four
                        o'clock this morning, and the cavalry entered the town pell mell, almost
                        before our pickets were aware of their approach. At this point there has
                        been established a branch office of the military telegraph, communicating
                        with the War Department.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately the telegraph operator, being instantly warned of his danger,
                        tore the recording instrument from the table to which it was fastened, cut
                        the wire, and thus armed made sudden tracks for the little town of
                        Rockville, situated some ten miles in the rear, on the Darnestown road. His
                        farther progress was soon ended, however, by the appearance of some of our
                        troops coming down the road.</p>
                    <p>With Darnestown the raid ceased, the Rebels probably fearing an attack from
                        our forces in the vicinity, who already were on the alert to punish the
                        enemy's audacity.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt but what the Rebels are coming in force into Maryland at
                        the points already named, and even at others still further up the river.
                        Parties who came in from Poolesville and Darnestown, all agree in this
                        supposition.</p>
                    <p>On Friday the Rebels fired and destroyed the funnel bridge across the
                        Monocacy river, and also did great damage to the canal at this point,
                        besides capturing and destroying several canal boats. To what further extent
                        their depredations were carried on, we have not yet been informed.</p>
                    <p>A number of farmers from Montgomery county, Maryland, whom we have seen,
                        mention the fact of having seen, from the Maryland shore a number of the
                        tents of the Rebels on the Virginia side of the Potomac in the vicinity of
                        Point of Rocks. They seemed to extend some three miles westerly from
                        Edwards' Ferry. The enemy are busily engaged in building rafts, is supposed,
                        as the sound of chipping is heard at all hours of the night. These rafts
                        will be used in crossing the river.</p>
