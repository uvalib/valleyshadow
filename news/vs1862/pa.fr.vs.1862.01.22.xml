                <excerpt>"It ought to be understood, that looking to the variety and character of
                    her [Pennsylvania's] products and industry, her material interest alone would
                    render the preservation of the Union from the present assault on it,
                    indispensable to Pennsylvania. She cannot afford to have a foreign power below
                    or above or bounding her on the Delaware, the Chesapeake or the Mississippi, and
                    she will never acquiesce in such a result, no matter what may be the cost in men
                    and money of her resistance to it."</excerpt>

                <summary>This article reprints Governor Curtain's January 8 address to the State
                    Senate and House. Curtain deals with the finances of the state first and then
                    turns to a number of issues surrounding railroad construction and financing. He
                    then spends the bulk of his address discussing Pennsylvania's participation in
                    the war effort. He lauds the patriotism of Pennsylvania volunteers and notes
                    that thus far Pennsylvania has contributed 109,615 men to the cause. He also
                    discusses purchases of armaments by the state and then briefly turns to other
                    state issues.</summary>

                    connected with the paper until two years ago, when he sold his interest to
                    Mengel, and to B.Y. Hamsher, former Clerk of the Courts of the County, a
                    Democrat who was elected in a majority Republican county. Mengel thanks his
                    subscribers for their patronage and assures them that no change will be made in
                    editorial content. The Valley Spirit will continue to speak as the voice of
                    Franklin County Democrats.</summary>

                <excerpt>"We have men--ah, Christian men--in our own county who are as rabid
                    Abolitionists at heart as Loyd Garrison or Wendell Phillips. Some of them even
                    pretend to be followers of the 'meek and lowly Jesus' but in place of preaching
                    the Gospel of 'peace and good will towards man' mistake their calling and
                    exhibit, in and out of the pulpit, the most infuriated spirit of vindictiveness
                    towards the whole Southern portion of their common country."</excerpt>

                <summary>Editorial arguing that, of the two forces seeking to keep the Union apart,
                    abolitionists are far more pernicious than secessionists--the latter are
                    fighting for property, while the former are fighting for a misguided ideal.
                    Abolitionists have become obsessed only with freeing the slaves, regardless of
                    the consequences that freeing African Americans would have on the country. The
                    editorial was prompted by a petition circulating in Franklin county, apparently
                    through the churches, supporting the emancipation of slaves in the Confederacy.</summary>

                <summary>The Festival of the Fayetteville Union Sunday Schools was held on Christmas
                    evening. It consisted of presentations by Rev. Samuel Crawford, Rev. Niccolls,
                    and William Heyser, Esq.; Rev. W.H.R. Deatrich and Rev. Joshua Kennedy also took
                    part in the exercises. The school sang devotional and patriotic songs, the
                    Fayetteville Brass Band played, and a "social chat" was held afterwards. The
                    school was recently reorganized on "broader union principles to embrace all that
                    appreciate and love to work in the duty of giving moral and religious

                <summary>Writes to update readers on activity of 77th Regiment of Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, quartered on the North Bank of the Green River in Kentucky. Jacob
                    Royer, from near Waynesboro in Company A, under the command of Captain McKesson,
                    died; James Ronlet, from near Shippensburg in Company C under the command of
                    Captain McNally also died. Daniel Levanite from Franklin County, in the Battery
                    Company, has been lost but it was not certain if he was drowned or taken
                    prisoner--he was sent out to collect water, and his kettle was found later but
                    no trace of Levanite. Confederate cavalry had been active in the area so it was
                    possible that he was taken prisoner. Generally, the 77th is in good health and
                    spirits, and Slumbaugh says he will make sure soldiers send the remittances due
                    their families.</summary>

                <excerpt>"The disbursements and general duties of the Department of the last year
                    have been largely in excess of any previous year in the history of our state. .
                    . .The arming, equipping and sustaining of such a large force as this by our
                    State has necessarily involved a large expenditure of money and caused the vast
                    increase of labor and expenditure of this Department to which I have alluded."</excerpt>

                <summary>Moore discusses three primary areas of activity of his department: the
                    issuing of state bonds, at 6% interest, to fund the wartime expenditures of the
                    state; the means by which the state will pay the $1.9 million dollar tax levied
                    by the federal government for support of the war effort; and the default of the
                    Wyoming Canal Company on the $281,000 in bonds the state holds. Moore added a
                    commentary on the unjust structure of state tax laws, which, he argues, allowed
                    wealthy holders of bonds, mortgages, and other securities to escape taxation and
                    threw the tax burden onto real property holders.</summary>
