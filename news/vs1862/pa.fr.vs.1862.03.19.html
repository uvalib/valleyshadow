<b>Stirring Address from Hon. James Guthrie</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a speech given by James Guthrie in Louisville, Kentucky on
                    Washington's Birthday. Guthrie advocates granting an amnesty for Confederates
                    who give up their arms and acknowledge the supremacy of the Constitution. As for
                    the leaders of the rebellion, he argues that he would try them before tribunals
                    but would also act in the spirit of forgiveness. He believes that the punishment
                    the leaders will receive from the hands of the people they tricked into joining
                    the rebel cause will be worse than anything the courts could dole out. At the
                    same time, he argues vigorously against a program of confiscation of Confederate
                    property and attacks Republicans in Congress who propose such a course.<br>

<b>Remarks of Hon. John S. Carlisle of Va. on the Confiscation Bill in the U.S.
                    Senate, March 11, 1862</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Senator Carlisle argues against a bill in the Senate that proposes the
                    confiscation of Confederate property, particularly slaves, and the financing of
                    a colonization effort for freed slaves. He states that the war does not suspend
                    Constitutional guarantees of property. He believes that Northern senators who
                    support a confiscation bill are deliberately trying to fan the flames of
                    sectional conflict, and thus are as bad as secessionists. He also adds that he
                    believed an amnesty for all Confederates except the leaders would end the war in
                    ninety days.<br>

<b>Debate in Congress on the President's Emancipation Resolution</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A synopsis of the debate in Congress over Lincoln's March 6 message to
                    Congress, which proposed that the federal government aid states in the gradual
                    emancipation of slaves by compensating slaveholders for their losses. The main
                    speakers featured in the debate were border state congressmen such as Crittenden
                    of Kentucky and Crisfield of Maryland, who argued that the way to conciliate the
                    border states was not to attack their institutions but to leave them alone.<br>

<b>The Union Splitters</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks Lincoln's proposal to emancipate the slaves in border states. The
                    Spirit believes that Lincoln virtually admitted that the Confederacy is a
                    legitimate institution. The paper fears that the administration has thus
                    essentially given up on the cause of reuniting the Union. It goes on to accuse
                    the Republican Party of being satisfied with disunion and quotes a number of
                    statements from Horace Greeley's New York Tribune that support the departure of
                    the Southern states. Greeley's opinion can be taken to represent Republican
                    opinion, argues the editorial, and thus voters should look to Democrats as the
                    true party of the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Presidents [sic] late emancipation message squints very strongly towards
                        a recognition of the Southern Confederacy. His idea appears to be to
                        emancipate the slaves in order to prevent the border States joining the
                        "disaffected region" when its independence is acknowledged. That we may not
                        be accused of misrepresentation we give his own language and if it will bear
                        any other construction we are unable to see it:</p>
                    <p>"The leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the hope that the
                        Government will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of some
                        part of the disaffected region, and that all the Slave States north of such
                        parts will then say the Union for which we have struggled being already
                        gone, we now choose to go with the southern section."</p>
                    <p>And again:</p>
                    <p>"The point is, not that all the States tolerating slavery would very soon, if
                        at all, initiate emancipation, but that while the offer, is equally made to
                        all, the more Northern shall by such initiation, make it certain to the more
                        Southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in their
                        proposed Confederacy."</p>
                    <p>Is this not virtually admitting that the Southern Confederacy is already a
                        fixed institution, and holding out a bribe ("pecuniary
                            aid," the President calls it,) to prevent the Borders from going
                        along with the Cotton States? If it has come to this that we are no longer
                        fighting for the preservation of the Union we had better disband our armies,
                        there is no use fighting if the restoration of the Union is not the object
                        of the war.</p>
                    <p>To any one who has watched the course of the Republican party it must be
                        apparent that a dissolution of the union is the object and result for which
                        that party has long labored and is still laboring. For years previous to the
                        outbreak of this rebellion it made no concealment of its hostility to the
                        Constitution and the Union. Their party shibboleth has been to "let the
                        Union slide" unless Abolitionism can have full sway over the land. These
                        Abolition Secessionists, under the sacred cry of preserving the Union are
                        plotting its overthrow, and determined to drive the two sections so far
                        apart that reconstruction will be impossible. Their very party organization,
                        upon a sectional basis, was, as Washington foretold it would be in his
                        Farewell Address, a proposition for the dissolution of the Union. The great
                        head of the Republican party is an avowed secessionist. Greeley has time and
                        again through the New York Tribune advocated the
                        destruction of the Union. We make a few short extracts from his paper to
                        show that we do not misrepresent him or the treasonous principles of his
                        party:</p>
                    <p>"If the Cotton States unitedly and earnestly wish to withdraw peacefully from
                        the Union, we think they should, and would be, allowed to do so. Any attempt to compel them by force to remain would be
                            contrary to the principles enunciated in the immortal Declaration of
                            Independence--contrary to the fundamental ideas on which human liberty
                            is based."--N. Y. Tribune</p>
                    <p>We quote another specimen of the Tribune's
                        disunion doctrine:</p>
                    <p>"If the cotton States shall become satisfied that they can do better out of
                        the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in
                            peace. The right to secede may be a revolutionary one, but it exists
                            nevertheless."--N. Y. Tribune</p>
                    <p>Here is another sample a little stronger still:</p>
                    <p>"We must ever resist the right of any State to remain in the Union and
                        nullify or defy the laws thereof. To withdraw from the
                            Union is quite another matter; and whenever a considerable section of
                            our Union shall deliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all
                            coercive measures designed to keep it in. We hope never to live
                        in a republic whereof one section is pinned to another by bayonets."--N. Y. Tribune.</p>
                    <p>The reader would weary if we republished one in a hundred of GREELEY'S
                        disunion articles. We give another sample of Abolition Secessionism and that
                        must suffice for the time:</p>
                    <p>"If it (the Declaration of Independence) justified the secession from the
                        British empire of three millions of colonists in 1776, we do not see why it
                        would not justify the secession of five millions of Southrons [sic] from the
                        Union in 1861." --N. Y. Tribune</p>
                    <p>Such is the position of the Republican party. It favored secession and urged
                        the South out of the Union until it brought about civil war, but when it
                        found a party in the North powerful enough to resist its fiendish work, it
                        brimmed its sails to catch the popular breeze, set up a hypocritical howl
                        for the Union, and is now the most loud mouthed in yelping "traitor" to
                        cover up, and draw public attention from, their own misdeeds.</p>
                    <p>We need waste no more time or space to prove the hostility of the Republican
                        party to the Union, everybody knows that such has been the determined object
                        of that party for thirty years past, and now having discovered that "war is
                        disunion" it is ready to recognize the Southern Confederacy and prepare for
                        an eternal separation. These are the traitors--and such is their treason!
                        The only hope to save the Union is in the patriotic action of the Democratic
                        party. That party will stand by the Constitution and the Union and crush out
                        treason to the Government North and South. The principles that triumphed at
                        the adoption of the Constitution are still the principles of the party--the
                        equality of the States and their right to regulate their own domestic
                        government. On no other ground can the Union be restored and preserved. The
                        Republican disunionists know this, and hence their thief-cry of 'traitor'
                        against the old life-guard of the Union--the Democratic party.</p>

                        short of getting their author to re-write them. It would be cruel to inflict

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Frederick Douglas [sic], free person of color, has been enlightening the
                        benighted people of Boston in a lecture upon what ought to be done with the
                        everlasting nigger. We should state the subject more properly, perhaps, by
                        saying it was about what ought to be done with them. As, for instance, he
                        ought not to be permitted to remain in slavery, and the government ought not
                        to let the chance pass to proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the
                        inhabitants thereof. But the great end of Fred. Douglass' lecture was to
                        show that colonization was a humbug. He proved, or at least tried to prove,
                        that colonization was unjust, impolitic and inexpedient. And this is the
                        doctrine of the ultra abolition fanatics. They don't want the four million
                        slaves of the south sent out of the country after being freed, but desire
                        that they shall go north and participate in the blessings of all the
                        civilization of that region. Fred. Douglass says that slaves have the will,
                        the capacity and the power to rise to the highest positions among the
                        whites, and he for one, backed by a large number of other abolitionists, is
                        in favor of giving them a chance to exhibit their equality. These harangues
                        don't hurt any body, and are not gaining many proselytes just now.--Missouri Republican.</p>
