<b>First Annual Message of Andrew G. Curtain, Governor of Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reprints Governor Curtain's January 8 address to the State
                    Senate and House. Curtain deals with the finances of the state first and then
                    turns to a number of issues surrounding railroad construction and financing. He
                    then spends the bulk of his address discussing Pennsylvania's participation in
                    the war effort. He lauds the patriotism of Pennsylvania volunteers and notes
                    that thus far Pennsylvania has contributed 109,615 men to the cause. He also
                    discusses purchases of armaments by the state and then briefly turns to other
                    state issues.<br>

<b>To The Public</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>George H. Mengel has sold the Valley Spirit to P.S. Dechert, who had been
                    connected with the paper until two years ago, when he sold his interest to
                    Mengel, and to B.Y. Hamsher, former Clerk of the Courts of the County, a
                    Democrat who was elected in a majority Republican county. Mengel thanks his
                    subscribers for their patronage and assures them that no change will be made in
                    editorial content. The Valley Spirit will continue to speak as the voice of
                    Franklin County Democrats.<br>(Names in announcement:  P.S. Dechert,  B.Y. Hamsher,  George H. Mengel)</blockquote>
<b>To the Patrons of the Valley Spirit</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The new owners assure readers that the Valley Spirit will continue to speak
                    for the Democratic party and they ask for a special show of support from its
                    readers. They also promise to make needed improvements.<br>(Names in announcement:  P.S. Dechert,  B.Y. Hamsher,  George H. Mengel)</blockquote>
<b>The Abolitionists at Work</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial arguing that, of the two forces seeking to keep the Union apart,
                    abolitionists are far more pernicious than secessionists--the latter are
                    fighting for property, while the former are fighting for a misguided ideal.
                    Abolitionists have become obsessed only with freeing the slaves, regardless of
                    the consequences that freeing African Americans would have on the country. The
                    editorial was prompted by a petition circulating in Franklin county, apparently
                    through the churches, supporting the emancipation of slaves in the Confederacy.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Proclaims that the state Democratic party has never enjoyed such good
                    organization at the State House, despite losing control of the House, since it
                    was the regular Democrats' refusal to cooperate with "fishy" Union Democrats
                    which brought about their defeat. The party was now free of "impure elements"
                    and is poised for victory in the future.<br>

<b>Letter from the 77th Regiment</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Writes to update readers on activity of 77th Regiment of Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, quartered on the North Bank of the Green River in Kentucky. Jacob
                    Royer, from near Waynesboro in Company A, under the command of Captain McKesson,
                    died; James Ronlet, from near Shippensburg in Company C under the command of
                    Captain McNally also died. Daniel Levanite from Franklin County, in the Battery
                    Company, has been lost but it was not certain if he was drowned or taken
                    prisoner--he was sent out to collect water, and his kettle was found later but
                    no trace of Levanite. Confederate cavalry had been active in the area so it was
                    possible that he was taken prisoner. Generally, the 77th is in good health and
                    spirits, and Slumbaugh says he will make sure soldiers send the remittances due
                    their families.<br>(Names in announcement:  Jacob Royer,  James Ronlet,  Daniel Levanite)</blockquote>

<b>Annual Report of Henry D. Moore, State Treasurer</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Moore discusses three primary areas of activity of his department: the
                    issuing of state bonds, at 6% interest, to fund the wartime expenditures of the
                    state; the means by which the state will pay the $1.9 million dollar tax levied
                    by the federal government for support of the war effort; and the default of the
                    Wyoming Canal Company on the $281,000 in bonds the state holds. Moore added a
                    commentary on the unjust structure of state tax laws, which, he argues, allowed
                    wealthy holders of bonds, mortgages, and other securities to escape taxation and
                    threw the tax burden onto real property holders.<br>
