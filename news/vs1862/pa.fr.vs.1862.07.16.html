<b>The Constitution--An Oration Delivered by Hon. George T. Curtis</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A speech given in Boston on the Fourth of July by George T. Curtis, which
                    lays out his defense of the Constitution and states' rights. Without either of
                    these, he argues, the republican form of government would be threatened--one by
                    losing the bounds within which the government operates, and the other by
                    weakening the local governments, which counter the tyranny of large governments.<br>

                    and the war must be fought solely to restore the Union. All those who argue that

<b>Army Correspondence</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from Company I, 9th Regiment of Pennsylvania Cavalry, stationed in
                    Mumfordsville, Kentucky. Several Franklin County men are soldiers in the
                    company, and the author writes to describe their exploits. In late May, on an
                    expedition to capture enemy raiders, several pickets, including C. J. Eckenrode
                    and F. A. Culberson of Franklin County encountered and engaged the enemy. The
                    company eventually defeated a Confederate force of twice its size, though the
                    skirmish resulted in the death of the company commander and the wounding of a
                    Franklin County soldier, James Woods. He was shot between the soldiers with the
                    ball coming out the other side. Franklin County men include a number of men from
                    the "upper school district in Amberson's Valley," (Conrad Eckenrode, J. S.
                    Eckenrode, Johnathan Shearer, Johnathan Piper, Martin Piper--who died in the

                    and James C. Shields), as well as men from Path Valley (James Wood and David
                    Clippinger), and men from Roxbury (Fred Culberson, Joseph Timmons, James
                    Laughlin).<br>(Names in announcement:  Conrad J. Eckenrode,  S. J. Eckenrode,  Johnathan Shearer,  Jonathan Piper,  Martin Piper,  Smith V. Syock,  Joseph McVitry,  James C. Shields,  James Wood,  David Clippinger,  Fred Culberson,  Joseph Timmons,  James Laughlin)</blockquote>

                    captured several actual deserters and arrested a number of people dressed in
                    uniforms left over from their three months' service. The editors recommend that
                    the government prohibit the wearing of a uniform after a term of service.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A squad of Cavalry dashed into this place last week, and remained a few days
                        hunting up deserters. They captured several actual deserters, and arrested
                        quite a number of persons dressed in soldiers clothes, who have been keeping
                        up a military reputation on their three months shoddy that they were very
                        anxious to drop as soon as arrested. It would be a good idea if the
                        Government would prohibit the wearing of a soldiers uniform, or any part of
                        a uniform, by any one not in actual service. These stay-at-home patriots who
                        are so fond of aping the soldier, would have their vanity brought down a peg
                        by such a wholesome regulation.</p>
