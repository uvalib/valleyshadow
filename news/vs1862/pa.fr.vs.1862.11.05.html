                    </p>
                    <p>General--In forwarding the report of Major General Stuart of his expedition
                        into Pennsylvania. I take occasion to express to the department my sense of
                        the boldness, judgment and prudence he displayed in its execution, and
                        cordially join with him in his commendations of the conduct and endurance of
                        the brave men he commanded. To his skill and their fortitude, under the
                        guidance of an overruling Providence, is their success due. I have the honor
                        to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant.</p>
                    <p>R. E. LEE, General.</p>

                        <br>
                        Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, Commanding Cavalry:
                    </p>
                    <p>General--An expedition into Maryland with a detachment of cavalry, if it can
                        be successfully executed, is at this time desirable. You will, therefore,
                        for a detachment of from twelve to fifteen hundred well mounted men,
                        suitable for such an expedition, and should the information from your scouts
                        lead you to suppose that your movement can be concealed from bodies of the
                        enemy that would be able to resist it, you are desired to cross the Potomac
                        above Williamsport, leave Hagerstown and Greencastle on your right, and
                        proceed to the rear of Chambersburg, and endeavor to destroy the railroad
                        bridge over the branch of the Conococheagne.</p>
                    <p>Any other damage that you can inflict upon the enemy or his means of
                        transportation you will also execute. You are desired to gain all
                        information of the position, force and probable intent of the enemy which
                        you can, and in your progress into Pennsylvania you will take measures to
                        inform yourself of the various routes that you may take on your return to
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>To keep your movement secret it will be necessary for you to arrest all
                        citizens that may give information to the enemy; and should you meet with
                        citizens of Pennsylvania holding State or government offices, it will be
                        desirable, if convenient, to bring them with you, that they may be used as
                        hostages, or the means of exchange for our own citizens that have been
                        carried off by the enemy. Such persons will, of course, be treated with all
                        the respect and consideration that circumstances will admit.</p>
                    <p>Should it be in your power to supply yourself with horses, or other necessary
                        articles on the list of legal capture, you are authorised to do so.</p>
                    <p>Having accomplished your errand you will rejoin this army as soon as
                        practicable. Reliance is placed upon your skill and judgment in the
                        successful execution of this plan, and it is not intended or desired that
                        you should jeopardize the safety of your command, or go farther than your
                        good judgment and prudence may dictate.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Imboden has been desired to attract the attention of the enemy
                        towards Cumberland, so that the river between that point and where you may
                        recross may be less guarded. You will, of course, keep out your scouts to
                        give you information, and take every other precaution to secure the success
                        and safety of the expedition.</p>
                    <p>Should you be led so far east as to make it better in your opinion, to
                        continue around to the Potomac, you will have to cross the river in the
                        vicinity of Leesburg.</p>
                    <p>I am, with great respect, your ob't serv't.</p>
                    <p>R. E. Lee, General. <br>Official: R. H. Chilton, A. A. General.</p>
                    <p>Stuart's Appeal to His Soldiers.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters. Cavalry Division, <br>October 9th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Soldiers--You are about to engage in an enterprise which, to insure success,
                        imperatively [sic] demands at your hands coolness, decision and
                        bravery--implicit obedience to orders, without question or cavil, and the
                        strictest order and sobriety on the march and in bivouac.</p>
                    <p>The destination and extent of this expedition had better be kept to myself
                        than known to you. Suffice it to say that, with the hearty co-operation of
                        officers and men, I have not a doubt of its success which will reflect
                        credit in the highest degree upon your arms.</p>
                    <p>The orders which are hereby published for your government are absolutely
                        necessary and must be rigidly enforced.</p>
                    <p>J. E. B. Stuart, <br>Major-General Commanding.</p>
                    <p>Stuart's Report of the Affair.</p>
                    <p>Order--No. 13.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, Cavalry Division, <br>October 9th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>During the expedition into the enemy's country, on which this command about
                        to engage brigade commanders will make arrangements for seizing horses, the
                        property of citizens of the United States, and all other property subject to
                        legal capture, provided that in no case will any species of property be
                        taken except by authority given in person or in writing of the commander of
                        brigade, regiment, or captain of a company, in the absence of his superior
                        officers. In all cases a simple receipt will be given, to the effect that
                        the article is seized for the use of the Confederate States, giving place,
                        date and name of owners, in order to enable the individual to have recourse
                        upon his government for damage.</p>
                    <p>Individual plunder for private use is positively forbidden, and every
                        instance must be punished in the severest manner, for an army of plunderers
                        consummates its own destruction. The capture of anything will not give the
                        captor any individual claim, and all horses and equipments will be kept to
                        be apportioned upon the return of the expedition through the entire
                        division. Brigade commanders will arrange to to [sic] have one-third of
                        their respective commands engaged in leading horses, provided enough can be
                        procured, each man linking so as to led three horses: the led horses being
                        habitually in the centre of the brigade, and the remaining two-thirds will
                        keep, at all times, prepared for action.</p>
                    <p>The attack, when made, must be vigorous and overwhelming, giving the enemy no
                        time to reconnoiter or consider anything, except his best means of flight.
                        All persons found in transit must be detained, subject to the orders of the
                        Division Provost Marshal, to prevent information reaching the enemy. As a
                        measure of justice to our many good citizens who, without crime, have been
                        taken from their homes and kept by the enemy in prison, all public
                        functionaries--such as magistrates, postmasters sheriffs, &amp;c.--will
                        be seized as prisoners. They will be kindly treated and kept as hostages for
                        our own. No straggling from the route of march or bivouac for the purpose of
                        obtaining provisions, &amp;c., will be permitted in any case, the
                        commissaries and quartermasters being required to obtain and furnish all
                        such supplies in bulk as may be necessary.</p>
                    <p>So much of this order as authorizes the seizures of persons and property will
                        not take effect until the command crosses the Pennsylvania line.</p>
                    <p>The utmost activity is enjoined upon the detachments procuring horses, and
                        unceasing vigilance upon the entire command.</p>
                    <p>Major J. P. W. Hairston is hereby appointed Division Provost Marshal. By
                        command of</p>
                    <p>Major General J. E. B. Stuart <br>R. C. Price, First Lieutenant and A. D. C.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Headquarters Cavalry Division, <br>October 14th, 1862. <br>Col. R. H. Chilton, A. A. Gen. Army North'n Va:</p>
                    <p>Colonel--I have the honor to report that on the 9th inst., in compliance with
                        instructions from the Commanding General Army Northern Virginia, I proceeded
                        on an expedition into Pennsylvania with a cavalry force of 1,800 and four
                        pieces of horse artillery, under command of Brigadier General Hampton and
                        Colonels W. H. F. Lee and Jones. This force rendezvoused at Darksville at
                        twelve M. and marched thence to the vicinity of Hedgesville, where it
                        encamped for the night. At daylight next morning (October 10) I crossed the
                        Potomac at McCoy's, between Williamsport and Hancock, with some little
                        opposition, capturing two or three horses of the enemy's pickets. We were
                        told here by the citizens that a large force had camped the night before at
                        Clear Spring, and were supposed to be en route to
                        Cumberland. We proceeded northward until we reached the turnpike leading
                        from Hagerstown to Hancock, known as the National road. Here was a signal
                        station on the mountain, and most of the party, with their flags and
                        apparatus, were supprised [sic] and captured, and also eight or ten
                        prisoners of war from whom, as well as from the citizens, I found that a
                        large force alluded to had crossed but an hour ahead of me, towards
                        Cumberland and consisted of six regiments of Ohio troops and two batteries,
                        under Gen. Cox, and were en route, via
                        Cumberland, for the Kanawha. I sent back this intelligence at once to the
                        Commanding General. Striking directly across the Nation road, I proceeded in
                        the direction of Mercersburg, Pa., which point was reached about noon. I was
                        extremely anxious to reach Hagerstown, where large supplies were stored, but
                        was satisfied, from reliable information, that the notice the enemy had of
                        my approach, and the proximity of his forces, would enable him to prevent my
                        capturing it. I therefore turned towards Chambersburg. I did not reach this
                        point till after dark, in a rain. I did not deem it safe to defer the attack
                        till morning, nor was it proper to attack a place full of women and children
                        without summoning it first to surrender. I accordingly sent in a flag of
                        truce, and found no military or civil authority in the place; but some
                        prominent citizens who met the officer were notified that the place would be
                        occupied, and if any resistance were made the place would be shelled in
                        three minutes. Brigadier Wade Hampton's command being in the advance, took
                        possession of the place, and I appointed him Military Governor of the city.
                        No incidents occurred during the night, during which it rained
                        continuously.--The officials all fled the town on our approach, and no one
                        could be found who would admit that he held office in the place. About 275
                        sick and wounded in the hospitals were paroled. During the day a large
                        number of horses of citizens were seized and brought along. The wires were
                        cut, and railroads obstructed. Next morning it was ascertained that a large
                        number of small arms and munitions of war were stored about the railroad
                        buildings, of which that could not be easily brought away were destroyed,
                        consisting of about five thousand new muskets, pistols, sabres, amunition
                        [sic]; also, a large assortment of army clothing. The extensive machine
                        shops and depot buildings of the railroad, and several trains of loaded
                        cars, were entirely destroyed. From Chambersburg I decided, after mature
                        consideration, to strike for the vicinity of Leesburg, as the best route of
                        return, particularly as Cox's command would have rendered the direction of
                        Cumberland, full of mountain gorges, particularly hazardous. The route
                        selected was through an open country. Of course I left nothing undone to
                        prevent the inhabitants from detecting my real route and object. I started
                        directly towards Gettysburg, but having passed the Blue Ridge, turned back
                        towards Hagerstown for six or eight miles, and then crossed to Maryland by
                        Emmettsburg, where, as we passed, we were hailed by the inhabitants with the
                        most enthusiastic demonstrations of joy. A scouting party of 150 lancers had
                        just passed towards Gettysburg, and I regret exceeding that my march did not
                        admit of the delay necessary to catch them. Taking the road towards
                        Frederick, we intercepted dispatches from Colonel Rush (lancers) to the
                        commander of the scout which satisfied me that our whereabouts was still a
                        problem to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Before reaching Frederick, I crossed the Monocacy, continued the march
                        through the night, via Liberty, New Market, Monrovia on the Baltimore and
                        Ohio Railroad, where we cut the telegraph wires and obstructed the railroad.
                        We reached, at daylight Hayattstown on McClellan's line of wagon
                        communication with Washington, but we found only a few wagons to capture,
                        and pushed on to Barnesville, which we found just vacated by a company of
                        the enemy's cavalry. We had here corroborated what we had heard before, that
                        Stoneman had between 4,000 and 5,000 troops about Poolesville and guarding
                        the river fords. I started directly for Poolesville, but instead of marching
                        through the woods, leaving it two or three miles to my left, and getting
                        into the road from Poolesville to the month of the Monocacy. Guarding well
                        my flanks and rear, I pushed boldly forward, meeting the head of the enemy's
                        column going towards Poolesville. I ordered the charge, which was responded
                        to in handsome style by the advance squadron (Irving's) of Lee's brigade,
                        which drove back the enemy's cavalry upon the column of infantry advancing
                        to occupy the crest from which the cavalry were driven. Quick as thought
                        Lee's sharpshooters sprang to the ground, and, engaging the infantry
                        skirmishers, held them in check till the artillery advance came up, which,
                        under the gallant Pelham, drove back the enemy's cavalry upon the column of
                        infantry advancing to occupy the crest from which the cavalry were driven.
                        Quick as thought Lee's sharpshooters sprang to the ground, and, engaging the
                        infantry skirmishers, held them in check till the artillery advance came up,
                        which, under the gallant Pelham, drove back the enemy's force to his
                        batteries beyond the Monocacy, between which and our solitary gun quite a
                        spirited fire continued for some time. This answered, in connection with the
                        high crest occupied by our piece, to screen entirely my real movement
                        quickly to the left making a bold and rapid stride for White's Ford, to make
                        my way across before the enemy at Poolesville and Monocacy could be aware of
                        my design. Although delayed somewhat by about two hundred infantry, strongly
                        posted in the cliffs over the ford, yet they yielded to the moral effect of
                        a few shells before engaging our sharp shooters, and the crossing of the
                        canal (now dry) and river was affected with all the precision of passing a
                        defile on drill. A section of artillery being sent with the advance and
                        placed in position on the Loudon side, another piece on the Maryland height,
                        while Pelham continued to occupy the attention of the enemy with the other,
                        withdrawing from position to position until he was ordered to cross. The
                        enemy was marching from Poolesville in the meantime, but came up in line of
                        battle on the Maryland height, while Pelman continued to occupy the
                        attention of the enemy with the other, withdrawing from position to position
                        until he was ordered to cross. The enemy was marching from Poolesville in
                        the meantime, but came up in line of battle on the Maryland bank only to
                        receive a thundering salutation with evident effect, from our guns on this
                        side. I lost not a man killed on the expedition, and only a few slight
                        wounds. The enemy's loss is not know; but Pelham's one gun compelled the
                        enemy's battery to change its position three times. The remainder of the
                        march was destitute of interest. The conduct of the command and their
                        behavior towards the inhabitants is worthy the highest praise; a few
                        individual cases only were exceptions in this particular.</p>
                    <p>Brigadier General Hampton and Colonels Lee, Jones, Wickham and Butler, and
                        the officers under their command, are entitled to my lasting gratitude for
                        their coolness in danger and cheerful obedience to orders. Unoffending
                        persons were treated with civility, and the inhabitants were generous in
                        profers [sic] of provision on the march. We seized and brought over a large
                        number of horses, the property of citizens of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The valuable information obtained in this reconnoissance [sic] as to the
                        distribution of the enemy's force was communicated orally to the Commanding
                        General, and need not be here repeated. A number of public functionaries and
                        prominent citizens whom the enemy has torn from their homes and confined in
                        dungeons in the North. One or two of my men lost their way and are probably
                        in the hands of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>The results of this expedition, in a moral and political point of view, can
                        hardly be estimated, and consternation among property holders in
                        Pennsylvania beggars description.</p>
                    <p>I enclose a map of the expedition, drawn by Capt. W. W. Blackford, to
                        accompany this report. Also, a copy of orders enforced during the march.</p>
                    <p>Believing that the hand of God was clearly manifested in the signal
                        deliverance of my command from danger, and the crowning successes attending
                        it, I ascribe to Him the praise, the honor and the glory.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant.</p>

<b>The Restoration of the Union</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Celebrates the recent Democratic electoral triumphs in the border states
                    and argues that it sends a welcome sign to Southern Unionists. They must now,
                    say the editors, rise up and dispose of Jefferson Davis, while the North breaks
                    the Confederacy's military power. Abolitionism has made the chances of reunion
                    less likely, and President Lincoln should heed the warning and see that if he
                    does not change his policies, the "days of our country as a united nation are
                    numbered."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The result of the recent elections in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana is a
                        happy omen in favor of the restoration of the Union and the future
                        happiness, prosperity and greatness of a common country. Its effect upon the
                        Union cause in the South will be immense. Thousands of Union men in the
                        Southern States who still love the old Government and the old flag, but who
                        have been commanded into silence by the despotism of Jeff. Davis &amp;
                        Co., will hail with unmingled joy the news of these victories in the North,
                        of conservatism and Constitutional principles over fanaticism and error. It
                        will convince them that the people of the free States are not all
                        Abolitionists and that there is yet hope of a re-construction of the Union
                        upon the broad principles of the Constitution, where the rights and
                        privileges of all the citizens of all the States shall be respected and
                        protected as guaranteed and defined in that instrument. It will encourage
                        them to cling to the faith which they have so long in silence cherished in
                        their hearts, and which, through the madness and folly of those in power at
                        Washington, many have forsaken and gone over to the enemy. It will stimulate
                        them to active exertions in behalf of the Union when the hour of their
                        redemption arrives and enable them, in course of time, to rally a powerful
                        Union party in their respective States, turn the minions of Jeff. Davis out
                        of power and bring the States back into the Union through the voluntary
                        action of their own people.--This is the only feasible plan of restoring the
                        Union and the only way in which it can be
                        restored. Break the military power of the "Confederacy" by the strong arm of
                        the Federal Government--the army and navy--punish the leaders, pursue a
                        wise, moderate and conciliatory policy towards the people of the seceded States, guarantee them protection in their
                        Constitutional rights, convince them by such a course that they have been
                        deceived and imposed upon by the leaders who precipitated this rebellion
                        upon the country, and you can restore this Union, and you can do it no other
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Let the administration of Mr. Lincoln and others in authority, listen to the
                        voice of the people, as well as the voice of reason and of common sense. Let
                        them abandon the radical and unconstitutional measures which they have urged
                        upon the country during the past year; let them change their line of policy
                        in accordance with the course we have indicated, and be guided strictly by
                        the letter and spirit of the Constitution, independent of sectional
                        prejudices and partisan considerations, and our eyes may yet behold but one
                        Constitution, one country and one destiny."</p>
                    <p>All the confiscation and emancipation schemes that have been urged with so
                        much pertinacity by the Abolitionists, are sheer madness. Apart from their
                        unconstitutionality they are inexpedient, and instead of tending to restore
                        the Union, their tendency has been and must continue to be still further to
                        widen must continue to be still further to widen the breach between the two
                        hostile sections of the country and render their reunion an utter
                        impossibility. This policy has produced evils enough already and caused the
                        country to drink of its bitter fruits to very dregs. It has turned thousands
                        against us in the South who would otherwise have been with us. It has
                        verified the predictions of the Secessionists that the Republican party
                        intended a war upon the Constitutional rights of the Southern people. It has
                        made good the chief argument of the rebel leaders by which they were enabled
                        to carry the people with them. Instead of endeavoring to convince the people
                        of the South that they were deceived and imposed upon by their leaders, and
                        thereby weaken their cause, our rulers at Washington pursued just the
                        opposite course and did everything that was calculated to consolidate,
                        strengthen and give permanency to the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Such has been the policy of the party in power. It is high time that it were
                        changed to a more wise, rational and feasible policy. If this be done and
                        done quickly, we may yet hope to see our beloved country emerge from her
                        present calamaties [sic] to a future of peace, prosperity, greatness and
                        glory. If it be not done then we fear that the days of our country as a
                        united nation are numbered, and we can see nothing in the future but anarchy
                        and strife ending in the total subversion of our republican institutions and
                        the establishment of a military despotism, more despotic and arbitrary than
                        the most tyrannical Government of Europe. Will President Lincoln take
                        warning and save the country while it may yet be saved? We sincerely hope
                        so.</p>

                    attacks an unnamed Franklin County politician who had switched from the
                    Democratic to the Republican party. Once in office, though, says the Dispatch,
                    he turned around and began associating with Democrats again. The editors of the
