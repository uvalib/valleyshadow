                    <p>Alexandria, Va., Sept. 7th, 1862</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: Since my former letter to you, I have learned of another sad
                        casualty of Saturday's battle, near Bull Run. From the most reliable
                        information that can be gathered, it seems safe to assert that Capt. Mark
                        Kerns, of Battery B, First Pennsylvania Artillery, is no more. He was
                        wounded severely in the head and arm, and, with two others, placed on a
                        caisson. Shortly afterwards a heavy shot struck the caisson battering it to
                        pieces, and our forces immediately falling back, nothing further was heard
                        of Kerns and his companions. With unflinching bravery he defended his guns
                        to the last, when the infantry which should have sustained him, had fallen
                        to the rear. His battery and that formerly commanded by the lamented Easton,
                        won laurels that day, the men holding their ground until they were sabred at
                        their posts. If the infantry had done half as well as the artillery the day
                        would have been ours. But poor Kerns fell while gallantly doing his duty.
                        Thus another brave spirit has left us the life of another martyr offered up
                        on the altar of the country--another household in your midst made desolate
                        by the fearful ravages of this unhallowed rebellion. God grant that speedy
                        vengeance may be visited upon its authors and those who seek to prolong it:
                        and may the day soon come when these revolting scenes of blood and carnage
                        shall be known only as things of the past!</p>
                    <p>Sunday, Sept. 7th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Have just returned from camp, and have only time to write a line. This
                        morning our Brigade took up its line of march for the vicinity of the Chain
                        Bridge, six miles above Washington. In all probability we will advance up
                        the Potomac on the Maryland side, and may soon be in the vicinity of our
                        homes. I think the boys would be able to do some fine fighting between
                        Franklin county and the Potomac, to protect their homes and firesides from
                        the ruthless tread of the invader. This morning's Washington <emph
                            rend="italic">Chronicle</emph> contains what purports to be reliable
                        accounts of a rebel invasion of Maryland; but, although we have had rumors
                        to this effect for several days, much confidence is not placed in any of
                        them. However, there can be no doubt some such movement will be made, and
                        that very soon.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. Mr. Niccolls arrived in camp yesterday to fill his position as
                        chaplain of the 126th. He looks remarkably well in his regimentals, and, I
                        venture to predict, without any exaggeration, that he will be one of the
                        most popular and useful Chaplain in the service. Although the officers
                        insisted on his using one of their horses, this morning, he emphatically
                        refused all their offers, and started off on his first ten miles march.</p>
                    <p>I, last evening, met Lieut. Wm. Burgess, of the 6th Reserves who has just
                        arrived from the Peninsula in charge of an ambulance train. He is enjoying
                        excellent health and joined his regiment this morning. Lieut. Geo. Cook, of
                        Co. K. 107th Pa., has been in town for several weeks, quite ill with fever,
                        but again has joined his company. Dr. Lane, Capt. Eyster, privates John A.
                        Smith and Peter Cummings of Easten's battery, and Jacob Noel of the 107th,
                        have all paid us visits--and all are looking the very pictures of health.</p>

                    <p>Near Fort Albany, Va., <lb/>September 12th, 1862.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Messrs Editors:</emph> After some deliberation, I have
                        finally concluded to give you a letter, this week; though from the present
                        interrupted state of travel and of the mails, it is doubtful whether it will
                        reach you in time; and it is also by no means certain that "Stonewall"
                        Jackson will allow you to publish it, or indeed to issue any paper at all.
                        We have already had him at Hagerstown, Chambersburg, Gettysburg and York,
                        perpetrating the most revolting and fiendish barbarities; though from the
                        latest and most reliable information it now seems doubtful whether he has
                        yet paid his respects to the people of either of those places. But he
                        doubtless will before he re-crosses the Potomac, and when he does, we of the
                        126th want those we have left behind to give him a warm reception, a
                        greeting worthy of Franklin County. Surely those who have done so nobly in
                        furnishing their fathers and sons and brothers and friends to swell the army
                        of the Union, should have brave hearts and strong right arms enough among
                        them to drive the invaders from their soil, as did their fathers before
                        them. Yes, People of Franklin County, you have already done well but now
                        still more solemn duties are upon you! Make every hill top a fortification,
                        and every valley a rebel burying ground before you yield your Liberties and
                        your Government. think of your brothers already in the field, think of your
                        families, your properties and your lives, and, under the sacred impulse of
                        all these ties, strike a deadly blow at your powerful and desperate enemy.</p>
                    <p>"Strike till the last armed foe expires! <lb/>Strike for your altars and your
                        fires! <lb/>Strike for the green graves of your sires! <lb/>God and your
                        native land!"</p>
                    <p>We are all anxious to be with you, in this hour of trial; and on our native
                        hills, defending our homes against a foreign foe, it is not too much to say
                        that every man would doubly do his duty; but it is otherwise ordered, and
                        you and your neighbors must, in a great measure, rely upon yourselves. You
                        have all we can give--our hopes and our prayers. Let every man do his duty,
                        and then, whatever be the result, you will at least have no cause to
                        reproach yourselves.</p>
                    <p>Our brigade had a long and excessively tiresome march last Sunday. We were
                        ordered to go to the Chain Bridge, a distance of about ten miles, but when a
                        short distance beyond Washington, the order was countermanded and we were
                        marched back to the vicinity of Fort Albany, near our first camp on the
                        "sacred soil," about three miles from Washington. Here we have been lying
                        ever since, and are likely to remain for some time. Many of the veteran
                        troops have been withdrawn from this side of the Potomac, to pay their
                        compliments to Jackson and Hill, and we are now in the front where the
                        chances are we may see some active service, should any demonstration be made
                        on the Capital, which is considered very probable in high quarters. Our
                        pickets and those of the enemy are almost within speaking distance; and we
                        are kept constantly prepared for battle. Of course it would be unproper to
                        give any intimation of the strength of our army in this locality, but one
                        thing I may say with the assistance of the Forts, we will be able to repel
                        any advance whatever. The general impression seems to be that there is no
                        very heavy rebel force now before us, a sufficient number only remaining to
                        keep up appearances. Yet, the military authorities have taken the precaution
                        to be on the safe side and are prepared for the worst. During the absence of
                        General McClellan, General Banks has command of the Forts and the army
                        around Washington--Gen. Popes, to the extreme satisfaction of the entire
                        army, having taken his departure for the far West, to hold the rebels in
                        check, which, it is to be hoped, he is better qualified for doing than for
                        commanding a grand army, opposed by a most cunning, wiley and determined
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of Gen. Pope, I can not refrain from alluding to the general
                        satisfaction manifested, throughout the whole army, at the reinstatement of
                        McClellan as Commander in Chief of the armies of "Virginia" and "The
                        Potomac." I always believed "little Mac" to be popular with his men, but had
                        no idea the enthusiasm for him was so intense as it is until I learned it
                        from the mouths of the very men who have served under him, and who have
                        shared with him his trials and his triumphs. Many of them declared, on their
                        way to Manassas, that they would fight under no one else; and the sequel of
                        those disastrous engagements gives occasion to say had he been in command,
                        as he was justly entitled to be, the result might have been different. How
                        nobly has McClellan behaved, too, during his relentless persecutions of the
                        last year. Never remonstrating as his command is, time after time, abridged;
                        never deigning to reply to the unjustifiable assaults made upon his ability
                        as a soldier or his integrity as a patriot; but all the time pursuing the
                        even path of duty, trusting alone to history and the near future to do him
                        justice. And how soon have the scales swung around! As soon as he had landed
                        his army at Alexandria and Acquia Creek, it is ordered to report at once to
                        Pope, and he is left with scarcely a nominal command, when the most
                        important battle of the war is to be fought. Yet he never once complains,
                        and even voluntarily, furnishes his body guard to protect an am[m]unition
                        train bound to the front, and remains, with only his staff around him, in
                        the rear, compelled to sit idly by and listen to the sound of the enemy's
                        cannon as they mowed down our loyal legions. But the hour of his vindication
                        had arrived; under bad leaders our forces had been miserably maneuvered,
                        were defeated at all points and were falling back within their
                        entrenchments. In this dark and dangerous hour, old jealousies are thrown to
                        the winds--and the President, in the honesty of his heart, closing his door
                        against the radicals, calls upon McClellan to save the army and the
                        Capital--a righteous vindication of a brave man, a great general and a pure
                        patriot.</p>
                    <p>You have no doubt seen the announcement, from the War Department, of the
                        discharge of Major J.C. Austin, of our Regiment, from the service, on
                        account of absence without leave, while the regiment was on duty; and it is
                        due to Major Austin that I present the facts of the case. He had been very
                        unwell for several days, and applied to General Tyler for leave of absence.
                        The General consented to approve his application, but at the same time told
                        him it was very doubtful whether the leave would be granted by the
                        authorities at Washington. The Major went to Washington and his application
                        was disapproved. While there he became so unwell that he felt unable to
                        return to camp, and in fact did lie for several days at one of the Hotels,
                        unable to leave his bed or room. During this period several companies of our
                        regiment were ordered down the Manassas road, to be under charge of the
                        Major of the Regiment, who, as a matter of course was reported absent, and,
                        his absence being without permission, his name was stricken from the roll. I
                        understand an effort is being made to have him reinstated, but have not
                        learned with what success it has met.</p>
                    <p>Now that we have settled down somewhat, drilling is actively carried
                        on--Squad, Company, and Regimental drills and Brigade parades occupy four or
                        six hours, daily; and a vast improvement is already manifest. Of course the
                        Chambers Infantry counts itself the brag company, and it does go through the
                        "manual" most admirably--many of the members being old pupils of Major
                        Hershberger. But in doing equal and exact justice I must allude to Capt.
                        Miles' company, which, unless company A looks well to its laurels, will soon
                        outshine the whole Regiment and become the "crack company" of the Brigade. I
                        mention these two companies because they have happened to come more
                        particularly under my notice, and intend no slight to the others, who, I
                        know, will come up to the general determination to have the 126th the best
                        drilled regiment in the nine months service.</p>
                    <p>Our old friend Major Hershberger has been acting as drill-master to the
                        regiment for a short time; but as we were almost continually moving, and
                        gave him but little chance for instructing us, he left for home, on Monday
                        last. Now that we seem to be rather permanently located, he had better
                        return, as we all feel that his services are much needed.</p>
                    <p>All the regimental officers of the 107th are too unwell for duty, and Capt.
                        Mac. Thomson is now in command. The regiment scarcely contains three hundred
                        men; when it left Harrisburg last winter, it was full to the maximum number.</p>
                    <p>I had the pleasure, the other day, of meeting (Rev.) Capt Cooken, formerly
                        principal of the High School of Mercersburg, and the U.S. Consul at
                        Cienfuegos, Cuba. He is now in command of a company in the 110th
                        Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>William M. Francis, late Speaker of the State Senate is here on a visit to
                        the sick and wounded from his vicinity. He is a relative by marriage of
                        "Stonewall" Jackson, and sincerely hopes to have one cousin less before many
                        days.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Campbells regiment (57th) has been consolidated with the 99th Penna.</p>
                    <p>You can scarcely have any idea how our old regiments have been decimated by
                        sickness and the sword and bullet. Whole Brigades look scarcely as large as
                        a full regiment. This is particularly the case with those who have returned
                        from the Peninsula. Some more active measures should be taken to fill them
                        up. Most of them are well officered and have earned for themselves a
                        reputation which new recruits should be proud to share. It reminds us that
                        we have seen but little of the dangers and hardships of the soldier's life
                        when we look upon our full ranks. But, like all others, our time must come;
                        and we too will some day have to look, with heavy hearts, upon our shattered
                        and thinned columns.</p>
                    <p>Most new recruits, on leaving home, have a horror of hospitals, and I know
                        many of us had. While in Alexandria I had a good opportunity of examining
                        some located at that point, and can bear the strongest testimony to their
                        neatness, comfort and admirable arrangement and management. The sick soldier
                        who resists going to the hospital, stands in his own light--for there he
                        will receive every attention, kind and obliging nurses, suitable clothing
                        and good medical treatment. If any of our friends, therefore, hear of their
                        loved ones being sent to the hospital, let them not picture to themselves
                        scenes of discomfort, dirt and lack of care, but let them know that the best
                        has been done that circumstances will allow of.</p>

                    <p>Near Sharpsburg, Md., Sept. 21.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Messrs Editors:</emph> After several days hard marching
                        we reached Frederick city, by way of Rockville and Hyatt-town: where we were
                        taking a day's rest, when the sound of cannon in the distance, constantly
                        increasing in volume and rapidity, soon aroused the camp to the most intense
                        excitement and anxiety. Soon the order came to march, and eagerly the men
                        put on their trappings and shouldered their muskets. We were encamped three
                        miles from Frederick, on the Washington road, and took up the line of march
                        about four o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday last. We marched all
                        evening and night, with scarcely an hours rest, traveling a distance of
                        twenty four miles and reaching the battle field, in the vicinity of
                        Sharpsburg, about seven o'clock the next morning; where, after a short rest
                        and a cup of tea and a hard cracker, we were drawn up in line of battle as a
                        portion of reserve of the centre. the whole army seemed to be anxiously
                        awaiting the opening of the ball, but there was very little firing at all
                        during Thursday, and that principally between the skirmishers of the advance
                        lines. There was no general engagement on Thursday, both armies, it is said,
                        being out of am[m]unition, and both being engaged in bury their dead.</p>
                    <p>The enemy, taking advantage of the lull in the storm, commenced their
                        retreat, and early on Friday and Saturday we pushed after them. Our advance
                        had a severe engagement at the river, both on Friday evening and on Saturday
                        morning. On Friday eve. we took several cannon and a number of Wagons, but
                        on Saturday morning the 118th (Corn Exchange) Pennsylvania was driven back
                        over the river with heavy loss. We marched to the river and there lay all
                        day, our artillery trying to clear the woods on the other side. The enemy
                        made no reply, but about five o'clock in the evening, commenced to plant a
                        heavy battery on a commanding height, whereupon we withdrew a mile into a
                        hollow, and left our guns to attend to the enemy. There was no firing during
                        the night. I write early in the morning, probably before any of you are up.
                        We will probably make another attempt to cross to-day.</p>
                    <p>The engagement of Wednesday was the fiercest of the war. Wherever the battle
                        raged, the ground was literally covered with the wounded and slain. Where
                        the Irish Brigade charged so bravely, half a dozen times, the rebels were
                        piled in heaps. In one field there lay at least six hundred of the enemy's
                        killed. While dead horses lay around in scores, altogether raising an almost
                        intolerable smell. Such sights are not pleasant to look upon, yet they will
                        amply repay a visit as they are not seen often in a lifetime. The most of
                        the rebel dead still remain unburied, though most of ours are already
                        interred.</p>
                    <p>It is supposed the rebels will make a stand near Winchester. We hope they
                        will do so; we will not have so far to go to reach them. The force opposing
                        us now is chiefly a rear guard. The veteran troops have nearly all crossed
                        at Williamsport, and we are the front of this wing, being now near the
                        extreme left. The great battle of the war is yet to be fought near here.</p>
                    <p>You would scarcely believe how anxious the boys are for a fight. Their
                        disappointment was very great in not reaching the late battle field in time
                        to participate. There we lay all day in sight of the enemy, perfectly
                        inactive. In fact we never could have stood the march if it had not been
                        that the sound of the enemy's cannon was ringing in our ears.</p>
                    <p>We have numbers of our Franklin County friends with us daily; and feel almost
                        as if we were at home.</p>
                    <p>Despite all our hardships the health of the regiment remains good--but few
                        being in hospital and they for slight sickness.</p>
                    <p>It would be useless to attempt to give a full description of the battle and
                        the battle field. The picture would not be a pleasant one to dwell upon--and
                        you have no doubt seen full details in the papers--more satisfactory ones,
                        in fact than I could give. The loss on both sides has been immense--from
                        seven to ten thousand on each side.</p>
                    <p>Gen. McClellan himself is in command of our wing. He is greeted with
                        enthusiastic cheers whenever he appears. His popularity seems to have no
                        bounds.</p>
                    <p>We are now in Gen. Humphrey's division. Letters should be directed to
                        Washington, D.C. They will be forwarded.</p>
                    <p>The Penna. Reserves, as well as the 107th Regiment, were in Wednesday fight,
                        and lost severely. The 107th could only muster 100 men after the battle.</p>
                    <p>We are having pretty rough times. Our tents are left behind and most of the
                        time commissary wagons fail to keep up with us, so we have none too much to
                        eat. I am requested to announce to our Franklin County friends, that if any
                        of them follow us up, anything in the eatable line they may bring along will
                        be very acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Our artillery has opened, heavily, on the hill above us--and still there is
                        no reply from the Virginia shore. We will probably cross to-day but will not
                        go far. We can be easily followed, at least as far as Winchester.</p>
                    <p>Our facilities for writing are so meagre that our friends must not expect to
                        hear from us often now.</p>

                    <p>We perhaps owe an apology to our readers for not issuing a paper last week.
                        "A poor excuse is worse than none," is an old saying, but in this case, (and
                        we think our readers will agree with us,) our excuse is a good one. We
                        issued no paper because we <emph rend="italic">couldn't</emph>. "Stonewall"
                        Jackson was threatening to invade our State and capture and perhaps sack our
                        town. Martial law was declared and every able-bodied man and boy was
                        required to shoulder the musket, and assist in repelling the invader from
                        our homes and altars, if he made the attempt. We succumbed to the
                        necessities of the case, closed the office, postponed all business till a
                        more convenient season, and all hands about the establishment, from Editors
                        down to devil, shouldered their guns (ours was a shot-gun) and with a little
                        assistance we received from Gen. McClellan, drove Lee and Jackson, with
                        their rebel hordes, across the Potomac. This is our apology. We feel sure
                        our readers will excuse us.</p>

                <excerpt>"The great battle of Wednesday following is so fresh on the minds of every
                    one that it is quite unnecessary for us to say anything on the subject. Suffice
                    it to say, that it is acknowledged on all hands to have been the greatest battle
                    of the war."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Two great battles were fought in Maryland last week, between the Union and
                        rebel armies, the first took place on Sunday, the 14th inst., on the South
                        Mountain between Middletown and Boonsboro and is said to have been a
                        sanguinary conflict. Lee had withdrawn his forces from the neighborhood of
                        Frederick, a day or two before, and taken his position along the mountain
                        ridges dividing Frederick from Washington county, Md. Here he no doubt
                        confidently expected to stop the further advance of McClellan, who was close
                        upon his heels, defeat his army and drive him back toward Washington. In
                        this he was doomed to sad disappointment, McClellan and his brave army
                        advanced steadily and firmly upon the enemy, posted in apparently almost
                        impregnable positions upon the mountain top. At the proper time, over the
                        rugged steeps, they charged the enemy upon the right and left, drove him
                        from his positions, and after a terrible slaughter, he was driven in utter
                        confusion down the opposite side of the mountain. Our Artillery and Cavalry
                        following rapidly and shelling them clear into Boonsboro'. This battle was
                        the turning point of the campaign in Maryland and decided the fate of the
                        rebels. The great battle of Wednesday following is so fresh on the minds of
                        every one, that it be quite unnecessary for us to say anything on the
                        subject. Suffice it to say, that it is acknowledged on all hands to have
                        been the greatest battle of the war. After the most terrific carnage,
                        lasting from early dawn until late at night, the rebels sought the first
                        opportunity to beat a hasty retreat across the Potomac into "Dixie." Though
                        the war is not yet over by any means, we think the rebels have received such
                        a drubbing as to cause them to think long and consider well, before they
                        again attempt the invasion of "Maryland, my Maryland!"</p>

                    <p>Sharpsburg, Md., Saturday Evening, <lb/>September 20th.</p>
                    <p>Our army moved yesterday--Friday--afternoon, toward Sheppardstown, on the
                        Potomac river, General Pleasanton went forward with his cavalry and picked
                        up about three hundred stragglers. Some of our artillery followed and when
                        they reached the river, exchanged compliments with the Rebels. Their whole
                        force appeared to be on the Virginia side, and their batteries were planted
                        along the bank to prevent the passage of the Union army. They succeeded in
                        saving everything except one field-piece, whose carriage broke down, and two
                        or three old wagons.</p>
                    <p>Their movements seem to have been conducted very leisurely and without
                        anything like panic. The most seriously wounded were left at Sharpsburg and
                        in the houses along the retreat to the river. They evidently took their own
                        time in falling back, and do not appear to have had any fear of being
                        pursued. A strong force was kept in our front during the whole of Thursday
                        although, to many of our officers and men it seemed apparent that the enemy
                        was retreating.</p>
                    <p>Great clouds of dust were continually rising in the rear of their lines,
                        which indicated a retreat of the main army.</p>
                    <p>In the battle of Wednesday, it is estimated by careful observers who went
                        over the field, that our loss will reach quite ten thousand killed and
                        wounded.</p>
                    <p>The Rebel loss is believed to be somewhat heavier, and there is no doubt but
                        their dead far outnumbered our own, as our artillery played upon their dense
                        columns with terrible effect.</p>
                    <p>Sharpsburg is completely riddled with our shot. The citizens mostly fled from
                        the town, while a few took refuge in the cellars of several stone houses.</p>
                    <p>After the retreat of the enemy, those who had left returned to the town, and
                        when our army entered it they welcomed it with hurrahs, and hung out the
                        Stars and Stripes from their windows.</p>
                    <p>The whole country in the region of the battle ground is laid desolate, and

                    <p>At Williamsport, Maryland, there are about 25,000 of the Pennsylvania
                        Militia, who had advanced into Maryland with the hope of participating in
                        the final rout or capture of the Rebel invaders. In this they have been
                        doomed to disappointment.</p>

                    <p>The Rebel army has succeeded in making its escape from Maryland. They
                        commenced to leave about dusk on Thursday evening, and by daylight yesterday
                        morning were all over except a small rear guard. They saved all their
                        transportation and carried off all their wounded but about three hundred.
                        Between three and four hundred Rebel stragglers were taken during theby
                        [sic] day General Pleasanton's Cavalry who took the advance. Nearly every
                        house in Sharpsburg was struck by our shells. Two were burned, and also a
                        large barn located in the centre of the town. The citizens who remained
                        escaped by staying in their cellars. Only one child was killed. Two Rebels,
                        while cooking their suppers, on Tuesday, were killed by one of our shots
                        passing through the kitchen. The name given to this battle is the
                        "Antietam."</p>
                    <p>After our forces occupied the whole field, the Rebel loss was found to be far
                        greater particularly in killed, than it was at first supposed. Fully 2500
                        were found lying on the field, while a large number had been buried the day
                        before by their friends. Their loss from killed and wounded will not come
                        far from 18,000 to 22,000. General Stark, of the Rebel forces, was killed,
                        and Generals Ripley and Hayes were wounded.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels on Thursday night burned the railroad bridge at Harper's Ferry.</p>
                    <p>The citizens of Sandy Hook were fleeing into the country on Thursday night,
                        to avoid being impressed into the Rebel army and carried into Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Large details of men were made this morning to bury the remaining dead
                        bodies, which have become offensive. The troops are still in excellent
                        spirits over the result. The Rebels are still visible on the opposite shore
                        in force. A large amount of artillery has been posted by the enemy, to
                        prevent our troops from crossing. The officers of this army are unanimous in
                        the expression of the opinion that Gen. Hooker should, for his gallantry and
                        bravery, be made a Brigadier General in the regular army, to fill the
                        vacancy occasioned by the death of General Mansfield.</p>

                    <p>Immediately on the issue of the last number of our paper, any number of
                        rumors became rife of the advance of the Rebel army upon our State border.
                        Each additional report brought confirmation of the former ones, until our
                        community was considerably excited and alarmed at the prospect of having the
                        rebel hordes in our midst. Business of all kinds was at once suspended, the
                        town was placed under Martial Law, and the entire community took up the
                        musket. The excitement, on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of week before last
                        was intense, but on Sunday we received news that the rebels were drawing in
                        their pickets from the State line, when the community began to breathe
                        easier. In the meantime large bodies of armed men from the North, East and
                        West, in response to the call of the Governor, literally poured into town,
                        and advanced to meet the enemy. In fact nearly all the able-bodied men of
                        our glorious old State seemed to be under arms and marching to repel the
                        invading foe from our borders. Luckily for us and the militia, Gen McClellan
                        whipped Lee on the South Mountain between Middletown and Boonesboro on
                        Sunday, which caused the sudden evacuation of Hagerstown by the rebels and
                        relieved us of any immediate danger of invasion.</p>

                <summary>Two weeks before, the town of Chambersburg was rife with rumors of an enemy
                    invasion, and the community was alarmed at the "prospect of having the rebel
                    hordes in our midst." Business was suspended, and martial law was declared. It
                    was particularly intense on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of the week before
                    last, but on Sunday came word that the Confederates were withdrawing their
                    pickets from the state line. Large bodies of men from the northern, eastern, and

                    <p>Our town was thrown into the wildest state of excitement on last Monday a
                        week by the arrival of 50 or 60 "secesh" prisoners together with a long
                        train of wagons loaded with ammunition and guarded by a company of the first
                        Maryland Cavalry. This train was captured that morning between Hagerstown
                        and Williamsport, by about 1,500 of our Cavalry from Harper's Ferry, who
                        were cutting their way through the enemy's lines, which they succeeded in
                        doing in the most successful manner, and arriving safely in this place with
                        their valuable prize, without losing a single man. This we consider the most
                        successful manner, and arriving safely in this place with their valuable
                        prize, without losing a single man. This we consider the most successful
                        exploit of the war. Among the prisoners, was Clegget Fitzhugh of this
                        County, who had left Hughes' Furnace but a few days before and gone over to
                        Hagerstown and joined the rebel army. The feeling against Fitzhugh was
                        intense and the crowd cried out "hang him," "shoot him," "kill him," but he
                        was hurried off to prison by the officers having him in charge, and the
                        crowd dispersed, satisfied that the better way was to let the law have its
                        course, which we have no doubt will give him the fullest punishment his
                        guilt deserves. We learn, that he has since been taken to one of the eastern
                        Forts.</p>

                        unimpaired, and that as soon as these objects are accomplished, the war
                        ought to cease."</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the chief and most imperative duty

                        tending to crush the existing causeless and infamous rebellion and to

                <summary>The Democratic county convention reaffirmed its support of the Crittenden
                    Resolution passed in 1861, which argued that the war should be fought for the
                    "Union as it was and the Constitution as it is." The convention also expressed
                    its support of the national administration, but stated that the war should not
                    be fought to change southern institutions.</summary>

                    <p>Head-Quarters Army of the Potomac, 8 miles beyond Middletown, Sept 14--9:40,
                        P.M.,</p>
                    <p>H.W. Halleck, General-in Chief:</p>
                    <p>After a very severe engagement the corps of Generals Hooker and Reno have
                        carried the heights commanding the Hagerstown road. The troops behaved
                        magnificently. They never fought better.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Franklin has been engaged on the extreme left. I do not yet know the
                        result, except that the finding indicates progress on his part. The action
                        continued until after dark and terminated leaving us in possession of the
                        entire crest. It has been a glorious victory. I cannot yet tell whether the
                        enemy will retreat during the night or appear in increased force in the
                        morning. I regret to add the gallant and able Gen. Reno is killed.</p>

                    <p>H.W. Halleck, General-in-Chief:</p>
                    <p>I have just learned from Gen. Hocker, in the advance, who states that the
                        information is perfectly reliable that the enemy is making for the river in
                        a perfect panic, and Gen. Lee last night stated publicly that he must admit
                        they had been shockingly whipped.</p>
                    <p>I am hurrying everything forward to endeavor to press their retreat to the
                        utmost.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) Geo. B. McClellan, <lb/>Major-General. Still Better--Franklin's
                        Movement a Complete Success.</p>
                    <p>Head Quarters Army of the Potomac, <lb/>Sept. 15th--9 A.M.</p>
                    <p>H.W. Halleck, General-in-Chief:</p>
                    <p>I am happy to inform you that Franklin's success on the left was complete as
                        that on the centre and right, and resulted in his getting possession of the
                        Gap, after a severe engagement in all parts of the line.</p>
                    <p>The troops, old and new, behaved with the utmost steadiness and gallantry,
                        carrying, with utmost steadiness and gallantry, carrying, with but little
                        assistance from our own artillery, every strong position defended by
                        artillery and infantry.</p>
                    <p>I do not think our loss is very severe.</p>
                    <p>The corps of A.S. Hill and Longstreet were engaged with our right.</p>
                    <p>We have taken a considerable number of prisoners.</p>
                    <p>The enemy dispersed during the night.</p>
                    <p>Out troops are now advancing in pursuit of them.</p>
                    <p>I do not yet know where he will be next found.</p>

                    <p>Head Quarters Army of the Potomac, <lb/>at Bolivar, Sept. 15, 10 A.M.</p>
                    <p>H.W. Halleck, General in Chief:</p>
                    <p>Information has this moment been received completely confirming the rout and
                        demoralization of the rebel army.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee is reported wounded and Gen. Garland killed.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Hooker alone has over one thousand more prisoners--seven hundred having
                        been sent to Frederick.</p>
                    <p>It is stated that Gen. Lee gives his loss at 15,000.</p>
                    <p>We are following as rapidly as the men can move.</p>

                        Gen. Mansfield--Our Loss 10,000--The Rebel Loss About the Same--1500
                        Prisoners Taken.</p>
                    <p>Head Quarters Army of the Potomac. <lb/>Tuesday evening, Sept. 16</p>
                    <p>During this afternoon, information was received at Head-quarters, showing
                        that the enemy were recrossing the river and concentrating their forces on
                        the ridge of hills outside of the town of Sharpsburg, to within three miles
                        of the main body of our army.</p>
                    <p>Stonewall Jackson left Harper's Ferry this morning. His troops commenced to
                        arrive during the afternoon. When it became evident that Gen. Lee was
                        disposed to engage our forces in battle at that point, Gen. McClellan sent
                        for General Franklin's corps and Conch's division, who were about seven
                        miles distant on the other side of Elk Ridge.</p>
                    <p>There was considerable artillery firing during the day on both sides,
                        resulting in our having about 40 men killed and wounded. Among those
                        seriously wounded was Major Oruedt, of the first New York Artillery, who was
                        struck in the side by a piece of shell.</p>
                    <p>The disposition of the troops for the impending battle was as follows:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Summer's corps with Gen. Hanks' division, to occupy the centre; Gen.
                        Hooker's corps with the Pennsylvania, Reserves and Franklin's corps, on the
                        right; Generals Porter and Burnsides on the extreme left, with a view of
                        turning the enemy's right flank. Gen. Pleasonton supported the centre with
                        2500 cavalry and four batteries.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Hooker, in the afternoon, crossed Antietam creek and took a position on
                        the hills facing Sharpsburg, and three miles to the right of Keatsville.</p>
                    <p>His troops got into action about dark, which lasted two hours, during which
                        the enemy were driven about half a mile, with considerable loss. The
                        Pennsylvania Reserves, who were in front, suffered much.</p>
                    <p>The night was occupied in getting the troops into their respective positions,
                        while ammunition trains and ambulances were forwarded to their different
                        commands.</p>
                    <p>VICTORY OF WEDNESDAY.</p>
                    <p>The Enemy Driven Back a Mile--They Rally and Recover the Ground--But are
                        Again Routed.</p>
                    <p>Wednesday Evening, September 17th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>This has been an eventful day in the history of the Rebellion. A battle has
                        taken place in which the army of the Potomac has again been victorious, and
                        which exceeded in extent, any battle heretofore fought on this continent.</p>
                    <p>At the dawn of day the battle was resumed on the centre and right by Gen.
                        Hooker and Gen. Sumner who, after a sharp contest of two hours, drove the
                        enemy about one mile.</p>
                    <p>The rebels, however, rallied shortly afterwards, and, with terrible loss,
                        regained most of the ground. At this time the fearless and indomitable Gen.
                        Hooker received a shot in the ankle, and was carried from the field, the
                        command of his troops devolving upon Gen. Sumner. Gen. Richardson,
                        commanding his Division, was severely wounded at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sumner, determined to retake the lost ground, ordered the troops to
                        advance, which they did with a will, driving the rebels before them with
                        great slaughter. They not only retook the ground, but drove them a quarter
                        of a mile beyond.</p>
                    <p>In this action Gen. Mansfield was shot thro' the lungs and died soon after.</p>
                    <p>The troops under Generals Burnsides and Porter had not been idle. They drove
                        the rebels from the line of the Antietam creek, on the main road to
                        Sharpsburg, and having built a bridge (the old one having been burned by the
                        rebels) occupied the opposite bank. The loss there was considerable.</p>
                    <p>To get possession of the ridge of hills on the right and left hand side of
                        the road from which the Rebels were thundering away with artillery, was a
                        task not easily accomplished.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sykes' brigade carried the ridge on the right hand side, with the
                        assistance of General Sumner, after considerable trouble and loss, the
                        rebels running in all directions.</p>
                    <p>It was now 5 o'clock, and all the enemy's positions had been carried except
                        the one on the left hand side of the road. To do this duty Gen. Burnside was
                        assigned. The artillery opened and the infantry advanced. The point was
                        carried at a charge, but our troops were [illegible] to retire before a
                        superior force, the rebels knowing that if they lost this ridge a complete
                        rout of their army would be the result; they fought with great desperation.</p>
                    <p>Darkness now overtook the two armies and hostilities ceased as though by
                        mutual consent.</p>
                    <p>The battle lasted from five o'clock in the morning until seven at night,
                        without a moment's cessation.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of all the troops, without exception, was all that any General
                        could wish. Several regiments of new troops, who were in action for the
                        first time, behaved admirably.</p>
                    <p>Hundreds of Marylanders were present to witness the battle, which could be
                        seen from many of the surrounding hills. The sharp rattle of 50,000 muskets,
                        and the thunder of a hundred pieces of artillery is not often heard, nor the
                        consequent excited movements of such large armies witnessed.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible, at this writing, to form any correct idea of our loss or
                        that of the enemy. It is heavy on both sides. Ours will probably reach ten
                        thousand in killed and wounded, and that of the enemy will, perhaps, not
                        exceed it.</p>
                    <p>The enemy's dead, which nearly all fell into our hands, were thickly strewn
                        over the fields, in many places lying in heaps.</p>
                    <p>Out wounded were immediately carried from the field, and the best possible
                        attention given them.</p>
                    <p>When Gen. Hooker fell, Gen. McClellan immediately proceeded to the right,
                        where he was enthusiastically received, and by his presence added much to
                        our success in recovering ground lost. He was in the centre and on the left,
                        anxiously watching the progress of the battle, and giving directions as to
                        the manner of attack.</p>
                    <p>He was in his tent to-night, for the first time since he left Frederick city.</p>
                    <p>We took some 1500 prisoners during the day while the enemy obtained but few.</p>
                    <p>The following officers were killed or wounded:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Hartsuff, wounded.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Duryea, wounded.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sedgwick, wounded in the shoulder.</p>
                    <p>Col. Childs, of the Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry, killed.</p>
                    <p>Col Knight, of the Eleventh Connecticut, seriously wounded.</p>
                    <p>Lieut Col Parvison, of the Fifty-seventh New York, killed.</p>
                    <p>Captain Audenried, Aid to General Sumner, wounded.</p>
                    <p>Colonel McNiel, of the Pennsylvania Bucktails, and Lieutenant Allison, were
                        killed.</p>
                    <p>Col Polk, of the Second United States Sharp Shooters, wounded.</p>
                    <p>Major Burbank, of the Twelfth Massachusetts, wounded.</p>
                    <p>Several other prominent officers were repor[ted] killed or wounded, but
                        nothing positive is known.</p>

                    <p>But little occurred yesterday, except skirmishing last night.</p>
                    <p>The enemy abandoned his position, leaving his dead and wounded on the field.
                        We are again in pursuit.</p>
                    <p>I do not yet know whether he is falling back to an interior position, or
                        crossing the river. We may safely claim a victory.</p>

                    <p>The enemy is driven back into Virginia.</p>
