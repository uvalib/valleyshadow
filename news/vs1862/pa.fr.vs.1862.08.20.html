<b>Address of the Democratic State Central Committee</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This address sums up the position of the Pennsylvania Democratic party on
                    the causes of the Civil War. They lay the blame for the onset of the war
                    squarely on the abolitionists. Without them, claim the authors, the
                    secessionists in the South would never have risen to power. Moreover, claim the
                    Democrats, the abolitionists are intent on changing the focus of the war from
                    restoring the Union to releasing the slaves, and they will not stop until the
                    white race in the South is "exterminated or held in subjugation." The address
                    also notes rumors that black regiments have been formed. The Democrats argue
                    that this is not only a waste of uniforms, since blacks in their view will make
                    worthless soldiers, but is also dangerous. Thus, argues the address, responsible
                    citizens should vote for the Democratic party, particularly the Democratic
                    candidates for state auditor general and state surveyor general, who will stand
                    in the path of the abolitionists in Pennsylvania.<br>

<b>The Constitution</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial argues that the Constitution is to the citizen as the Bible
                    is to a Christian, and that loyalty to the Constitution, rather than to a
                    political party, is the only measure of loyalty. Abolitionists who argue that
                    secession justifies the abolition of slavery are making an "absurd and
                    fallacious" argument, and such a view proves that they are not loyal to the
                    Constitution. Lincoln's inability to resist the abolitionists indicates his
                    weakness. The editors lament the lack of a political leader like Andrew Jackson,
                    who could resist radicals on both sides of the spectrum.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Even-Handed Justice</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The proprietors and editors of the Harrisburg Patriot and Union (a
                    Democratic paper often excerpted by the Valley Spirit) were arrested recently on
                    order of the provost marshal of Washington, and taken to Washington City under
                    military guard and imprisoned. The cause of the arrest was the publication of a
                    handbill announcing that Jim Lane was in town recruiting black troops--printed
                    apparently in jest by two printer boys. The publication was deemed to have a
                    harmful impact on recruiting white troops, and the two owners and two editors
                    were arrested. The Valley Spirit and Times argues that this happened simply
                    because they were Democrats. In contrast, Republican papers are free to publish
                    the most incendiary material that they choose without any repercussions.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Messrs. Barrett and M'Dowell, Proprietors, and Forster and Jones, Editors of
                        the Harrisburg Patriot and Union, were arrested a short time since, by order of the Provost
                        Marshall of Washington and taken to that city under charge of a military
                        guard and imprisoned in the old capital prison. The cause of this arrest and
                        imprisonment was the issuing of a hand-bill from the office of the Patriot and Union, by
                        two printer boys, announcing that Jim Lane was in town, and would enlist
                        colored recruits for the war.</p>
                    <p>The issuing of this hand-bill was held to be discouraging to the enlistment
                        of white men. Now, if enlisting, or advocating the enlistment of negroes is
                        calculated to discourage the enlistment of white men, why, we ask in all
                        seriousness, has not Jim Lane himself been arrested under the late order of
                        Secretary Standon [sic]? He, we are told, has gone to Kansas to enlist two
                        full regiments of negroes. Or why have not the Editors of the NY Tribune, of the Harrisburg Telegragh [sic] and other kindred abolition sheets been
                        arrested, who have been advocating the enlistment and arming of negroes for
                        months past? It's a poor rule that wont [sic] work both ways. But it would
                        seem that what is taken for the highest degree of loyalty and patriotism in
                        Jim Lane and abolition Editors and orators, instantly becomes treason, when
                        proposed by a couple of irresponsible printer boys belonging to a Democratic newspaper office. Is this impartial and
                        even-handed justice? We think that every honest and fair minded man must say
                        that it is not.</p>
                    <p>We could have no sympathy with any parties who would be guilty of
                        discouraging enlistments, and if we felt convinced that the parties arrested
                        had any such design we would say they deserved the severest punishment
                        commensurate with the crime. But we must confess our inability to see
                        anything of the kind in the transaction which caused the arrest of these
                        men.</p>
                    <p>The following just and sensible remarks on this subject we find in the
                        Northampton County Journal, the organ of the
                        Republican party in that county, Would to God, there were more such
                        honorable and fair-minded men editing Republican newspapers. In speaking of
                        the late order of the Secretary of war and the arrest at Harrisburg, the
                        Editor remarks:</p>
                    <p>But we hope that in the execution of this order, the govnment [sic] will
                        pursue a course of even handed justice. There should and there must be no
                        favor shown on account of political party affinities. The editors lately
                        arrested at Harrisburg for publishing incendiary hand-bills, no doubt,
                        deserved what they got, but in the judgment of many their offence was not
                        half so grand as that of Wendell Philips and the whole radical faction of
                        the North. The former lately delivered an address, in which, by heaping up
                        abuse and ridicule upon the President and some of our Generals, he has done
                        more to weaken confidence in the government and to discourage enlistments
                        than any other one man in the North. The order should not only reach and
                        punish known sympathizers with secession, but also that large class of
                        radical abolitionists who are most fond and hearty in their denunciation of
                        the government because it does not adopt and carry out their plans for
                        suppressing the rebellion. Unless the order is thus impartially executed,
                        sparing none however high, or whatever their political creed, it will do
                        more harm than good. It is just the thing now needed to enable the
                        government to prosecute the war, if it be executed without fear or
                    favor.</p>

                    <p>Near Arlington Heights.</p>
                    <p><br>Saturday, August 16th, 1862</p>
                    <p>Correspondence of the Spirit and Times.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: Here we are, at last, encamped on the sacred soil, on one of
                        the Arlington Heights, five miles from Washington City, two and a half miles
                        from Alexandria, and some two miles from the mansion of the Rebel General
                        Lee. Our regiment was formed on Wednesday last, consisting of eight
                        companies from Franklin and two from Juniata county James G. Elder, of St.
                        Thomas, was chosen Colonel; D. W. Rowe, of Greencastle, Lieut. Colonel, and
                        James C. Austin, of Chambersburg, Major.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday evening we received orders to strike our tents at three o'clock
                        the coming morning, and be ready to march, with two days cooked rations. The
                        orders were promptly obeyed, but it was nine o'clock before we were marched
                        to the railroad, where a long train of cars was in waiting for us; after
                        remaining seated in the open cars for nearly three hours, we started for
                        Baltimore on the Northern Central Railway, after innumerable unpleasant
                        delays, we arrived at eight o'clock. We took supper at the "Union Relief
                        Association," and immediately left for the Federal Capital, which we reached
                        about three o'clock, this morning; here we were likewise indebted to the
                        Washington "Ladies Retreat" for our breakfast. After breakfast, the boys
                        were allowed an hour or so to see the sights of the town; and you may well
                        imagine they made very good use of their time. Unlike some regiments and
                        companies we have seen, they did not rush as soon as dismissed, to the
                        hotels and grogeries, but wended their way to the Capitol, President's
                        House, Public Departments, Smithsonian Institute, and other buildings and
                        places of note and interest. At about twelve o'clock, the one hundred and
                        twenty fourth regiment, Col. Bell, and the one hundred and twenty sixth,
                        (our's) took up their line of march over the Long Bridge. The day was
                        exceedingly warm, the road dusty, and the march about five miles long. You
                        may know it was the most fatiguing half day's duty many of us had ever
                        performed. There was but little shade along the road, and still less water;
                        and with a heavy knapsack weighing forty or fifty pounds together with a
                        musket and accoutrements, a haversack with rations and a canteen, many of
                        the men were almost exhausted. If our march had been much longer some of us
                        would most assuredly have been left behind. It was a very strong march for
                        raw recruits, but although greatly fatigued, we all escaped without any
                        serious consequences. The location of present camp is a pleasant one. It is
                        situated on a hill overlooking the Potomac and the Valley stretching away to
                        Alexandria, a small brook runs through it and several wells of good water
                        are in the immediate vicinity.</p>
                    <p>The day before we left Camp Curtin, Major General Wool paid us a vit [sic].
                        He was greeted with the most enthusiastic cheers by the men; and intimated
                        that the nine months volunteers would be ordered into active service as soon
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>It is rumored in camp that last night a party of ten guerillas [sic] were
                        captured within two miles of our camp. Two of them were shot in the
                        encounter and the remainder were taken prisoners. Scouting parties are out
                        after them nightly; to-morrow we expect to go ourselves. They will receive
                        but little quarter, if any of our parties succeed in entrapping them.</p>
                    <p>A portion of McClellan's army has already arrived below Alexandria, and
                        everything seems to indicate that the second advance upon Richmond will be
                        made from the direction of Fredericksburg and the Rappahannock. By extracts
                        from Richmond papers received here, it would seem that the Rebels really
                        begin to fear for the safety of their Capital. If such be the case they
                        will, in all probability, make another demonstration, before many of the new
                        recruits can get to this side of the river. We have no desire to participate
                        in any serious engagement until we become tolerably well drilled, but after
                        that we want to do our whole duty. Our present camp is surrounded with forts
                        on all sides, at distances varying from one to three miles. Forts Runyan,
                        Albany, Scott, North Blencker and Corcoran, all within the range of the
                        naked eye, can be seen to turn their bristling parapets towards the foe, and
                        are each within shelling distance of the others.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of some little sickness occasioned by change of water and
                        climate, all still continue to enjoy excellent health, and are in the
                        liveliest spirits.</p>
                    <p>We were the first Pennsylvania nine months regiment, which reached the
                        Federal Capital; but now they come pouring in by thousands. Thus far we have
                        all been thrown into one camp; but it is to be hoped that different camps
                        will be established, as it becomes very uncomfortable when thirty thousand
                        men are massed in a single camp.</p>
                    <p>Our reception in Baltimore was very cordial--flags and handkerchiefs were
                        fluttering from hundreds of windows, while many followed us along our route,
                        cheering and encouraging us. I saw regiments passing through the streets of
                        Baltimore last winter, but their reception did not bespeak as healthy a
                        union sentiment as our's did. At least, one thing is certain, the union men
                        are now much bolder in the expression of their sentiments than they formerly
                        were.</p>
                    <p>Henceforth, our movements are very uncertain. But I shall try to keep you
                        advised as to our whereabouts. For the present letters for Capt. Doebler a
                        company should be directed to Company A, 126th Regiment Pennsylvania

<b>Prisoners</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Five or six prisoners under guard passed through town on Monday, on their
                    way to Fort McHenry. They were apparently citizens of Hagerstown and Lellersburg
                    "who had been too freely indulging their Secesh proclivities."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Small Change</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that the scarcity of small change is unprecedented. If the
                    government does not hurry up its production of postage stamps to use as
                    currency, business operations will be impaired.<br>

<b>Their First Charge</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A visitor to the 126th Penn. Volunteers reports that the regiment, on their
                    march to Washington, spied in the field what was thought to be an enemy battery.
                    They charged, only to find that it was a field of watermelon. The editors note
                    that they regained their position without the loss of a man, and wish them the
                    same luck in future encounters.<br>

<b>Improvement</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

<b>A New Tobacco and Segar Store</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mr. C. H. Bush, formerly of Winchester, Virginia, has opened a new tobacco
                    and cigar store on the southeast corner of the Diamond, between the Mansion
                    House and the Repository and Transcript Building. He was compelled to leave
                    Virginia due to his Unionist sympathies, and he lost everything he owned.<br>(Names in announcement:  C. H. Bush)</blockquote>
<b>Court</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Not as large a crowd attended the most recent court session. The only cases
                    tried were on the criminal calendar, and most were of a "trifling" nature. The
                    people engaged in "flooding our county with counterfeit money" received a light
                    sentence, but severe enough, the editors hope, to deter others from doing the
                    same. The editors urge the public to continue to examine all bills offered them,
                    as there are still a number of counterfeit notes in circulation.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Governors of the States are ordered forthwith, to proceed to furnish
                        their respective quotas of the 300,000 militia called for by the President,
                        and to appoint commandants and designate rendezvous. They are also ordered
                        to cause an enrollment to be made forthwith, by
                        the Assessors of the several counties.</p>
                    <p>When the enrollment is completed, it is to be filed in the offices of the
                        Sheriffs of the several counties. The Governor is then to appoint a
                        Commissioner for each county to superintend the draft and decide upon
                        exemptions. These cases are specified. Exemptions for physical disability
                        will not be allowed, unless it unfits the claimant for service for a period
                        of more than thirty days, and it must be certified by a Surgeon to be
                        appointed in each county for the purpose. Within ten
                            days of the filing of the lists of enrollment the draft is to be
                        made by the Sheriff of the county, who is to publicly place in a Jury wheel
                        a separately folded ballot for each name on the list; and when they are all
                        in, a person to be appointed by the Commissioners is to draw, blindfolded, a
                        number of ballots, equal to the quota for the county.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent paragraphs of the regulation provide for the publication of the
                        list, furnishing substitutes &amp;c., and the assembling of drafted men
                        within five days after they are drawn.</p>
