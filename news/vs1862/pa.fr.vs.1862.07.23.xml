                <summary>John Campbell writes that the Republicans have vastly underestimated the
                    breadth of the current crisis and he argues that Democrats are better and more
                    loyal citizens than the Republicans. He then complains that nearly every
                    Democratic plank has been interpreted by Republicans as a sign of disloyalty. He
                    recognizes that McClellan's retreat near Richmond was disastrous. However,
                    Campbell blames the administration, not McClellan's, because it did not supply
                    the general with more men.</summary>

                <summary>The Republicans are supposedly engineering a "Union" state convention,
                    nominating "renegade" Democrats wherever they can find them. Democrats John
                    Forney and John C. Knox were appointed as delegates, both "of the same class of
                    treacherous trimmers." Forney and Knox are both accused of hating the Democratic
                    party and of seeking its destruction.</summary>

                <summary>David Wilmot has been nominated to defend his seat in the U.S. Senate by
                    Pennsylvania Republicans. The editors remind the readers that Wilmot attended
                    and approved of a meeting which proposed labeling the seceded states as
                    territories, thus recognizing the fact of secession. Thus, they argue, he aided
                    and abetted the Confederate cause.</summary>

                <summary>This editorial attacks the "Abolition-Republican-Peoples-Union-Loyal
                    League-no party party," which had its convention on July 17. The editors
                    criticize the Democrats who participated in the convention, including John C.
                    Knox, John W. Forney, and William S. Ross. Mr. Ross was nominated for auditor
                    general, while John Rowe was not nominated for anything. The editors predict
                    that the people will repudiate this party for its radicalism, its corruption,
                    and its refusal to address the real issues. In addition, they believe that
                    Democrats will obtain a majority of 50,000 in the October elections.</summary>

                    uncomplimentary reference to the Democratic State Convention of the year before.
                    Since Judge Nill and John Rowe, former Democrats, were at the Republican
                    Convention this year, the editors speculate that a "renegade Democrat" must be
                    able to "stand almost anything in the way of insult from his new friends."</summary>

                    <p><lb/>Highly Important Movements. <lb/>Advance To Gordonsville. <lb/>An
                        Important Railroad Junction of the Rebels Destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Washington, July 18--A letter from Warrenton says our troops are all in fine
                        spirits at the prospect of active operations. Mention is also made of an
                        important movement already made. The people of Warrenton are represented as
                        courteous towards our troops; and the ladies, though rank Secessionists,
                        treat them with dignified politeness. Warrenton and White Sulphur Springs
                        have been recently infested by Rebel scouts, who were passed yesterday by a
                        detachment of our cavalry without opposition.</p>
                    <p>Reports exist in camp, which are probably based on Rebel authority, that
                        Jackson is at Staunton preparing for another visit down the valley. He will
                        not have an undisputed march.</p>
                    <p>The command of General Hatch is reported to have penetrated as far as Rapidan
                        Station, on the Virginia Central Railroad, seventy-four miles from
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>The following appointment have been made in General Bank's Corps d'armee:
                        Brigadier-General Angur to the First Division, Brigadier-General Prince to
                        the First Brigade and Brigadier-General Greene to the Second Brigade of the
                        same Division.</p>
                    <p>Later from General Pope's Army.</p>
                    <p>Washington, July 18--We feel at liberty to state that yesterday a portion of
                        the army of Gen. Pope entered the important town of Gordonsville, Virginia,
                        unopposed, and duly destroyed all the railroad paraphernalia at that
                        point--the junction of the Orange and Alexandria and Virginia Central
                        Railroads. Three-fourths of the troops, munitions and supplies of ever[y]
                        description for the Rebel army at Richmond, of necessity, passed through
                        Gordonsville by rail. The blow is, therefore, a most important one, more
                        especially as it is the first of a series which, we trust, will do more to
                        cripple the efficiency of the Rebel army at Richmond than aught that has yet
                        occurred.</p>
                    <p>Official Orders.</p>
                    <p>The following orders have been issued in this Department for its government:</p>
                    <p>Generad [sic] Orders, No 5.</p>
                    <p>H.Q. of the Army of Virginia, Washington, July 18, 1862. Hereafter, as far as
                        practicable the troops of this command will subsist upon the country in
                        which their operations are carried on. In all cases, supplies for this
                        purpose will be taken by the officer to whose department they properly
                        belong, under the orders of the commanding officer of the troops for whose
                        use they are intended. Vouchers will be given to the owners, stating on
                        their face that they will be payable at the conclusion of the war, upon
                        sufficient testimony being produced that such owners had been loyal citizens
                        of the United States since the date of the vouchers.</p>
                    <p>Whenever it is known that supplies can be furnished in any district of the
                        country where the troops are to operate, the use of trains for carrying
                        subsistence will be dispensed with as far as possible.</p>
                    <p>By command of Major-General Pope.</p>
                    <p>Geo. D Ruggles, Col. A A G and Chief of Staff.</p>
                    <p>General Orders, No 6.</p>
                    <p>H.Q. of the Army of Virginia, Washington, July 18th, 1862. Hereafter in all
                        operations of the cavalry forces in this command, no supply or baggage
                        trains of any description will be used, unless so stated specially in the
                        order for the movement.</p>
                    <p>Two days cooked rations will be carried or the persons of the men, and all
                        villages and neighborhoods through which they pass will be laid under
                        contribution, in the manner specified by General Orders No 5 (current
                        series) from these head quarters, for subsistence of men and horses.</p>
                    <p>Movements of cavalry must always be made with celerity, and no delay in such
                        movements will be excused, hereafter, on any pretext.</p>
                    <p>Whenver the order for the movement of any portion of this army emenates [sic]
                        from these headquarters, the time of marching, and that to be in the
                        execution of the duty, will be especially designated: and no departure
                        therefrom will be permitted to pass unnoticed without the gravest and most
                        conclusive reasons. The commanding officer will be held responsible for a
                        strict and prompt compliance with every provision of this order.</p>
                    <p>By command of Major-General Pope</p>
                    <p><lb/>Geo. D. Ruggles, Col. A A G and Chief of Staff. General Orders, No 7.</p>
                    <p>H Q of the Army of Virginia, Washington, July 18, 1862; The people of the
                        valley of the Shenandoah, and throughout the region of the operations of
                        this army, living along the lines of railroad and telegraph, and along the
                        routes of travel in the rear of the United States forces are notified that
                        they will be held responsible for any injury done to the track, line or
                        road, or for any attacks upon trains or straggling soldiers by bands of
                        guerrillas in their neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>No privileges or immunities of war can apply to the lawless bands of
                        individuals not forming a part of the organized forces of the enemy, nor
                        wearing the garb of soldiers, who, seeking to obtain safety on the pretext
                        of being peaceful citizens, start out in the rear of the army, attack and
                        murder straggling soldiers, molest trains of supplies, destroy railroads,
                        telegraph lines and bridges, and, commit outrages disgraceful to a civilized
                        people and revolting to humanity.</p>
                    <p>Evil disposed persons in the rear of our armies who do not themselves engage
                        directly in these lawless acts, encourage them by refusing to interfere or
                        to give any information by which such acts can be prevented or the
                        perpetrators punished. The safety of the life and property of all person[s]
                        living in the rear of our advancing armies, depends upon the maintenance of
                        peace and quiet among themselves, and upon the unmolested movements through
                        their midst of all pertaining to their military service. They are to
                        understand distinctly that this security of travel is their only warrant of
                        personal safety. It is, therefore, ordered that, whenever a railroad, or
                        telegraph line is injured by parties of guerrillas, the citizens living
                        within five miles of the spot shall be turned out <emph rend="italic">en
                            masse</emph> to repair the damage, and shall besides pay to the United
                        States in money, or in property, to be levied by military force, the full
                        amount of the pay and subsistence of the whole force necessary to coerce the
                        performance of the work during the time occupied in completing it.</p>
                    <p>If any soldier or legitimate follower of the army be fired upon from any
                        house, the house shall be razed to the ground and the inhabitants sent
                        prisoners to the head-quarters of this army. If such an outrage occur at any
                        place distant from the settlements, the people within five miles around
                        shall be held accountable and made to pay an indemnity sufficient for the
                        case. Any persons detected in such outrages either during the act or at any
                        time afterwards shall be shot without waiting civil process.</p>
                    <p>No such acts can influence the result of this war, and they can only lead to
                        heavy affliction to the population to no purpose. It is, the
                        e[illegible]fore, enjoined upon all persons, both for the security of their
                        own property and the safety of their own persons that they act vigorously
                        and cordially together to prevent the perpetration of such outrages.</p>
                    <p>Whilst it is the wish of the General commanding this army, that all peaceably
                        disposed persons who remain at their homes and pursue their accustomed
                        avocations shall be subjected to no improper burthen of war, yet their own
                        safety must of necessity depend upon the strict preservation of peace and
                        order among themselves, and they are to understand that nothing will deter
                        him from enforcing promptly and to the full extent, every provision of this
                        order.</p>
                    <p>By command of Major-General Pope <lb/>G D Ruggles, Col. A A G and Chief of
                        Staff.</p>

                <summary>A reprint of Lincoln's message to Congress regarding the confiscation bills
                    sent to him by Congress. Lincoln substantially approves of most of the sections,
                    and argues that it is not a great leap to claim that those in rebellion against
                    the government forfeit their property to the government. When that property is
                    slaves, says Lincoln, they should be freed rather than resold. Lincoln had some
                    objections to the terms under which land would be expropriated, and suggested
                    remedies to bring them within constitutional limits.</summary>
