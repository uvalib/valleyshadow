                    <p>The poisoning of wells, the wanton tearing up and destruction of railroads,
                        engines, and cars, the employment of thousands of remorseless savages, the
                        seizure and abuse of the possessions of their own friends--these are the
                        characteristics of a rebellion which challenges the indignation and
                        amazement of the civilized world. When we reflect that the men guilty of
                        these excesses claim to be enlightened, and persist in charging upon the
                        United States Government their own public and private crimes, we may well
                        pause before the sublime spectacle of the moderation and magnanimity of our
                        own moderation and magnanimity of our own soldiers. Who can doubt the object
                        of the traitors when they began this war? It was not to secure their rights
                        but to inflict irreparable injury upon the authority that had defended them,
                        and nothing but the bravery of our troops has prevented the repetition of
                        these barbarities on Northern soil. Is it not surprising that such marauders
                        and ruffians should find men to sympathize with them in the loyal
                        States--men who, while ignoring the vices and villainies of the traitors,
                        openly rejoice over their victories and bewail their defeats?--Phil. Press.</p>

                    hardship for a country as wealthy as the United States.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is, perhaps, no debt so hard to the American people to pay as their
                        taxes. Whilst this seems to be the case, the Spirit (which avails itself of every opportunity to put forth its
                        secession proclivities, and thus aid indirectly in the cause of rebellion)
                        attempts to poison the minds of its readers by holding up before them the
                        most erroneous ideas of the national taxation which this hellish rebellion
                        has rendered necessary for the government to levy. If the Spirit would pause and reflect a little, it might
                        ascertain that the leaders in this rebellion have always acknowledged
                        allegiance to its party, and have felt insulted when called anything else
                        than Democrats. It might see, too, that where it finds a traitor it will
                        find one who was formerly a Democrat, and that the most influential among
                        traitors have been eulogized and puffed in its columns. It finds fault too
                        with those in power, distorts, misconstrues, and perverts whatever is said
                        or done by them. A message or proclamation may be so plain that the
                        school-boys may understand it, yet the Spirit,
                        true to its instincts, goes to work, and, if nothing else will do, most
                        glaringly falsifies the whole affair. We could not occupy our columns with
                        extracts from this secession sheet, but will only call attention to what we
                        consider a correct view of the taxation, which we as loyal citizens must
                        cheerfully bear. Those who have undertaken to destroy our Government have
                        brought upon us a terrible civil war, which must be quelled. The loyal
                        people of the North have put forth their energies to accomplish this
                        purpose. The question naturally presents itself, how can the enormous
                        expenditure which this will create be met? It is answered in a word,
                        Taxation. Without this, our Government cannot succeed, and the Spirit well knows that its efforts to poison the
                        public mind upon this question is going no loyal service to our cause.</p>
                    <p>We have good men in the field and on "the wave," with able generals and
                        admirals, but that will avail nothing unless our Government sustain its
                        credit. The present generation should not be required to meet the heavy
                        expense of this war, and as posterity will be benefitted [sic] as much and
                        more than the present generation, then they in justice should be compelled
                        to bear a pat of this burden. How can this be done? The answer is, by
                        Taxation.</p>
                    <p>But what will be the extent of this taxation? The amount expended in this war
                        alone may amount to six hundred millions. This is indeed a large sum, but to
                        a country like ours it is small, and should not occasion a murmur. Let the
                        loyal people of the North pay the interest annually, which amounts to
                        thirty-six millions, and less than one-third of what our Government cost the
                        people a year, when James Buchanan was President. The Secretary of the
                        Treasury says, that the real and personal values in the States loyal to the
                        Union are eleven thousand millions of dollars, and the yearly surplus
                        earnings of the loyal people are estimated at more than four hundred
                        millions of dollars. Now a tax of nine per cent, on this surplus, would pay the interest on six hundred millions. This,
                        when properly considered, is not so alarming after all, and in times like
                        these, and for objects like those which now claim the attention of our
                        Government, any man who refuses to pay nine per cent. of his surplus
                        earnings does not deserve the protection of a good government. And the man
                        who will misconstrue these facts, and endeavor to excite the public mind to
                        a misapprehension of this matter is not a loyal citizen, nor is the Spirit in this respect a loyal paper.</p>
                    <p>Our honest farmers and laborers have nothing to fear from taxation; it will
                        not be so burdensome as they at first blush might suppose. Even should it
                        prove burdensome, is it not better to lie peaceably under a good government,
                        with heavy taxes, than to be compelled to submit to a worse government with
                        still heavier taxes. The blessings of a government like ours are invaluable,
                        and cannot be estimated by money.</p>
                    <p>The Spirit talks and prates about the flood of
                        paper money that will flow over our country. This, however large the flood
                        may be, will injure no man, if the credit of the Government be sustained and
                        the interest of the national debt promptly met by taxation. We must not
                        become frightened because the country suffered from the vast amount of paper
                        that was issued during the Revolution. It is true that this paper became
                        worthless, but is was because there was no limit to its issue, and no
                        provision for its redemption or the payment of interest. The Congress of
                        that day had no power to lay a tax, and the States being entirely without
                        resources, and acting without any material understanding, became at variance
                        with each other. There then was no taxation, no provision for the payment of
                        interest, and no redemption, and consequently the paper money which was
                        issued wholesale, rapidly sank to its proper level of worthlessness. The
                        people know something of the history of this paper currency, and therefore
                        dread it. Let them, however, consider the peculiar circumstances of our
                        Government at that day, the character of that paper currency, and the
                        condition of our Government now, its vast resources and power, and the
                        legislation upon taxation, and no one can have the least apprehension, but
                        cheerfully unite in aiding the Government by the payment of their full share
                        of taxation. </p>
