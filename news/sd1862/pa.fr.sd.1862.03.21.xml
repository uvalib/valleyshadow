                <excerpt>"This series of brilliant victories is gradually unfolding the vast plan of
                    operations, and even more triumphs in the not far distant future will bring the
                    most satisfactory evidence that the movements of Gen. McClellan, and the
                    evacuation of Mannassas by the Rebels, were but the grand prelude to the most
                    decisive and crushing blows upon the head of the Rebellion that we shall yet
                    applaud with triumphant shouts."</excerpt>

                    vindicate General McClellan against the charges of those who have "abused and
                    maligned" him. Also suggests that nine-tenths of the American people have always
                    continued to trust the General as the leader of the federal troops.</summary>
