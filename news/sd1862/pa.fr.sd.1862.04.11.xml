                <summary>Answers the Valley Spirit's claim that the Republicans were the ones who
                    immediately answered the President's call for troops and thus are responsible
                    for the war. The Dispatch agrees that the Republicans did respond promptly to
                    the President's call and proposes that the Democrats had just as much reason to
                    fight to uphold the Constitution and the Union as did the Republicans.</summary>
