                <summary>Suggests that the tariff be increased, since the proposed tax bill
                    presently being considered in Congress imposes little financial burden on the
                    agricultural interest or the large landholders, but causes the manufacturing,
                    mechanical, and laboring interests to shoulder most of the burden for the war.</summary>

                    one is actuated by the noblest impulses of the soul; that no mercenary principle
                    designates his struggle; but the love of Country, of freedom and of the
                    Government established by his fathers, urges him on to a noble daring, that
                    knows no fear, and perils all for the priceless boon."</excerpt>
