                    foreign powers, as the approaching trial, allotted us by Providence, through
                    which we will reach a glorious destiny. Right and power shall be maintained over
                    our broad domain of Freedom, and millions, schooled in the use of arms, shall
                    defy the base purposes of the tyrannies of the Old World!"</excerpt>

                <summary>The Dispatch argues that once the government has suppressed the rebellion
                    successfully, then the United States will be prepared to defeat England if a war
                    does occur. Speculates as to whether England will go to war against the United
                    States.</summary>
