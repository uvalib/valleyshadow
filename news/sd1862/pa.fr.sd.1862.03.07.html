<b>Somebody is Lying</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Questions whether the Valley Spirit or William Yancey is telling the truth.
                    The Valley Spirit has argued that the "Abolitionist Party"--the
                    Republicans--drove the South out of the Union, while Yancey has written that the
                    South does not fight to preserve slavery in the face of the abolitionist
                    tendencies of President Lincoln, who they admit guaranteed that slavery would be
                    preserved under his government, but to protect their political power.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit has kept up a constant howl about
                        Abolitionism, charging the present Rebellion upon the policy and acts of the
                        Republican, or, "Abolition" party, as it calls it. This has been and is the
                        burden of its weekly issue, mixed up with just such arguments against the
                        course pursued by the Government to restore the Union as those used by the
                        veriest Southern Rebels that now run unhung.</p>
                    <p>Somebody is lying--who is it? In connection with Mason and Slidell, the South
                        has a host of agents in England and France to beg those Governments to
                        recognize the Slave Oligarchy as an independent power. Among these agents is
                        the notorious Wm. L. Yancey, of Alabama, and others equally base, who have
                        addressed a letter to the British Parliament for the purpose of operating
                        upon the anti-slavery sentiment of England, and thus prejudice our
                        Government in our estimation, the better to secure favors from the English
                        Government. In that letter these base traitors have, among other things,
                        made the following honest and truthful declarations:--</p>
                    <p>"It was from no fear that the slaves would be liberated that secession took
                        place. The very party in power has proposed to guarantee slavery forever in
                        the States, if the South would but remain in the Union. Mr. Lincoln's
                        message proposes no freedom to the slave. * * * * * * The great object of
                        the war, therefore, is not to free the slave, but to keep him in subjection
                        to his owner, and to control his labor through the legislative channels
                        which the Lincoln government designs to force upon the master."</p>
                    <p>Somebody is lying in this matter, and we leave the reader to judge who it is.
                        The Spirit says, but for the election of Lincoln
                        and the fear of the South that the Republican party would abolish Slavery,
                        there would have been no attempt at subverting the Government. Yancey says,
                        "It is from no fear that the slaves would be liberated that Secession took
                        place," &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Does not this prove most conclusively that the Spirit's assertions are most untruthful and reckless. The truth is,
                        that as soon as the Southern politicians found that they could no longer
                        control the Government, and shape its policy for their own benefit, at the
                        expense of the working millions of the Free States, they determined to break
                        it up. </p>

                    <p>There will be a division of sentiment in Congress on the proper attitude
                        which our Government should assume towards the States now in rebellion. Mr.
                        Ashley, of Ohio, has a bill, which is on the basis of the Sumner
                        resolutions, and has been approved by the Committees on Territories of the
                        Senate and the House, which virtually destroys all State Governments, and
                        establishes Territorial Governments in their places, without any power to
                        legislate for the protection of slavery, which is thus virtually abolished.
                        In opposition to this scheme is a bill offered by Senator Davis, of
                        Kentucky, which provides for the punishment of traitors, but protects the
                        loyal inhabitants of States in re-organizing their State Governments.--Each
                        bill is declared by its friends to have the support of the Administration,
                        but it is believed that the Cabinet are divided.</p>
