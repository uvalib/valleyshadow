<b>The Embarrassment of the Government</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Complains of the government's policy that allows Southern sympathizers to
                    remain in office within the federal government.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Who, that is heartily devoted to the great cause of our country, is not
                        prepared to applaud any policy looking towards the speedy and effectual
                        suppression of this monstrous Rebellion? Who, that is really in earnest, in
                        his profession of attachment to our holy cause, can maintain a studied
                        reticence on the damning infamy of the authors of the Rebellion, and raise
                        his voice in opposition to every safe measure of State policy? Who, in fine,
                        can sympathise with rebels, and call himself a true friend of the Government
                        and country? If the uprooting of Slavery will the more speedily end the war,
                        and save the Union, God speed a universal emancipation! If an honorable
                        adjustment of the Trent affair has averted a war at this time with Great
                        Britain, which might have threatened the very existence of the Government,
                        it has also settled forever a principle of maritime right for which we have
                        ever contended. If those soi-distant loyalists
                        profess such unbounded sympathy for rebels and their institution of Slavery,
                        right-thinking men cannot hesitate to regard all their professions of
                        loyalty only as the protecting shield of perjured traitors!</p>
                    <p>We have propounded a few questions, and have undertaken to answer them for
                        our readers. TO them, as well as ourselves, they cannot fail to prove the
                        basis of a very unpleasant theme; yet it is a subject upon which most of us
                        have spent serious thought. When men, occupying positions in the army, and
                        seats in both branches of Congress, and clerkships in the several
                        Departments, bestow aid and comfort, directly or indirectly, to the enemy,
                        the wonder is often expressed that the sternest justice is not meted out to
                        such secret enemies of the Government. If in any investigation, partial
                        evidence of guilt is only adduced, a dismissal of the case is followed by a
                        continuance in office, and that everlasting bond of future good behavior, a
                        renewal of their fealty to the Government. Soldiers, as well as civilians,
                        have even thus been favored, while there was sufficient ground for grave
                        charges against them, and it only required time for the development of the
                        most conclusive proof of their guilt. Semi-traitors, infesting the
                        Departments, are actually known, and good-natured conservatives and peace-men regard
                        them with fatherly complacency. While the Army, Congress and the
                        Departments, have within them these sympathisers with traitors, can we
                        marvel that the President, Chiefs of Departments, and Chiefs in command of
                        the Grand Army, look around them with distrust and embarrassment?</p>
                    <p>Since Southern sympathisers in Congress oppose every measure that they
                        conceive hostile to Slavery, we cannot wonder that officers in the Army have
                        employed men of their command in the degrading work of capturing fugitive
                        slaves and restoring them to their rebel masters. Instead of "saving the
                        Union by letting Slavery take care of itself," conservative Border State men
                        and Southern sympathisers in Congress would reverse the proposition, by
                        saving the institution of Slavery and letting the Union take care of itself!
                        There are various ways, with such soulless men, of discovering their
                        sympathy for the rebels, one of which is Vallandigham's fierce denunciation
                        of the Administration for adjusting our difficulty with England, and thus
                        sinking the hopes of Southern traitors, who meant with foreign aid to carry
                        out their nefarious plan of breaking up the Government. Another involuntary
                        discovery of this sympathy is the conduct of a certain brigadier in
                        permitting a notorious rebel general and his army to escape, when they might
                        have been captured. This Federal officer, doubtless, felt assured of
                        approval and sympathy from the Vallandighams of the House! Even such
                        disasters as Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, no one can doubt, have been subjects
                        of private rejoicing among this class of pseudo-loyalists.</p>
                    <p>None need wonder at the embarrassment of the Government, environed as it is
                        by influences so inimical to all safe and effective measures in the vigorous
                        prosecution of the war. The inactivity which prevails along the various
                        lines of operation might be attributed to the distrust which the Government
                        may have for certain officers in the Army, and to the betrayal of important
                        information to the enemy by those underlings who infest the Departments. The
                        time, however, is approaching when such abuse of trust, confided to men in
                        the Army and under the Government, will not only be thoroughly exposed but
                        justly punished. Then, when the traitors of the rebel States shall have been
                        at our mercy, and the Union re-established upon an enduring basis, will the
                        labor of a day be accomplished in cleansing the Augean stable of its
                        treasonable foulness, and placing true loyalists in positions held now by
                        men who wink at treason, whom the President and Cabinet, overlooking their
                        defection, generously continue in office.</p>

                    <p>The establishment, known as the "Lemnos Edge Tool Factory," of this place,
                        has, we understand, changed hands. The new proprietors, embracing some four
                        or five, or more, of the monied and business men of our town, it is said
                        contemplate, in the course of time, not only to manufacture on an extensive
                        scale all kinds of Edge Tools, but also Shovels, Spades, Forks, and other
                        articles, which are made in the East, brought here by dealers all over the
                        country and sold at a profit.</p>
                    <p>This is as it should be. With the facilities of machinery and water power,
                        what is to interfere with the profitable manufacture, in Chambersburg, of
                        such articles as we have named, that does not exist in the manufacturing
                        towns of the Eastern States? We have many advantages, indeed, that are not
                        possessed by them; the capital is here, but what we need most is enterprise, and we trust this new movement will
                        result in the arousing of our town out of its Rip Van Winkle slumber. </p>
