<b>Freedom in the District</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Echoes the answer given by the Washington National Republican and the Press
                    to those who have denounced the abolition of slavery in the District of
                    Columbia. Reprints several paragraphs from a petition submitted to Congress in
                    1828 by residents of the District asking that a scheme for gradual emancipation
                    be implemented.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Parson Brownlow at the Methodist Book Concern, Cincinnati</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Summarizes Parson Brownlow's speech, in which he outlined the position and
                    actions of the clergy in the South that he had encountered. The parson stated
                    that most of them were secessionists, and that the few who were not could do
                    little more than denounce secession, or they would be hung, regardless of their
                    age.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Movements at Yorktown</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Predicts that the next great battle of the war will take place at Yorktown,
                    and that if the Union forces are able to defeat a Southern force that appears to
                    be well prepared and well led, the victory would be of the utmost importance for
                    the North.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Memorial from the Colored People</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that the African-American people of Washington have presented a
                    memorial to Congress in which they express their gratitude for the recent action
                    by which they were able to secure their freedom. In the memorial, however, they
                    also requested a place to which they might emigrate and suggested Central
                    America for the purpose.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Prisoner Shot at the Old Capitol Prison</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates that a prisoner who refused to follow an order to remove his head
                    from his window was shot by a guard at the Old Capitol Prison in Hagerstown.<br>

<b>The Junior Indignant</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Berates the Valley Spirit for its grammatical and typographical errors and
                    suggests that they employ "more experienced writers."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Another Disloyal Democrat</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that the committee investigating the alleged disloyalty of Senator
                    Starke from Oregon has determined that he offered support to the Confederacy and
                    therefore was indeed disloyal to the government of the United States.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The True Reason</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Refutes the claim made by the Valley Spirit that it is the existence of
                    abolitionists and not of slavery that is to blame for the war. Argues that the
                    Spirit is not condemning the crime but the attempt to get rid of the crime as
                    the evil.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Spirit and the Workingmen</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Points out that the Valley Spirit has attempted to deny the Dispatch's
                    charge that by ridiculing what the Spirit calls "small politicians" it has
                    "sneered" at the workingmen of Chambersburg. The Dispatch again defends the
                    artisans of the town from ill treatment in the press by the Spirit.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>From Memphis</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that the South still claims the battle at Pittsburg Landing as a
                    victory, allegedly because more Union men were killed, wounded, or taken
                    prisoner than were Confederate men.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that several escaped slaves arrived in Chambersburg the previous
                    Tuesday morning and have been "loitering" around town since. The Dispatch
                    remarks that the fugitives should maintain "eternal vigilance" while there are
                    still Breckinridge Democrats in town.<br>

                    looking for a place to live and was taken in by Mr. F. Walk of Guilford

                    attempting to steal a horse from Mr. Groosman, while the latter was attending
                    church. The boy is now in prison.<br>(Names in announcement:  James Stout, Mr. F. Walk, Mr.  Groosman)</blockquote>
