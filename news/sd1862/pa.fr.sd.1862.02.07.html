                    <p>How They Enjoy Themselves.</p>
                    <p>Corporal Merrill, a Union soldier, lately released from imprisonment in
                        Richmond, writes his experience, while there, which is published in the
                        Rochester Express. We quote the following, which
                        will be found interesting:</p>
                    <p>
                        A Promotion.
                    </p>
                    <p>Shortly after my arrival from the hospital to the prison, I was permitted,
                        through the agency of Messrs. Ely and Huson, to visit the officers' quarters
                        during the day, but at night was required to return to the second floor.
                        This peculiar privilege was granted me till, at the request of the
                        commissioned officers generally, my name was transferred to their own list,
                        and I thenceforth became a permanent occupant of the lower room.</p>
                    <p>There were between sixty and seventy in this department of the prison,
                        ranking from colonel to lieutenant--the only civilians being Messrs. Ely and
                        Huson, of Rochester, Mr. Flagler, of Virginia, and Mr. Taylor, of Ohio.</p>
                    <p>
                        Housekeeping.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the first two or three months of their imprisonment, the officers
                        enjoyed few conveniences superior to those of the privates; but after
                        obtaining remittances from the North, a considerable improvement was
                        effected in this regard. Tables were erected, cots and blankets procured,
                        and knives and forks were added to the facilities for eating. They clubbed
                        together in messes, and lived chiefly at their own expense. Privates were
                        employed for the culinary work, and everything, with the exception of the
                        meat (which was prepared in the yard), was cooked over the gas-burners. The
                        prison was furnished with one cylinder coal stove, which answered only for
                        heating purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        High Prices.
                    </p>
                    <p>The standard bill of fare consisted of beefsteaks and bread, which were
                        furnished by the Confederacy; coffee, adulterated with corn, at $1.25 per
                        pound; sweet potatoes, $1.50 per bushel. Some of the messes obtained butter,
                        which, if I remember correctly, cost seventy five cents per pound. Eggs were
                        scarce at five cents apiece; nutmegs, for an occasional pudding, ten cents
                        each; whisky, on physician's "prescription," fifty cents a pint; common
                        molasses, twenty five cents per quart.</p>
                    <p>There was a great scarcity of provisions in Richmond and "Lincoln's Blockade"
                        was denounced by the rebels in unmeasured terms. Salt sold from $18 to $26
                        per sack; boots, from $20 to $26 per pair; clothing was fabulously high, and
                        very little to be obtained at any price. Ordinary note paper cost two cents
                        per sheet, and buff envelopes ditto. In short, ruinous prices were demanded
                        for everything but cotton, and for this there were no callers.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Prison Association.
                    </p>
                    <p>The origin of the Richmond Prison Association was a meeting of the officers
                        to devise plans for their comfort. It resulted in the election of a
                        president and secretary, and the organization of a society under the above
                        title, whose regular meetings were held weekly. Hon. Alfred Ely was the
                        presiding officer, and Mr. Edward Taylor the secretary. The first order of
                        business was the election of candidates, who were formally introduced in a
                        speech from the "page," (Lieut. Hart,) and were afterwards requested to
                        respond, which they usually did by recounting the manner of their capture,
                        &amp;c. The "test question" was then put: "What did you come down here
                        for?" and then the fun commenced in earnest.</p>
                    <p>The following song, composed by the "page," was sung in the prison every
                        evening, to the tune of the "Poor Pilgrim:"</p>
                    <p>Come, fellow prisoners, let's join in a song; <br>Our stay in the prison, it
                        won't be long; <br>CHORUS--Roll on, roll on, sweet moments, roll on,
                        <br>And let the poor prisoner gos [sic] home, go home.</p>
                    <p>Our friends at home have made a demand <br>To have returned this patriot
                        band. <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>The public press they are bound to obey. <br>For from the people they
                        receive their pay. <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>Congressman Ely is first on the list, <br>He'll soon be there, our friends
                        to assist <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>And give to his mind its wildest range. <br>To "spread himself" on the theme
                        of exchange. <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>This is the way I long have sought. <br>And mourned because I found it not.
                        <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>If you get there before I do, <br>Look out for me, for I'm coming too.
                        <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>For now that the thing has got a start, <br>They have concluded to send old
                        Hart. <br>[Chorus.]</p>
                    <p>The enchanting effect with which this eloquent and affecting production was
                        rendered by the united voices of the association, usually attracted a large
                        crowd of citizens to the prison windows; and it was the general conviction
                        of the inmates that the nation had lost a brilliant poet in winning a
                        gallant soldier.</p>
                    <p>The sessions of the society were highly entertaining. Mr. Ely, I understand,
                        has in his possession a record of the proceedings taken by himself,
                        including sketches of the speeches, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>
                        Love at First Sight and Without Sight.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have before stated that some of the private soldiers, from the upper rooms,
                        were employed in the officers' quarters, a service which they gladly
                        accepted as affording superior rations. Among these was Corporal M----n, of
                        New York, a young man of wealthy parentage, of attractive manners, good
                        intellectual endowments--and withal "handsome as Apollo."</p>
                    <p>At the request of some of the officers, he was occasionally permitted to
                        visit the lower floor, and, upon one occasion, was permitted to leave the
                        prison on parole, for the purpose of purchasing supplies. While thus passing
                        through one of the main thoroughfares, M-----n was accosted by a little
                        girl, who presented him with a bouquet, at the same time, pointing to a
                        young lady, on the opposite side of the street, as the donor.--The corporal
                        acknowledged the gift, by a polite bow, and proceeded upon his mission. The
                        lady, apparently fascinated, followed him at a distance to the prison, and,
                        as he entered it, she reciprocated his bow, and leisurely walked away.</p>
                    <p>For some inexplicable cause the corporal was not again permitted to go out,
                        and a negro--I should have mentioned that quite a number of servants were in
                        the prison--was despatched [sic] in his stead. The negro had not proceeded
                        far when he was met by the young lady referred to, and the sequel to the
                        interview was developed in a package with which he returned to the officers'
                        quarters, and delivered to Corporal M----n. It was found to contain a new
                        suit of clothes, and upon one garment was pinned a small card, neatly
                        inscribed with the name of his benefactress:</p>
                    <p>"Only this, and nothing more."</p>
                    <p>Corporal M----n instantly addressed himself to the task of epistolary
                        composition, in which he gracefully acknowledged the receipt of the gift,
                        and expressed his heartfelt thanks. This was delivered by the negro on the
                        day following, and he returned with a package containing a number of
                        pocket-handkerchiefs, socks, and shirts!</p>
                    <p>As in the first instance, the only communication which accompanied the gift
                        was the donor's card. The corporal again acknowledged his obligations by a
                        polite note, which was duly delivered through the same medium.</p>
                    <p>Thenceforth the corporal was in daily receipt of the choicest dainties, and a
                        regular epistolary correspondence was carried on until the day of his
                        release, which occurred on the 3d of January. A matrimonial engagement had
                        been made during the interval, with the understanding that the parties would
                        meet in Baltimore on the 1st of March next.</p>
                    <p>I have omitted to state that the corporal had been sent back to his old
                        quarters, but having ascertained that his fair inamorata daily promenaded within view of the officers' quarters, he
                        obtained employment as a cook, and was thereafter unfailing at his post to
                        reciprocate the loving smiles of his betrothed.</p>
                    <p>She had sent him her daguerreotype, which he frequently exhibited to me. It
                        was a lovely image, and one that would have required no "collateral"
                        inducement to carry captive the most frigid and lethargic fancy. I learned
                        that she was of a wealthy family, and of as good blood as was to be found
                        among the F. F. V.'s and her letters, I was assured, evinced that she was no
                        less intelligent and refined.</p>
                    <p>When the glad news of our release came, the name of Corporal M-----n was
                        found in the list. The intelligence was quickly conveyed to his yearning
                        admirer. We saw nothing of her, however, as we marched through the streets
                        of Richmond, though the corporal's longing vision was strained at every
                        ultimate object.</p>
                    <p>But when a halt was ordered, a fine carriage, driven by a negro, suddenly
                        made its appearance, and halted at a short distance from our ranks. A lady
                        descended--there was a brief, but earnest colloquy among the Confederate
                        officers of our guard, and the next moment the enraptured twain (Corporal
                        M----n and his affianced) were face to face. A few words, the first they
                        ever exchanged in person, were exchanged in subdued, yet melting tones;
                        their faces were for a moment lighted, as with a flame--the engagement was
                        sacredly renewed--there was a fervent, thrilling pressure of their hands,
                        and they separated.</p>
                    <p>A circumstance is connected with the daguerreotype above referred to, which
                        deserves a passing notice. Before it left the prison, the picture was taken
                        from the case, and a small slip of paper, closely written, and addressed to
                        Gen. M'Clellan, was deposited therein, and the daguerreotype then replaced.
                        It was safely delivered to the commander-in-chief, a meeting of the Cabinet
                        was called, and the day following there was a leak stopped--a mysterious
                        leak, from high official circles, and which has inestimably benefitted [sic]
                        the rebels for many months.</p>

<b>Extraordinary Confession</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>When the case of Senator Bright, of Indiana, was up for consideration, in the
                        U. S. Senate, a few days ago, Mr. McDougall, (Democrat) of California,
                        addressed the Senate at length on the question, and we find the following
                        language in the report of the Congressional proceedings as the substance of
                        his remarks on the occasion. He said:--</p>
                    <p>"We were at war, and had been at war, at least of opinion, since 1832. There
                        had been a continual organized war against the principle of constitutional
                        government. He contended there had been a regular plan to bring about
                        Secession, which was well known to Democrats and to
                        HIM, (Mr. McDougall,) and as a DEMOCRAT the
                            Senator from Indiana must have known the fact!"</p>
                    <p>Here is a deliberate, premeditated, and candid admission of a Democratic
                        Senator, that there had been a "regular plan to bring
                            about Secession, WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN TO DEMOCRATS, and known to him, and, as A DEMOCRAT, the Senator from Indiana must have known of the
                        fact!"</p>
                    <p>Senator Bright is now arraigned before the Senate on the charge of Treason.
                        His offence consists of having written a letter to Jeff. Davis, introducing
                        to his acquaintance a man named Lincoln, who had an improved fire-arm, which
                        he, (Lincoln) wished to have Davis adopt in the army of the Rebel States,
                        and in alluding to this letter, Mr. McDougall said:--</p>
                    <p>"The war, which had been so long planned, was actively inaugurated before the
                        letter was written to Davis, and he, (Mr. McDougall) could consider that
                        letter in no other light than an act of treason. A Senator of the U. States
                        who, knowing all the facts, could write such a letter, was not fit to remain
                        in the councils of the nation. Treason was the highest of all crimes and
                        ought to receive severe punishment."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bright, as a Democrat, we have no doubt knew
                        all about the "regular plan" of the rebellion. Mr. McDougall honestly
                        confesses that it "was well known to him," and
                        that, so well informed were Democrats upon the subject, that Mr. McDougall
                        exclaims with a great deal of earnestness, that, owing to the prominent
                        position occupied by Senator Bright in the councils of his party, as a Democrat, he "MUST have
                            known of the fact" also.</p>
                    <p>Let this extraordinary, candid, deliberate, premeditated and honest
                        confession of a Democratic Senator be remembered.</p>
                    <p>We believe that Mr. Bright is guilty of treason, but is Mr. McDougall, as
                        well as hundreds of other Democratic leaders, to whom this "regular plan of
                        secession" was so "well known," altogether innocent in their conduct? Why
                        did they not apprise the country of the fact long ago, and thus prevent the
                        awful blood-shed and suffering that has resulted and will continue to flow
                        from the rebellion while it lasts? Forewarned is to be forearmed. Why did
                        not these Democratic leaders sound the alarm, like a fire-bell at midnight,
                        and arouse the country from the lethargy into which it had fallen, an thus
                        save it from the horrors of rebellion and civil strife? Mr. McDougall
                        candidly confesses that the "plan" "was well known to
                            Democrats, and known to him, and as a Democrat the Senator from Indiana MUST have
                        known of the fact" also.</p>
                    <p>Well, it is said "a candid confession is good for the soul," and we trust the
                        soul of Mr. McDougall will receive all the benefit that may result from his
                        candor; but after this we do trust that we may be saved the necessity of
                        defending the present Administration as being responsible for the war. All
                        well-informed people know and believe what Mr. McDougall has said, to be
                        true, and yet, the unprincipled, the reckless and the dishonest portion of
                        the Democratic journals, as well as politicians, persist in denouncing the
                        Republican party as having caused the war. They characterize it as "a
                        Lincoln--Curtin War," "an Abolition War," and other equally silly
                        assertions, for the purpose of prejudicing the ignorant, and, thereby, from
                        among the wreck and ruin of a country, to try and save at least the
                        fragments of a party!</p>

                    <p>From the Louisville Journal.</p>
                    <p>Camp Wood, January 24, 1862.--A special correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette, writing from Munfordsville, Ky., in
                        describing the conduct of certain regiments on the 17th instant, speaks thus
                        of the Pennsylvanians:</p>
                    <p>"The 77th and 79th Pennsylvania remained in the entrenchments. Four companies
                        of the 79th Pennsylvania were sent out to make a reconnoisance to Horse
                        Cave. Arriving at that point, they heard firing, which seemed to come from
                        their rear, when they suddenly conceived the idea that it was the enemy, and
                        that they were likely to be cut off. This was enough. It is believed the
                        Pennsylvanians became panic stricken. At Horse Cave, where the railroad and
                        turnpike diverge part took the turnpike and part the railroad, coming
                        together again at Rowlett's station. Which party it was that despatched the
                        courier is not clear--most likely the party that returned by the pike. Judge
                        of the mutual surprise when they met at Rowlett's. It was supposed that the
                        firing was on the left, and played the will-o'-the-wisp caper which so
                        frightened the Pennsylvanians. In the hurried retreat of the Pennsylvanians
                        they scattered the report that the enemy was approaching to attack us."</p>
                    <p>These statements, from first to last, are infamously false. Pennsylvanians
                        little desire that kind of bravery which only appears in newspapers; but
                        when a mean and cowardly imputation is cast upon their courage and military
                        demeanor, they are not willing to pass it unnoticed, unanswered, or
                        unrebuked.</p>
                    <p>Now for the facts. On the morning of the 17th inst., a detachment of 180 men
                        from the 79th Regiment, P. V., by request, started on a reconnoisance in the
                        direction of Horse Cave. At one P. M. distant firing was heard--musketry,
                        soon followed by artillery. Simultaneously with this, a bugle signal was
                        detected to proceed from some point in front of our outlying picket.</p>
                    <p>This signal was thought by a bugler who was with the remaining companies of
                        the 79th (on tour of duty at the outposts), to come from his bugle comrade,
                        who accompanied the reconnoitering party. As the shrill tones reverberated
                        from hill top to hill top, they were ascertained to be the "rally for skirmishers." Two citizens of Kentucky
                        and a captain from the same State, came hurriedly in and informed Colonel
                        H., commanding the 79th, that his scouts were attacked by a superior force,
                        and also that the enemy were advancing in a large body. This same Kentucky
                        captain carried the news to the interior, and not
                        the Pennsylvanians, as asserted by the special
                        correspondent of the Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Colonel H., of she [sic] 79th, feeling it a duty to move forward a short
                        distance to the support of his own scouts, ordered a signal sounded for five
                        companies to rally to the centre, also sent a messenger to Colonel S., of
                        the 77th to ocupy [sic] temporarily the outposts thus rendered vacant.</p>
                    <p>Two companies of the 79th, one on the right and the other on the left,
                        remained firm at their posts. Regiment after regiment filed over the pontoon
                        bridge--some occupying positions within the entrenchments, others passed a
                        few hundred yards beyond but aside from the pike. The approaches by which an
                        enemy might have entered were guarded by unaided
                            Pennsylvanians. The correspondent states "that the 77th and 79th
                        Pennsylvania Volunteers remained in the entrenchments." This is false. Not a single member of the 79th was at any time
                        during the excitement within or behind the breastworks. Three companies of
                        the 77th were promptly placed under the command of Colonel H., of the 79th.
                        The remaining companies were distributed at the outposts and held in
                        reserve.</p>
                    <p>"It is believed the Pennsylvanians were panic stricken." Undoubtedly, by this
                        correspondent, who seems to have been on the north side of the river--at
                        least two miles from any danger. Let us see. The reconnoitering party
                        proceeded to Horse Cave, and was welcomed there as the first detachment from
                        the Federal Army.</p>
                    <p>The scouts returned in good order--in a body--were
                        not alarmed; neither were they aware any alarm had been given. Those led by
                        Colonel H. to aid his detachment, marched southward about two miles, when an
                        official messenger ordered the forces to retreat.</p>
                    <p>Colonel H. directed no one to transmit intelligence to head-quarters, and was
                        really astonished to learn, upon his return.</p>
                    <p>From the above, it is clear that the "will-o'-the-wisp caper" did not
                        frighten the Pennsylvanians, and, as no retreat was made, the statement that
                        "the report of the enemy's approach being scattered," merges into the common
                        falsehood that distinguishes this correspondent's letter.</p>
                    <p>"They met at Rowlett's Station." No such thing--they met at the point of
                            starting.--These are the facts. Your readers
                        may decide the question of cowardice for themselves. It is to be regreted
                        [sic] that any falsehoods, so grave in their tendency, should ever have
                        emanated from military sources. Doubly so, when we reflect that, although
                        from many States, we are one soldiery, enlisted
                        under one banner, ready to bathe its glorious folds in the warmest blood of
                        our bosoms, and as one people looking down to
                        futurity for the benefits and blessings those who now fight our battles must
                        secure.</p>
                    <p>Pennsylvanians have a profound contempt for unearned laurels; they do not
                        covet plaudits undeserved, but their indignation at this wanton assault upon
                        their courage and valor can be better imagined than described. They claim
                        (and challenge dispute) to have gone, at this date, several miles further
                        into the enemy's country than any other troops in the central
                        division--never to have been caught in a trap--never to have had their
                        pickets driven in surprised--never to have had buildings or wood fired with
                        200 yards of their line of pickets--never to have permitted the destruction
                        of property in full view of their posts.</p>
                    <p>I have much to speak of the noble manner in which Ohio, Indiana and other
                        Wester [sic] States responded to the call for succor from loyal Kentucky. I
                        have much to speak of Kentucky herself--of all the Generals--but still more
                        to say to your readers, that, under the leadership of the accomplished
                        Generl [sic] Negley and three gallant Colonels, the Pennsylvanians propose
                        to carve their fortunes by deeds, and to write the glad or the mournful tale
                        of their military careere [sic] with their swords.</p>
                    <p>A PENNSYLVANIAN.</p>
