                <head>Would Additional Railroads Benefit Our Farmers?</head>

                    <p>The impression is general that the agricultural element of our country, the
                        largest in number, and much the wealthiest, is less anxious for its further
                        development by means of railroads than any other. This conclusion would seem
                        to be satisfactorily reached from the fact that our farmers never lead, and
                        reluctantly follow, all such enterprises, though there are a number of other
                        reasons perhaps more specific, which would satisfactorily account for their
                        apparent lack of enterprise. Whatever the true reason may be, it is not that
                        farmers are wanting in energy and perseverence to accomplish a work which
                        their judgment tells them must result vastly more in their material
                        prosperity than that of any other class of our citizens; or, that they have
                        not the means at their command to secure what to them would be a source of
                        incalculable benefit.</p>

                    <p>It may be fairly assumed that our farmers do not fully appreciate the vast
                        benefits which would flow to them from the construction of such railroads as
                        have lately been agitated in several sections of the county. Perhaps the
                        smallest benefit they would receive from these railroads, if they became
                        through lines to the great markets of the country, would be the increased
                        advantages of getting to market, and the reduction of the prices of
                        transportation by means of competition. We do not wonder at their inertness
                        on the subject if they see no more substantial benefit than this. Their true
                        advantage is to be found in this, that it would transport the market for
                        their productions from the seaboard cities to their midst. In other words,
                        it would plant the manufacturer by the side of the farmer. Franklin county
                        is exclusively agricultural, and enjoys already all the advantages of any
                        other agricultural community, except an immediate market. But it is not
                        necessarily only agricultural. Independent of that it is blessed in mineral
                        wealth even far beyond many counties we now recall, which, with only mineral
                        resources, have outstripped us in wealth and population. The single item of
                        iron ore, without a fertile soil, has built railroads and furnaces, villages
                        and towns, and given employment and comfortable homes and subsistence to
                        thousands in some sections of the State. In other sections the presence of
                        coal alone, in the mountains, has in a few years built up a population
                        surrounded by wealth and teaming with busy manufactoring industry, to which
                        our county far more highly favored, and settled a hundred years, is a
                        perfect stranger.</p>

                    <p>Franklin county has hitherto relied solely on her agriculture for her wealth
                        and prosperity, but even in this branch of industry she has not secured half
                        as much as she might have done, nor can she ever until she brings the
                        consumers of her raw materials into her midst. Nature has bountifully
                        provided for this in storing inexhaustible supplies of iron ore in all her
                        hills and mountains, and in diversifying her valleys with streams of water
                        which will abundantly supply water power for manufactures. Railroads would
                        develope the one and employ the other. They would make ours a manufacturing
                        people as well as agricultural, and would thereby greatly increase the value
                        of land and the profits of farming. With a remote market farmers are
                        restricted to the cultivation of wheat, corn and oats, a few great staples,
                        which steadily impoverish their soil by draining it of the important
                        elements which enter into the constituents of these crops. A new market
                        would enable them to diversify their products by cultivating fruits and
                        vegetables, and thus maintain the fertility and even increase the productive
                        capacity of the soil. This near market can only be secured by building up
                        manufactures in our midst, and that can never be done without constructing
                        railroads to connect us with the iron ore of our own county, and the coal
                        fields adjoining us.</p>

                    <p>Of one thing farmers may be assured, and that is, if they rely solely on the
                        cultivation of wheat, corn, oats and rye, and on shipping the best elements
                        of their soil away, year after year, the time is not far distant when they
                        will no longer be able to raise these crops in paying quantities. The
                        average yield of wheat has fallen in the recollection of some who are still
                        active farmers, from twenty-five bushels to less than ten, and if the
                        husbandry were not more skillful than it was at first, the yield would be
                        still less than it is.</p>

                <summary>The paper complains about the weak support among farmers for construction
                    of railroads. The article suggests that Franklin County's reticence in the
                    matter is responsible for its slow economic growth compared to other areas of
                    the state. Railroads and the development of natural resources, the author
                    argues, would help the farmer and industrialist alike.</summary>

                    <p>Packer has now been before the people as the Democratic candidate for
                        Governor for a period of six weeks, and just so long have we looked, and
                        looked in vain, to find a valid reason for his nomination. There are some
                        things, they may be called principles, to which the Democracy of
                        Pennsylvania have strictly adhered in the past, in the selection of their
                        candidates for office, and which had come to be regarded by the mass of the
                        party as essentials. Their candidates for high offices were always chosen
                        from the number of those who had distinguished themselves in public life,
                        for earnest ability either as legislators, or as jurists, or as successful
                        leading politicians; and if from the class of purely politicians, they must
                        be opposed to monopolies of all kinds, and the concentration of wealth in
                        the hands of the few, in order to be able to secure the sympathy of that
                        largest class of voters, so fitly expressed by the term, "poor man."</p>

                    <p>In the selection of Packer the party has cut loose from all these
                        considerations, and the question is asked, what has it gained in lieu of
                        them? These inquiries are not our own; we hear them spoken of every day
                        among the people at large, and the people find but one reply.</p>

                    <p>The positions which Packer has held before the public are respectively those
                        of County Judge, Member of the Legislature and of the House of
                        Representatives in Congress. As County Judge he could have no opportunity of
                        doing anything to become known. As Legislator and Member of Congress he
                        could and did have. Yet, though only a few years have elapsed, but for the
                        members who served with him, and the records, it would be difficult for him
                        to prove that he was either. In both positions he was manifestly without
                        ability and without influence. He doubtless occupied his seat both in the
                        State and National Legislatures, and voted with his party as it favored or
                        opposed such measures as was brought before them.</p>

                    <p>But if he ever originated a measure, either in Congress or the Legislature,
                        if he ever formed a bill, or an amendment to a bill, if his voice was ever
                        heard for or against any measure his party has failed or neglected to make
                        it known. If his usefulness or his influence was ever felt, in committee or
                        out of it, if the attention of the people was ever drawn to him by anything
                        he said or did in his public life, it has entirely escaped the knowledge of
                        his party friends, as well as those who are politically opposed to him. Even
                        in the matter of the fearful struggle for the life of the Nation, though he
                        had been a member of Congress, he is wholly and absolutley without a record.
                        The only circumstance which his party has been able to produce on this point
                        is that when Gen. Lee invaded the State at the head of a powerful army, and
                        threatened to desolate it, he offered to support the families of such of his
                        employess as went to the front and imperilled their lives to protect his
                        property.</p>

                    <p>His chief wealth consisted of railroad stocks and coal mines. If Lee had
                        succeeded in his attempt to overrun the State, both of these would have been
                        rendered valueless, and it was to protect these that he did the only act and
                        made the only speech which his friends have dared to produce to prove his
                        sympathy with the Government during the war. That is all.</p>

                    <p>Now then, in the choice of this man, who has been both legislator and member
                        of Congress, and was never heard from in either, what has the party gained?</p>

                    <p>It has gained a candidate worth twenty millions of dollars, and you are asked
                        to make him Governor. It has gained money, and sacrificed principle. It has
                        gained a leader with loaded pockets and empty head. It has gained a
                        grasping, money accumulating, money hoarding monopolist, who has made his
                        collossal fortune by controlling and manipulating the price of a necessary
                        commodity. Our whole population has contributed to make up his enormous
                        wealth. Even the poor man, whose help the Democracy always invokes, has been
                        made to add his mite in the extortionate prices his is forced to pay for
                        coal.</p>

                    <p>Well, the almighty dollar elevated this man into the Legislature, but it
                        could not give him legislative ability. It carried him into Congress, but it
                        failed to give him respectable standing or even notoriety while there. It
                        has never failed to do his bidding yet. Will it be able, burdened with his
                        imbecility, his lack of learning, his want of statesmanship, to carry him
                        into the gubernatorial chair? If it can do this it can steal away the
                        judgement and prudence and the integrity of Pennsylvania voters.</p>

                    <p>From <emph rend="italic">res publica</emph>--a public <emph rend="italic"
                            >thing</emph>--a political prostitute. A double-gendered,
                        doubly-polluted hermaphrodite that has grown rich by sinning. Like that of
                        all fabled monstrostities, the circumstances attending to the birth of this
                        bisexual creature are sublimely awful; but accounts differ. The most
                        plausible is that he, or she, or both, is the result of an illegitimate
                        intercourse of Mr. Disunion with Miss Abolitionism. History is undecided
                        whether this connection was a forced one, or whether both parties were
                        "willing." It is said that the travail of the mother was painful in the
                        extreme; and when the infant monster saw the light of day, the earth shook
                        with the roar of artillery (not "heaven's own" but earth's), and brother
                        smote brother, as if afflicted with some sudden madness. We have the
                        authority of one of its fathers (there were quite a number of "fingers in
                        the pie") for the statement that the embryo was <emph rend="italic">nineteen
                            years</emph> in course of incubation. ("I have been trying for nineteen
                        years to break up this government"--Philips) But notwithstanding this
                        prolonged state of impregnation on the part of its mother, the thing is very
                        short-lived. Its death is predicted on the 2d Tuesday of October, and beyond
                        all peradventure of a doubt it will so come to pass, as all the "signs" of
                        the times lie towards such an event.--<emph rend="italic">Last week's
                        Spirit</emph>.</p>

                    <p>We once heard the editor of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> say that he
                        didn't allow Brick Pomeroy's paper to come into his office, and we
                        thought--we were verdant then--that he condemned it on account of its
                        obscenity. There are no words to express the disgust we feel at our
                        stupidity. It was the contempt of a master for the miserable abortions of a
                        bungler who had the presumption to invade his own domain, and not horror at
                        the blasphemy and impiety which filled its pages. We feel that we wronged
                        the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> and displayed great ignorance. Now let
                        ignorance plead in mitigation of the offence. We bow with unreserved respect
                        to this king of beasts. Pomeroy is a pigmy, Pomeroy is a dwarf. The <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> alone is great. When the lion roareth let
                        Pomeroy hide his diminished head. Why sing the praises of Pomeroy, when
                        greater than Pomeroy is in our very midst. Pomeroy's soul is but a shallow
                        pool of blasphemy and corruption, and its resources are limited; but here is
                        boundless wealth, here is an inexhaustible mine of nastiness.</p>

                    <p>Let us congratulate the Democracy of Franklin county. The <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph> of evil is theirs. A great law is illustrated. Nature
                        never creates a want but she sets about supplying it. Here is the Democratic
                        party, its organization is unique, and its wants are peculiar. It must have
                        filth; it must have corruption; it hungers and thirsts for obscene
                        literature; it languishes for bawdy suggestions and illustrations. These are
                        its meat and its drink, the atmosphere it breathes. Without these it cannot
                        exist. How shall its wants be supplied? We shall see. Nature has come to the
                        rescue. The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> is brought up to the measure
                        of the demand. The universality of law is true. Nature never creates a want
                        but she supplies it.</p>

                    <p>But why circumscribe it to the limits of Franklin county? The Democracy is
                        the same everywhere. Why not extend the spirit of the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph>? Are there not little children, girls and youths, beyond
                        our county, with minds and consciences to be corrupted and debased by such
                        literature? Surely there are, and it is the surest way to make Democrats of
                        them. The tender mind is susceptible. If good seed be sown then it will be
                        able to resist the seductions of wicked and impure literature, and this
                        would be detrimental to the cause of Democracy. To escape this we urge upon
                        Democratic parents to place the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> in the
                        hands of their children, to put it away under their eyes, to lay it upon
                        their tables. Why should they grow up to be pure and innocent men and women,
                        when to do so would be fatal to Democracy?</p>

                    <p><emph rend="italic">Second Week.</emph>--In the case of the Com. vs. John
                        Harmony, for the murder of Frank Spitel, (which was on trial as we went to
                        press last week,) the defendant was found guilty of murder in the second
                        degree. A motion was at once made for a new trial, which was granted by the
                        court. The defendant then plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and was
                        sentenced to undergo an imprisonment of one year in the Eastern
                        Penitentiary.</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday afternoon, the trial of the civil causes was commenced. The first
                        case, and one that occupied the remainder of the week, was that of John
                        Bitner, Samuel Bitner and Christian Bitner, Ex'rs of Christian Bitner,
                        dec'd, vs. Joseph Bitner, Jacob Bitner and Geo. W. Brewer, guardian of the
                        minor children of Henry Bitner, dec'd. Feigned issue. Kimmell and Stenger
                        for plffs; Sharpe, Geo. W. Brewer and W. U. Brewer for defts. The issue was
                        made up for the purpose of testing the validity of a will made by Christian
                        Bitner, dec'd. The parties desiring to break it and give to all the heirs
                        what seemed to be an equal portion of the property, alleged that a want of
                        mental capacity existed in the testator, and that his peculiar dislike to
                        some of his children rendered him a monomaniac, and thereby incapacitated
                        him for doing justice to all those who were interested in the disposition of
                        his estate. Mr. Bitner died September 17th, 1868.</p>

                    <p>The following are the names of the jurors in the case: Robert Mahon, John
                        Valentine, Alex Martin, Thomas M'Laughlin, John H. Snider, Peter Cook, John
                        D. Speer, Ezra Hambright, Eli Fuss, Barnet B. Picking, William Hayman,
                        George Taylor.</p>

                    <p>The will was made on the 14th of June, 1865. The testator bequethed his
                        estate to his sons, John, Samuel and Christian, in trust, and also
                        constituted them his Executors, and also desired it understood that the
                        three sons above named should be the heirs and devisors of all his real and
                        personal estate of which he died seized and possessed, except so much as was
                        bestowed to others; and he further desired them to carry on the farming
                        business as it had been conducted in the past, and he did not want them to
                        file inventories and appraisements of his property. He did not wish them to
                        sell and dispose of ther respective interests, in either the real or
                        personal estate during their lives, but desired them to continue on the land
                        and farm and enjoy it as heretofore, during their lifetimes, and at their
                        death to dispose of the same according to their pleasure. As his son
                        Christian was the best qualified, he desired that he should be the business
                        man. Should either of his said sons marry, he desired that the one so
                        marrying should take one of the houses on the farm, except the mansion
                        house, or if there was no convenient house on the premises, one should be
                        built; but should Christian marry, he was to occupy the mansion house.
                        Whilst they remained single they were to continue as one family. To his son
                        Joseph, at present residing in the State of Maryland, for reasons not
                        necessary to state, he gave five dollars, payable on demand. To his son
                        Jacob and wife, and their children, not of an age to support themselves, a
                        home on the farms, either in the house occupied by them, or in such other as
                        his said Executors and Trustees might erect for the purpose, and in the
                        event of his son Jacob, his wife and their youthful children laboring on the
                        farms, for is sons, as in his lifetime they labored for him, his Executors
                        were to furnish the family with everything necessary to their well being
                        suited to their condition in life. This provision was to extend to the
                        father, to the wife also, if she survived the husband, and remained
                        unmarried, and to the children until they would attain such an age as they
                        might be able to support themselves, his object being to give this family a
                        home on the condition mentioned, so long as the parents lived and the
                        children were for any reason unable by honest labor to support and maintain
                        themselves. If the children of Jacob proved to be honest and good members of
                        society, he recommended his Executors to aid them, but left it optional with
                        them whether they would do so or not, and their judgment was to be to final
                        in the premises. As he had provided for his son Henry into his life time, he
                        had nothing more to give his children. He gave to his daughters Susan and
                        Catharine, a living on the farms so long as they remained unmarried, but in
                        case of Susan's marriage she was to receive $500 from his Executors, and
                        should Catharine marry she was to receive $250, and the Executors were
                        further recommended to keep these daughters liberally supplied with pocket
                        money, but in case of marriage their husbands were to support them without
                        any further claims on the estate, except the above specified legacies. The
                        will was signed in the presence of Jacob S. Brand, Sol. Huber, John Huber
                        and F. M. Kimmell.</p>

                    <p>The Bitner trial was continued during the third week of court. The Jurors for
                        this week have been discharged. Fifteen witnesses have been examined on the
                        part of the plaintiff and fifty on the side of the defence. The case is
                        still on trial as we go to press, and the probabilities are that the
                        testimony will not be closed before this evening.</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday next the Democracy of Franklin county will meet in Convention to
                        form a county ticket. There is not that harmony in the party at present that
                        is needed to make their coming campaign a success. For several years past
                        their "rings" have opposed one another fiercely, and the party beaten in
                        Convention has given a lukewarm support to their nominees. It will require
                        considerable "gerrymandering" to give satisfaction to all their ambitious
                        office-seekers. Capt. G. W. Skinner, present County Treasurer, appears to
                        have the inside track for the Legislature. Col. B. F. Winger, spoken of
                        sometime since, in this connection, seems to be laid on the shelf for the
                        present, and unless John DeGolley, Esq., a recent convert who not only
                        changes his name but also his politics as the fit takes him, should develop
                        greater strength than he now possesses, the Captain will have no difficulty
                        in making his point. The only objection urged against him is, that he was a
                        soldier. Capt. T. D. French, H. M. White, Benj. M. Powell, L. Leidy and Wm.
                        Reber would all like to be County Treasurers. Their patriotism is really to
                        be admired. Reber ought to be the man, for this is his third if not his
                        fourth attempt to serve his fellow-citizens in this capacity. For Clerk of
                        the Courts, Vincent M'Coy, B. A. Cormany and Lieut. M. D. Reymer are
                        mentioned, and have paid the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> for
                        advertising their cards. There is the same objection to Reymer, as to
                        Skinner, he was a soldier, and in addition to that, has been in the party a
                        very short time. There are but two men named for Register and Recorder, H.
                        T. Snyder and J. Cook. Knowing Democrats bet on Snider two to one. Geo. W.
                        Welsh has no competitor for Prothonotary, and if hard work for a partisan
                        organization deserves recognition, George should be nominated unanimously.</p>
