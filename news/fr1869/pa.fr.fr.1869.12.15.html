<b>The President's Message</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper gives a summary of Grant's annual message to Congress. The
                    president clarified his positions on Reconstruction, finances, foreign policy,
                    and Native American relations.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The first regular message of President Grant will be found in our columns
                        this week though, as it was delivered to Congress more than a week ago, it
                        has already been persued by many of our readers. It is a great satisfaction
                        to know that President and Congress are once more working harmoniously
                        together, and that when a message is sent to that body its tone and temper
                        and suggestions do not produce the tempestuous scenes which were want to
                        follow the reception of those of the Tennessee tailor. This message is
                        plain, direct simple and frank, of moderate length, goes immediately to the
                        heart of the subject and discusses it with a candor and honesty which must
                        please even those who differ from the conclusions reached by the President.
                        But there is more to commend than the spirit which inspires the message.
                        Many of the suggestions contained thereon should be heeded for their
                        intrinsic merit. There may be few members of the great Republican party who
                        will endorse and approve the whole paper, but there can be none who will
                        condemn it. If any were still in doubt as to where the President stands on
                        the issues which divide the two great parties, they need be no longer.
                        Democrats need no longer hope, nor Republicans fear that Grant may undertake
                        to Johnsonize his party. He stands in front of his party, and that too not
                        as a politician seeking popularity or power, but as a true exponent of its
                        principles.</p>

                    <p>The message opens with a brief survey of the great and growing material
                        wealth and prosperity of the Republic, from which it naturally turns to the
                        gap left therein by the unreconstructed condition of a part of the South. He
                        recommends that in the case of Georgia, Congress pass a law authorizing the
                        Governor to convene the members originally elected to the Legislature, and
                        require each one to take the oath required by the Reconstruction act, and
                        that none be admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the
                        fourteenth amendment. This would restore the members who were illegally
                        deprived of their seats in that body, would reject those who had usurped
                        them, and would secure the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by the
                        State. Then follows a recommendation that the State of Virginia be fully
                        restored to her place in the Union as having complied with all the
                        requirements of the Reconstruction acts.</p>

                    <p>On the currency question the President does not favor an attempt at immediate
                        resumption of specie payment, lest it might bring ruin and bankruptcy to the
                        debtor class. He recommends such legislation as will insure a gradual return
                        to specie payment, and if possible put a stop to the fluctuations in the
                        value of currency. As one of the means to this end, he recommends a new loan
                        at four and a half per cent. interest, and, with
                        the means received from it, to take up the six per
                        cent. bearing debt as it falls due. If this be done, a reduction in
                        the rate of taxation for revenue is also recommended. Among the specific
                        suggestions on this subject is the renewal of the tax on incomes, which
                        otherwise expires by limitation in 1870, and a reduction of the rate from
                        five per cent. to three per
                            cent.</p>

                    <p>The President, contrary perhaps to general expectation, does not favor the
                        recognition of Cuba. Though deeply interested in all struggles for
                        independence and freedom, he does not think that Cuba has accomplished the
                        conditions of which amount to a war in the sense of international law, and
                        which would justify a recognition of belligerency on the part of the United
                        States. In this view of the case Congress is likely to sustain the
                        President, though feeling a strong interest in the success of the
                        insurgents.</p>

                    <p>On the question of the Alabama claims the message takes the position held by
                        Sumner in his great speech before the Senate on that subject, but informs us
                        that a further attempt at settlement had been deferred because the state of
                        feeling on both sides was not favorable to an attempt at renewed
                        negotiation. This is now the only grave question which the United States has
                        with any foreign nation.</p>

                    <p>The question of a reciprocity treaty between this country and the British
                        provinces is not favorably regarded by the President, who believes that all
                        the advantages are on the side of the provinces. The President also favors
                        the encouragement of home manufactures and utters a caution against
                        disturbing any of the indutrial interests of the country. This is not as
                        direct and pointed on the subject of our industries as it should be. The new
                        Indian policy, which is peculiarly the President's plan, is discussed at
                        length, and regarded with much favor. He finds reason to be encouraged in
                        what has already been done. At all events it is a merciful policy and
                        whether experience approves or condemns it, every opportunity should be
                        furnished to give it a fair and full trial. The President condemns the
                        former policy of the Government and strongly hints that it was practically a
                        system of extermination. He concludes by saying:</p>

                    <p>"A system which looks to the extermination of the race is too horrible for a
                        nation to adopt, without entailing upon itself the wrath of all Christendom,
                        and engendering in the citizen a disregard for human life and the rights of
                        others, dangerous to society. I see no substitute for such a system, except
                        in placing all the Indians on large reservations as rapidly as can be done,
                        and giving them absolute protection there. As soon as they are fitted for
                        it, they should be induced to take their lands and to set up territorial
                        governments for their own protection. For full details on this subject I
                        call special attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and
                        the Commissioner of Indian Affairs."</p>

                    <p>After referring Congress to the various reports of the heads of departments
                        and bureaus, the message concludes with a recommendation to Congress to
                        increase the salaries of the Justices of the Supreme Court, whose labors and
                        expenses have both been largely increased, though the salaries have not. The
                        reminder to Congress that twice it has found it necessary to increase
                        largely the compensation of its own members, is perhaps a gentle hint that
                        it does not forget to look out for number one, whatever it may fail to do
                        for others.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper supports a bill introduced by Benjamin Butler that would improve
                    the pension system for soldiers.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>GEN. BUTLER has moved in the House of Representatives to do a great good to
                        the soldiers and sailors, and their families who are pensioners on the
                        Government. Every one who has any experience at all, either as a pensioner
                        or as a friend of these, knows what trouble and often expense are necessary
                        to obtain the semi-annual pittance the government grants to her disabled
                        defenders; trouble and expense too which they are less able to meet than any
                        other class of citizens. Many are maimed and crippled, and must pay a per-centage out of the small sum they receive,
                        sometimes a heavy one, in order to get it. Many others are widows of brave
                        soldiers, who fell for their country, and have small and helpless children
                        to care for. Gen. Butler's bill provides a simple method whereby these
                        pensioners can be paid through the post offices, by means of the money-order
                        system, every month or two. We hope that this beneficent measure may be
                        accomplished. It will save time, labor, expense and trouble, and will stop
                        the small leaks which in the hands of unscrupulous agents often waste a
                        large part of the pension before it reaches the pensioner.</p>
