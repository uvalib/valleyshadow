                    <p>MR. NASBY IS ALMOST PERSUADED TO ADVOCATE THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL
                        AMENDMENT, SEEING IN THE SUCCESS OF THAT MEASURE A CHANCE OF GAIN TO THE
                        DEMOCRACY.</p>

                    <p>POST OFFIS, CONFEDERIT X ROADS (Wich is in the State uv Kentucky), Feb. 11,
                        1869. That cussid Constooshnel Amendment hez bin on my mind nite and day for
                        mor'n a week. I hev slept on it, dreamed onto it, and it hez monopolized my
                        wakin hours to the excloosion uv everythin else. Ez an evidence uv how much
                        it hez absorbed me, I wood merely menshen that twice while sitting in
                        Bascom's thinkin it over, strangers in the place hev askt the crowd up to
                        take suthin, without my heerin uv em at all, when in fact I went there, and
                        wuz sittin there, and waitin there for the express purpose uv availin myself
                        uv sich chauces. I stay at Bascom's solely to accept invitashuns to drink,
                        for his benefit. Often hev I sed to him, "G. W., sich is my admirashen for
                        the sterlin qualities in yoor hed and heart, that I will drink myself into
                        delirum tremens for yoor sake, willinly. Yoose me in this capasity ez you
                        will, my stumick is glass-lined and ken stand even your likker."
                        Notwithstandin this self-sacrifis Bascom has never perposed to give me a per
                        cent on wat I put into his drawer in this way. Shood he do so I cood easily
                        earn enuff to pay my board; but shood he do it there wood be no merit in
                        this sacrifis.</p>

                    <p>I hev more than half made up my mind to go for the adopshen uv the
                        Constooshnel Amendment, and that for the benefit solely uv the Dimocrisy. I
                        more than half beleeve that the adopshen uv that Amendment just ez it hez
                        passed both Houses of Congris, wood result after all to our advantage; that
                        is ef the posishen we hev alluz taken that the nigger is an inferior race be
                        the troo one. The Dimocrisy hez never failed to git possession uv the
                        inferior classes. They hev sole and undivided control uv sich people ez hev
                        stumick alone, without brane - Dimocrisy flourishes best where school houses
                        are not. Thus the patriots who inhabit the lower wards uv Noo York; the
                        denizens uv Mackrelville and uv the Five Pints; the Southern half of
                        Delaware whose people wood demonstrate the trooth uv the theory that men wuz
                        orijinelly oysters, wuz there any possibility of makin men uv em; the
                        Southern porshens uv Injianny and Illinoy; all these regions are strongholds
                        uv Dimocrisy, and agin these rocks the waves uv Ablishenism beat in vain.</p>

                    <p>Now the question which agitates my mind is, wood the niggers ef given the
                        ballot rise above us, or sink below us? They wouldn't have fur to go either
                        way. Ez a matter uv course, we shood cultivate em. Ez a matter of coarse,
                        the minit they hev the ballot, they become to us Objects of Interest. The
                        minit they hev the fate uv a member of Congris in their hands, that minit
                        the Democratic candidate for Congris goes for em. He cannot avoid eatin with
                        em, drinkin with em, and sleepin with them. In the South the latter
                        operation wood be no new experience; the practis hez been more common with
                        that portion uv the race which for sexual reasons, kin never vote. But the
                        candidate native and to the manner born, wood hev the advantage over the
                        Northern carpet bagger uv havin long ago overcome his repugnance to color,
                        which is a great pint gained.</p>

                    <p>Trained by us and mixin with us how long wood it take to bring em down to us?
                        Kin Pollock and Bigler hold them niggers at Garrettstown in their hands
                        forever? I don't beleive it. The poll is opened at Bascom's and Bascom's
                        likker wood fetch em in time. It hez made many uv us loathsome objects, and
                        why not them? At all events I know that among em there's any number uv lazy
                        cusses who wont work, and who take to new whiskey ez naterally ez I do; and
                        that porshen uv em we're as certin to git ez leaves is to fall. This class
                        must gravitate to us for the sufficient reason that they hev no nowhere else
                        to go to find conjenyel assoseashens. Whether these fellows armed with the
                        ballot kin contaminate enuff uv the others to give us a majority, is the
                        great moral question. At all events ez the thing is bound to go thro, I
                        believe it is better for us to make the most of it, and by yeeldin a
                        cheerful assent to what we can't help, make shoor uv this class at least.</p>

                    <p>I feel tolerably easy. Ef the ballot is given em in Kentucky and we kin keep
                        out them cussid missionaries with their primers and spellin books and
                        school-houses, I hev faith to beleeve that the Ablishnists will, after all,
                        hev acheeved a barren victry; this is for the present. Troo, we can't allez
                        hold em. The Bible Societies, and the Crischen Assoseashens, and them other
                        nachrel enemies uv our party, spellin books, will evenchooally git hold uv
                        em, but they can't do it for ten years, and before that time passes, I shel
                        sleep in the valley. On good likker I cood only hope to survive ten yeers -
                        on Bascom's a shorter period will suffise. I feel now a lack of physikle
                        vigger. My haltin steps, and the incapassity to take over three drinks per
                        fifteen minits warn me that my biler is rusted, that the rivits is weaknin,
                        and that ere long it must bust. After that wat do I care who rools Kentucky?
                        When I am sleepin in the buryin ground behind Pennibacker's distillery, wat
                        difference will it make to me whether that buildin is convertin corn into
                        sustenance, or whether it is bein yoozed ez a Young Ladies' Seminary, with
                        teachers from Massachoosits with their hair in intellectual ringlits? When
                        this frail body is mouldrin into dust, wat dust, wat do I care whether
                        Confederit X Roads is what it now is, or whether its name is changed to
                        Summerville, with a cotton factory, and a nail factory and a rolin mill and
                        such; with the country cleared up around it and all devoted to dairies and
                        markit gardens? Nary. But ez this frail body aint mouldrin into dust, and ez
                        it aint sleepin in the buryin ground, but on the contrary, is livin and
                        movin with wants and necessities, it prefers to hev Confederit X Roads
                        remain jist ez it is doorin its stay on this sublunary speer. And to this
                        end I am willin to do whatever may be necessary to keep it so. Ef the way is
                        thro Afriky - I am willin to embrace Afriky. Ef it is kickin Afriky, why
                        then Afriky shel find there's vigger yet in my foot and leg.</p>

                    <p>And the Dimocrisy, ef the are wise, will hold theirselves in ekul readinis to
                        drop on either side. In Noo York city, for eggsample, ef the nigger theeves
                        and suckers only vote ez the white theeves and suckers do, the carryin ov
                        the State will allez be a shoor thing. The only question is, kin they be
                        kept in that condishen? Here is where doubt comes in and beclouds an other
                        wise fair pikter. Kin John Morrisey control the niggers in his Deestrik, ez
                        he does the Irish, and by the same means? How long will it take to git a
                        nigger uv ordinary sensibilities down to a pint uv assoshiatin with John
                        Allen and Kit Burns? And for the sake uv their vote cood our Irish fellow
                        citizens of Noo York be pursuaded to forego their trooly nasnhek amoozement
                        in killin a d--d nigger now and then? I won't ask whether they cood be
                        indoost to occasionally give them an offis, for that question wood be
                        lunatic, there not bein quite offises enough in Noo York to pervide for the
                        Irish alone, to say nothin uv the others who want em.</p>

                    <p>Upon the anser to these questions depends my askshen. I shall study it over
                        for a day or two longer before I decide. In the meantime I shell prepare
                        myself. I shel shake hands with sich niggers ez I meet, when unobserved by
                        white men, and shel prevent, ef possible, the hanging uv any more uv them
                        till I hev solved these doubts.</p>

                <summary>This article from a Kentucky postmaster, full of spelling errors, lays out
                    a Democratic case for passing the Fifteenth Amendment. He argues that while in
                    the South black men "for sexual reasons can never vote," the Democrats generally
                    control the lower classes of society. Thus, but using the same methods - he
                    mentions keeping out schools and using associations like the Irish in New York -
                    the Democrats can take control of more of the country by embracing the amendment
                    and seizing the black vote.</summary>

                    <p><orig reg="Today">To-day</orig> the Lower House of the State Legislature
                        takes up the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It has been made the
                        order of the day, and the Democracy will have a fair opportunity to discuss
                        it fully. It has already passed the Senate by a strict party vote, and will
                        pass the House in the same manner. Every Democrat will of course record this
                        vote against this just and enlightened measure. But it will make little
                        odds. There is every reason to believe that it will become a part of the
                        Constitution, and just as much, that it will commend itself strongly to the
                        good sense and intelligence of the American people, as has every step yet
                        taken by the Republican party in the road of true progress and
                        enlightenment.</p>

                    <p>Before the vote is taken in the House, we hope to hear, not much talking by
                        Republican members, but a concise, clear explicit enunciation of the
                        principles on which our Government is founded, and a declaration that the
                        faith of the people in the correctness of these principles demand and
                        justify their incorporation into the Constitution. The favorite argument of
                        the Democracy against it that the question of suffrage was not an issue in
                        the election of the present Legislature amounts to nothing, and need not be
                        answered. When the election was held they alleged that it was, and that it
                        was the intention of the Republican party to make suffrage general. If they
                        say now that it was not, they were guilty of falsehood either then or now,
                        and they are at liberty to accept either horn of the dilemma.</p>

                    <p>But it is not a mere question of policy, about which the people can express a
                        choice in the election of members. It is one involving the natural rights of
                        man, and a portion of the population can have no voice, under our present
                        laws, to express either assent or dissent. The Republican party may not have
                        favored the passage of this Amendment before the year 1869, because the
                        prejudices of the people were too strong against it. Nevertheless equal
                        justice demanded it just as strongly at the formation of the Government as
                        now, and the patriotic men of that day embodied it in the Declaration of
                        Independence.</p>

                <summary>Another attempt was made to burn the Mercersburg home of Capt. James C.
                    Patton. The citizens of the town aided in putting out the flames before too much
                    damage was done. "The incendiaries are supposed to have acted from a desire to
                    revenge themselves on the Captain, because he has taken so prominent a part in
                    having prosecuted the parties who were implicated in the robbery of Fallen's
                    store." Patton's efforts succeeded in breaking up Robinson's and Seyler's gang.
                    Dr. James W. Robinson, Thomas Hoeflich, and James of Mercersburg have been
                    arrested for the incident, and are in Fort Fletcher awaiting trial after failing
                    to meet $3,000 bail.</summary>

                    velocipede in Chambersburg. The paper reports that many of the town's young men
                    have already learned to ride. A demonstration will be held in the hall with
                    prizes for the fastest and slowest riders. Admission is 25 cents.</summary>

                    Union Hall. The audience enjoyed the show, and a repeat performance will be

                    the evening, however, with "obscene utterances on the street, and by storming
                    the doors and windows of one or two citizen's houses."</summary>
