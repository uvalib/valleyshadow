<b>Decency in Female Dress</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints an essay on "respectable" women's attire. The author
                    criticizes men who encourage "respectable dress" in their wives, daughters, and
                    sisters, but all too frequently applaud the opposite in their acquaintances.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Young girls and riper matrons need not go about robed like religious
                        fanatics; but let those to whom a high-necked and long-sleeved party dress
                        would be a grievous affliction content themselves with showing a modest rim
                        of shoulder above their bodices. And let them not forget that well turned
                        white arms can be seen and appreciated without the necessity of being
                        exposed clear up to the arm pits. No fair young girl ever lost anything in
                        the admiration of men, whose opinion is worth having, by appearing with
                        neck, shoulders and arms chastely veiled in delicate lace or muslin, instead
                        of exposing them to the promiscuous gaze of a public assembly.</p>

                    <p>We hoard away the jewel that we prize the most; we draw a curtain before the
                        picture that we dote upon; we hide our most sacred feelings in our hearts;
                        we veil the shrine of the temple; we hedge the lily about lest its whiteness
                        should be soiled; we want to cover up from other eyes the things that are
                        fairest, the dearest, and the most sacred to us.</p>

                    <p>Oh, woman! the most sacred thing, the fairest and dearest that man has in
                        this world, is yourself. And I hold that man's
                        instinctive protest is the best guide in this matter.</p>

                    <p>And the feeling of the father, the brother, the lover and the husband, when
                        his nature is unperverted, is that the arms that caress and enfold him, the
                        bosom, which is the dearest home his head can have on earth, should be as
                        sacred as was the holy of holies in the days of old Jewish rites.</p>

                    <p>A woman's body is the temple of her soul, and her soul's outward symbol. What
                        we want to keep pure, holy and undefiled, we do not expose to be a common
                        bait for all the eyes of all the world, pure and impure, to gloat upon.</p>

                    <p>The way in which men, as a body, act and express themselves, when brought
                        face to face with this dress reform question, is inconsistent, unjust, and
                        ungenerous to woman, and unworthy of themselves as
                            gentlemen; they think because a woman is not their sister, or wife, or sweetheart, that it is no concern of
                        theirs how she demeans herself in this matter of dress. On the contrary they
                        seem eager to help push her into a false position by hypocritical
                        compliments, and phrases of hollow admiration, which are as false and bitter
                        as Dead Sea fruit, if she will but stop to analyze the feelings from which
                        they spring, the motives which prompt them. Too much familiarity breeds
                        contempt. No one knows this better than the man who watches over the dress
                        and deportment of his wife or sister with the stern jealousy of an Oriental,
                        while at the same time he blandly encourages the wives, and daughters, and
                        sisters of other men in every species of license.</p>

                    <p>Women do not always know--the very young ones especially--that a certain dash
                        and freedom in the style of dress encourages familiarity in the manners of
                        men towards them. They too often follow blindly after the reigning mode,
                        without questioning its meaning, or the effect it will have upon men's
                        opinion of them. They feel strong because they go in droves, and in droves
                        they dare to indulge in a style of dress for which any one woman would be
                        ignominiously hooted out of society, if she dared to appear in it alone, and
                        upon any occassion for which it is not sanctioned by fashion.</p>

                    <p>If men would but give up their abominable two-sided policy on this question,
                        and act towards every reputable woman, whom they find masquerading in
                        disreputable attire, just as they would under like circumstances to their
                        own wives, daughters or sisters, as far as is consistent with surroundings
                        and circumstances, this mode of dress would soon be driven to its rightful
                        home--the haunts of the profligate and the lost woman.</p>

                    <p>For my own dear countrywomen I have one wish, which has moved me to speak as
                        I have spoken. Plain words and hard words to say, but words which must be
                        spoken, nevertheless, and which are better spoken sooner or later. It is
                        that they should be known all over the world as the most modest of women in
                        dress and deportment, even as they are now distinguished for wit, elegance,
                        patriotism and innate purity of character. Let the women of other countries
                        belie themselves if they will, by a mode of attire which is in direct
                        opposition to the dictates of their natural modesty, but let ours set a
                        bright example in this respect to the world, and then, indeed, the nations
                        shall rise up and proclaim the American women blessed!--HOWARD GLYDON, in Packard's Monthly for September.</p>

<b>Massachusetts and Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors assert that all political questions surrounding the 14th and
                    15th amendments are settled and Democrats will no longer be able to appeal to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The negro still lives, but the "nigger," if not totally defunct, is in the
                        very last stage of dissolution. The progress of the disease, which years ago
                        claimed this extraordinary creation of the Democratic party for its own, was
                        sometimes rapid, and its victim experienced keen and intense suffering.
                        Indeed seldom was its journey to the grave so calm and placid as to be
                        typified by the poet's beautifully expressed idea of a peaceful death: "So
                        sinks the weary day to rest."</p>

                    <p>But it is not the history of its lingering disease, nor the cruel treatment
                        it suffered at the hands of its unnatural parents, that we wish to trace,
                        though we feel the fascinating influence of the subject. We desire to note
                        the twofold fact that the severest tortures inflicted upon it by its parents
                        no longer produce any sign of animation, and that even they are reluctantly
                        beginning to realize that life is extinct. The fact of its death, as was
                        natural, was first discovered by those who most desired to lengthen its
                        days. The Democracy of the South were the first to realize and appreciate
                        it. After repeated and expensive efforts to vitalize the dead corpse, all of
                        which were fruitless, they abandoned it and announced to their friends in
                        the North that though the negro flourished and
                        grew like a green bay tree, the nigger was as
                        dead as a door nail, or a coffin nail, if one nail can be deader than
                        another. Proverbially slow to believe anything but falsehood, the Democracy
                        of the North gathered the loathsome carcass in their arms, declared that it
                        still breathed, though all others knew that it only stank, and made the
                        memorable Presidential campaign of 1868. The over
                            whelming defeat which followed led the most intelligent to doubt
                        the dogma of their party, that the "nigger" can never die, and convinced
                        them of the necessity of making a new departure in politics. It is perhaps
                        needless to remark that these were not of the Pennsylvania Democracy, for
                        though a whole year has elapsed they still cling to the polluting carcass,
                        and asseverate louder than ever that it is in full life and vigor.</p>

                    <p>The Democracy of Massachusetts are first of that "slow to learn" party in the
                        North who fully realize the total deadness of the nigger, and move forward to a platform which fully recognizes the
                        existence of the negro in politics. More shrewd
                        than their brethren of Pennsylvania, they see that the term "all men" is not
                        limited in its meaning by the accident of a white cuticle, and that Equality
                        of Rights does not end where a black skin begins; and they see it because
                        the progress of events points to it, and not because of the inherent truth
                        of the proposition.</p>

                    <p>At their State Convention on the 24th day of August, they nominated John
                        Quincy Adams as their candidate for Governor, as they had done several times
                        before, and resolved the following resolution:</p>

                    <p>"We deem it a political duty to acquiesce in settled results and postpone
                        fruitless opposition to the accomplished facts of yesterday, in order to
                        secure effective action upon the pressing problems of to day."</p>

                    <p>In response to his nomination, and in the spirit of the resolution above, he
                        thus cut the cords which bound his party to the dead nigger:</p>

                    <p>"In my judgment our defeat in the last election substantially settled the
                        reconstruction and negro suffrage controversy. Much as we may dislike the
                        decision, there is no way short of revolution by which it can be reversed,
                        certainly for four, and considering the complexion of the Senate of the
                        United States, now the affective government of the country, probably not for
                        ten years at least. This insures, at any rate, a fair trial of universal
                        unqualified suffrage at the South, and even when its failure is ascertained,
                        it is probable that all moderate men will agree that no sweeping measure of
                        disfranchisement would be expedient. The barbarian ballot, then, should be
                        regarded by a wise party as no longer a legitimate subject of discussion. It
                        has passed from the realm of debatable questions and should now be classed
                        in the category of facts. Arguments for and against its adoption were
                        admissable last autumn, but now they are out of place; we cannot abrogate or
                        abolish it: we must accept it as one of the elements in the problem offered
                        for our solution, and address ourselves to that as affected by this
                        inseparable modification."</p>

                    <p>Here, then, for Massachusetts at least, the era of the nigger ends and that of the negro
                        begins. John Quincy Adams, by virute of his place on the Democratic ticket,
                        and the authority of the State Convention, pronounced in its resolution,
                        politely touches his aristocratic hat to "our colored fellow-citizens," and
                        kicks the dead nigger out of politics.</p>

                    <p>The New York World in plain language advises the
                        Democracy of that State to fall in and muster under the same banner. It
                        says:</p>

                    <p>"Just in proportion as Democrats adopt his advice, will Republicans be
                        persuaded by his arguments. The Democrats of Massachsetts have adopted this
                        advice by their unanimity in his nomination; for the opinions expressed in
                        his speech were well known to be his before the delegates to the convention
                        were chosen. It may indeed be said, and said with truth, that the whole
                        Democratic party in other States does not yet accept all the positions of
                        Mr. Adams respecting obsolete questions; but it is equally true they are
                        fast coming to his conclusions. It is not to be expected that old Democrats
                        in other State, whose antecedents differ from those of Mr. Adams, will be
                        very forward to proclaim that certain questions are finally decided; but it
                        will be seen more and more, those questions are carefully let alone, and
                        that the whole stress and emphasis of Democratic controversy is given to
                        financial and other living issues."</p>

                    <p>All this seems very plain, and excellent advice, but there is hardness of
                        head peculiar to the Democracy of Pennsylvania, which renders them
                        impervious to any progressive idea. To them the nigger is still living and active. In their late Convention they
                        fully declared this belief in the follwoing resolution.</p>

                    <p>"That the Democratic party of Pennsylvania is opposed to conferring upon the
                        negro the right to vote, and we do emphatically deny that there is any right
                        or power in Congress or elsewhere to impose negro suffrage upon the people
                        of this State in opposition to their will."</p>

                    <p>From this position the Democracy of this State cannot be driven, until some
                        day they will open their eyes and discover that even here the negroes have
                        ballots in their hands and are using them. Then a change will come over the
                        spirit of their dream, the burden of the nigger
                        will drop from their shoulders, the hatred of the negro race will be
                        banished from their hearts, the odious and insolent terms which they have
                        applied to the despised race, which had given its origin in the monkey and
                        chimpanzee, will give place to the smooth, and gentle, and suppliant phrases
                        of the beggar of votes. Ballots, whether white or black, are the emblems of
                        power, and before a black ballot Democratic office seekers will "crook the
                        pregnant hinges of the knee" with as much ease and facility as if the holder
                        thereof had through all the ages been a "man and brother." We would not be
                        astonished if, then, they clearly and conclusively proved that the original
                        Democrat had been a full blooded negro, and that all Democrats since, had
                        been more or less negroes.</p>

                        developments indicated that the real intention was not so much to mark the
                        different points of interest on that battle
                        field, where fell so many of America's bravest and noblest sons, as
                        to advertise the wonderful Katalysine Springs, and make them a profitable
                        speculation. Last week's REPOSITORY referred to this matter, and the reports
                        of what has really occurred have more than justified its position. There was
                        not a despatch sent in relation to the proceedings of this re-union, in which the hotel or springs were not
                        brought before the notice of the public. But few, very few, of the
                        distinguished Generals who won for themselves honor, and for their country
                        victory, in July, 1863, were present. They all hold in sacred memory the
                        courage and patriotism of the brave soldiers and officers who nobly laid
                        down their lives in their efforts to hurl the army of treason Southward, and
                        therefore do not desire to countenance this effort to coin money off the
                        resting places of their dead comrades.</p>

                    <p>The Compiler says the "'promised' reception was a
                        failure," and the Star and Sentinel remarks that
                        "the efforts to secure the attendance of prominent rebel officers proved a
                        miserable failure." There were but two rebel officers present, and worse
                        than that, Gen. Lee and others in replying to the letters of invitation
                        which had been sent them "snubbed" the Memorial Association. The next time
                        the virtues of the water that remained hidden until recently, are to be
                        announced, let them not be mentioned in connection with the graves of the
                        soldiers of the Army of the Potomac. Let the managers of this association
                        take warning from this lesson. Cemeteries and grave
                            yards are not the places for carousing, dancing and mirth. They
                        are solemn cities of the dead, where repose the remains of many a fond
                        husband, or affectionate son or darling brother, and outside of the
                        stockholders of the Katalysine Springs Company, there is no man who is not
                        indignant at the course pursued by those who were so forgetful of that which
                        respect for the feelings of others demands. Gettysburg Battlefield belongs
                        to no association, to no particular men, but it is the property of the whole
                        American people, and they will not suffer searchers after temporary
                        notoriety, or those whose sole ambition is accumulation of money, regardless
                        of the means by which they attain it, to rob them of what is theirs.</p>

                    <p>The REPOSITORY does not stand alone in condemning this movement. All the best
                        papers of the country, regardless of party, have denounced it.</p>

                    <p>The Tribune says:</p>

                    <p>It may not be inappropriate just here to recall the fact that the movement
                        now making to preserve the battle field is
                        most anomalous. Possibly some, to whom the war was too short for the
                        illustration of genius, desire to correct history and send their names down
                        to posterity coupled with great deeds of valor that might have been
                        performed. But whatever the motive, it is certain that there is being
                        erected on this great field, not such a memorial as those who wish
                        prosperity and peace to their country would desire. The
                            most interested in the affair are gentlemen identified with certain
                            money making projects in this vicinity whose investments require more
                            than ordinary watering to insure profitable returns. This may not
                        be considered a very flattering commentary upon American patriotism, but it
                        is nevertheless true, and the record of the fact is but due as an indication
                        that the race is not wholly given to sordid impulses.</p>

                    <p>And thus the absence of such men as here become famous by their deeds of
                        heroism in the civil war, now happily ended, becomes more noticeable.</p>

                    <p>The New York Sun remarks:</p>

                    <p>A great deal is saying in the newspapers and elsewhere about the survey now
                        going on of the Gettysburg battlefield. Some denounce the work as an attempt
                        to perpetuate the memories which had better be allowed to die out, while
                        others commend it as noble and patriotic. The fact is that those who have
                        got up the enterprise have no other motive at heart than the good of the
                        hotels of Gettysburg. It is a watering place advertising
                            expedient, and the more it is talked about, either favorably or
                        unfavorably, the better it will succeed, and the better it will be for the
                        landlords' pockets. The real heroes of the battle on
                            both sides have no interest in it; historically it is of no value; and
                            when it has served its temporary purpose, we presume it will never be
                            again heard of.</p>

                    <p>And as if fully determined to try to the greatest extent the feelings of
                        those whose friends lie buried in those grounds, this Memorial Association
                        must needs have a dance on this occasion. We will not mention the names of
                        the officers who were prominent movers in this festival, for reflection will
                        satisfy them that they committed a great mistake, when they appeared on the
                        floor of a ball room at such a time.</p>

                    <p>The Philadelphia Bulletin calls it the "Grave Yard
                        Dance," and observes:</p>

                    <p>"Union loss, killed, 2,834, wounded, 13,733; missing 6,643. Rebel loss,
                        killed and wounded, 16,379." So ran the news from Gettysburg, when the
                        terrible Three Days of July came to be summed up. "The ball opened at 9:30.</p>

                    <p>"The ladies are handsomely, though by no means extravagantly, dressed. All of
                        the most distinguished here are present. None of the generals are in
                        uniform. The candles occasionally drop, to the ruin of silk and broad-cloth,
                        and the ball may be called a success from the mere novelty of all its
                        belongings."</p>

                    <p>So runs the news from Gettysburg to-day. What a
                        delightful place for a dance! We trust that it is not as dry as the
                        neighborhood of the Gettysburg Springs Hotel as it is in Philadelphia, for
                        it would not have been pleasant to have the dust of that field blowing in at
                        the open windows of the ball-room. The nimble
                        feet of the dancers were probably too light to wake any of the out door sleepers for whom "there was no place at
                        the inn." This Terpsichorean re-dedication of the National Grave Yard only
                        disturbs the living. The dead sleep well. They laid down six years ago, in
                        terrible earnest, and their rest is long and sweet. They cannot distinguish
                        between the graceful galop of last night, and the wild gallop of the light
                        artillery; the airy evolutions of "Les Lanciers"
                        and the fierce sweep of the Sixth Cavalry are both one to those quiet men.
                        Thank God! the Grave Yard Dance does not shake their uncoffined beds.</p>

                    <p>Brave Reynolds and his comrades were not at the Gettysburg hop, last night.
                        The hour did not suit them. They take their exercise and celebrate their
                        Gettysburg festivities somewhat later than 9:30.</p>

                    <p>There is something in the idea of a dance on the field of Gettysburg, which
                        will not effect all people precisely alike. Pennsylvania could scarcely send
                        her four thousand soldiers' orphans, to enjoy a pic-nic, on that ground; and in the invitations to the hop would not
                        have been welcome messages at the thousands of firesides forever vacated and
                        desolate since those bloody Three Days mad Gettysburg famous. Gettysburg
                        belongs rather to the dead than to the living, and "it is for us, the
                        living, to be dedicated to the work that they so nobly carried on."</p>

                    <p>We honor the living soldiers of Gettysburg, but God forbid that we should
                        ever forget the dead ones! We esteem very highly many of the brave men who
                        are now assembled on that bloody battle
                        field. We are glad that their company is unmixed with the rebels and
                        traitors who were so mistakenly bidden to this gathering; but we do not like
                        dancing so near the graves of Gettysburg.</p>

                    <p>We hope this will be the last time that Pennsylvania will be humbled by the
                        avariciousness of the friends and managers of one of the greatest humbugs of
                        this century, the Katalasyne Springs.</p>

<b>Republican Economy</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper celebrates the news that Gov. Geary's administration is meeting
                    state debts faster than they mature. The editors asserts that taxpayers will

                    Democrats. The paper argues that such good news hurts Democratic chances since
                    voters will not want a return to ruinous financial policies.<br>

<b>Who Pays the Piper</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper challenges Democratic claims that Asa Packer's wealth
                    demonstrates his shrewdness with money and makes him a good candidate for
                    office. The editors charge that Packer raised rates on coal tonnage on the
                    Lehigh Valley Railroad in order to fund a $100,000 donation to the Democratic
                    State Committee. "The additional tonnage, which must be paid by the consumers,
                    who are chiefly poor and laboring men, will make up that $100,000 and Packer
                    will have the credit of furnishing it. It is not surprising that the man who can
                    manage to make the consumers of coal pay the expenses of electing him Governor

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>We would like to see our friends more alive to the issues of the present
                        canvass. Its importance cannot well be overestimated. The result would be a
                        sad one for our State, should its management pass into the hands of a party,
                        all of whose purposes are simply the promotion of the interests of party.
                        Our opponents see nothing beyond their party. The public welfare is a
                        secondary consideration, if a consideration at all. Throughout the war, they
                        watched its varying fortunes with an anxiety only for their organization.
                        Having inaugurated the rebellion, having constituted the armies of the
                        rebellion, having sympathized openly with its cause, they knew its overthrow
                        would be the death knell of their political hopes. And so they kept up their
                        organization against the active prosecution of the war, discredited the men
                        and measures employed in its conduct, and longed for its dishonorable
                        termination. No sooner had their pet confederacy fallen, than they addressed
                        themselves to preventing the restoration of peace and concord. They
                        persuaded the subdued rebels to resist the attempts at peaceful
                        reconstruction. They led a seduced and wicked Executive into measures as
                        dangerous to the welfare of the nation as open warfare. They would have
                        invited a war of races which, they were always predicting, would have
                        rendered our currency utterly worthless, and now would repudiate our debt,
                        all for party ascendency. According to their conceptions government is a
                        machinery for the support of what they call the Democratic party, and should
                        it pass into their hands for this miserable end only would they administer
                        it. Progress would be arrested, reforms retarded, humanity disregarded, the
                        palmy days of the republic as they see them in the fatal years of Buchanan's
                        rule, would be their polar star, and the sunlight of the republic would go
                        back more than ten degress in the dial of civilization. For this end they
                        select most willing instruments. Such candidates as Seymour, Vallandigham,
                        Pendleton, Sharswood, Thompson they select for their purposes. In their
                        pending canvass they present a millionaire whose fitness for the nomination
                        is his supposed ability to buy his way to power, and such a man as Pershing,
                        who has no fitness of any kind but a willingness to give a majority vote to
                        the party decisions of unscrupulous judges whose law is the will of a party.
                        The Commonwealth would become a pasture field for the battening of
                        Democratic politicians.</p>

                    <p>The loss of Pennsylvania would not affect her own interests merely. It would
                        be felt balefully over the whole country. It would assist in putting the
                        control of the country in the hands of the men who sought to destroy it.
                        They would become our masters. The living patriots who saved the nation and
                        republican forms of government would be disgraced, and the memories of the
                        dead who gave their precious lives in her defence would be dishonored. Let
                        not our apathy assist their depravity.</p>
