<b>To the Republicans of Franklin County</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper urges local Republicans to attend the County Convention. The
                    editors concede that it is a busy time for local farmers, but insist that

<b>The Campaign</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This call-to-arms both encourages participation in the upcoming Republican

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The time is very near at hand when we must engage in a stern and earnest
                        conflict with our political opponents. Before another issue of the
                        REPOSITORY, a Republican county ticket will be nominated, the preliminary
                        work will be accomplished, and the necessities and duties of the campaign
                        will summon the workers to the field.</p>

                    <p>In organizing our army let every thing be done
                        solely with a view to victory. Let there be no mistakes in the beginning.
                        All the responsibility for the success or the failure of a party in such a
                        contest depends upon the people in their primary meetings and nominating
                        conventions. If an honest desire to serve the country and the party prevail,
                        and a wise and judicious discrimination be made in the selection of
                        candidates for county and legislative offices, the State ticket will be
                        jeoparded and the county will be lost. Hence we say, it is of the utmost
                        importance that we stand right, and that the responsibility of the start
                        lies not with a few contriving local politicians, nor yet with those who
                        utter a warning voice, but with all the voters of the party in their primary
                        meetings and in their nominating conventions.</p>

                    <p>We are aware that all this is neither striking, pithy nor original. On the
                        contrary it is trite and common place. It has been uttered time after time
                        and year after year so long as your memory can recall. Yet it embodies a
                        great truth, the truth upon which, as it is used or abused, hinges your
                        success or failure. We might make appeals to you in well rounded periods,
                        and high and mighty sounding epithets, but though they did win your
                        applause, like a scenic play, when the play was done, you would go your way
                        and forget it.</p>

                    <p>When the time arrives for primary meetings, one is gone to his farm, and
                        another to his merchandise, and the responsible work of selecting honest,
                        intelligent and incorruptible men for delegates to the Convention falls to
                        the management of a few interested men, professional wire-workers, and
                        political barnacles. When the work is done, and all wrongly done, then comes
                        a growl of dissatisfaction because bad men have got the places which better
                        men should occupy.</p>

                    <p>Let there be no more disappointments, and no more growls. A reasonable degree
                        of attention on the part of those men who delight in saying that they are
                        not politicians will prevent them both, and give us a first class ticket to
                        vote for. It is not much to go to an annual election and vote, but it is
                        something to attend the primary township and ward meetings, and with a
                        little laborious care lay the foundation for a ticket which all Republicans
                        can and will support heartily.</p>

                    <p>We call upon Republicans in every district to make it a sacred duty to be at
                        the primary meetings, and to exercise their right to look after their own
                        interests; and charge them to keep all self constituted managers, and
                        officious trimmers in their proper places. Select men of high and pure
                        character as delegates, men who are interested for the body of the people
                        rather than for the office seekers, and who are acquainted with the claims
                        and qualifications of those aspiring to public positions. Then we may expect
                        popular nominations, such as will receive the hearty and enthusiastic
                        support of the party. Such local nominations, and such a support will
                        harmonize and concentrate all classes upon the State ticket, and add to its
                        strength instead of detracting from it.</p>

                    <p>Let us not forget that we must fight this campaign with an active, alert,
                        resolute and unscrupulous foe, backed with millions of money, which will be
                        poured out like water to win over the weak and venal. We must oppose them
                        with the weapons which have won so many loyal victories, and which we
                        believe are as dear as ever to the friends of a just and equal and
                        economical government. Let the party commend itself by the selection of
                        irreproachable men for candidates, and they will find favor with the people
                        if the people be mindful of their true interests.</p>

<b>Packer the Soldier's Friend</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository takes the Patriot to task for arguing that Gubernatorial candidate Asa Packer
                    is a "friend to the soldier" because he offered a large financial reward for
                    anyone who volunteered to fight in the Civil War. The Repository does not condemn this action, but rather points out that
                    Packer had a great fortune to lose during Lee's 1863 invasion of Pennsylvania.
                    The editorial suggests that Packer may have just been trying to protect his own
                    interests when he made the offer.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Patriot of the 24th inst., under the above
                        caption, undertakes to write up Packer's war record. It says that when Lee's
                        army invaded Pennsylvania in 1863, a meeting was called at Mauch Chunk to
                        raise "emergency" men, at which Packer made the following proposition:</p>

                    <p>"I will provide the necessaries of life for the family of every man who
                        enlists to-day, and the wages of those of my
                        employees who will enlist shall be paid during the time they serve in the
                        army, the same as if they worked for me."</p>

                    <p>The Patriot adds that a large number of men
                        volunteered, and that Packer kept his faith with those whom his speech sent
                        into the field as soldiers, which is very much to Packer's credit.</p>

                    <p>For this record, which we admit "is good enough what's of it, and plenty of
                        it such as it is," we are asked to accept the following exalted reflections:</p>

                    <p>"Few such true friends of the soldier as Asa Packer are to be found anywhere.
                        Only a noble nature, a liberal mind, can appreciate that heroism which
                        nerves a man to leave behind him wife and children and all the endearments
                        of home to risk his life and his all in defence
                        of his country. Judge Packer' sanction, in the instance just referred to,
                        proves that he is a man who measures at its true value the patriotic valor
                        which saved Pennsylvania from the invading host and turned the tide of
                        battle against the armies of the Southern Confederacy. Justly, therefore,
                        and without any affectation of phrase, may he be termed 'The Friend of the Soldier.'"</p>

                    <p>People are, as a rule, willing enough to accept facts, but they don't want
                        their patriotism and heroism put up in nice little parcels, and labeled,
                        ready for use. They prefer to make their own deductions; and when the
                        Patriot says "here's your nice genuine Packer patriotism, only five cents a
                        package - the friend of the soldier," it must
                        not be surprised to hear it pronounced spurious.</p>

                    <p>Few men had the means which would permit them to make the proposition which
                        Packer is said to have made, and still fewer had the strong personal and
                        pecuniary reasons to make it which he had. Lee was invading Pennsylvania
                        with an immense army; unless the tide of invasion was speedily turned back
                        the loss to the State, and especially to wealthy capitalists would be
                        incalculable. Packer's $20,000,000 were in danger. His railroad might be
                        destroyed, his extensive coal mines rendered valueless. Everything he had
                        was at stake. Was it exalted patriotism alone which prompted him to "provide
                        the necessaries of life for the families of those who enlisted" in his
                        village and from his mines, to defend his property against the invaders with
                        their lives? Perhaps it was; perhaps it was not, but we will not argue the
                        question. After all it might not be difficult to find such true friends of
                        the soldier as Asa Packer anywhere.</p>

                    <p>Now let it be understood, we do not find fault with what Packer did, we only
                        object to the false and sophistical use which is here being made of an act
                        prompted solely by his self-interest. He did well to save and protect his
                        property, but call it not patriotism, not mistake it for the act of the friend of the soldier. We might here, invited
                        to it by the Patriot, point out which of the two
                        candidates for Governor is the friend of the
                        soldier, but it would be like trying to demonstrate that white is
                        white.</p>

<b>Democratic Confidence</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reports that the Democrats of
                    Pennsylvania are confident of victory because their candidate, unlike many past
                    candidates, has a great deal of personal wealth to contribute to the campaign.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Democracy profess to be confident of success in the coming election, and
                        we are inclined to think that they are. Of course they profess to be every
                        time an election is held; it is important to assume the appearance of
                        confidence or the faint and wavering, from repeated defeats, would drop off,
                        but this time it seems to be stronger than ever. Now they have no new
                        arguments to present to the people by means of which to win enough of voter
                        to elect their candidates. They have precisely the same platform which
                        crushed Woodward and annihilated Clymer. It is true they have shifted it
                        upon the back of a new man, but Coffee-pot Wallace told the Convention which
                        nominated him that men were of no moment, but principles were everything. So
                        it cannot be the new man.</p>

                    <p>The secret of their confidence lies in this, that though they have no new
                        argument to lay before the people, they have the old one in greater
                        abundance, and the way it has already worked itself under the jackets of
                        those who were opposed to Packer's nomination is "surprisin'." Money has
                        always been a telling Democratic argument. Its only fault heretofore has
                        been, like Sam Weller's vision, that its supply was limited. But the
                        Democratic candidate for Governor is the happy possessor of $20,000,000, and
                        the confidence of the party is increased in proportion to the difference
                        between this princely sum and the paltry $50,000 which were formerly
                        exhausted in the purchase of coffee-pots, parchment and whiskey. In view of
                        the rich pluckings Democratic managers smile scornfully at the memory of the
                        thinly lined wallets with which they once attempted to corrupt the people.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>A correspondent at Orrstown writes as follows: - Having heard you express a
                        desire to have some local correspondents, giving items of local interest
                        from different sections of the county, I may occasionally, as I have time
                        and inclination, give you a few items which may be of interest, to at least
                        some of the numerous readers of the good old time-honored REPOSITORY, which
                        has been a welcome visitor to our family circle for more than a quarter of a
                        century.</p>

                    <p>With this introduction, I will direct the mind of the reader to the pleasant
                        village, or rather I should say, Borough of Orrstown, which is situated in
                        the northern part of the county of Franklin, ten or twelve miles north of
                        Chambersburg, on the road leading from Shippensburg to Upper Strasburg,
                        midway between the two places, five miles from either place, within a few
                        hundred yards of the Conodoguinet Creek, and is noted as one of the most
                        healthy locations in the county.</p>

                    <p>As there is nothing of particular interest occurring here at present, it may
                        be of some interest to give a partial description of our town, as there are
                        a great many persons even in the county who have never seen it. Just the
                        other day one of the candidates for one of the county offices said he never
                        had been here before, and was perfectly astonished to learn what a "nice
                        place we had down here."</p>

                    <p>Well, in the first place, we have a population of about four hundred
                        inhabitants, a quiet, peaceable, industrious and thrifty people, of whom the
                        greater part are engaged in the various avocations and pursuits of life, of
                        which I may give some description hereafter. Out houses are principally
                        built of brick, the buildings presenting a very unique and neat appearance,
                        and the stranger is often heard remark, what a beautiful place, we have not
                        seen as pretty a town, in all our travels, &amp;c. Not wishing to be
                        tedious, and having said thus much, we will leave its business operations,
                        churches, schools, mechanics, &amp;c., &amp;c., for some future
                        communication.</p>

                    <p>Our usually quiet town has been somewhat enlivened by certain visitors from
                        abroad. Two of the Messrs. Bard have been here for several days. They were
                        formerly from this place, but now engaged in the mercantile business in the
                        city of Chicago. Also Mr. James S. Blair, now in business in the city of
                        Alleghany.</p>

                    <p>The crops in the vicinity have been very abundant; - the wheat crop
                        especially being very heavy, and has all been stowed away in barns and
                        stacks in good order, and the farmers have reason to be grateful for having
                        had such fine weather for harvesting their crops. The oats crop will also be
                        an abundant one, and since the recent rains the corn and potato crop look
                        very promising. On the whole, I think we never had a more plentiful crop in
                        this locality.</p>

                    <p>ON Sabbath evening last, about 6 o'clock, quite a serious accident occurred
                        in our town, causing great excitement, and drew quite a crowd of men, women
                        and children to the residence of Mr. J. W. Orr. On arriving there, I learned
                        the following particulars: - Mr. McKosh, a gentleman in the employ of Mr.
                        Orr, was taking the horses to the pasture field, and had with him Mr. Orr's
                        little son, between two and three years old, carrying him in front of him on
                        the horse he was riding. When near the field, one of the horses, which was
                        running loose, viciously attacked the horse upon which they were riding,
                        kicking the man and child, which caused them to fall to the ground, cutting
                        them severely in the face. Mr. McKosh received a gash in the face and also
                        in the forehead, and the child a severe gash in the fleshy part of the
                        cheek. Dr. Max Kennedy was promptly summoned to the place, and upon
                        examination found there were no bones broken and although they were severely
                        hurt, their case was not considered dangerous. They are at present doing
                        well.</p>

                    <p>On Monday morning, W. H. Blair, Esq., Jos. Kennedy and Dr. Max Kennedy,
                        started to Tennessee, with a view of purchasing land and locating in that
                        section of the country.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Convention of the Union Republican Party of Franklin county promises to
                        be unusually interesting this year. There will be four important offices to
                        fill, and great care must be taken in selecting good, strong men. Franklin
                        county is one of the closest in the State, and discord and want of harmony
                        may give it to the enemy. It is in such localities as this that Asa Packer's
                        money will be used to corrupt. We have the material to make a ticket that
                        cannot be defeated. We print below the names of the candidates for the
                        different offices. All are good men and would give satisfaction to their
                        constituents.</p>
