               <p>At a meeting of the Republican Co. Committee, held in Chambersburg, on the 4th of
                  May last, TUESDAY, THE 3D OF AUGUST NEXT, at 11 o'clock, A. M., was selected as
                  the time for holding the County Nominating Convention, and SATURDAY, THE 31ST OF
                  JULY, at the usual time and places, for the holding of the primary meetings.</p>

               <p>The following resolution, establishing a basis of representation in the
                  Convention, was adopted by the last County Convention:</p>

               <p><emph rend="italics">Resolved,</emph> That the County Convention shall be composed
                  as follows. Each district shall be entitled to three delegates, and one additional
                  delegate for each one hundred Republican votes, or fractional part of one hundred
                  votes exceeding fifty, and that the vote given at the Presidential election of
                  1868 shall be the basis of representation.</p>

               <p>The following table gives the Republican vote of the several districts, and the
                  number of delegates each is entitled to, with the number of delegates from each
                  district under the old basis:</p>

               <p>Perhaps the most and conclusive evidence of the success which has followed Grant's
                  administration of the government is found in the bitterness with which the
                  Democracy pursue and denounce it. If any Democratic journal has yet published
                  anything in approval of a single one of his measures it has been our misfortune to
                  fail to see it. We cannot, however, open a single paper of that political
                  persuasion which does not teem with outrageous abuse and misrepresentation. All
                  this means something if we but look for it. It means that Grant is truly
                  Republican, and has disappointed the expectations of the Democracy, who hoped to
                  see him apostatize as Johnson had done before him. If General Grant had not
                  pledged himself in his inaugural address to administer the affairs of the
                  government in accordance with the principles of the Republican party, and had
                  followed in the steps of Johnson, the Democratic party would be as loud in his
                  praises today as it is in his condemnation. That he did not do so is a sufficient
                  reason for the course Democratic journals pursue. There could scarcely be anything
                  more conclusive as to the success of his administration than this, "The Democratic
                  party hates and fears him."</p>

               <p>But there is a better reason than even Democratic hate why we should be satisfied
                  with the President, and what he has done. During the campaign preceding his
                  election the favorite count in the Democratic bill of indictment was the
                  extravagance of the Republicans while in power. This was pressed from every cross
                  roads, every corner grocery and every platform. Even the eternal nigger sunk into
                  insignificance before it. We were charged with making the war debt, and
                  squandering the taxes, which should go toward paying it, and not only this, but
                  prophets were not lacking who predicted that Grant's election would increase the
                  national debt and largely augment the expenses of the government.</p>

               <p>But see how these false prophets have been brought to shame. Three months of
                  Grant's administration have reduced the national debt $36,000,000, and the current
                  expenses of the government to one half the sum of the last year of Johnson's
                  administration. Now we look for these Democratic journals, which stand as
                  sentinels on the watch tower of the Republic, and have such keen vision for
                  Republican extravagance, to herald the healthy and gratifying condition of affairs
                  under the new administration. Let us hear them proclaim their predictions false.
                  Let them convince us of their determination to be just by calling out along their
                  line the "all's well" of the Republic. We urge it as wise policy on their part. It
                  will convince the people that though mistaken in their view of the Republican
                  party, they were actuated by upright motives, and seek to subvert the best
                  interests of the people. Are we destined to look in vain?</p>

               <p>The healthful conditions of our finances, and the confidence which the people have
                  learned to feel in the administration, arise from the most simple and natural
                  causes, honesty and fidelity in the execution of public affairs. There have been
                  no great or unexpected changes in the policy of the government. Retrenchment and
                  Reform are the magical instruments which have wrought it all. They constitute a
                  policy which is fully within the comprehension of the simplest mind in the
                  country, and give the administration a strength and support which can only come
                  from the masses of the people.</p>

            <head>The Registry Law</head>
            <origin/>
            <commentary/>
            <transcript>

               <p>The question of the constitutionality of the new Registry Law will be settled by a
                  full bench of the Supreme Court, now in session in Philadelphia. The argument was
                  taken up on Friday last, and a decision will be reached before long which will
                  determine whether or not the people have a right to restrain fraud and corruption
                  in elections, and to protect honest and legitimate voters in the exercise of the
                  elective franchise. The elaborate opinion of Judge Sharswood, delivered a few
                  weeks ago, to the effect that the law was unconstitutional surprised no one, at
                  least no one who understood the intent of the law. We knew what his opinion would
                  be from the moment the case was brought before him. It could not well have been
                  otherwise. The law was framed and intended solely to prevent fraudulent voting at
                  elections, and such a law is necessarily damaging to the Democratic party. The
                  action of Judge Sharswood, in this matter, is to say the least a most remarkable
                  spectacle, and the man who finds in the constitution of the State his warrant for
                  legalizing fraud and corruption, wears the judicial ermine with exceedingly
                  doubtful propriety. Our elections have for years been notoriously fraudulent, and
                  both political parties have been justly charged with taking advantage of the loose
                  and slip shod provisions of the law to swell their votes and to carry the
                  election. Especially in Philadelphia is this the case, where it is but necessary
                  for either party to hold a sufficient number of the voting precincts, and plenty
                  of money on election day, to win. The new law was wisely and judiciously framed to
                  prevent this, by rendering it well nigh impossible for any one, not a legal voter
                  under the constitution, to deposit a ballot. It was a strong and earnest
                  declaration of the people, through the Legislature, in favor of the purity of the
                  ballot. Its provisions made no party discriminations whatever, but placed all men
                  squarely on the same footing. Those who were entitled to a vote should be secured
                  in their rights; those who were not should be retrained. One would naturally
                  suppose that such a law would meet with universal approval. We are pained to say
                  that it met universal and bitter opposition from the Democratic party. From the
                  moment of its becoming a law it has not been able to muster a friend in that
                  party. Every Democratic journal, of high or low degree, with disgusting and
                  ill-concealed concern, made haste to assail it, and make themselves the champions
                  and defenders of crime and corruption. It is too much to say that this party is
                  afraid to submit its principles and candidates to the arbitrament of elections,
                  protected against fraud and corruption by a wise and carefully constructed
                  Registry Law? Judged by its acts and its record we think not, and we hold
                  ourselves ready to condemn the law as earnestly as do the Democrats themselves, if
                  in any particular it discriminates unfairly in favor of one party or the other.</p>

               <p>We have refrained from discussing the argument of Judge Sharswood against the law,
                  based on the position that it discriminates against the voters of Philadelphia,
                  and therefore violates the constitution which provides that suffrage shall be
                     <emph rend="italics">equal and free</emph>. The Supreme Court have the question
                  now before them, and will say whether such arguments, weighed in the balance of
                  common sense and morality, shall avail to deprive the people of a measure to
                  eminently just and needful as a Registry Law. In spite of the learned opinion we
                  are sure they will not, unless they too, like Judge Sharswood, mean to aid the
                  Democracy through fraud and corruption.</p>

               <p>While the Northern Democracy are making a weak effort to prevent the adoption of
                  the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and are united in their denunciations
                  of the negro, the late Virginia rebels are vigorously working among their former
                  slaves and are trying to win their support in the ensuing election, by the use of
                  such endearing terms as "colored voters" and "colored freedmen," the Staunton
                     <emph rend="italics">Spectator</emph> even going so far as to say "colored
                  friends." Democrats of Pennsylvania, and especially Democrats of Franklin county,
                  you who have been for so many years willing to do the bidding of your Southern
                  masters, what say you to this? Will you submit to it? Why do you not in thunder
                  tones denounce this effort at negro equality that is being made by the members of
                  your own party? Democratic orators and Democratic journals in the South are daily
                  beseeching these men, whom you have been taught to despise and hate, to join your
                  party. Your papers dare not tell you this, but nevertheless it is so. You have
                  been outrageously swindled, and are in no better condition than if you had never
                  opposed the Radicals.</p>

               <p>Read and reflect what Edward A. Pollard, one of the most able advocates of
                  secession, says in an address to colored people of Virginia:</p>

               <p>Now believe me, there are other rights which you want more than political rights.
                  You want the right to have more than political rights. You want the right to have
                  justice done you in the courts, to live in the severest eye of the law as every
                  inch free. You should have it. You want something more than this - to be regarded
                  practically not as "niggers" with tickets-of-leave, not as freemen by courtesy, or
                  by any left-handed title, but as freemen in fee-simple and in full estate. You
                  should have it. From a close study of the temper of the colored people of the
                  South, I am, fully persuaded of one curious thing - that their uneasiness is not
                  so much from a desire of political influence in the community - as witness their
                  comparatively small ambition for office - as it is to be respected in their new
                  estate. I know that there are newspapers who are constantly deriding your race;
                  who have no other name for you but "nigger," or "colored cuss;" reporters who are
                  always glad to barb a police item with such epithet, who make caricatures of your
                  speeches, and "pints" of order and "notations." But a few weeks ago I noticed with
                  pain and shame that when one of your race was hung in Richmond, the few untutored
                  words he put up on the scaffold to the Savior of all mankind - words to which He
                  who say on the circle of that day and held the winds in his hands deigned to
                  incline the ear - were caricatured, and set down in the usual gibberish of the
                  funny orthographers of the newspapers; and I afterward saw two white men at a
                  hotel laughing over the dying speech of the poor wretch! Such an example of humor
                  is hideous enough to have drawn the echo of a laugh from hell. But even in their
                  lightest aspects, these derisions of your race do harm; they occasion resentment;
                  and no wonder you sometimes burn with a sense of injustice, for I can testify that
                  I have heard some colored men make better speeches than white reporters who went
                  to ridicule them could possibly have done. The insults which you habitually
                  receive - the manner in which you are looked down upon, and scorned, and
                  travestied - are, I venture to say more galling to you, and more really the cause
                  of your dissatisfaction than any want of suffrage and office. <emph rend="italics"
                     >No brave man will thus insult you;</emph> no reflecting and good white citizen
                  will thus wound you, and inflame with such wantonness the resentments of race. On
                  the contrary, there are many in the ranks of your old masters who are observing
                  your efforts at ascent and improvement, with thoughtful interest and with kindly
                  sympathy; who are bidding you "God-speed" in the emancipation of your intellects -
                  the great work that remains for yourselves; and who are wondering, piteously it
                  maybe, but thoughtfully and tenderly, how you will work our the problem that God
                  has placed in your hands. * * * * * * *</p>

               <p>The white man of the South who would insult you, to whom you are still a "Nigger,"
                  who would have black and white justice in the courts, and who would make a
                  cowardly reflection upon you for what he has lost in the war, is a dirty enemy.
                  But on the supposition that there are decent and honorable white men in the South
                  sufficient to put down this disgrace in their midst, willing to give you your
                  proper rights, and treating with respect all your real endeavors for improvement -
                     <emph rend="italics">men who recognize in you a real cause of chivalry and a
                     modern chapter of romance - who appreciate that the black man may yet bring
                     back the reign of a truer chivalry in the South, opportunity for all fine and
                     courageous spirits </emph>- men fit in every disposition to be your champions -
                  I say on this supposition you are asked to give up your causes of resentment
                  against the native whites of the South, and to abandon as well your false
                  friendships with the North and your hopes there in the selfish and fleeting policy
                  of an alien party. It is on this supposition that your whole density depends; and,
                  if it fails, believe me you are indeed lost. No merely political party can ever
                  save you. It must be done through the justice and humanity of the South itself;
                  and take care lest in passion or in self-sufficiency you drive these good angels
                  from your side.</p>
