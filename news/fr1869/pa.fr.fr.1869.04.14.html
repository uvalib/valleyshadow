<b>"An Evil Spirit Troubleth"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article refutes the Valley Spirit's
                    editorials arguing that the recent rapes by a black man are indicative of blacks
                    in general under Republicanism. The Repository
                    argues that only the single criminal is responsible and attacks the Democratic
                    party in general for its conduct over the past several years.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Valley Spirit knows the taste of its patrons
                        better than we; yet we have too much respect for newspaper readers, to
                        believe that even the most unthinking and rabid of its subscribers can
                        derive any gratification from its editorials on the late fiendish outrage
                        that sickens the hearts of our community, and the atrocity of which is
                        without parallel in the annals of crime. The flippant and indelicate style
                        indulged in by the editors, gloating obscenely over the hellish iniquity,
                        shows too clearly that they do not deplore the crime, but regard it as a
                        windfall for the especial benefit of their party, whose mission seems to be
                        only the imbruting of the negroes and forcing them into a condition of
                        abasement that would forever make them a loathing and a dread in our midst.</p>

                    <p>"The teachings of the Radicals" that all men should be equal under the law,
                        and should have a free chance for development and culture - that no caste,
                        condition or color should be suffered in a democratic government to trample
                        the manhood out of their fellow mortals of other classes, is consonant with
                        the precepts of human wisdom and the obligations of the Divine Law.</p>

                    <p>Claiming with pride the superiority of the Caucasian over all other races of
                        men, in moral and intellectual capabilities, we are ashamed to acknowledge
                        that it had furnished examples of brutality and wickedness that blanch the
                        cheek with horror, and cause our statute books to groan under fearful
                        penalties.</p>

                    <p>And we believe that meagre as the Democratic party has, fortunately, become,
                        the vast body of criminals that stain our fame as a people, are burning and
                        shining lights in that horde of national offenders. The great cess-pools of
                        vice in our large cities fester with "Democratic" teachings and teachers.
                        New York, whose anti-Republican majorities are made up to order by all
                        manner of fraud and violence, is literally beneath the dominion of outlaws
                        and cut-throats, who intimidate the courts of justice, and bully the judges
                        on the bench, instigated by the teachings and sanctioned and sustained by
                        the Democratic party. By these teachings, too, such Congressmen as the Woods
                        and Morrissey, and such blaspheming, clergy-hating organs as Brick
                        Pomeroy's, are possible.</p>

                    <p>From the same teaching come the swarms of counterfeitors (the particular
                        friends of the late President after he relapsed into his first love and his
                        natural affinities,) who, accepting the cord-wood valuation of greenbacks, think it no sin to imitate them,
                        and who lately filled our penitentaries until a sympathising Democratic
                        President turned them loose upon society.</p>

                    <p>The impunity with which this offence could be committed bore its fruits even
                        in this county, and our own prison now is ornamented by gentry of this ilk,
                        whose intense Democracy nevertheless does not prevent the social equality of
                        whiling away the time in playing "seven up" with nigger culprits in Fort
                        Fletcher.</p>

                    <p>The Spirit's efforts to fasten the responsibility
                        of Cane Norris's diabolism upon the negroes as a people is cruel and wicked.
                        As well hold the Germans responsible for the fiendishness of Probst, the
                        Swiss of Wirz, the Philadelphians of Twitchell.</p>

                    <p>The black beast, fitly so called by the Spirit,
                        would fare worse at the hands of such partisans as the Spirit men, who seek to make his brutality a systematic purpose
                        of his race, and who welcome every crime committed by a "nigger" as so much
                        water on their party wheels, and to whom no sight is so odious as a
                        respectable, well-doing colored man. It is a shameless prostitution of the
                        press to attempt, for interested purposes, to pervert this horrid outrage of
                        a brute, that disgraces mankind whether white or black, to inflaming and
                        exciting the mind of the people against a class. But as there is joy in
                        Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, so there is jubilation and triumph
                        over every "nigger" that commits an atrocity, in the breasts of evil spirits.</p>
