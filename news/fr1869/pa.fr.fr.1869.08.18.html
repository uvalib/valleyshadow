<b>The President and the South</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper asserts that President Grant's actions demonstrate his commitment
                    to supporting faithful Republicans in the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The policy of the President towards the Republicans of the Southern States
                        can no longer be disputed, for he has frankly and publicly announced it.
                        There was at no time any reason to doubt his entire sympathy with the
                        straight-out Republicans in those States, except that those who were
                        laboring to divide and defeat them, claimed to receive his encouragement and
                        influence. Then it was time for him to speak out, and this he has done in a
                        way which cannot be misunderstood.</p>

                    <p>Gen. Grant's earnest desire to bring those who had been rebels into practical
                        citizenship was clearly manifested in the Virginia campaign, in which he
                        submitted the clause of the Constitution disfranchising rebels to a separate
                        popular vote. This was construed by the Democrats and ex-rebels of the
                        Southern States to be equivalent to an admission that he desired to see the
                        Republicans in the South defeated, and the original rebel element again
                        placed in power. Upon this assumption Governor Senter had the fifty thousand
                        rebels of Tennessee registered and armed with the ballot; and this it was
                        which brought to the surface the so called National Republican party of
                        Mississippi, with Judge Dent, a life-long Democrat, as its candidate for
                        Governor.</p>

                    <p>Such was not Gen. Grant's intention, however, and he takes advantage of his
                        interview with Gen. John Tarbell, Secretary of the Executive Republican
                        Committee of Mississippi, to lay his views before the country. He deprecates
                        the efforts made to divide the party, and declares that his sympathies were
                        with the regular Republican candidate for Governor in the Virginia campaign.</p>

                    <p>This is a timely admonition to Governor Walker, not to reject the offer,
                        already scorned by some of his supporters, to unite the Republican party in
                        Virginia. On this subject the President is reported to have said, that he
                        thought Governor Walker fully committed to the administration, by his
                        speeches made since the election, and that he was honestly intending to act
                        up to them. He expressed his regret at the apparent failure of the effort of
                        Well's party to unite the two wings of the Republican party, and remarked
                        that the letter of Dr. Gilmer, the chairman of the Walker Committee, showed
                        that the followers of Walker were not acting in good faith, that the
                        Democracy intended to use the defeat of Wells for their own benefit, and did
                        not design to act with the Republican party as had been pretended.</p>

                    <p>The opinion of the President as to the conduct and policy of the Virginia
                        Democracy which supported Walker as a conservative Republican, and hope to
                        use him against the interests of the Republican party, gives us the reason
                        for his emphatic declarations concerning the campaign in Mississippi. He has
                        been watching the development of the rebel Democracy along the whole
                        Southern line, and he finds them to be no more loyal to the government to-day than they were during the war. Their whole
                        effort seemed to be made to divide the Republican party, that through the
                        divisions they might creep into power. Being perfectly powerless to
                        accomplish this so long as the Republican party remains a unit, their first
                        step is to get up a mongrel Republican ticket, and by the aid of a faction,
                        joined to their own ranks, to get control of the State. Hence, he said, on
                        the situation in Mississippi, with regrad to the recent professions made by
                        those who were lately rebels "that it seemed impossible to loyal men that
                        they would accept sincerely and so suddenly views and opinions which they
                        had resisted at such cost. He thought that he knew the Southern people, and
                        while nothing could be more gratifying to him than to know that they had
                        come in good faith up to his platform, he could not realize that such was
                        the case. His only desire was peace and amity, and he would do anything
                        which was right to bring that about. But these people cast suspicion upon
                        their own motives, by the fact that all their efforts seem to be aimed at
                        dividing, not aiding the Republican party in their midst. If they were
                        really in earnest, they would not be so anxious about those with whom they
                        voted. Sincere men could easily decide who in the South were and had been
                        the administrations friends." He concluded his interview by declaring "that
                        his sympathies were altogether with the Republicans of Mississippi, and
                        against all efforts to divide them, coming from whatever source they might."</p>

                    <p>The Republican party will look with much interest upon the campaign in
                        Mississippi. The platform of the Radicals is quite as liberal as that of the
                        Conservatives. They declare for universal suffrage and universal amnesty, as
                        well as do their opponents. Those who have been rebels and traitors, the
                        ex-Confederates, find themselves as fully taken care of, their property and
                        their lives as well protected, as do the Union people, be they white or
                        black. The influence and sympathy of the administration is with them, as it
                        should be, for if there were no better reason, the course of the
                        Conservatives and rebels in Virginia and Tennessee have shown that they are
                        not to be relied on. If they are defeated it will be conclusive evidence
                        that the rebel element is still alive and active in Mississippi, and needs
                        to be taken care of. We shall see.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Philadelphia Age asks:</p>

                    <p>"Why should a mechanic or workingman support the Radical party? What has that
                        organization done to better the condition of himself or family?"</p>

                    <p>And then says by way of answer to its own interrogatories:</p>

                    <p>"Deducting time lost by sickness and all other causes, he now earns from two
                        to three dollars per day. He has a family to support, feed, clothe, and
                        educate. Saturday night comes and he pockets twleve or eighteen dollars. If
                        he lives in a favorable locality, and has a comfortable house, three dollars
                        of the amount he receives goes for rent. Then his boys want shoes, and
                        muslin for shirts, and the family a good many other articles, meat, flour,
                        vegetables, coffee, sugar. He goes to the shoe store, the dry goods store
                        and grocery, and finds that eighteen dollars don't go as far as ten dollars
                        did ten years ago. And why? Because the Radical party has increased the debt
                        and taxation of the country by all kinds of plundering schemes. All the
                        burdens at last fall upon laboring men, and hence they are yearly becoming
                        poorer, although nominally getting higher wages. Keep the Radical party in
                        power, and workingmen will see harder times yet."</p>

                    <p>If it had not been asked a thousand time before, we would be tempted to ask
                        now why Democratic journals always assume that mechanics and workingmen are
                        stupid fools, when they address them. It is true that they are not and that
                        this quiet assumption of their ignorance must insult and offend them. The
                        mechanic or workingman will find some difficulty in determining what part
                        the Radical party had in making up the situation as it is given above,
                        except that part which works to his advantage. The average mechanic or
                        workingman never earned from two to three dollars a day before the Radical
                        party was in power. As a rule he was quite as likely to have a family to
                        support, feed and educate before that time as now. When Saturday night came
                        he didn't pocket his twelve or eighteen dollars, but had to content himself
                        with six or eight. If he lived in a favorable locality and had a comfortable
                        house, he had to pay a larger proportion of what he earned for rent then
                        than now. Boys generally do want shoes, and muslin for shirts, and the
                        family a good many other articles, meat, flour, vegetables, coffee, sugar,
                        and will continue to demand them, whether the country is ruled by
                        Republicans or Democrats. But when he goes to the shoe store, the dry goods
                        store and gorcery, is it true that eighteen dollars don't go as far as ten
                        dollars did ten years ago? And if it be true, why is it? First of all, it is
                        not true. Shoes are almost as cheap as then, dry goods cost very little if
                        any more than before the war, and provisions are to-day quite as cheap as they were then. Many of them, allowing for
                        the difference between currency and specie, are cheaper.</p>

                    <p>If we admit for the sake of argument that the price of living is dearer now
                        than then, is the reason given by the Age, that
                        the Radical party has increased the debt and taxation of the country, the
                        true one? The debt of the country is enormous, and the taxation heavier than
                        it was before the war, but who made both? The debt is a war debt; the
                        taxation is a necessity arising out of the war debt. The war brought upon
                        the country by the Democratic party attempting to overthrow the government.
                        We have yet to learn of a single Republican or Radical being engaged in the
                        rebellion; but there were hundreds of thousands of Democrats engaged in it,
                        and not a few of them were from the Northern States.</p>

                    <p>Taking it all in all, the condition of the laboring man is no worse than it
                        was before the war. With the increased wealth and diversified industry of
                        the whole country, but for the debt and taxation of the war, his condition
                        would be vastly better than then. As it is, the wise, judicious and
                        discriminating policy of the Republican party has rescued the country from
                        the financial distress, the industrial prostration and disaster which in all
                        history, before, have followed in the steps of a great civil rebellion. The
                        burdens which fall upon laboring men have been lightened, and the debt and
                        taxation are gradually growing less.</p>

                    <p>Stick to the Republican party which has saved the integrity of the
                        government, and which by its fostering care of home industry, is doing far
                        more for the poor man than ever has been done before. It is nothing less
                        than insulting effrontery for the party which brought about the war, made
                        the debt, and cause the necessity for burdensome taxation and high prices of
                        living, to ask you, workingmen, to entrust them with another lease of power.</p>

                    <p>Court continued in session all last week, his Honor Judge King presiding.

                        The attendance was as large as usual, and the atmosphere of the Court Room
                        was at different times anything but agreeable, all present suffering from
                        the heat. Notwithstanding the Jurors had been previously notified, and due
                        notice been given in the paper to those whose names had been drawn, there
                        were sixteen men of the first week's panel who ought to have been here, who
                        were absent. Those gentlemen might have got themselves into trouble, but the
                        leniency of the Court saved them from costs for their negligence.</p>
