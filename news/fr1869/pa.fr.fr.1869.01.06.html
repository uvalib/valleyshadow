<b>Murder Near Shippensburg--Arrest and Confession of the Murder</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Adam Titus, a German, was arrested in Shippensburg by Constable Hykes for
                    the murder of Henry Stem, also of German descent. The two friends were last seen
                    together leaving the house of Mrs. Frey on the property of Marshall Maius. Titus
                    returned alone, and in the company of his wife, Mrs. Frey's daughter, purchased
                    a number of goods, including a shovel with which he planned to "bury a sheep."
                    Mrs. Frey became suspicious, followed tracks in the snow, and came upon a
                    shallow grave containing the body of Stem. When confronted with the body, Titus
                    confessed. He explained that he had struck Stem with an axe after an argument
                    that he blamed on "ale, whiskey, and bad women." He was arrested as he was
                    making plans to leave for Harrisburg.<br>(Names in announcement:  Adam Titus, Constable  Hykes, Mrs.  Frey,  Marshall Maius)</blockquote>
<b>Sunshine at the Parsonage</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>I. N. Hays, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, thanks his
                    congregation for a surprise visit on New Years Eve. They brought many gifts of
                    food and provisions for the parsonage.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Mysterious</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The body of Nancy Toms was exhumed and a post-mortem inquest held in the
                    town of Mercersburg. A girl named Swank, who took up with a man named William
                    Jones, now in jail under suspicion for the robbery of Fallen's Store, had been
                    living with Toms and her nephew. Toms' nephew, about 50 years old, died a few
                    years ago under suspicious circumstances, but no charges were made. Nancy Toms,
                    about 80 years old, died suddenly after writing a will that left her house,
                    money, and eight acres of land to William Jones on condition that he and Swank
                    care for her while she lived. The citizens of Mercersburg requested an
                    investigation. Dr. Senseny, Dr. Boyle, and Mr. Hyssong conducted the inquest.
                    They are said to have evidence they will be sending to the grand jury.<br>(Names in announcement:  Nancy Toms,   Swank,  William Jones, Dr.  Senseny, Dr.  Boyle,   Hyssong)</blockquote>
<b>Readings from Gough's Lecture</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A large audience crowded the M. E. Church for Prof. Corwin V. Wilson's
                    reading of Gough's famous lecture on the evils of intemperance. Readings have
                    been popular lately, and Wilson did an admirable job of equalling Gaugh's
                    dramatic presentation. "We had no doubt of being interested in the argument of
                    the lecture, as enforcing the benefits resulting from total abstinence, as well
                    as in the terrible pictures drawn to show the evils resulting from drinking; but
                    we had no expectation that Prof. Wilson would be able to give the bold and
                    masterly delineations of those scenes with any thing approaching the dramatic
                    power and pathos of the author."<br>(Names in announcement: Prof. Corwin V. Wilson)</blockquote>
<b>Murderous Attack</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A dangerous altercation occurred at the bridge near Spring Garden Mills
                    between Harry Wilson and Dr. Diarman. The two men had been feuding for some
                    time. Wilson stalked the Doctor while he shopped at the store of J. H. Witherow.
                    He then followed Diarman home and attacked him twice, the second time inflicting
                    three dangerous wounds with a butcher knife.<br>(Names in announcement:  Harry Wilson, Dr.  Diarman,  J. H. Witherow)</blockquote>
<b>Arrested for Fishing with Stir-Nets</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    Conococheague with stir-nets in violation of an act of the legislature. Francis
                    paid a $10 fine, while the others served 30 days in Fort Fletcher. The law was
                    intended to "protect the bass placed in the creek a few years since."<br>(Names in announcement:  Francis Yeager,  Samuel Yeager,  George Yeager)</blockquote>
<b>Important Change in the Revenue Districts of Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that the state has eliminated the office of Assistant
                    Assessor in Pennsylvania distilleries. All distilleries will henceforth be taxed
                    on their full operational capacity. The act will save the state money on
                    salaries, and also decrease whiskey production and consumption as some
                    distillers go out of business and prices consequently rise.<br>

                    volunteer his services to his country at the commencement of the late war, and
                    served faithfully until its close."<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. William Earnshaw)</blockquote>
<b>Dedication Notice</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
