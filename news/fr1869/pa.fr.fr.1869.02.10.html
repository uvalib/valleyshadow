<b>Meeting of Damage Claimants</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article announces a meeting regarding reparations for damages incurred
                    along the borders of the state during the War. The paper strongly endorses such
                    repayments.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The announcement, two weeks ago, of a meeting of the citizens of Franklin
                        county, to be held on Thursday the 19th day of February, to consult on the
                        question of Border Damages, should have been Thursday, the 18th.</p>

                    <p>We hope that the meeting will be largely attended, and a full and free
                        interchange of the views of those who are interested will be had. If we ever
                        hope to receive compensation for our losses, in the war, we must not forget
                        that every day we remain inactive makes our chances more doubtful. It would
                        have been easier to secure a proper recognition of our right to compensation
                        from the Legislature, immediately after the close of the war, other things
                        being equal, than to-day. It is easier now than it will be a year hence, and
                        five years hence it would be well nigh impossible to secure anything. But
                        individual effort is of no avail in this matter. There must be a
                        concentration, of all the forces that exist, upon one point, and a harmony
                        of action to secure it. If it be deemed advisable to ask the Legislature, at
                        its present Session, to make compensation for our losses, let it be done
                        with a hearty concurrence of all our citizens, both in town and country. Our
                        only hope is with the State. The sooner we understand that we can expect
                        nothing from the General Government the sooner, and with the better reason
                        for success, will we seek to effect our purpose with the Legislature.</p>

                    <p>If the State make an appropriation, there can be but little doubt that the
                        amount thus given will be refunded by the General Government; but not so if
                        a community of individuals go to Congress to ask for aid.</p>

                    <p>The reason is obvious. The latter have no representation there, and can bring
                        but little influence to bear on the question. But if the Commonwealth once
                        assumes this obligation, the whole State is interested in recovering it from
                        Congress. Every member of Congress in the State, together with our Senators,
                        and the whole population, will work together to secure compensation. This,
                        it seems to us, is the strong and vital point of our case. The State will
                        loose nothing by being just, and making compensation, for the General
                        Government will assuredly refund the amount paid.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper chastises Congress for not providing financial assistance to Mary
                    Todd Lincoln. "The petition is plainly based on the fact that she is his widow,
                    that she is in want, that his services to the people of the United States can
                    never be repaid, and that a decent regard for him who gave his noble life to his
                    country will show itself in making ample provision for his widow, who has been
                    deprived of his maintenance and support by the blow of an assassin."<br>
