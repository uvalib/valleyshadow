                <summary>The paper asserts that the results of elections accross the country show
                    that voters are satisfied witht the Grant administration. Republicans did not
                    loose ground, even if Democrats retained control in areas of traditional
                    strength. Low turnout and lack of interest marked elections everywhere.</summary>

                <summary>A meeting was held in Loudon at Mullen's Hotel to discuss building a
                    railroad from Loudon to Mercersburg. A number of prominent Loudon citizens
                    attended. Col. Ahl and Richmond L. Jones of the Caledonia Mining, Manufacturing,
                    and Transportation Company attended in order to support the project. Their
                    company was formed to mine ore, manufacture iron, and transport it to market.
                    They have invested heavily in Franklin County and would like to see the road
                    built. The citizens of Mercersburg have raised $130,000 of a $150,000 quota. The
                    people of Loudon are called upon for a lesser contribution. The paper support
                    the project. "Never before has such an opportunity been offered them for
                    increasing the value of their lands, developing our vast mineral resources,
                    making an easy access to market, and bringing to our county capital and labor.
                    Men engaged in the iron business say that if this road is built and extended to
                    Mount Union, Franklin county can make the cheapest iron in the United States."</summary>
