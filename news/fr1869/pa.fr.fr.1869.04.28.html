<b>The Quakers and the Indians</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper applauds General Grant's developing policy of using Quakers as
                    emissaries to the Indians. "By sending among the Indians agents whose religious
                    persuasion binds them to measures of peace, and whose history fully proves their
                    adherence to it, General Grant has taken a step far in advance of the former
                    Indian policy of the Government, and thereby pledges it to conciliation and
                    kindness. If it be possible to disarm the inborn, native hostility of the
                    Indians to the white race, to eradicate their love of butchery and bloodshed, to
                    teach them to abandon their thieving, roaming, idle, vagabond life, if it is
                    possible, in a word, to civilize them, then the policy inaugurated by the
                    President is incomparably the wisest and best yet suggested."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper jokes that Senator Cameron's speech complainign that he has no

                    Thomas for the office of Register and Recorder. Shade performed admirably in
                    assisting Mr. Strickler, the present Register and Recorder, and deserves a shot
                    if Strickler steps down. Shade did much of the day-to-day work anyway, since
                    Strickler had lost an arm in the war.<br>(Names in announcement:  Henry S. Shade,   Strickler)</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>In another column will be found the order of Gen. Logan, requesting the
                        observance of this day. As this day falls on the Sabbath this year, it is
                        left to the choice of the people to say whether they will observe Saturday
                        or Sunday. There certainly would be no impropriety in strewing flowers over
                        the graves of our departed heroes on the Sabbath day. The great majority of
                        them were at one time members of the different Sabbath Schools of our town,
                        some of them no doubt fell martyrs to the cause which they espoused, on this
                        holy day, and we, their survivors, could give no better token of our
                        admiration for their patriotism and of our sincere regret at their death,
                        than to participate in the solemn services of an occasion like this. If our
                        Ministers and Sabbath School Superintendents would unite in this matter with
                        the veterans of the late war, and the friends and relations of those who
                        fell that we might live, we feel confident that this decoration day would be
                        one long to be remembered. There has as yet been no programme made for these
                        interesting ceremonies, and we make the above suggestions, resting assured
                        that should they not be adopted, some arrangements will be decided upon that
                        will answer the purpose equally as well.</p>
