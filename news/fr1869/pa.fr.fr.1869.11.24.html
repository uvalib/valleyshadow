<b>The Legislature and the Press</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors blast the Republican legislature for not heeding the warnings
                    of the press to reign in corruption and waste. The paper believes that the party
                    only escaped electoral disaster because the Democrats were too weak to take
                    advantage of the recent poor performance of the Republican legislature.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>It was once a fact that Legislative bodies sought to learn the wishes of
                        their constituents, and to act in accordance with them. Such a theory exists
                        yet, but practically it is only a pleasing fiction. Legislatures have long
                        since both abolished and demolished the old-time notion that their members
                        assemble to consult and act for the public good. In fact, nearly every thing legitimately pertaining to these
                        bodies have been abolished, except the Legislatures themselves; and they
                        stick with a pertinacity which affords little warrant to believe that,
                        though well nigh every thing which called them
                        into existence has sloughed off in the forgotten past, their days of
                        dissipation and dishonesty are numbered.</p>

                    <p>The sentiment of the people upon any question of public interest is best
                        ascertained from the expression it finds through the public press. Indeed it
                        is the only way, except in the choice of public servants at the ballot-box.
                        Last year the Republican press of the State demanded, almost with unanimity,
                        that the profligate legislation and extravagant expenditures which disgraced
                        the few preceding years, should then cease. The odium brought upon the
                        party, the arms put into the hands of the Democracy, the disgust aroused
                        among honest Republicans, the utter impossibility of retaining the supremacy
                        of the party in the State, were all urged as reasons for this demand, if the
                        common honesty of the Legislature itself was not sufficient to warrant it.
                        Regarded merely as a question of policy, as a necessary precaution, if there
                        were no higher motive, the experience of the last political campaign proved
                        that their timely admonitions should have been heeded. If there was not more
                        iniquitous legislation than the year before, there was as much. If there
                        were not more supernumeraries sucking the blood of the people than before,
                        there were as many. If there were no new fat jobs created to conciliate
                        Bergner and rob the people, the old ones were reduced neither in number nor
                        in size. Hence, when the campaign began, the great and only danger which
                        imperilled the success of the party was the indefensible record of the
                        Republican Legislature. Many Republican voters were indifferent or
                        positively opposed to the re-election of
                        representatives of their own party, and in some instances, where old members
                        had secured their own renomination, they actually compelled their withdrawal
                        from the ticket. They should be universally commended for it. The Democratic
                        journals were not slow to take advantage of the wrongs done by the
                        Legislature and press them upon the attention of the voters of the State.
                        Though their own members had been conspicuously active in many of them, they
                        were in the minority in both branches, and the people did not hold them
                        responsible. It was no defence of Republican
                        members that they, too, had been guilty. They alone were powerless to do
                        either good or harm, however willing they may have been.</p>

                    <p>Though the Republican party was again successful an examination of the vote
                        throughout the State clearly shows that its success was due to the positive
                        weakness of the Democratic State ticket, and the unwillingness of the loyal
                        masses to put the power of the State in the hands of a party which had
                        proved itself disloyal during the late war. These things saved us the State,
                        and only saved it, in spite of the damage done by the last Legislature. It
                        would not be safe to try again.</p>

                    <p>Again the Republican press demands that the Legislature shall start right:
                        first, in its organization, by turning adrift the corrupt men who have made
                        it a reproach, and by selecting a speaker, and clerks, and heads of
                        committees who will not need the doubtful commendation of journals which are
                        forever tongue-tied when a voice of warning or of condemnation is needed,
                        and always blatant to qualify and smooth over when an outrage is done:
                        second, by lopping off all the running sores and excrescences which drained
                        the Treasury of so many thousands last winter. The subject was pretty well
                        ventilated before, and the people are not ignorant as to what expenses are
                        necessary and what superfluous, and diverted from their proper channels, to
                        feed an army of retainers, whose use the members best know. Let it be
                        understood that there shall be nothing concealed or withheld, and that the
                        responsibility for every wrong act shall be saddled on the proper party. Let
                        those who stand up in their places and denounce journals which they cannot
                        muzzle, but whose influence they are always ready to seek when candidates
                        for re-election, know that their evil deeds
                        shall be heralded from one end of the State to the other; then, if they make
                        the Legislature a burden too heavy for the party to bear, let the party
                        repudiate them, as some of them were repudiated at the last election.</p>

<b>Too Low</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper asserts that teacher's salaries are too low. An article in a
                    Philadelphia paper gave a rundown on the folowing professions: cook, receives $3
                    to $4 per week, and is found equal to $6 to $7; coachman, receives $5 to $6 per
                    week, and is found equal to $10 to $11; laborer, receives $10 to $12 per week;
                    policeman receives $17.50 per week; school teacher of the lowest grade receives
                    $6.92 per week. The paper asserts that the situation is similar in Franklin, and
                    that there is no hope of raising the quality of education in the area until
                    teacher salaries are raised higher.<br>

<b>The Fifteenth Amendment</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that Tennessee rejected the 15th Amendment while Alabama
                    ratified it. The editors believe that, paradoxically, strong Union rule in
                    Tennessee during the war made post-war resistance of the government more likely.
                    Alabama, they claim, felt the effects of war and the errors of her ways while
                    Tennessee did not.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The House of Representatives of Tennessee, on the 16th inst., rejected the
                        Fifteenth amendment, as it was expected that it would do. Indeed there has
                        been no doubt in the minds of the friends of the Amendment that Tennessee
                        would go against it since the election of Governor Senter. About the same
                        time intelligence comes from Alabama that her Legislature has ratified it by
                        a very decisive majority. The Amendment, therefore, is no worse off than
                        before, but if any thing better. Tennessee was sure to reject it, and
                        Alabama was not so sure to adopt it. The result is favorable. Now let the
                        remaining Republican States ratify it without delay, and finish the work.
                        There is no longer any human probability that it will fail to become part of
                        the supreme law of the United States, and the sooner this result is reached
                        the better.</p>

                    <p>The action of Tennessee in this matter, as well as her election, is another
                        proof how unfortunate for the Border States it was that they were not
                        allowed to carry out their disloyal inclinations and go off into the
                        Confederacy. The rebels in these States were restrained in nothing during
                        the war, unless, perhaps, in the wagging of their treasonable tongues; they
                        were not punished, nor was their property sacrificed, like that of the
                        States which seceded. They have not suffered. Hence they are as arrogant and
                        as disloyal to the Government which saved them from perdition as ever they
                        were. Tennessee, Kentucky and Maryland have no love for the Union, while
                        Alabama, on the other hand, cordially adopts the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
