<b>High-Toned Democracy</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper gloats that the defeat of Democrat Packer in the governor's race
                    has touched off squabbling within the Democratic Party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>There is always something entertaining to Republican spectators in a square
                        fight between members of the Democratic household, especially if the
                        contestants are none of your common Democrats, but real bona fide
                        politicians, and editors of little newspapers which rejoice in being the
                        "organ of the party" in their respective counties. The fiercest quarrels are
                        family quarrels, is the experience of all the world, and the most amusing
                        family quarrels are those who look on as at a dog-fight, merely to enjoy the
                        sport, are such as take place in the Democratic family. There is no denying
                        that the average Democrat is a peculiar animal, and believes that the most
                        ponderous argument against an opponent, consists in calling him names and
                        epithets, which suggest objects offensive to the sense of smell, repulsive
                        to the sight, or loathsome to the imagination. He who wields these most
                        felicitously, and hurls them at his enemy most recklessly, is generally
                        conceded to have the best of the argument. If he calls him a "miserable
                        creature," a "slimy, hissing serpent," a "bloated, grovelling toad," or a
                        "cesspool of corruption," he is almost sure to be regarded as having totally
                        demolished his adversary.</p>

                    <p>Many Republican readers may regard this statement as overdrawn, but it is
                        not. A Democratic paper lies before us which fully establishes all we have
                        said.</p>

                    <p>The defeat of the millionaire candidate for Governor in this State, seems to
                        have left some sore heads in the Democratic party, who imagine that they did
                        not get a fair share of the rich man's plunder, and they persist in asking
                        ugly questions of others whom they think circumstances favored more highly
                        than themselves.--Gibson, of the Genius of
                        Liberty, of Fayette county--we would like him better if the name of
                        his paper did not convict him of being an arrant demagogue--asks Myers, of
                        the Bedford Gazette, whether it was pay the
                        latter was after, when he sought the Chairmanship of the Democratic Central
                        Committee, and the handling of Packer's money-bags! and inquires why he
                        informed a certain gentleman that Packer could go to hell if he didn't make
                        him chairman? He also asks him if he compromised with Packer for the deputy
                        management of the central counties! and why he was lukewarm in the
                        Senatorial contest between Scull and Findley, in his own district? These
                        questions are rather direct it is true, but they are respectful, and
                        entitled to a respectful answer. If Myers had nothing to conceal, he could
                        have answered them briefly and to the satisfaction of his readers.--This is
                        the way he does answer them:--"Gibson of the
                            Genius of Liberty, whose name stinks in the
                        nostrils of the Democracy of Fayette county, as the very skunk weed of
                        corruption, dare not deny that he declared in Philadelphia last fall, that
                        Packer's vote in that county would depend altogether on how much money was
                        given him by the State Committee for the purchase of his independent
                        candidate for Prothonotary. He fights very shy on that subject, and beats an
                        inglorious retreat under cover of a scattering fire, armed however, a little
                        too low to hurt any one who does not lie in the same depths of political
                        infamy, in which the miserable creature of the Genius perpetually grovels. Dropping the metaphor,"
                        &amp;c.--Myers calls this metaphor. * * * "Let this cowardly blackguard
                        whose congenial business it is to libel those whose fair fame his corrupt
                        nature prevents from emulating, ask the Democrats of this Senatorial
                        District, whether we were lukewarm in the struggle between Findlay and
                        Scull." After more of like kind, he covers himself all over with glory or
                        dirt, and no doubt even astonishes himself in the brilliancy of his last
                        sentence. His opponent is demolished, and inspired with mingled pity and
                        scorn, he drops him thus: "But we have already said more on this subject,
                        than the nature of it warrants. Let the vain coward of the Genius eject his slimy words. They are quite
                        innocuous."</p>

                    <p>We look in vain for any instance of decency, dignity or manhood throughout
                        the article from which we have quoted, yet it is likely that its author
                        regards it as a conclusive and unanswerable reply to the questions which
                        were respectfully put to him. We look equally in vain for a direct answer,
                        for a single explanation, or for any attempt at reasoning or argument. Yet
                        this man Myers,--we need not withold the name for the names are called out
                        by themselves--is an admitted leader of his party not only in his county but
                        throughout the congressional district, and has been and active and
                        formidable aspirant for congressional honors. He is even now looking and
                        laboring with a view to securing the next Democratic nomination for that
                        position, and it is said that he is likely to succeed. We can imagine with
                        what feelings the intelligent and gentlemanly voters among the Democracy
                        will march to the polls and vote to put such a man into such a position.</p>

<b>The Jews in Russia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper calls on Americans to support equal treatment of the Jews in
                    Russia, reminding readers that the "struggle in behalf of human rights" has no
                    borders. The editors believe that the mission of all governments is to destroy
                    all "distinctions on account of religion, condition, race, or color."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The great struggle in behalf of human rights is not confined to any party nor
                        to any country. Man, as man, and not because he is an individual member of
                        any class, clan or caste, has rights inherent and inalienable, and no
                        national, religious, or social organization can with impunity infringe upon
                        those rights. The only marked distinction ever ordained by the great Creator
                        of all, was the election of the seed of Abraham, which he constituted a
                        distinct organization, invested with peculiar privileges, not, we are told
                        in scripture, for their own sakes, but that through them higher and more
                        inestimable privileges should be extended to mankind. The fullness of time
                        having come, this distinction itself was abolished, and the blessings of the
                        Gospel, which is the highest favor of God to man, were extended to every
                        creature. In the economy of Heaven, there is now neither<br> "Greek nor
                        Jew, Barbarian, Scythian, nond nor free."</p>

                    <p>But man, erring, selfish man, is wont to establish and keep up certain "walls
                        of partition," to separate between those of the same flesh and blood, and by
                        virtue of those distinctions, to trample on the rights which are common to
                        all. We hear much in regard to superiority of races and people, but if
                        superiority in one respect or another, can be a justification for oppression
                        of man in his rights, then indeed the doctrine would soon obtain, "that an
                        inferior has no rights which a superior is bound to respect." Scripture,
                        reason--nay selfishness itself--demands equality of rights in society, and
                        before the law.</p>

                    <p>Every government, therefore, should overturn, and overturn and overturn its
                        fundamental and municipal law, until all distinctions on account of
                        religion, condition, race or color, are swept from the face of the earth
                        when man, because he is a man, made in the image of his Creator, may stand
                        upon his rights, and claim their vindication before all judicial tribunals
                        on earth. One of these inalienable and inherent rights of man, is to live in
                        whatever part of God's habitable globe he chooses, or in fact, where he may,
                        in the providence of God, be compelled by circumstance to live. "God hath
                        made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the
                        earth; and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of
                        their habitation." Acts 17c., 26v. Even the Israelites, who by direct
                        revelation, were assigned to the land of Palestine, were commanded to
                        respect the rights of strangers. "If a stranger sojourn with you in your
                        land, ye shall not vex him. But the stranger that dwelleth with you, shall
                        be as one born amongst you, and thou shalt love him as thyself." Levit.
                        19c., 33 and 34vs.</p>

                    <p>America, which received the exiles from the continent of Europe, and now
                        stands foremost of the nations of the earth in vindicating the rights of
                        man, is appealed to by the scattered Israelites, to use its friendly
                        interposition with the Czar of Russia, to prevent the expatriation of the
                        Jews from their home in the midst of winter. And we have reason to believe
                        that the great Autocrat of all the Russias, from his throne in the East,
                        will listen to a respectful request from our government, in regard to these
                        unfortunate people. He, of his own accord, in 1863, emancipated thirty-eight
                        millions of serfs, sixteen millions of whom belonged to the Crown. When the
                        greatest nations of the earth, Russia and the United States, shall, not only
                        by precept but by example, teach the powers of the earth that man, as man,
                        irrespective of race, religion, or color, has rights, then will all the low
                        and sordid attempts of political partisans, to array one race against the
                        other, be met by the people with that contempt and derision, which should
                        always repel from our consideration the appeals to passion and prejudice, in
                        which ignoble spirits delight to indulge. Let the conflict rage; time will
                        crown with success the efforts of those who labor for the education,
                        elevation, and christianization of all mankind.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Congress met on Monday. As the President's message will not be given to the
                        press before it is read in Congress, we cannot lay it before our readers
                        until next week. It is said that the President has given much careful study
                        to the subjects discussed in the message, and it is a much shorter paper
                        than Presidential messages usually are. This is certainly no fault, and if
                        it is as clear, concise and pointed as his other official productions, both
                        civil and military, have been, it will be perused with unusual interest. The
                        present session of Congress will be marked by serious work, because the
                        people are in a serious mood, and they look to that body to help them out of
                        some of their troubles. The members have had much intercommunication with
                        their constituents, and ought to have learned many things of value to assist
                        their judgment in the business of legislation. Some of the important
                        committees have travelled from place to place during the summer, and have
                        studied the needs of the people on both sides of the continent.</p>

                    <p>The finances of the country call loudly upon Congress for some legislation,
                        which will give a new impetus to industry and manufactures. The tariff
                        regulations ought to be revised, and such imports as are necessaries, and
                        enter into the consumption of all classes of people should be relieved from
                        duty. The revenue of the government will admit of this without giving
                        embarrassment, and the necessity of the government is the only reason at any
                        time, why it is justifiable to impose a tax upon such imported commodities
                        as are necessary, and cannot be produced among us. The question of the
                        recognition of Cuba will be considered early in the session. It cannot be
                        too soon. Reconstruction of the South may see its final accomplishment this
                        winter. Further effort is needed, and urgent necessity demands that it be
                        given, to clean out fraud and corruption in the civil service of the
                        government. The President is pledged to this, and is striving to perform all
                        he has promised. Let Congress aid him by competent legislation.</p>
