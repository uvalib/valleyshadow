               <p>THE LAST CABINET MEETING - THE END OF THE JOHNSON REIGN AS DESCRIBED BY MR. NASBY.</p>

               <p>WASHINGTON, D.C., March 5, 1869.</p>

               <p>The agony is over! A. Johnson, spurned by an ungrateful people, wich didn't
                  deserve so sweet a boon, is wunst more a privit citizen; and uv no more account
                  than I am - nor ez much, for I am still a postmaster.</p>

               <p>Ez I wuz in at the birth uv the Johnson party, so it wuz my painful duty to be in
                  at the death. I wuz present at the first and last uv its Cabinet meetins. The
                  first wuz a eggsileratin scene - the last the most mournful I ever witnist.</p>

               <p>At the first we started out with high hopes - fresh in our offisis, with a
                  Treasury to draw on wich seemed to us to have no bottom, and with sich men as
                  Raymond, Weed, et al to give us character, and the
                  voice uv the thousands uv patriots wich wanted offis biddin us God speed - at the
                  last there was left only those who hed become so fixed that they couldn't get
                  away, and every one of em conshus that the next day at 12 M. they wuz foevere
                  lost. The harlot commencin her career with youth, beauty, strength and store
                  clothes is one thing - the same bein holler-eyed, sunken cheeks, dirty and
                  drabbled, turned out to die on a dung-hill, aint so pleasant to look at.</p>

               <p>The meeting wuz held in the same old room in wich I hev seen more weepin than ever
                  tell to the lot uv one man. The administrashen of A. Johnson will be known in
                  history ez the moist Administrashen. It wuz in this room that we decided to veto
                  the Freedmen's Buro and Civil Rites Bills, and all the other acts of the 39th
                  &amp; 40th Congresses. It wuz in this room that we received the news of the
                  eleckshens uv 1866, '67 and '68; it wuz in this room that the Philadelphia
                  Convneshen wuz determined upon, and the tetchin march of Couch and Orr,
                  arm-in-arm, up the aisle wuz arranged; the President writing at the same time his
                  little speech in which he menshond the fact that, ez he read the account thereof,
                  he couldn't restrain his emoshun, but busted into a flood uv teers; it wuz in this
                  room that the spontaneous triboots uv respect toward his Eggslency at various
                  times and places wuz arranged, and the details there fixee up, in short, it wuz in
                  this room that all the acts wich gild the memory uv the late administration wuz
                  decided upon, and evenchoally wept over.</p>

               <p>Ez I entered it - for the last time probably - I bust into tears on the threshold
                  and jined the other weepers who hed bin distillin briny greef for some hours.
                  Indeed so long hed they bin weepin that one friend uv the President, who hed a
                  Kentucky countenance, howled piteously for some liquid to replace that which he
                  hed lost. A bottle wuz handed him and he wept no more. I tried to strengthen me
                  agin the waste that I knowd must ensoo. Ingratitood is not my failure. Till A.
                  Johnson gits back to Tennessee my eyes shel not be dry.</p>

               <p>The President was terribly calm and composed.</p>

               <p>"Weep, my friends!" sed he, "weep. I can't blame yoo, for yoo
                     are about to be deprived of me! But in this trying hour I will be calm.
                  I hev swung around the entire circle uv offishel honor, I hev ben - </p>

               <p>At this pint his voice trembled, and his eyes wuz suffoosed.</p>

               <p>"But no! I will be myself. Sekretary Seward, is there any more acts uv a
                  unconstitooshnel Congress to veto?"</p>

               <p>"No - pockitin uv em ansers the purpose."</p>

               <p>"Is there anybody to pardon?"</p>

               <p>"No one - but stay. Now that I think uv it, two counterfeiters, one whisky
                  speculator, a Confederit officer or two, and wats left uv the assassinashen party,
                  still languish either in basteels or in exile."</p>

               <p>"I must finish my work. Hand me them blank pardons."</p>

               <p>He wrote with a firm hand, a fillin uv em out, wich only took a second, ez he hez
                  blanks printed for all the various offences men kin be guilty uv.</p>

               <p>"Now, then, my dooties is accomplished, and I cheerfly resine the power wich I
                  wood hev laid down long ago but for the sake uv my bloodin country. I wood hev
                  saved my native land, but ---- Enuff. Admit our friends."</p>

               <p>Mayor Munro, uv Noo Orleans, Mrs. Cobb, a score or more uv Confedrit officers and
                  a flood uv unforchenet men hed bin accoosed uv tamperin with an uncontooshnel
                  currency, and a hundred, more or less, uv Fedral offis-holders filed in and shook
                  the President corjelly by the hand, dropin a silent tho elokent teer ez they
                  passed. There was, in addishen to these, sevrel hundred poor wretches who had bin
                  layin about Washington for months waitin for posishens, but who hedn't got em.
                  They hed no money to get home with, and they insistid that the President must and
                  shood furnish em means. One uv em demanded uv Randall $500, but that great man
                  finally got rid uv him by loaning him a clean shirt and a box uv paper collars.</p>

               <p>The man was deprest, though still hopeful. "This," sed he, wavin the shirt in air,
                  "this is all I hev to start on agin - when I embarkt into Johnsonism my friends
                  fell off. In remorse I took to likker, and step by step went down till I became
                  the loathsome objick yoo behold. But I shel now reform, and try to be somebody.
                  Disguised in this shirt, I may inspire confidence, and find a helpin hand. But
                  don't none of yoo speak to me on the street.</p>

               <p>Ez I saw him the next evenin in a state uv hilarity hangin to a lamp-post,
                  repeatin porshens uv the late President's address to passersby without any clean
                  shirt on. I judged remorse hed overcome him agin, and that the clean shirt hed
                  been pawned. Poor fellow!</p>

               <p>Then come the most saddest scene uv all. The President hed to bid adoo to his
                  Cabinet.</p>

               <p>"My tried and trustid friends," he commenced, when Randall broke in with the
                  onfeeling remark that he'd better say "trustid friends," without the "tried."</p>

               <p>"My liege, 'yoor tried freinds' wuz in that gang uv counterfeiters wich jist left
                  the presence. They wuz not only tried, but convicted."</p>

               <p>Sekretary Seward wuz visibly affectid. They afternoon he had heard uv an island
                  for sale, the principle volcano on wich was mostly stopped gushin, and he wept to
                  think he hedn't time to complete negociashens for it. It wuz offered for
                  $200,000,000, and he considered the price a mere bagatelle.</p>

               <p>Secretary Welles wuz the only cheerful one in the party. He had no idea that he
                  wuz to stop bein Sekretary uv the Navy - he expectid to do along ez tho nothin hed
                  happened. Seward and Randall hed bin tryin for an hour to make him comprehend the
                  sitooashen - that ther wuz to be a change - but to no purpose. He coodent git it
                  thro him. I undertook to impress it onto his intellek, but my efforst wuz futile.
                  Huggin to his buzzum a model uv a Erie canal boat which he hed determined to
                  remodel into a revenoo cutter, he kept sayin, "Why - why shood I go out? I wuz
                  under Linkin and Johnson than there is between Johnson and Grant, is there? I
                  agreed with Linkin and with Johnson, and I shel agree with Grant, doubtless. Why
                  shood I differ with Grant?"</p>

               <p>Randall smiled a sardonicle smile at the aged infant, and remarkin that he
                  (Randall) hed hed a good time uv it anyhow. The recolleckshen whereof the
                  Abolitionists coodent rob him uv shook hands with A. J., addin that he didn't bear
                  him any ill will.</p>

               <p>"I'm a rooined man," continyood Randall, "but I'm ez much to blame ez yoo are. I
                  shell go into histry coupled with yoo - my bloomin boys when they arrive at man's
                  estate, will apply to the Legislachers uv their respective States to hev their
                  names changed to suthin else. I'm young and can't die in a few years ez Welles
                  kin, and must therefore drag out a longer eggsistence, but I don't blame yoo. I
                  went into it takin the chances, and I stand the hazzard uv the die. I shel serve
                  the ambishus youth uv this country ez an Awful Eggsample."</p>

               <p>But little remained to be done. Randall and Johnson arranged to hev Welles absent
                  from Washington for a week followin the inaugurashen, knowin that otherwise he'd
                  hev to be carried out uv the department by main force. They appointed a committee
                  uv Connecticut men to keep him busy till after his successor wuz installed, and,
                  skin hands all around, each sheddin a manly tear, the last Cabinet meetiin uv A.
                  Johnson's Administration passed into history.</p>

               <p>Uv the inauguration uv Grant the next day, I hev not the heart to write. Suffice
                  it to say that niggers participated in it! Niggers wuz on the sidewalks, not ez
                  the olden time, humble and meek, but in chairs, waitin to see the procession pass,
                  amoosing theirselves the while and readin noosepapers.</p>

               <p>Deekin Pogram, who wuz with me, called my attenshen to this, asken ef it wuz
                  possible for a Kentuckian whose eyes beheld sich a site to hev any faith in
                  republikin institooshens? The old saint shuddered visibly ez a nigger in a dress
                  coat, plug hat and shiny boots passed us, nearly knocking us into the gutter in
                  their haste, his wife onto his arm, dressed in the height uv feshion, with a
                  panyer. He smiled feebly, and in a bewildered way, busted nothing. The site uv a
                  nigger regiment marchin in the perceshun finished the Deekin. He grew so faint
                  that I had to take him to his lodgins. He left the same evening for the Corners.</p>

               <p>The members of the late Administration hev not decided what to do. Browning will
                  probably go into a claim agency in Noo York. Randall remarkt that ef Sammy Cox and
                  Jack Rogers cood succeed in Noo York, he thot he cood. Mrs. Cobb will go to Noo
                  York, and probably the pardon brokers, lobbyists and sich will do likewise. A
                  dozen or two faro banks packed up tonite, and others will speedily follow'em. In
                  consekence uv this breakin up in the Administration and its supporters, the
                  poleece force uv Washington hez bin already leesoned.</p>

               <p>I shel accompany the late President to Tennessee and take my leave uv him then. He
                  will want some faithful friends to console him in that dreary passage, and who so
                  fit for the offis as the undersigned. I shel see him entombed in Greenville, and
                  then sadly turn my steps to Kentucky and await the ishoo uv evence. I shel uv
                  course be turned out of offis, and what will follow I know not. A. J. may conclood
                  to stump Tennessee for the Governorship, ez Brownlow hez the paralysis; if so, I
                  shell go to his recue. I can't now go to his rescue. I can't now go to Noo York,
                  for that city will be overrun. With Browning, Randall, and the thousands who go
                  out uv offis with em, in that city, wat chance would there be for me.</p>

               <p>PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M.,<br> (Wich is Postmaster.)</p>

               <p>P. S. - The press wich is now subsidized is animadvertin upon ex-president Johnson
                  for not appearin at the inaugurashen. His eggslency preferred to avoid the
                  display. "Let Grant start fair," he nobly sed. "I will not mortify him by givin
                  the throng wich hez flocked here to pay triboots uv respek to me an opportoonity
                  to hurrah for me ez the procession passes. I hev swung around the entire circle uv
                  offishel honor and kin afford to be magnanimous. Let him hev the entire credit uv
                  wat enthoosiasm is manifested."</p>

               <p>Cood any thing be more noble? P. V. N.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

               <p>On Friday morning, the 19th inst., our usually quiet community was greatly excited
                  by the announcement that on the previous day, a negro had committed rape on three
                  ladies of the highest respectability. We will endeavor to give the facts of each
                  case as they were made known, to us, on reliable authority, without mentioning
                  names. It appears that on Thursday morning last, between 11 and 12 o'clock, the
                  negro first made his appearance at a house about a mile from the Waynesboro road
                  and two and a half miles South of Chambersburg. There was no one about the
                  premises except a young girl, not quite thirteen years of age. The father of this
                  child was from home attending to his business and the mother was assisting a
                  neighbor to move. When the negro was seen approaching the house the child locked
                  the door in order to keep him out. He endeavored to burst the door open but
                  failed, and finally threatened to burn the building if he was not admitted. He was
                  then permitted to enter and when in, demanded all the money in the house. The
                  terrified child says she gave him a "levy" and some other change, in all amounting
                  to ninety cents. Having obtained the money he foully violated her person,
                  resistance on her part being in vain, on account of the superior strength of the
                  infuriated brute. His purpose accomplished, he told her that if she ever informed
                  on him he would follow her and have his revenge by killing her. On leaving the
                  house he was traced towards Stoufferstown, taking sufficient time by the way,
                  however, to steal a hammer from a farmer which he afterwards sold for a quarter,
                  stating he had purchased it from a gentleman in Chambersburg a short time before,
                  for one dollar. He is afterwards heard of at a farm house where he was furnished a
                  good supper. He had gone but a short distance from this last place, when he met a
                  young lady returning from a moving, and almost in sight of the house where she
                  lives, knocked her on the head and succeeded in raping her person.</p>

               <p>Scarcely twenty minutes elapsed until he overtook another young lady crossing a
                  field to her home, when he assaulted her with all the ferocity of a fiend. She
                  fought him as best she could and would have mastered him but he drew a razor and
                  threatened her life. In the struggle she was very much injured, but was forced to
                  yield. These horrible crimes were committed between 11:30 A. M. and 4:30 P. M., of
                  the same day, and all occurred in a distance of about three miles from the scene
                  of the first diabolical deed. As soon as the facts were made known search was made
                  for the black scoundrel, but the night approaching, efforts to find him were not
                  successful. We might say here that he was tracked to the pike leading from
                  Chambersburg to Greenvillage, from there across the creek, down towards Eyster's
                  Paper Mill, and thence to a small grocery on a lane leading from Front street to
                  the mill, where a few days previous he had pawned a razor. He redeemed the razor,
                  and in reply to a question why his hands were bloody said that he had cut them
                  with a knife. The truth of the matter doubtless is, that it was the blood of his
                  last victim. He afterwards said in Wolfstown that he had killed a dog that had
                  attacked him.</p>

               <p>On Friday morning Sheriff Fletcher arrested a colored man named Cambridge Adanis,
                  often called Norris, who corresponded with the description furnished him of the
                  villain, and lodged him in jail. The prisoner, on being questioned, told a
                  straight-forward story, and there was some doubt as to his guilt, but further
                  investigation showed he had been lying. During Friday there was great excitement,
                  and open expressions in favor of lynch law. Many of our best citizens felt that an
                  example should be made of this devil that would forever serve as a warning. Never
                  before in the history of Franklin county had such a horrible series of crimes been
                  committed by one man. There was an intense feeling of sympathy for the sufferers
                  from the brutal passions of this inhuman wretch.</p>

               <p>The Sheriff feeling alarmed for the safety of the prisoner, called on Capt. G. W.
                  Skinner, commander of the Housum Zouaves, for assistance in case of trouble. About
                  8 P.M. the firebell was sounded, and men at once made
                  up their minds that an attack would be made on the jail. The fire companies turned
                  out, but the crowd rushed to King street, towards the prison. They were addressed
                  by Sheriff Fletcher, Hon. D. W. Rowe, T. B. Kennedy, Esq., Lyman S. Clarke, Esq.,
                  John R. Orr, Esq., Capt. G. W. Skinner, and others, who plead with them not to
                  injure the prisoner, but to let the law take its course. It struck us that there
                  were many words wasted, for it was the weakest attempt for a mob that could
                  possibly be. These would-be vindicators of Justice, from the top of an engine, or
                  the midst of a crowd, bravely bellowed, "fetch him out," "hang the nigger," "go
                  for him," etc., and not one had the courage to distinguish himself in the attack.
                  There was too much blowing for practical work, and the only thing done was
                  frightening of the Sheriff's family. The Housum Zouaves were called out, and the
                  true soldiers shouldered their muskets, marched to the jail and the crowd
                  dispersed. The jail was guarded during the night, and has been since.</p>

               <p>The great majority of our law-abiding citizens are opposed to mob-law and will
                  stand by the officers in resisting it. Our Courts will see that the prisoner has a
                  fair and impartial trial and if found guilty will punish him as he deserves under
                  the law, but all lawless proceedings should be discountenanced, for when once
                  started there is no telling where they will stop.</p>

               <p>On Sunday last the child first attacked was taken to the jail, and among other
                  prisoners pointed out Adams as the one who had violated her person. There is not
                  the least doubt the prisoner is the guilty criminal and we hope that the remainder
                  of his natural life may be spent within the boundaries of the penitentiary.</p>

               <p>The prisoner is as black as the ace of spades, about 5 feet 4 inches high, of
                  rather a stout build and possesses a most wicked countenance. He is a son of
                  "Titus Adams," and has been "down the road" at least once. There are none who have
                  more vindictive feelings against him than his own race, and if placed in their
                  hands his punishment would be swift and certain.</p>

               <p>The three victims of this friend are under the care of skilful physicians, and are
                  in a fair way to recover from the injuries inflicted on their persons.</p>
