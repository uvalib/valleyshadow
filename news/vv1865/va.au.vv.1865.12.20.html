<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. John W. Garrett, President of the Balt. &amp; O. R. R., by whose
                        magnificent management that road has risen to its present greatness and
                        prosperity, has been re-elected. In his report he shows the great benefits
                        to be derived by building a road through our great Valley and, as this is
                        our only chance for developing our resources, we hope the Legislature will
                        not hesitate to give the right of way to the Balt. &amp; O. R. R. Co.
                        The time for legislating to build up any particular city has passed and if
                        Richmond can't compete with Baltimore, then let Baltimore have the trade:
                        Mr. Garrett says:</p>
                    <p>In the new era that has opened, another subject of the greatest importance to
                        the country, and especially to the people of Virginia and Maryland, has been
                        presented. Many of the most distinguished citizens of Virginia have
                        expressed their anxiety of the early construction of a line of railway
                        leading from Harper's Ferry, threw Winchester and Strawsburg, to connect
                        with the great Virginia and Tennessee road in the southwestern part of the
                        State, and thus open a direct and effective line of communication from
                        Baltimore to New Orleans, presenting to the States of Virginia, Tennessee,
                        Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, an admirable, economical and
                        direct line to the national capital, and the great seat of commerce at the
                        head of the Chesapeake. The Valley of Virginia, fertile, rich in mineral
                        resources, with fine water power, with a most beautiful climate, possesses a
                        region of wonderful attractiveness and characteristics for great populations
                        and extensive development. The entire region through Virginia, Tennessee and
                        the connecting States, presents the greatest advantages for emigration, and
                        these advantages are sure to give absolute assurance of prosperity and
                        wealth.</p>
                    <p>During the existence of slavery in Virginia, a jealousy existed of any line
                        leading to the free States by which slave property became less safe. That
                        obstacle having been removed, all jealousies appear also to have ceased, and
                        I have been called upon by many of the most eminent and sagacious citizens
                        of that great State, who urge that the attention of the people of Baltimore,
                        and the managers of the Baltimore and Ohio Road, should be directed to this
                        subject. Their region has been desolated, their capital has been almost
                        destroyed, and now they are most anxious that the enterprise and capital of
                        this community shall be thrown to their aid, in accomplishing objects which,
                        whilst vastly benefiting them, will also yield a rich fruition in increasing
                        fraternity and commercial fraternity. Such a lind will accomplish much in
                        the restoration of kindly feelings, and assure mutual interests and the best
                        and greatest commercial advantages, and will aid in binding in iron bands
                        those great commonwealths to the union of our fathers.</p>
                    <p>A natural route, full of local and general advantages, is thus presented. It
                        is true that, whilst a portion of traffic which now comes up the Ohio river,
                        and is received by Western railways from the Southwest, thus passing over
                        the whole three hundred and seventy-nine miles of the Baltimore and Ohio
                        road, would, through a valley line, pass over but eighty miles of the main
                        stem; yet, in view of the great objects to be achieved for those interests,
                        and in securing a direct communication to Washington, and adding vastly to
                        the commercial strength and importance of Baltimore, I do not hesitate to
                        commend to the most earnest and favorable consideration of this community
                        and to this board this interesting subject.</p>
                    <p>The Baltimore and Ohio road built up the region of Virginia through which it
                        passes. It has aided largely in the construction of the Parkersburg road,
                        which has cost more than seven millions of dollars, and whilst it has
                        enormously increased business and prosperity upon that line and mad
                        millionaires of the owners of oil lands, of coal lands, and largely advanced
                        the values of all properties in that region, that road has thus far failed
                        directly in paying any interest upon the investment; yet in the future it is
                        believed that remuneration can be secured, whilst the general commerce of
                        Baltimore has been benefited, and that region so specially improved. Like
                        difficulties may embarrass the enterprise proposed, but its results in the
                        future will justify every effort in its behalf.</p>

<b>State Proxies and Directors</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mr. Waddell of Augusta County wrote a resolution asking that the Committee
                    of Roads and Internal Navigation "withdraw all State Proxies and Directors from
                    the control and management of the public improvements," instead leaving state
                    interests to be managed in common with private stockholders; appoint inspectors
                    and accountants to examine annually the management of the improvements; and to
                    exchange the stock of the State in such improvements for "State stocks or bonds
                    at par."<br>(Names in announcement:   Waddell)</blockquote>
