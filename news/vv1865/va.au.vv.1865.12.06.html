<b>Plan for the Development of the Industrial Resources of the South</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article from the Baltimore Gazette announces a plan to develop a joint
                    stock company with a capital of $5,000,000, to be used to encourage southern
                    industrial development. The money will be raised in Baltimore and other northern
                    cities and loaned to southern planters and land owners. The loans will be
                    secured by mortgages on property whose cash valuation is more than 50% over the
                    amount loaned. Interest will be paid as usual, but in addition, planters will
                    have to agree to consign their products to company agents who will then sell in
                    cities such as Baltimore on very low commissions. In this way they will "compete
                    with the commercial houses in every town along the seaboard who are now
                    straining every nerve to draw to themselves the business of the South." The
                    originators of the plan "entertain the belief that capital can be turned over
                    ten times a year," and will yield stockholders a net profit of fifty percent.
                    Once wealth is amassed, it will be "devoted to the development of the resources
                    of the Southern States, to the improvement of navigation, and to furthering
                    works of internal improvement. In a word, the association which in the
                    beginning, is to be devoted simply to trade, is, as it gains strength and power,
                    to perform all the functions of a grand credit mobilier."<br>
