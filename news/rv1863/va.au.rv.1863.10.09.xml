                <summary>A man who lives in Staunton but who has a plantation nearby instructed his
                    "servant" to haul nine loads of oats to the barn and to bring the tenth load to
                    the quartermaster as payment of the tithe tax. When the owner returned to his
                    plantation a few days later and asked if the tenth load had been properly
                    delivered, he was told no, that the government would not get the tenth load
                    because all of the oats had been crammed into nine loads.</summary>

                <summary>The editor copies an excerpt from the New York Times, which he calls "that
                    out-and-out abolition sheet," on the number of African-American troops in the
                    Union army and then launches into a long discussion of how and why the North has
                    to force slaves into service. The editor notes that twenty million white people
                    in the North cannot subjugate the South, but the North nevertheless believes
                    that additional African-American troops will make a difference.</summary>
