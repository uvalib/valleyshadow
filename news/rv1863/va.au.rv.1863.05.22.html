<b>The Northern Press on the Death of Jackson</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The death of Stonewall Jackson is an irreplaceable loss to the Confederate
                    forces, as all agree, on both sides, that he was "the most brilliant rebel
                    general developed by this war." The Richmond Enquirer claims this loss is
                    greater than if the Confederates had lost a whole division of their army. The
                    Southern victory at Chancellorsville, therefore, was costly. This article
                    assesses Jackson's military prowess, highlights his battle record, and describes
                    his personal demeanor.<br>

<b>Still Dodging</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator's editor calls for the Spectator's editor to explain why he
                    criticized Governor Letcher's candidacy Congress and belittled those who
                    supported his candidacy. The Vindicator does not fault the Spectator's
                    endorsement but rather calls for a fair comparison between the two candidates.
                    Further, the Vindicator's editor points out his rival's capacity for dodging and
                    for switching positions in response to public opinion. For example, the
                    Vindicator contends, the Spectator lagged behind in supporting the Southern
                    cause two years before but now acts as if it sounded the clarion call on its
                    behalf.<br>

<b>Gas! Gas!</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A lack of gas in Staunton has caused the stockholders of the gas company to
                    call a meeting next Saturday to determine what can be done about the situation.
                    The fact that the Central Lunatic Asylum has been able to get gas indicates that
                    the trouble may be with the gas company itself, rather than with the
                    availability of the product.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Our Sick and Wounded</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor calls for the women of Augusta County to resume their important
                    roles in the hospital in Staunton now that it is full again with wounded
                    soldiers from recent battles and now that the small pox threat has passed. The
                    editor refutes the rumor that the surgeon in charge does not want the women to
                    visit and encourages them to continue the work for which they have such a good
                    reputation. Those women in the country who may not be able to visit as
                    frequently may send things to the patients that women in town cannot supply. The
                    editor notes the "peculiar duties" the "ladies" perform and the "sweet consoling
                    presence" they provide.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer proposes a ticket of General William Smith for Governor and
                    General J. D. Imboden for Lieutenant Governor. This ticket would reverse the
                    current administration, which has a governor from the western part of the state
                    and a lieutenant governor from the eastern part. In addition, it would be a
                    ticket able to "meet the emergency of the crisis" and would unite the political
                    parties, since one candidate had been a Democrat and the other a Whig.<br>(Names in announcement: General J. D. Imboden)</blockquote>
