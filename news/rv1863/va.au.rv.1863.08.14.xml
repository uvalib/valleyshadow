                <summary>Three slave men ran away from M. G. Harman's the night of August 9. William
                    Marshall, about 20, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches, very black and smooth skin, good
                    face, smiles when spoken to, wearing dark gray roundabout and pants and a cap
                    with a little red tassel. Nelson, about 23 or 24, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches, very
                    black, wearing gray cap and white coat. Charles, very light mulatto with
                    straight hair, wearing a soldier's jacket, belongs to Mrs. Blight of Fauquier
                    County. Harman believes that they are trying to reach Fauquier County, that
                    Charles is their guide, and that they may be with three others who left the
                    Central Lunatic Asylum the same night and are also from Fauquier County. Harman
                    offers $200 for the return of William and Nelson, or $100 for either, and $25
                    for Charles.</summary>
