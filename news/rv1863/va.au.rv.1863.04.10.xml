                <summary>This excerpt, reprinted in the Richmond Enquirer from the Philadelphia
                    Inquirer, tells of a preacher in Kentucky who spoke at a Union League meeting in
                    Philadelphia. He fears the insurrection that may come from arming
                    African-American troops but still would rather "see every woman and child in the
                    South perish rather than that the Southern Confederacy should succeed in
                    attaining the objects of its leaders." The Richmond paper noted that the
                    applause that followed this speech reaffirms the deep hostility between the two
                    nations.</summary>

                    It asserts that the waiting in suspense is the worst part, that once the
                    "forward" order comes soldiers find relief in moving in unison into battle, and
                    that their sensibilities dim in the face of horrors.</summary>
