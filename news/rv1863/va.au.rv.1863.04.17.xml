                    The editor surmises that the purchasers were more than just supporters of the
                    Confederacy but instead recognized the wise and safe investment in buying the

                    Republican victories and thus show that the people of each state have endorsed
                    the war. Northern Democrats, the editor contends, had expressed hopes of an
                    early peace, but they were defeated.</summary>
