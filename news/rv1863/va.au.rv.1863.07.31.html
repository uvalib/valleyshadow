<b>The Draft in Pennsylvania--A Mob of Women at Lancaster</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A group of between one-hundred and two-hundred women entered a court house
                    in Pennsylvania, overturned the draft wheel, and then were joined by a large
                    group of men. The situation threatened to turn into a riot until the mayor read
                    the riot act and the sheriff enrolled a posse of two-hundred men. Frederick
                    Douglass was scheduled to speak to African-American men, but a crowd of Germans
                    and Irish surrounded the hall where he was to speak, and he did not come.<br>
