<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>These exchanges between the Augusta Constitutionalist, the Mobile

                    material and explain women's use of calico (cheaper, cooler) over homespun,

<b>General Assembly</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor discusses the issues before the special meeting of the General
                    Assembly, specifically the need for volunteer citizens groups to defend their
                    areas in light of the new federal strategy of raids and the need for a better
                    financial system.<br>

<b>Religious Exercises</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A religious meeting led by Reverend J. C. Hyde, Chaplain, and other
                    ministers, is ongoing at the General Hospital in Staunton, with several sick and

<b>Mob in Atlanta, Ga.</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Atlanta Gazette reports that an African-American man was arrested and
                    jailed for insulting the wife of a Confederate officer. A crowd came for the
                    prisoner, broke him out of jail, and "lost him somewhere with a rope around his
                    neck. Like the subject of recognition, he was in suspense." The article concedes
                    that some people may have trouble with the manner in which the prisoner met his
                    death but will agree that it was justified. According to the Gazette, "He richly
                    deserved hanging."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Correspondence of the Sentinel</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer quotes Proverbs 11:26--"He that withholdeth corn, the people
                    shall curse him; but blessings shall be upon the head of him that selleth
                    it"--and proposes a hefty monthly tax on all surplus produce and other articles
                    of necessity so that growers will not hoard their goods.<br>
