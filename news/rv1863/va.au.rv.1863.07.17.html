<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a letter written to the Vindicator from an unnamed soldier and
                    originally published in the June 19th edition of the newspaper. The soldier

                    Confederate army and then fleeing to Lewisburg when Yankee troops were nearby
                    rather than staying to protect his and his neighbors' property. The editor of
                    the Spectator responds with two columns of refutation.<br>
