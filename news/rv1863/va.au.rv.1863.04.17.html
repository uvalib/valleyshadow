<b>A Losing Game</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Assesses the Mississippi River campaign and, drawing upon a balance sheet
                    from the Natchez Courier, asserts the superiority of the Confederate forces
                    there.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Copperheads</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes a breastpin from Ohio that has the head of the goddess of Liberty
                    on it. The article notes that liberty must mean little to Northerners, who
                    oppress the South.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lynchburg Virginian</blockquote>
<b>A Good Idea</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Passports are now issued in Augusta County at a cost of twenty-five cents

<b>Confederate Loan</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses the response in Europe to Confederate bonds and asserts that
                    their popularity reflects the perception that the young Confederacy is stable.
                    The editor surmises that the purchasers were more than just supporters of the
                    Confederacy but instead recognized the wise and safe investment in buying the
                    bonds.<br>

<b>Connecticut Election</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes that the recent elections in Connecticut and Rhode Island resulted in
                    Republican victories and thus show that the people of each state have endorsed
                    the war. Northern Democrats, the editor contends, had expressed hopes of an
                    early peace, but they were defeated.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter invites Augusta citizens to assemble in Staunton on April 27,
                    the next meeting of the county court, in response to the President's
