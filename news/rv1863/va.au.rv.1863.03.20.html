<b>The African as a Citizen</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that the United State Congress ratified a treaty with the Republic
                    of Liberia stating that Liberians were eligible to become United States citizens
                    through the same process available to persons from other countries. The editor
                    notes that the point of establishing Liberia in the first place had been "to
                    relieve the United States of a population, which, whenever assembled in any
                    number, has been a disagreeable and deleterious element of society." The editor
                    warns Liberians that citizenship will mean they will be put on the front lines
                    and that few privileges of citizenship await them after the war.<br>
