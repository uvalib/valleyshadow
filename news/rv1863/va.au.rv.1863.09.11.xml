                <summary>These exchanges between the Augusta Constitutionalist, the Mobile
                    Advertiser, and the Savannah Republican discuss women's choice for dress
                    material and explain women's use of calico (cheaper, cooler) over homespun,
                    which might be considered more patriotic.</summary>

                <excerpt>Governor Letcher's message "suggests that the time has come when it is
                    indispensably necessary that we should omit nothing calculated to insure
                    protection to our people and success to our cause, that we must expect reverses
                    and be prepared for them and that they instead of discouraging should only
                    stimulate universal efforts, call forth redoubled energy and inspire us with
                    more determined spirit and courage."</excerpt>

                <summary>The Atlanta Gazette reports that an African-American man was arrested and
                    jailed for insulting the wife of a Confederate officer. A crowd came for the
                    prisoner, broke him out of jail, and "lost him somewhere with a rope around his
                    neck. Like the subject of recognition, he was in suspense." The article concedes
                    that some people may have trouble with the manner in which the prisoner met his
                    death but will agree that it was justified. According to the Gazette, "He richly
                    deserved hanging."</summary>
