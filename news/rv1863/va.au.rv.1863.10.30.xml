                <summary>The Methodist Episcopal Sabbath School gave an exhibition on October 15 for
                    the benefit of the poor children of Staunton. The event, which raised more than
                    $1200, was so successful that it was repeated on the 21st. This sum and that
                    raised by the Town Council in doubling taxes will go far in addressing the needs
                    of the local poor this winter.</summary>

                <summary>On last Monday the enemy tried to stop Confederate soldiers from carrying
                    off railroad iron near Bealington Station, causing a fight in which veterans of
                    the Stonewall Brigade, the 4th and 5th Virginia Regiments, were engaged. The
                    Confederate forces won the conflict and removed the iron. Several of the wounded
                    are in the hospital in Staunton, including S. C. Yount and John D. Greaver from
                    Company L, S. H. Cook and F. Alexander from Company I, and V. Bartley of Company
                    D, not seriously wounded. Michael Ham and Thomas Brand were killed. William
                    Pence of Company D was seriously wounded in the shoulder, and _____ Wood of
                    Company A was seriously wounded in the breast.</summary>
