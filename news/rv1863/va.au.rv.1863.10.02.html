<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Generals Wigfall and Smith addressed an unusually large gathering of
                    Augusta citizens at the court house last Monday. These distinguished gentlemen

                    based on their experience. The assembly passed resolutions that the editor hopes

<b>Skirmish and Capture of Prisoners</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    thank the women of the county for their patriotic service, discourage desertion
                    by soldiers, and encourage citizens both to pay the tithe of produce as tax and
                    to abide by prices set by the government for surplus produce.<br>(Names in announcement:  J. Marshall McCue, Honorable A. H. H. StuartChairman,  A. F. KinneySecretary,  N. C.

<b>How It Works</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Exemption Act of Congress includes a provision subjecting to
                    conscription every exempted manufacturer who charges a profit of more than
                    seventy-five percent on production cost. An excerpt from the Greensboro Patriot
                    uses an example of lard oil to demonstrate the difficulty of setting prices by
                    legislation.<br>
