<b>"Gov." Pierpoint's Message</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Governor Pierpoint of northwestern Virginia asserts that Virginians have
                    been the chief supporters of the rebellion in men and supplies. The editor of
                    the Vindicator, while proud of the role of Virginians, asserts that such a claim
                    is slanderous to other Southerners.<br>

<b>Outspoken and Truthful</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>On the issue of raising African-American regiments, the Boston Courier
                    states that the prospect of such an act is degrading, to be at a point to be
                    willing to call on inferiors for defense. The prospect is also impractical, as
                    inequality between the races renders a mixed-race regiment ineffective and as
                    supplying 150,000 African-American troops with weapons is madness.<br>

<b>The Yankee Women</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Disparages reports that 12,824 Yankee women have signed a petition calling
                    for Lincoln "to remove the host of intemperate and incompetent military
                    officials."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>Significant</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Mississippian notes that the Northern press has recently begun
                    referring to Confederate politicians and officers by their proper titles instead
                    of "the most opprobrious" ones used previously. In addition, the press has
                    referred to the "Government of the Confederate States," as if the Confederacy
                    were a recognized power.<br>

<b>Jeff. Davis's Black Battallions</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This excerpt reports that in a recent skirmish, the 85th Indiana was
                    attacked by two African-American regiments. The editor of the Nashville Union
                    abhors the use of African Americans among the Southern troops, as the war's
                    purpose is to free them.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor calls readers' attention to the Impressment Bill published
                    elsewhere in the newspaper. He states that the bill seems intended to protect
                    the producer and the buyer and that farmers can grow their crops with the
                    confidence that they will not be impressed at unfairly low prices.<br>

                    one a prisoner of war taken last spring when Jackson evacuated the Valley.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. Charles Armentrout)</blockquote>
