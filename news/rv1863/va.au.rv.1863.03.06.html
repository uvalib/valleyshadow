<b>Impressment of Supplies</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor responds to an editorial from the Spectator, which stated that
                    farmers would not grow more than their families needed unless they had some
                    guarantee against or compensation for impressment of their harvest. The editor
                    of the Vindicator asserts that farmers of the Confederacy will continue to raise

<b>The Valley</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial praises the sacrifices made by the people of the Valley,
                    deplores their current condition, and condemns Brigadier General Jones, the
                    commander of the forces of the Valley, for his poor leadership and contribution

                    as proud patriotism as ever adorned our race. Whilst these heart-rendering
