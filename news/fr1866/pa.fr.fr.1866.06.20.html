<b>An Old Indictment</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article recounts the resolutions adopted at the Union State Convention
                    of 1865, condemning Democrats for their stand on a range of topics, including
                    their opposition to the enlistment of black soldiers and their refusal to grant
                    soldiers the right to vote.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the Union State Convention of 1865 a resolution was adopted by
                        acclamation, declaring that the leaders and candidates of the Democratic
                            alias Copperhead party stood arraigned before
                        the people of Pennsylvania for constantly obstructing the efforts of the
                        Constitutional authorities to maintain the life of the nation. We now repeat
                        the counts in the indictment then preferred by declaring that the Copperhead
                        leaders did this--</p>
                    <p>By inflaming the passion of their ignorant followers against the legally
                        elected officers of the Federal Government, and refraining from all reproach
                        against treason or armed traitors.</p>
                    <p>By procuring a decision from the Democratic judges of our Supreme Court,
                        denying the right of the Government to the services of the citizens of this
                        State for the defense of the imperiled country.</p>
                    <p>By discouraging men from volunteering into the armies of the Union; thus
                        rendering it necessary to succumb to treason, or to pay large bounties, and
                        so burdening every ward, township and borough in the State with debt to fill
                        the ranks of our armies.</p>
                    <p>By opposing the enlistment of negroes for our defense, although no white man
                        was required for every black one who could be enlisted, and this at the very
                        moment when the battle of Gettysburg was raging on the soil of Pennsylvania,
                        and that decisive battle was uncertain.</p>
                    <p>By denying to our soldiers the right to vote while fighting for the flag of
                        our fathers, on the plea that such rights were not allowed by our
                        Constitution, and by opposing an amendment which removed their objections
                        and relieved our brave soldiers from this disability.</p>
                    <p>By exaggerating the public indebtedness, decrying the public credit, and
                        teaching that the financial resources of the north were unequal to the
                        suppression of the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>By a shameful opposition to measures for extending relief to the families of
                        Union soldiers, and by a malignant effort by these means to secure the
                        success of the rebels in the field as such a protraction of the war as would
                        exhaust the nation in its effort to subdue their friends.</p>
                    <p>By now heaping abuse upon the Government for
                        punishing assassins and their accomplices; by demanding the release of
                        leading traitors, by frowning down all attempts to bring to punishment the
                        fiends who starved our soldiers, and by assuring rebels that neither in
                        person nor property shall they be punished for their crimes.</p>
                    <p>And if anything were wanting to complete their infamy, we have it in their
                        determined opposition to free labor, and to a tariff which, while it would
                        make labor profitable by protecting the workingmen of Pennsylvania from
                        British competition, would largely increase the revenue essential to the
                        maintenance of the public faith and credit.</p>

<b>The Issue Made Up!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With Congress having agreed upon the terms to admit the former rebel states
                    back into the Union, the editors assert that the issue has been resolved. The
                    only remaining obstacle is the ratification of the amendment, which leaves the
                    onus upon white southerners themselves.<br>

<b>Mr. Seward at Auburn</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece castigates Secretary Seward for sympathizing with the plight of
                    the former rebels, whom, he asserts, are deserving of honor, both for their
                    bravery on the field of battle and for their willingness to abandon the
                    institution of slavery. His "strange madness" undermines the accomplishments of
                    his "long years of public service to the great principle of human equality" and

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In response to the news that the "Clymer men" intend on holding "a real
                    Soldiers' Convention" on June 20th, the editors have issued a mock announcement
                    that denigrates the proposed proceedings as a meeting for "bounty jumpers" and
                    "skulking conscripts."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Clymer men are to have an preliminary meeting in Harrisburg on the 28th
                        inst., to call "a real Soldier's
                        Convention"--that is of soldiers who will vote the Democratic ticket. We are
                        glad to hear that the enterprise has been undertaken, and it is all
                        important to have the call properly worded so as to make the Convention a
                        decided success. Knowing how seriously the committee will be embarrassed on
                        this point, we submit the following call for their consideration:<br> REAL
                        SOLDIERS CONVENTION!<br> BOUNTY JUMPERS TO THE RESCUE!<br> SKULKING
                        CONSCRIPTS COME FORTH!<br> DISCHARGED ERRING BRETHREN WELCOME!<br>
                        SOLDIERS OPPOSED TO SOLDIERS VOTING ATTEND!</p>
                    <p>A mass convention of the "real soldiers of Pennsylvania" will be held at the
                        head-quarters of the Molly Maguires in the coal regions, on the anniversary
                        of the New York Draft Riots of 1863--a period in the history of Democracy
                        and real soldiers to which we all point with emotions of profoundest
                        gratification and pride.</p>
                    <p>The Molly Maguires have organized a committee of heroic conscripts who
                        gallantly killed several conscription officers to preserve their own
                        liberties, and prevent the patriotic armies of Lee, M'Causland, Forrest and
                        other distinguished sons of the South from being overwhelmed. This committee
                        will have ample arrangements made for the entertainment and comfort of the
                        delegations in attendance, in the historic caves and mountain fastnesses so
                        sacred to every real soldier.</p>
                    <p>The grand procession will be formed with honorably discharged erring brethren
                        soldiers in the front, next bounty jumpers, taking precedence in the ranks
                        according to the number of times they served the government by enlisting;
                        next skulking conscripts who rendered the best service they could to the
                        Union army by staying out of it; next the gallant soldiers who believe with
                        Clymer that soldiers in the service would not be allowed to vote, and all to
                        have appropriate banners, with such strange devices as the patriotic efforts
                        of the different classes demand.</p>
                    <p>Distinguished speakers will be in attendance. Hon. Heister Clymer, the real
                        soldiers' candidate for Governor; Presidents Johnson and Davis are invited
                        and confidently expected; Col. Moseby, Gen. M'Causland, Gen. Forrest and
                        other distinguished soldiers of the United Republic will attend. By order of
