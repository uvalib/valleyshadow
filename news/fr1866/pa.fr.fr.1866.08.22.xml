                <summary>An account of the political gathering held on August 9th at York, Pa.,
                    where Gen. Geary and Gov. Curtin spoke to a reported crowd of 10,000, 7,000 of
                    whom were soldiers. According to the article, the rally was a huge success.</summary>

                    <p>The Union ticket is now complete, and the issues involved in the election of
                        our candidates are so clearly defined that none can err or be deceived as to
                        their import and logical results. Of the men presented for the suffrages of
                        the loyal people of this county and the districts with which it is
                        connected, for most of the lucrative and important offices, the Union party
                        have presented gallant and faithful soldiers, who have won distinction on
                        our sanguinary fields and have the requisite fitness to fill the positions
                        for which they are candidates with efficiency and credit. The noble soldier
                        Maj. Gen. Geary heads the list for Governor. Col. F. S. Stumbaugh and Maj.
                        Geo. A. Shuman, both soldiers from contested fields, are presented for the
                        legislature, where they have already served with the hearty approbation of
                        their constituents. Sergt. Harry Strickler and private T. M. Mahon, the
                        candidates for two of the most lucrative offices in the county, have served
                        in the army until disabled by wounds, and they are eminently fitted to make
                        most acceptable officers. Mr. Strickler has been tried, and it is no
                        injustice to any one to say that no county officer has served with more
                        satisfaction to the public. Of Gen. Koontz we need not speak in detail. He
                        is known to all our readers, who have watched with the liveliest interest
                        the effort to defraud him out of the position to which the loyal people
                        elected him, and he will be returned so triumphantly that fraud will be
                        powerless to defeat the will of his district again. James Ferguson, the
                        candidate for Associate Judge, is one of the most worthy men in the county;
                        a man of unblemished integrity, intelligent, and in all respects fitted for
                        the important office for which he is presented. Wm. H. M'Dowell is one of
                        the oldest and truest supporters of the principles of the party; a man of
                        most blameless character, and will make an obliging and efficient officer.
                        Jonas C. Palmer, the candidate for Commissioner, Martin Heintzelman, the
                        candidate for Director of the Poor, and Samuel Myers, the candidate for
                        Auditor, are all of our mot substantial and deserving citizens. The offices
                        for which they have been nominated are not important to them, but they are
                        most important to the taxpayers of the county, and it is gratifying that men
                        so eminently qualified for the trusts have been nominated.</p>
                    <p>The whole Union ticket can be elected from top to bottom by a decided
                        majority, if the Union men of the county and districts do their whole duty.
                        We must have organization--it must be immediate, systematic and thorough;
                        and we must have hearty, cordial, earnest cooperation for the entire ticket.
                        Franklin may decide both the Congressional and Legislative contests, and we
                        must buckle on our armors and meet the foe with a zeal and determination
                        worthy of our cause. We feel that we cannot too earnestly impress upon the
                        Union men of Franklin county the necessity of immediate action. If we stand
                        idly by while the opposition are working with tireless energy, we may
                        sacrifice a portion of our ticket to our criminal supineness. We have the
                        Union votes to make the victory complete, and it is worse than folly--it is
                        a wrong to every loyal man and a wrong to the nation, for any Union man to
                        sacrifice his cause to indifference.</p>
                    <p>The election is less than two months distant. The time is short, the labor to
                        be performed is great, but it can be done, and well done, in time to leave
                        no star on our flag blotted by defeat on the second Tuesday of October next.
                        Union Men! organize for victory!</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We condole with Mr. Sharpe. He unbosomed his grief to the Democracy on
                        Tuesday evening last in the Court House, and the dark spectre of the African
                        was omnipotent in his remarks. His whole frame vibrates and trembles at the
                        apprehension of negro equality. He confesses himself so poorly endowed by
                        his Creator that he fears some stalwart, long-heeled, wooly-headed and
                        perfumed African may equal or surpass him in his profession, make his
                        rhetoric pale on the stump, jostle him in his inordinate ambition for
                        Congressional honors, and may even ride in the same car, bow down in the
                        same church, worship the same God and finally turn up in the same locality
                        where future rewards and punishments are dispensed by infinite justice--all
                        because of the Freedmen's Bureau and Civil Rights bills.</p>
                    <p>We can render our stricken and sorrowing fellow-townsmen an indefinite amount
                        of sympathy. Since it is his misfortune to be unable to cope with the
                        downtrodden and oppressed African in the race for social, political and
                        religious honors, he is surely entitled to protection. How it is to be
                        given, we can't exactly divine, but it must be had. But for the fact that
                        Mr. Sharpe peremptorily forbids any amendment of our constitution lest
                        rebels should be somewhat inconvenienced for their murderous treason, we
                        should join our afflicted fellow-citizen in demanding our organic law be so
                        changed as to provide that no person of African or mixed blood shall ever
                        learn more of law, politics, religion or social graces than said Sharpe;
                        that no such person shall travel in the same vehicle or on the same road,
                        or, if need be, in the same direction with Mr. Sharpe; that no such person,
                        even to the fourth mingling of African and Southern Democratic blood, shall
                        kneel in the same pew, supplicate the same throne, or go to the same heaven,
                        with Mr. Sharpe; and that no such person shall intrude upon his social
                        circle, bow to him on the street, or marry any of his relations.</p>
                    <p>It is a sad, sad story that Mr. Sharpe is helpless to protect himself against
                        the aggressions of a degraded race, but sad as it is, he pronounces it no
                        less true, and his infirmities appeal to the law-making power of the nation,
                        in mute but most pathetic eloquence, for protection. Sleeping or waking, the
                        African haunts him as a triple-headed giant with mountains of wool and most
                        threatening ambition. Sharpe might point this hideous spectre to the
                        bleaching bones of its fellows in Memphis, New Orleans and elsewhere, but
                        the very dry bones seem to rattle new horrors in his ears, as he protests
                        with heavy heart and tremulous tones against his unequal contest. Living or
                        dead, the African is before him. His ghost will not down however bidden, and
                        his dusky person and presence greet him on the street, in his office, in his
                        study, in his social circle, in his praises and prayers, and even in his
                        allotted tomb. In life the African is about him, in perpetual conflict for
                        the mastery of learning, honor and fame, and even in the dark valley of the
                        shadow of death, the negro will sleep with him, decay into inanimate earth
                        so that the stain of caste will be obliterated, and when the last trump
                        shall summon all the earth, behold there will be the African to cloud his
                        spirit land, and what is sadder still, there will be no appeal to the high
                        chancery of heaven against the harsh law of equality for all the people of
                        the earth.</p>
                    <p>We do not produce this picture of consuming sorrow to Mr. Sharpe to inflict a
                        needless wound where there are gaping wounds already; but we have drawn it
                        to point the imperious necessity of some high decree, some reversal of the
                        laws of a common Creator, to rescue Mr. Sharpe from this mountain of grief.
                        He might take up the beneficent policy of his political friends of Memphis
                        and New Orleans, and gather in the harvest of death while the African could
                        be found in his path; but it would be as tedious as bloody, and even his
                        ruffled ambition and wounded dependence might weary and sicken the gory
                        carnival. There is therefore no relief but in an appeal to the law-making
                        power both human and divine. They must be reversed. A new creation must be
                        improvised for the purpose, and the line of distinction between the man and
                        the brute must be marked up over the heads of the sable part of creation.
                        True, there might still be fear and quaking, for unless the new order of
                        brutes should be bereft of their reasoning faculties, the next shadow in Mr.
                        Sharpe's pathway would be the rivalry of the animal kingdom for his honors.
                        What then? We are lost in the bewildering mazes of this momentous question.
                        Its misty labyrinths precede the cradle and reach far beyond the grave; and
                        we can see no positive balm for his agonizing fears but by reversing the
                        court above all created powers. This cannot be done by Democratic mass
                        meetings or resolutions, nor by impassioned appeals to vulgar prejudices.
                        Mr. Sharpe must, therefore, wade through the Congressional contest with the
                        African confronting him at every step, in every condition, and in every
                        shape that fancy can suggest, and when he is defeated, as he must be, there
                        will be the dark spectre multiplied into an innumerable throng chanting, in
                        ghostly, ghastly and horrible discord, the requiem over his political grave.</p>
                    <p>Courage, Mr. Sharpe! There is One whose attributes are measured by no human
                        conception, who in life and in death will deal justly with all. In the
                        fullness of time, prejudices of the ignorant and vulgar will fade away, and
                        with them will perish the fears which seem to make life itself intolerable
                        to ambitious Democratic politicians. The negro will fill his sphere--will
                        cease to be hated by those who have only wronged him, and will be judged by
                        his merits and usefulness as other men. He may not vote, or go to Congress,
                        and physical laws as well as instinct forbid his mingling with his
                        pale-faced oppressors, save as Slavery has brutalized the master and
                        prostituted the slave; but the time is nigh at hand when to declaim against
                        an ignorant, helpless, degraded race on the plea of possible equality, will,
                        as it deserves, class the declaimer as beneath the level of those whose
                        endowments and progress he effects to dread. Mr. Sharpe should appreciate
                        the fact that the world moves; that some things are best to be forgotten,
                        while some other things are best to be learned. He and his terrible African
                        will both be wiser by and by, and the wiser they grow, the less they will
                        fear each other!</p>

                <summary>The editors ridicule Democratic nominee William Sharpe for his inability to
                    focus on any other issue beyond the "dark spectre" posed by blacks. Judging by
                    his remarks on the stump, in which "African was omnipotent," the editors assert
                    that Sharpe is deserving of considerable sympathy since he seems certain of his
                    inability to compete with "the downtrodden and oppressed African in the race for
                    social, political, and religious honors."</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that the "rebels" have emerged victorious in the late
                    election in Kentucky. Following the decision of the "kind-hearted Union men" to
                    repeal the laws excluding former Confederate soldiers from voting, the article
                    explains, the rebels showed their appreciation for this display of "magnanimity"
                    by "defeating nearly every Union man in the State."</summary>

                    were several cases for fornication and bastardy, a number dismissed by the
                    court, and fifteen were ignored by the grand jury--in many cases the prosecutors
                    being saddled with costs. There was an unusual amount of trivial prosecutions,
                    and it is to be hoped that in all such cases the the prosecution will be made up
                    to pay costs until such prosecution cease. Common Pleas--John Miller's vs. S. R.
                    McKesson's Estate--Summons in assumpsit founded on promisory note. Judgement
                    confessed for $342.18. This was the only case before the Common Pleas.

                    refused to Conrad Harmon, George Dittman, and Henry Daniels. The application of
                    Daniel Greenawalt was withdrawn. The applications of Philip Fendricks and James
                    Snyder, of Mercersburg were put off until next court.</summary>

                <summary>At the meeting of Agricultural Society in Chambersburg last Thursday, the
                    directors of the organization decided to cancel the agricultural fair scheduled
                    for the upcoming fall. The reason: The army seized all of the fencing and most
                    of the improvements made at the Fair Ground, but the Society does not have
                    sufficient funds to replace them at this time. The directors also determined
                    that the site should be moved to a "suitable" location closer to town and
                    serviced by running water.</summary>

                    coal into a cart at Melhorn and Eyster's coal and lumber yard, near the Franklin
                    Rail Road. Apparently, Croft's horse was frightened by an engine that had
                    somehow cut loose from a train of cars. In his effort to restrain the animal,
                    the man was thrown on his head and instantly killed.</summary>

                <summary>John Pensinger died at his residence on Tuesday after a brief illness.
                    Pensinger was "among the first to respond to the call of his country," joining
                    the 2nd Penna Regiment. Upon the expiration of his service (a three month term),
                    he re-enlisted with the 77th Penn, the regiment he stayed with until he was
                    discharged near the end of the war because of an illness he had contracted in
                    the field. Pensinger's remains were buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery with "the
                    honors of war."</summary>

                    Leckrone's barn, secreted away with a quantity of bacon that was reported
                    missing by John J. Irvin under similar circumstances. The suspected thief is a
