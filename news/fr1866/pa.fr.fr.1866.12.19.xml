                    <p>THE Reading <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> makes the statement that a
                        clear majority of the Republican members of the legislature are already
                        committed to Simon Cameron for U. S. Senator, and that he will be nominated
                        on first ballot in caucus. This is but a part of the desperate and
                        unscrupulous system of political strategy adopted to make a Senator in
                        defiance of nineteen-twentieths of the Republicans of the State.</p>
                    <p>There are not twenty members of both branches of the legislature who would
                        today confess their purpose to vote for Simon Cameron, and no Republican
                        member, of either branch, can vote for him and return to his constituents
                        with a rational hope of re-election. Every vote cast for him will be
                        insolent disregard of the Republicans who chose the member thus voting, and
                        will require explanation.</p>
                    <p>There are statesmen in Pennsylvania who would adorn the Senate, and who would
                        wear the highest honors of the Commonwealth with pride and credit, and
                        return them unstained by infidelity or corruption; and the Republicans of
                        the State will not excuse the barter of the richest fruits of their noble
                        victory to the mousing politician, who makes politics a trade and office a
                        mere engine to gather plunder and bring shame upon the people.</p>
                    <p>The man who was dismissed by Mr. Lincoln in obedience to the imperative
                        demands of the country; upon whom the positive censure of a Republican
                        Congress still rests, with none even bold enough to move its expurgation;
                        who struggled for the apostate Johnson's patronage and plunder even after
                        his vetoes and defiantly treasonable speech in February, and who has left a
                        record of shame in every trust, and betrayed every principle that yielded to
                        him a leadership, cannot, and the People mean shall not, renew the
                        humiliation the State has already borne by his ill-gotten power. The times
                        are too full of peril, the principles to be maintained are too vital to the
                        nation, and the cause of Universal Freedom and Impartial Justice, so richly
                        baptized and so nobly achieved, too sacred to the living and to the memory
                        of the martyred dead, to thrust them like sheep into the shambles and
                        sacrifice them to venality and imbecility.</p>

                <summary>In scathing terms, the Repository editors excoriate Simon Cameron and his
                    backers at the Reading Journal. In an effort to thwart the will of
                    "nineteen-twentieths of the Republicans of the state," the Journal "makes the
                    statement that a clear majority of the Republican members of the Legislature"
                    support Cameron's bid for Senate, a claim the editors categorically refute.
                    "There are not twenty members of both branches of the legislature who would
                    today confess their purpose to vote for Simon Cameron," they proclaim, "and no

                <transcript>
                    <p>During the last session of Congress, and before the pending amendments to the
                        constitution were submitted by Congress, a bill was passed the popular
                        branch of the national legislature enfranchising the negroes of the district
                        of Columbia without regard to intelligence or property. The measure was,
                        upon reflection, considered to be in advance of the sentiment of the
                        country, and it slumbered in the Senate until adjournment. It was deemed by
                        many of the best and most patriotic statesmen an admonition to the
                        rebellious States that they would not venture to disregard, as it clearly
                        foreshadowed momentous coming events in case the congressional policy of
                        reconstruction should be rejected by the South. The pendency of such a bill,
                        to which the Republican party was squarely committed by the votes of the men
                        who had to carry their case directly to their constituents for approval, was
                        an appeal to the rebellious people that only madness could despise; but,
                        lured to supreme folly by the arrogant assumptions of an apostate President,
                        they resolved to shut their eyes to inevitable results, and thus the
                        proffered terms of Congress have been rejected, and the great issue of
                        reconstruction thrown back upon Congress by the obstinacy of treason.</p>
                    <p>The beginning of the sequel we record in our columns to-day. The House
                        suffrage bill for the District of Columbia enfranchised all the blacks, but
                        it was not severe in its disfranchisement of traitors. Now, however, the
                        same Senate that hesitated to pass the House bill of last session, has
                        passed a new or modified bill, which not only confers suffrage upon the
                        blacks, but sternly disfranchises all who "have voluntarily given aid and
                        comfort to the rebels," and imposes severe penalties for any violation of
                        the law. The proposition to make negro suffrage qualified by intelligence
                        and property, was lost by 11 to 34, and the bill passed finally by 32 to 13.
                        The vote is significant beyond the mere passage of the bill, as it is clear
                        that even the expected Presidential veto will not prevent the adoption of
                        the measure as one of our national statutes. On Friday the House passed the
                        bill by the decisive vote of 117 to 46.</p>
                    <p>The work of Universal Freedom and Impartial Justice thus fitly begins in that
                        portion of the Republic under the immediate jurisdiction of Congress, and,
                        unless all signs of the times are deceptive, it will be the policy of the
                        government in all the States lately in rebellion. In the House Mr. Stevens
                        has presented a bill that may be accepted as but another step in the work
                        commenced in the District of Columbia. It proposes, in its title, to
                        reinstate civil government in North Carolina, and provides that a Convention
                        shall be held on the 20th of May next to frame a constitution, and in the
                        election for delegates to the Convention all male resident citizens of the
                        State of the age of twenty-one years, without regard to color, who can read
                        or write, or may own $100 of real estate, are allowed to vote; but no one
                        who has heretofore exercised the right of suffrage under the laws of the
                        State, shall be denied the right to vote for delegates. Every delegate
                        elected will be required to qualify by taking a stringent oath that they did
                        not voluntarily aid the rebellion after the 4th of March, 1864. It is made
                        the duty of the convention to frame a constitution, Republican in form, and
                        it must pass the ordeal of Congress as do other territories when seeking
                        admission into the Union. This bill is evidently the first step toward
                        taking possession of the rebellious States as territories, and it is now
                        clear that no other policy will bring those States into harmonious action
                        with the general government. They obstinately and insolently spurn all
                        proffered terms of reconstruction as if they were victors instead of
                        vanquished, and the safety of the government demands radical measure to make
                        treason odious and powerless.</p>
                    <p>We do not approve of the distinction Mr. Stevens makes between North Carolina
                        and the District of Columbia. His bill assumes for Congress the same
                        absolute control of the territory and people of North Carolina it exercises
                        over the District of Columbia. It fixes the qualifications of voters and
                        treats the State as a territory without government or law. But while
                        Congress under Mr. Stevens' lead, wisely enforces Loyal Manhood Suffrage in
                        the District, he proposes a very different policy in the restoration of the
                        States. If the power is claimed to extend suffrage at all, the power to
                        extend it or deny it to all citizens, is equally clear, and we fear that the
                        mere enfranchisement of negroes who can read and write or own $100 worth of
                        property, while all rebels, of every class, can vote, will be to say the
                        least, doubtful in the attainment of desired results. If it is not deemed
                        best to enfranchise all the blacks, we cannot resist the conviction that the
                        classes of rebels disqualified by the proposed constitutional amendments
                        should be denied a voice in the work of restoration. Why should they be
                        allowed to take part in creating a government to which they will be made
                        aliens and strangers after it is organized? If they are to be denied a voice
                        in the future control of the government they once sought to overthrow, the
                        penalty of their crime should come with the very first step toward
                        reconstruction. Not one twentieth of the adult male negroes could vote under
                        Mr. Stevens' bill--probably not one in forty, and yet every rebel, whether
                        intelligent or ignorant, rich or penniless, could vote to give triumph to
                        treason. It is needless to urge that oaths will restrain the work of
                        treason. There is not a leader of treason who is not blackened with perjury,
                        and there are men who are Mr. Stevens' peers, in point of privilege, in the
                        House, and also in the Senate, who proved that the test-oath could not
                        arrest the advent of men who had aided rebellion.</p>
                    <p>We do not complain of Mr. Stevens' bill, nor question his patriotism and
                        fidelity. He may have good reasons for the harsh discrimination he makes of
                        which we are not advised; but looking to loyal results we cannot but doubt
                        the efficacy of his measure. When the work of restoration is to begin on the
                        policy of Congress, it must be thorough and must be pressed to prompt
                        completion, and it is, we think, an error not to strike at the vitals of
                        discord in the start. If suffrage is not made impartial in framing a
                        constitution, when can it ever be made so?</p>

                <summary>Demonstrating the degree to which sentiment toward the South has changed,
                    the editors highlight the pending adoption of the bill that grants suffrage to
                    blacks in the District of Columbia and denies the same to "all who 'have
                    voluntarily given aid and comfort to the rebels.'" Only months ago, they note,
                    the likelihood of such a measure becoming law would have been unthinkable, but
                    now, because of continued southern obstinacy, even the Senate is in favor of
                    adopting more stringent terms for re-union. This bill, they advise, "is
                    evidently the first step toward taking possession of the rebellious States as
                    territories."</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>IT seems now settled that the Senate will reject all nominations of the
                        President whereby faithful men were displaced solely on political grounds.
                        This policy will make the official terms of Col. Swope and Gen. Coffroth
                        very brief, and render the termor of their subordinates extremely uncertain.
                        Just what course the President will pursue when the Senate plants itself
                        firmly against his shameless debauchery, we cannot pretend to guess; but it
                        is more than probable that he will fall back upon the Democracy and dispense
                        his favors to them. No Republican could accept position under a man whose
                        apostasy has been so wanton and insolent as was the President's, and we
                        presume that he will not want to favor men who have adhered to the
                        principles on which he was elected. It has been proposed to restore the old
                        incumbents by legislation, but we doubt the practicability of such a
                        measure. Certain important patronage, particularly that growing out of the
                        Revenues, may be taken out of the hands of the Executive, but we do not see
                        how the residue of his patronage is to be controlled.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the Democracy are just as anxious as the Republicans to have
                        the Bread and Butter camp-followers overthrown, and when they come to grief,
                        as soon they must, they will die officially "unwept, unhonored and unsung."
                        In this district we could chalk the hats of a score of Democrats who will
                        not go into mourning when Swope and Coffroth are rejected, and who would
                        kindly accept the places of the Johnson martyrs. The Democracy feel that
                        they were crowded to the wall by the Bread and Butter men, and they will
                        welcome the day of their disenthrallment. Col. Swope had no affinity with
                        the Democrats, and literally sold himself out for the plunder, pledging
                        himself to dispense his patronage so as best to serve his new masters. Gen.
                        Coffroth was not wanted as Assessor by anybody but himself, but he has the
                        faculty of making the most out of a very small capital, and he wrung the
                        appointment out of Mr. Sharpe and his friends to make him work properly in
                        the Congressional contest. Now that the fight is over, and the whole machine
                        is smashed, there is no one who cares to see Coffroth survive the general
                        wreck. He will therefore go overboard unregretted save by himself and his
                        subordinates.</p>
                    <p>The Republican party has higher and more sacred duties just now than to make
                        an issue on the plunder of a perfidious Executive, but it owes it to itself
                        and to the nation to arrest the appalling debauchery attempted by the
                        President, and it will be done. If the President shall then refuse to
                        appoint faithful men, he can select Democrats--men who will not be living
                        monuments of corruption and infamy.</p>
