                    <p>In order that our readers may see the very best coloring that can be given on
                        the rebel side to the New Orleans butchery of Union men, we quote the
                        following extract from the correspondence of the New York Times, the organ of President Johnson and the New
                        Orleans murderers. Singularly enough the letter is headed with display lines
                        indicating that the letter is to correct the "Radical falsehoods" about the
                        riot. The writer was on the spot and witnessed the massacre. He says:</p>
                    <p>When the freedmen, members of the Convention, spectators and others, had been
                        driven into the building, the police advanced to the entrance and forced the
                        way upstairs to the door of the Hall of the House of Representatives, where
                        the Convention had been assembled, and into which they and the freedmen had
                        retreated. Several different tales are told as to what followed. Certain it
                        is that one policeman was mortally wounded in the hall, while, as he claims,
                        he was attempting to arrest a member. It is claimed by a member who was
                        wounded by this policeman, that he tried to shoot, but his pistol being
                        knocked up, the ball sped harmlessly into the air, whereupon he seized the
                        weapon by the barrel and struck the member on the temple with the butt end.
                        It is said that all hands in the hall fell on their faces, and after the
                        police had expended their shots got up and drove them out of the room with
                        chairs, &amp;c. After this, R. King Cutler is said to have demanded that
                        every armed man leave the room. Capt. Burke, formerly Union Chief of Police,
                        did so, and received a slight flesh wound in the side while passing out.
                        Another version of this assault is, that the policemen,
                            without demanding the surrender of any one, poked their pistols through
                            the half open door and fired promiscuously at the crowd inside; this,
                            while a white flag was being displayed from a cane stuck up on the
                            speaker's platform. It is certain that so much confusion
                        prevailed inside that each of the stories may have some foundation, for with
                        the hubbub occasioned by the firing and shouting of the one hundred or more
                        men in the hall, no one could see or hear everything or be able to tell
                        exactly what occurred.</p>
                    <p>The mob and the police filled the sidewalk and the stairway of the building.
                        Shots were fired through the windows from both in and outside, and bricks,
                        paving stones, clubs and other missiles were thrown from both directions. A
                        gentleman named Cox came down stairs and was arrested; but on stating that
                        he was merely a spectator was released, and walked across the street, where
                        he shielded himself on a door-step. From this position he could see inside
                        the building which he had just left, and he states that only one person after him came out without being killed or badly
                            wounded as they came down stairs by the police and the mob of rioters
                            accompanying them. Gov. Hahn, who is lame and walks with a
                        crutch, was met on the stairs as he came down, and escorted out to the
                        curb-stone by two policemen. On reaching the sidewalk he was surrounded by
                        about twenty persons, who beat him on the back of the head with clubs, and
                        he received a severe stab in the back, also a pistol shot from behind. It is probable that this shot was fired by a
                        policeman. On reaching Canal street he was placed in a carriage, and
                        under the charge of the Chief of Police was taken safely to the lock-up. He
                        owes his life to the chief and his squad, as they prevented him from being
                        lynched. Fish, Henderson, Shaw and other members were treated likewise.
                            On reaching the foot of the stairs they were beaten
                            by the police and the mob, and after being rendered insensible were
                            dragged on to jail. An attempt to lynch Fish was made on Canal
                        street, but the police in charge of him prevented it, although they nearly killed him themselves by beating him with the
                            butts of their pistols. But few freedmen were arrested coming out
                        of the building, as they were nearly all shot dead at
                            sight. The Rev. Mr. Horton, a clergyman from New Hampshire, now
                        in charge of a church in this city, officiated as chaplain of the
                        Convention. I heard his prayer at the opening in which he asked fervently
                        that the lives of the members might be spared, and thanked God that peace
                        had been declared in Europe, praying for the same blessing in this country.
                        In a habit peculiarly ministerial, one which distinctly marked him as a
                        clergyman, he came down stairs with a white handkerchief on his cane
                        intending to surrender himself peaceable. He was met,
                            knocked down, trampled upon, kicked and beaten nearly to death, while
                            begging for mercy. The police and the rioting friends were his
                            assailants. Dr. Dostie, intending to surrender himself, also came
                        down. He was shot, stabbed, and treated in the same
                            manner as Horton, although he implored the ruffians to take him prisoner
                            and spare his life. It is probable that both Horton and Dostie
                        will die. These details suffice to show how the arrests were made. R. King
                        Cutler and Judge R. K. Howell escaped without much injury, and chancing to
                        fall into the hands of humane policemen were conveyed to prison almost
                        uninjured.</p>
                    <p>On Common, Baronne, Dryades, St. Charles, Rampart and Carondolet streets
                            freedmen were murdered by the police and the mob in
                            cold blood. Standing in the door of the telegraph office on
                        Carondolet, I saw about two hundred men chasing one negro along the
                        sidewalk. Six policemen were nearest to him, and in advance of his pursuers.
                        They emptied their revolvers into his back, and finally another one, when he
                        was near enough to his victim to lay his hand on his shoulder, shot him in
                        the head, and he fell dead into the alley. Another freedman trying to escape
                        from the institute was climbing over a fence, when I saw him fall from a
                        policeman's shot. As he struck the ground at least a
                            dozen police and rioters surrounded him and fired their pistols into his
                            head and breast, at the same time pounding him with clubs and
                        canes. The blood flowed from wounds in his scalp, covering his entire
                        face; but they continued their brutal assault until he breathed his last,
                        although he several times raised his feeble and wounded arms to gesticulate
                        for the mercy his tongue could not ask for. I saw a
                            white man draw a stiletto and strike it into the heart of a dying negro
                            on Common street. The blood spurted out in great red jets,
                        staining the murderers clothing, face and hands. He got
                            up and displayed the gory marks as though they were proud emblems of a
                            praiseworthy deed. These and other incidents which I saw, suffice to
                            show you how the freedmen were treated in a majority of cases. It
                        is due to justice, however, to say that some of the policemen treated even
                        the freedmen with moderation, and rescued them from death at the hands of
                        the mob.</p>
                    <p>LAST MOMENTS OF DR. DOSTIE.</p>
                    <p>The Picayune of August 1st has the following
                        account of the last moments of Dr. Dostie:</p>
                    <p>In company with Col. De Witt Clinton, Assistant Adjutant on Gen. Sheridan's
                        staff, Recorder Ahern, and others, we visited the room of Dr. A. P. Dostie,
                        at the Hotel Dieu, yesterday evening, for the purpose of hearing his dying
                        declarations, as the physician in attendance has no hopes of his recovery.
                        From his own declarations, the doctor was easier than he was the day before.
                        He stated that he felt no pain whatever, and said there was a probability of
                        his recovering.</p>
                    <p>His forehead and arms were badly bruised, apparently from clubs or brickbats
                        or other missiles thrown at him. He has two slight wounds in the neck,
                        evidently inflicted with a penknife; also one in the chest. The most serious
                        wound is that which was inflicted by a ball entering in the small of his
                        back, and which is now lodged in the spine, paralyzing the lower
                        extremities.</p>
                    <p>He seemed to be very rational, recognized all those who addressed him, and
                        spoke fluently, but still with great evidence of exhaustion.</p>
                    <p>Judge Hiestand was present, and inscribed what he conceived to be his
                        statement concerning the difficulty at the Institute. Upon its being read to
                        him, the Doctor objected to several parts of the statement. Dr. Dostie not
                        realizing a sense of approaching dissolution, it was deemed unnecessary to
                        take down anything that pretended to be a "dying declaration."</p>
                    <p>While apparently lying in easy indifference or unconsciousness, we were
                        forcibly impressed by several remarks made by the wounded man. He inquired
                        in regard to John Henderson, Jr., and was told that he was dead. He paused
                        for a moment, and remarked: "Well, it is a strange coincidence. We were born
                        on the same day, and embarked in the same glorious cause. I had reason to be
                        apprehensive--to fear a bloody attack--but not he. Strange!"</p>
                    <p>A gentleman standing by his bedside asked: "Do you know me doctor?" "Oh yes,"
                        was the reply, "let the good work go on, that's all."</p>
                    <p>The only complaint made by the wounded man was that of suffering severe heat
                        in the breast.</p>
                    <p>The affair commenced at 12:45, and, lasting three hours, ended at 3:45. It did not end until every negro and white man in the
                            Institute had been either killed or wounded and captured, with the
                            exception of three or four whites. As there were about 100 men of
                        both classes in the building, and about 50 wounded outside, the total casualties will amount to 125, of whom 50 were
                            killed or have since died from their wounds. This estimate is
                        moderate.</p>
                    <p>The military force was encamped at Camp Jackson, five miles from the scene of
                        the riot, and in the morning were told to be ready for any emergency. They
                        did not arrive until quiet had been restored, and it was only restored when
                        there was nothing left to kill or maim. It is certain that somebody was very
                        derelict in ordering the troops into town. Gen. Sheridan was not in town,
                        and Gen. Baird had command. I understand that one of his staff reported
                        everything quiet when, at the time he was making his report the massacre had
                        begun and progressed for a quarter of an hour. His dereliction should be
                        investigated.</p>
                    <p>The police impressed the baggage-wagons of an express firm in this city to
                        carry off the dead; one load, consisting of eight or ten
                            bodies, had two living men at the bottom. They were wounded, and
                        perhaps would have died; but they had life enough left in them to struggle
                        for air. An eye-witness, whose name I can furnish, says
                            that a policeman mounted the cart, and shoving his revolver down between
                            the bodies on top, killed the poor fellows, with one shot for
                        each. The fiendish thirst for blood which seemed to possess some of
                        the rioters was too brutal for even the imagination of a savage. Their eyes gleamed with it, and rolled in their sockets;
                            their tongues protruded from their mouths, parched and shriveled almost,
                            and their voices grew husky from demoniac yells. I have no doubt
                        but that some of the policemen and rioting whites were wounded by members of
                        their own party, as some of them seemed possessed with a desire to shoot at
                        human beings regardless of caste, color or sex. No females were hurt, that I
                        know of. Houses were pillaged; but the outrages were mostly confined to the
                        immediate vicinage of the Institute. One man in a livery
                            stable deliberately took up a rifle and killed a negro who ran through
                            the door looking for a place of refuge.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to give you any more details than I have without going
                        beyond the limits of my desire to furnish only authorative statements. I saw with my own eyes almost everything that I have
                            described, and have responsible witnesses for all the rest. I have not
                            accepted any rumors; but I was fortunately "on the spot," I am able to
                            give you the facts.<br> E. P. B.</p>

                    admission of the former rebel states. Should Sharpe's policy be carried to its
                    logical results, it would "make the war fruitless--its sacrifices vain; its

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Hon. J. M'Dowell Sharpe, of this place, was nominated as the Democratic
                        candidate for Congress in this district, on Thursday last. There were
                        twenty-five fruitless ballots, when the Adams men--instructed to support
                        M'Sherry all the time and not to yield to the claims of any other
                        county--cast their votes for Sharpe and made him the nominee.</p>
                    <p>We welcome Mr. Sharpe to the field as the fittest representative of his party
                        that could have been presented, and we are gratified, too, that in him the
                        friends of rebel representation and unconditional power have their ablest
                        champion thus presented to the people. Coffroth as a candidate would have
                        been neither the embodiment or standard-bearer of anything but Coffroth, and
                        M'Sherry, while personally blameless and worthy, would have been a silent
                        candidate sweeping just as the current goes.</p>
                    <p>In Mr. Sharpe, however, the Democracy have chosen their ablest advocate and
                        their truest representative, and we shall have a contest worthy of the vital
                        principles at stake. We say we rejoice that it is so, and our confidence in
                        the triumph of the right is strengthened by the fact that in no previous
                        contest since the war began has there been the same light thrown upon the
                        questions to be decided, that will be shed upon the issues in the contest in
                        this district. Mr. Sharpe, ingenious and plausible as he is, cannot make a
                        speech that will not tell fearfully against his own success. He cannot belie
                        history even if he would. He cannot ignore facts patent as the noonday. He
                        cannot by any measure of sophistry make rebels loyal men, nor can he erase
                        from their skirts the blood they bear of their murdered brethren. He must
                        demand for them seats beside him in our National Congress in case of his
                        election, and there is no refinement of logic, no subtlety of rhetoric, that
                        can make the shadowed homes of our people rejoice at his proposition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe will be heard with the respect his ability merits, and he will be
                        heard by thinking, reasoning men. While political fledglings and clowns are
                        tolerated and sometimes laughed at, Mr. Sharpe will be expected to explain
                        to an intelligent, earnest people the most earnest issues ever presented for
                        their determination, and he cannot defend the policy of his party without
                        making more than ever apparent the fearful perils to the Republic which must
                        be the fruits of his success.</p>
                    <p>With Mr. Sharpe there is no concealment. His position is free from all doubt
                        on the great questions involved. He is for immediate and unconditional
                        admission to full fellowship and power, of all the rebel States, and instead
                        of making treason infamous, he would recall it to the honors it clouded and
                        the power it wielded, with perfidy and perjury, for the destruction of the
                        government. While he cherishes prejudices against freedmen unworthy of both
                        his head and heart, he nevertheless is the ready champion of rebel
                        representation in Congress being based upon the freedmen who are ostracized,
                        disfranchised and in many instances safe in person and property only under
                        protection of Union bayonets; and there is not, we believe, a principle
                        advocated by the apostate President that he does not cordially sustain. In
                        short: he would make the war fruitless--its sacrifices vain; its
                        achievements a stain upon the pages of our history, and even the honored
                        scars of our heroes would be but marks of shame, if his policy could be
                        carried to its logical results. We do not say that such is Mr. Sharpe's
                        wish, but we do say that the principles on which he is placed by his party,
                        and which we believe he earnestly supports, could lead only to the sad
                        fruition we have portrayed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe has a foeman worthy of his steel in Gen. Koontz, who will be among
                        the people advocating the true policy of a nation redeemed by countless
                        sacrifices. He is able, fearless, energetic and unexceptionable, and will
                        rally the faithful men of the district with a degree of fervor and
                        enthusiasm not usual in our contests. Both men fitly and most ably represent
                        their respective parties, and, with treason almost daily decking itself with
                        fresh garlands of loyal blood, there will be voices, although mute upon the
                        hustings, more eloquent and more potent in struggle than ever the chosen
                        leaders, and they will move the popular heart with the sweep of the tornado
                        against him who assumes to apologize for the traitors still crimsoned with
                        wanton sacrifice, and still unrepentant of the bereavement and desolation
                        they have wrought. The man upon whom this retributive sentiment shall fall,
                        will be ground to powder. Has Mr. Sharpe calculated the issue?</p>

                    <p>NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 8.</p>
                    <p>The following address has been issued to the people of Louisiana by Gov.
                        Wells:</p>
                    <p>NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 8.--The bloody tragedy enacted in the City of New Orleans
                        on the 30th day of July, 1866, in which more than three hundred citizens
                        were killed or wounded, has, to the credit of humanity, created a profound
                        sympathy in the breast of every man throughout the length and breadth of the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>The remote and immediate causes of this outrage demand a thorough
                        investigation and explanation; and, as the Chief Magistrate of the State, I
                        feel a solemn duty resting upon me to give a plain, unvarnished statement of
                        its origin and progress. In doing this it becomes necessary for me to
                        commence in the year 1864, at the reorganization of the civil government in
                        that portion of Louisiana which had been wrested from rebel authority. I
                        regret that I shall in this connection be obliged to speak of myself. It is
                        not to satisfy any feeling of vanity that I do so, for I fully realize that
                        I am but an insignificant atom in the great cause of maintaining and
                        perpetuating the Union of these States.</p>
                    <p>The political history of the country teaches us that under the policy of the
                        late lamented President, all the loyal citizens of Louisiana; in the
                        parishes then within the Union, were invited and authorized in the
                        proclamation issued by the military commander of this Department, to hold an
                        election on the 22d day of February, 1864, for State officers. The election
                        was held, and I then, being a refugee from my parish in the rebel lines, in
                        consequence of my Union sentiments, was nominated by the Free State party,
                        as it is called, and also by the extreme Radical party, of which J. Durand
                        was the acknowledged leader, as their candidate for the office of Lieut.
                        Governor. The first named ticket, headed by Michael Hahn for Governor, was
                        elected. Gov. Hahn served until the 4th of March, 1865, when, by his
                        resignation, I succeeded to the office of Governor. In the meantime, and by
                        virtue of military authority, an election for delegates to the State
                        Convention to amend and revise the Constitution of 1852, had taken place.
                        The Convention had met, framed a Constitution declaring slavery to be
                        abolished, which Constitution is now the fundamental law of the State. It is
                        now further known that the Convention did adjourn sine
                            die, but subject to the call of the President for any cause. A
                        Legislature had also been elected, and was in session at the time of the
                        assumption by me of the duties of the office of the Governor.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after the collapse of the so-called Confederate Government took
                        place, and by the surrender of the forces in the Trans-Mississippi
                        Department, the entire territory of the State was restored to the lawful
                        authority of the United States. When this event took place, what was my
                        conduct towards the population of the eighteen parishes reclaimed? Although
                        I had been persecuted and driven away from my home by the rebel authorities,
                        I suppressed all feeling of rancor so natural to the many, and expressed the
                        belief that a majority had been seduced from their allegiance to the old
                        flag by the wiles of artful demagogues who brought on the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>When the members of the Legislature met in extra session in the month of
                        November, I determined to try the effect of kindness and conciliation in
                        weaning them back to their first love. I addressed them a proclamation,
                        congratulating them on their restoration to the protection of a government
                        of law and order, and assured them that so far as I was concerned, I was
                        willing to forget the past. I begged them to submit cheerfully, and
                        unreservedly to the new order of things and assured them, that although a
                        State Government had been organized, yet I was anxious that a general
                        election for State officers should be held, in which the whole State could
                        participate. I appointed men, recommended, to fill the offices in the
                        several parishes. I signed their applications to the President of the United
                        States for special pardon. I persisted in my course of reconciliation,
                        notwithstanding the warnings and remonstrances of Union men, who believed
                        that my policy would be unavailing in accomplishing the purposes intended,
                        and who predicted that, at the very first election, these men, in every
                        parish where they held power, would proscribe every man from office who had
                        not been in the rebel army, and fought for the rebel cause.</p>
                    <p>These predictions have been realized to the letter at every subsequent
                        election, with the exception of my own case; and it is well known, for it
                        was publicly avowed, that I was put at the head of their ticket simply
                        because it was thought that I could be useful in securing a representation
                        of this State in Congress. It is well known that the platform reported by
                        the committee, appointed for that purpose, is a reiteration of the doctrines
                        of the right of secession, and it was only through the exertions of a few of
                        the more cautious and politic of the party that this platform was made to
                        assume the form in which it was adopted. At the same convention, a well
                        known citizen, and live democrat, was publicly censured by resolution
                        because, in a speech delivered before that party, he said that secession was
                        worse than a crime--it was a blunder. Notwithstanding my nomination by the
                        Democratic party, another candidate was put in the field in opposition to
                        me, who had officiated as Governor under rebel rule, and who, had been in
                        the country, and signified his assent, I have no doubt would have been
                        overwhelmingly elected.</p>
                    <p>The Convention of 1865 was convened for the purpose of raising money to
                        restore the broken levees, and to take measures to redeem the credit of the
                        State. I found that they were more intent on calling a Convention to change
                        the Constitution of 1864 than to promote the material interests of the
                        people. Their chief objection to that instrument was the character of the
                        men who framed it, and the abolition thereby of slavery. Having failed at
                        the extra session to pass a bill calling a Convention, the attempt was
                        renewed at the regular session, held in the month of January, and more than
                        half the time of that body was spent in discussing that question. Finally, a
                        committee was sent to Washington to consult the President, and the
                        Legislature only abandoned the measure through his advice. I considered a
                        Convention inexpedient, and for that reason opposed it. I had learned enough
                        of the real sentiments of the people to convince me that if a new
                        Constitution was made it would be less in harmony with the views of the
                        President and Congress than the Constitution of 1864, the result of which
                        would be to lessen the chances for the admission of our Representatives. I
                        urged these views on the members of both Houses of the Legislature, but they
                        had no effect with the majority. I deprecated the city and parish election,
                        for the reason that I feared the result, because of the character of the men
                        that would be elected, because I had seen enough of public sentiment to
                        convince me that more of those who had served in the Confederate army, or
                        who had gone into the Confederate lines, would be elected to office. I
                        foresaw that such a result would justly be regarded by the people of the
                        loyal States as showing a defiant spirit, and as still glorying in a course
                        that had cost them such a fearful loss of life and expenditure of treasure.
                        With numerous and repeated evidences of the continuing of an intolerant and
                        rebellious spirit, and the manifestation of the persecution of all that did
                        not adhere to the fortunes of the Confederacy, to the last, on the part of a
                        large majority of the citizens, and with a press almost unanimously
                        expressing sentiments of the same tenor, it is a matter of surprise that I
                        should pause and commence to reflect on the consequences, both as regards
                        the future security of the Government and the fate of the Union men in the
                        South, if these men, who once attempted to break up the Union, succeeded in
                        grasping the power of the nation again? I had seen, that while professing
                        with their lips renewed allegiance to the flag and obligation to the
                        President for his pacific policy, they were becoming arrogant, intolerant
                        and dictatorial. They were glorying in the apparent schism between the
                        President and Congress in the policy of restoring the State lately in
                        rebellion, and rubbing their hands with delight at the idea of civil war in
                        the loyal States.</p>
                    <p>In view of all this array of strong, stubborn acts, I frankly own that my
                        views of the conciliatory policy in bringing back to allegiance those who
                        have been engaged in a war to destroy the Union have undergone a change. The
                        intolerant spirit engendered by slavery still exists. The loss of property
                        and the failure of their hopes can never be forgiven, and though I regard
                        them as impotent to renew constituted authority, enforced by the presence of
                        military forces, yet I am convinced that they would renew the rebellion
                        to-morrow, if there were a sure prospect of success. Impressed with the
                        truth of these views, foreseeing the uncertainty for the future security of
                        the Union men in the South, desiring that the amendment to the constitution
                        adopted by Congress and submitted to the States for ratification should
                        prevail, and fully realizing the fact that the amendment would never be
                        ratified by the present Legislature, I own that I was in favor of the
                        reassembling of the Convention of 1864 as the only means of securing the
                        ratification as required, and thereby insure the admission of our
                        representatives in Congress. The legal right of the Convention to continue
                        its functions is a question I suppose properly pertaining to the Courts to
                        decide. Senators and Representatives in Congress of great learning, and men
                        of high legal attainments in New Orleans, have expressed the opinion that
                        under the resolution of adjournment the Convention could lawfully
                        reassemble. A distinguished Democrat Senator in Congress took the same view.
                        For myself, if I had any doubt on this subject, which I have not, I would
                        have deferred to the opinion of abler men. The total number of delegates
                        composing the Convention was one hundred and fifty. The number elected was
                        seventy-three. The quorum was fixed at seventy six, this number being a
                        majority of the whole. There were twenty-seven parishes unrepresented in the
                        Convention, entitled to eleven delegates, and adding thereto ten vacancies
                        to be filled, it would make sixty-one delegates to be elected, besides there
                        were some ten or twelve delegates, who, disapproving the emancipation
                        clause, refused to sign the Constitution, who may be ranked with the extreme
                        conservatives. Counting the sixty-one delegates elected to be of the same
                        class, and the balance of the Convention to be radical, it will be seen that
                        the parties would have been nearly equally divided.</p>
                    <p>There are disfranchising clauses in the Constitution of 1864. The much abused
                        members of that body had it in their power to have made the Constitution as
                        stringent against those engaged in the rebellion, as Tennessee and Missouri
                        have done. They pursue and opposite course, believing and trusting, as I
                        did, that these men would be actuated by a spirit of tolerance and
                        forbearance, in return for the liberality shown toward them. How the members
                        of that Convention have been treated individually by the very men in whose
                        honor and good faith they have trusted, to say nothing of the scorn and
                        vilification fulminated against them, as a collective body, and the
                        Constitution they made, let the record of the bloody doings at the Mechanics
                        Institute on Monday, the 30th ult., answer. In keeping with their
                        unrelenting policy to maintain the power of the State in their own hands
                        exclusively, they opposed the meeting of the Convention of 1864. They needed
                        no better monitor than their own conscience to tell them that by their
                        conduct they had forfeited all claims to further favors from the original
                        members of that Convention. They resolved that it must be put down, crushed
                        out at all risks. The terrible scenes of the 30th of July, confidently
                        predicted in case the Convention met, were the result. The letters of Mayor
                        Monroe to Gen. Baird, accompanying this communication, furnish proof that it
                        was the determination that if every other measure failed, a resort would be
                        made to force. Everything was arranged on Sunday. Preparatory to that
                        purpose, the police received orders and on Monday morning they were in large
                        numbers at the corner of Canal and Dryade streets, each having one or more
                        revolvers on his person. They were not there, except to commit violence. The
                        speakers at the Friday night meeting counseled nothing more than that the
                        blacks should come aimed to defend the Convention, in case the members were
                        attacked. Admitting that they had assembled for that purpose, what occasion
                        was there for alarm, unless it was meditated to assault the Convention. The
                        inference is irresistible, from that manner of the police alone, that it was
                        designed to break up the Convention by force. For this purpose a beginning
                        was necessary by the arrival of a procession of blacks with music, on their
                        way to the place of the meeting of the Convention, which procession had
                        entered the street through the crowd of policemen and citizens. At the
                        corner of canal street they were met with insult and jeers, which brought on
                        a collision. A shot was fired but ended in nothing serious. The next act of
                        violence was the arrest of a colored man by a policeman in front of the
                        Institute, but for what offense I am unable to say. The crowd of colored
                        persons assembled became excited at these occurrences, the same as a body of
                        white men would do under the same circumstances. Some took the side of the
                        policemen, others the side of the prisoners; brickbats were thrown, and one
                        shot fired, the testimony going to show that it was fired by one of the
                        colored crowd. It was answered immediately by several shots from the crowd
                        of policemen at the corner, and followed up by rapid firing on the crowd of
                        blacks, who returned the fire as fast as they could, but being overpowered
                        and driven from the street, took shelter in the Mechanic's Institute. If the
                        object of the police was simply to preserve the public peace, why did they
                        not, after the men had taken refuge in the Institute, return to their
                        original position, at the corner of the streets, which effectually cut off
                        egress from the front, and, placing a guard to watch the rear of the
                        building, await the arrival of the military, who were known to be on the
                        way. Their only reason for this course is that it did not suit their
                        purpose. They accordingly advanced in front of the building, and besieged it
                        on all sides, and every negro who attempted to escape was murdered.</p>
                    <p>The crowning climax of these murderous and bloody acts is well known. When
                        the white flag was hung out as a token of surrender, the police arrested the
                        members of the Convention and other white citizens, and brought them into
                        the streets, where the most prominent, for their Union sentiments, were
                        shot, stabbed and beaten in the very custody and presence of the entire
                        police force of the city. Why did not the Mayor, or his Chief, station a
                        guard at the door, and forbid any person from entering, and await the
                        arrival of the military? By this means the last, most deliberate, and most
                        horrible phaze of this bloody tragedy would have been avoided. It is also
                        notorious that the police failed to arrest, or attempt to arrest, even one
                        of the riotous citizens, who, according to their often repeated statements,
                        were continually attacking, wounding and killing persons, who had
                        surrendered and were in custody.</p>
                    <p>I think that I have fully shown that it was the design of those opposed to
                        the Convention to break it up by force. The inference to be drawn from the
                        letter of the Mayor that such a course was resolved on, and the massing of
                        the police, and their willingness to rush into the fight, I think fully
                        establishes the fact that the causes of this exhibition of violence and mob
                        law must be traced further back. It it the embers of the fires of the
                        rebellious feeling which plunged this country into a desolating war, the
                        flames of which are not yet extinguished in the breast of the former
                        slaveholding aristocracy, who failed in their first effort to destroy the
                        Government. They seek now to regain political power in the same old spirit.</p>
                    <p>My deliberate conclusion is, that if the military forces be withdrawn, the
                        lives of the Union men, who proved themselves conspicuous in maintaining
                        their allegiance, will not be safe. The security, both of the Government and
                        the Union men of the South, depended, in my opinion, upon the ratification
                        of the constitutional amendment proposed by Congress, and the
                        enfranchisement of the loyal black man, that he may become educated and
                        qualified for that important privilege. If the advocacy of these measures
                        identify me with the Radical party, as it is called, in my opposition to the
                        President, I must accept the situation, besides I cannot change my
                        conviction in respect to the principles and measures I deem necessary to
                        perpetuate the Union.<br> [Signed.] Madison Wells,<br> Governor of
                        Louisiana.</p>

                    <p>In addition to the above vote, Lincoln received 346 votes in the army from
                        this county, and McClellan received 259, but there is no return of this vote
                        by districts, and we cannot apportion it. It was returned by single votes,
                        company votes, &amp;c., and the return judges never apportioned it to
                        the townships. It would be almost an impossibility to do it now; but as it
                        would not make any material difference in the representation of the
                        districts respectively, we presume the home vote will be accepted until the
                        next Presidential election. It will be seen that the new table varies the
                        representation very little from what it was in the last convention.</p>
