<b>Speech of President Johnson</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A copy of President Johnson's speech before a delegation of white
                    legislators from Virginia who had come to Washington to pledge their support for
                    his Reconstruction plans. In his address, Johnson urged them to elect only those
                    men who are "unmistakably and unquestionably loyal to fill places of power," if
                    they hope to speed full representation in Congress.<br>

<b>The New Revenue Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial discusses key aspects of the proposed revenue bill, and
                    suggests that the best solution to the state's financial quandary is a repeal of
                    the tax on real estate. Even without the revenue generated by the tax, it
                    argues, the state will be able to reduce its war-induced debt by $ 1 million a
                    year.<br>

<b>The Relief Bill</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Relief Bill passed the Senate last Wednesday and was immediately signed
                    into law by Gov. Curtin. The bill appropriates $500,000 of the victims of the
                    1864 raid on Chambersburg. The appraisers, from Dauphin county, as stipulated by
                    the measure, will arrive shortly and are required to complete their duties
                    within sixty days. To make a claim, the piece notes, an individual must take an

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The bill appropriating five hundred thousand dollars to the victims of rebel
                        vandalism in Chambersburg, passed the Senate on Wednesday last by a vote of
                        18 to 12, as follows:</p>
                    <p>YEAS--Messrs. Bigham, Clymer, Connell, Donovan, Glatz, Graham, Haines, Hall,
                        Hopkins, Householder, Landon, Latta, M'Conaughy, Nichols, Randall, Ridgway,
                        Royer, and Fleming, Speaker--18.</p>
                    <p>NAYS--Messrs. Beardslee, Brown, Cowles, Dunlap, Hoge, James, Lowry,
                        Montgomery, Shoemaker, Walls, White and Worthington--12.</p>
                    <p>NOT VOTING--Messrs. Champneys, Schall and Wallace--3.</p>
                    <p>The bill had passed the House the week previous by the decisive vote of 73 to
                        23, and it is now a law, as it was promptly approved by Gov. Curtin. The
                        Appraisers are to be appointed by the court of Dauphin county, an adjourned
                        meeting of which has been fixed by Judge Pearson on Monday next for the
                        purpose. The Appraisers will probably commence their duties about week after
                        next, and they are required to perform the duties assigned them within sixty
                        days. The appropriation can be realized by our people some time in the
                        latter part of April, or by the 1st of May at the latest.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen by reference to the provisions of the bill, which we give
                        entire in another column, that it is very stringent in its penalty for
                        presenting fraudulent claims. The second section provides that "if it shall
                        be established that any person shall present a false statement, in part or
                        in whole, for property either not destroyed, or in excess of just valuation
                        with the intent to defraud, the petition of such person shall be dismissed
                            without any allowance whatever." Each claim
                        must be made out under oath, and in addition the claimant must make
                        affidavit that he or she has not given aid, comfort, encouragement or
                        information to traitors. The bill prescribes the oath, and of course all
                        claims must conform strictly to it.</p>
                    <p>We have not seen the various valuations made out for the local committee in
                        1864, but it is well known that some of the bills were largely in excess of
                        a just value of the property destroyed. Such claims, under the present law,
                        will receive nothing unless they are revised and presented in a correct and
                        just manner. Our citizens generally desire that justice should be done to
                        all, and they will not allow fraud to be shielded before the Appraisers. In
                        this, as in all other business transactions, people will find honesty to be
                        the best policy. Many have doubtless honestly placed their valuations from
                        different stand-points. Some have taken the original cost of the property
                        destroyed; others have probably taken the cost of restoring it, and others
                        have estimated according to the cash value at the time the property was
                        destroyed. The last would seem to us to be the correct basis of valuation;
                        but the Appraisers will doubtless give official notice to the people, when
                        they assume their duties, how to state their claims, so as to secure a
                        uniform basis of valuation.</p>

<b>The Spring Elections</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece admonishes local Union men to begin organizing for the upcoming
                    election. Because the governor will be selected in the contest, it relates,
                    there is every reason to believe that the Democrats will try to manipulate the
                    returns through both mild forms of chicanery and outright fraud.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates the little known fact that soldiers, who lost limbs in the war and
                    were honorably discharged, are eligible to receive artificial limbs. "They are
                    furnished free of charge, and do not affect any pension or bounty claim the

                    <p>DRAFT STATISTICS.--The following tables showing the operations of the several
                        drafts in this county under the different calls for troops by the general
                        government, will be preserved by many of our readers as a matter of
                        reference. They exhibit the quotas of each township under the various calls,
                        the number drafted, the number held to service, the number who put in
                        substitutes, the number who were exempted and the number who failed to
                        report. One of the tables also presents the amount paid by the different
                        townships for bounties, and the last table shows the aggregate results of
                        the drafts in the congressional district. In addition to these drafts, the
                        State draft took some 700 men from this county in 1862. We subjoin the

                    <p>ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION.--The committee of thirteen, appointed by a public
                        meeting of the citizens in December last and charged with the general
                        interests of the people in framing a bill and presenting the same to the
                        legislature, met on Monday evening to devise measures to guard against fraud
                        in the distribution of the appropriation generously made by the State. After
                        mature deliberation, it was unanimously decided that two Attorneys should be
                        employed to represent the people, examine witnesses and defend against
                        claims which shall appear to be exorbitant in valuation. Messrs. Thomas B.
                        Kennedy and Lyman S. Clark, Esqs., were selected as counsel to represent the
                        citizens generally, and it will be the duty of every citizen who has
                        knowledge of any fraudulent claims to communicate with those gentlemen and
                        furnish them with the names of witnesses whose testimony can defeat fraud.
                        It is the determination of the committee and of the counsel chosen to
                        represent the people, to enforce strict justice in the valuation of
                        property, and any citizen who shall make claim for property not possessed or
                        not destroyed, or who shall make a fraudulent valuation, will find his
                        petition dismissed without any award whatever.</p>
                    <p>The Appraisers will be appointed on Monday next, and will probably be here to
                        enter upon their duties next week. Any person can present his own claim
                        either in person or by attorney, and the proper form, with the oath
                        prescribed by the law--which must be strictly followed--can be had at this
                        office. We have carefully prepared the blank form in accordance with the act
                        of assembly, so that any ordinary accountant can make out his own statement.
                        All the claims must be adjudicated and returned to the Auditor General
                        before the appropriation can be received, and claimants should be careful to
                        have their statements properly presented so as to facilitate the labors of
                        the Appraisers. It is most important to our people that the appropriation be
                        received as early as possible.</p>

                    <p>COL. JOHN W. FORNEY was recently waited on and serenaded by an assemblage of
                        Colored Men. He responded in a speech from which we extract as follows:</p>
                    <p>"The question is now whether, having been liberated here in the District of
                        Columbia, and freed through all the Southern States--whether, having fought
                        for your citizenship, you are to be permitted to remain in the lower grade
                        which you occupied before the war began, save only that you are no longer to
                        be kept, physically, in servitude; and that is the great question now before
                        the American people. When the Rebellion closed I was not of those who
                        believed that the Union party of this country would make the civil
                        enfranchisement of manumitted millions part of their policy. In other words,
                        I did not believe that we were strong enough to take ground in favor of what
                        is popularly called universal suffrage. But I am now here to say that I am
                        mistaken. I did not apprehend the full logic and duty of the case; and now,
                        without turning back upon the past, I avow myself in favor of the trial of
                        that great experiment which the statesmen would be a coward to postpone, and
                        the philanthropist unworthy of his name if he did not meet it half way; and
                        here, in the District of Columbia, we may safely meet the issue."</p>

                        branches of the legislature. It passed the House by a vote of 73 to 23, and
                        the Senate by a vote of 18 to 12:</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, The rebels, under the command of Gen. M'Causland, entered
                        Chambersburg on the 30th of July, A. D. 1864, and sacked and burned the most
                        valuable portion of the town, inflicting a loss of over two millions of
                        dollars upon but a few hundred heads of families, consigning many to
                        hopeless bankruptcy and seriously crippling the whole business energies of
                        the people;</p>
                    <p>And whereas, Such desolation by a barbarous foe in
                        but one locality of a great Commonwealth, with millions of population and
                        boundless wealth, claims the generous consideration of the State, since
                        peace has been won by the heroism and fidelity of all sections; therefore</p>
                    <p>SECTION 1. Be it enacted, &amp;c. That the sum
                        of five hundred thousand dollars be and the same is hereby appropriated, out
                        of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to the people of
                        Chambersburg and vicinity, whose property was burned by the rebels on the
                        30th of July, A. D. 1864, to be paid to such sufferers pro rata, upon the valuation of their losses as hereinafter
                        provided.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 2. That the court of common pleas of Dauphin county, at its first
                        meeting after the passage of this bill, shall appoint three intelligent and
                        disinterested appraisers, who shall not be residents of Franklin county, and
                        such appraisers shall, within twenty days after their appointment, (having
                        first been duly swore or affirmed to discharge their duties with fidelity,)
                        proceed to Chambersburg and make just and true appraisement of the losses
                        sustained by the people of Chambersburg and vicinity, by reason of the
                        burning by the rebels on the 30th of July, A. D. 1864, and they shall
                        continue to perform said duties until they have appraised the losses
                        aforesaid of both real and personal estate, and upon each petition setting
                        forth his, her or their losses, the said appraisers, or a majority of them,
                        shall make award of the losses actually sustained. Each petition shall
                        present a statement of losses under oath, and said appraisers shall require
                        such additional proof of the correctness of the statement as they may deem
                        necessary, by the examination of the claimant, or any other witnesses they
                        may decide to call; Provided, however, That if
                        any statement shall be presented for the benefit of an assignee, said
                        assignee shall be required to prove to the satisfaction of the appraisers
                        the actual cash value of the consideration paid to the assignor, and the
                        amount so paid, if not in excess of the actual loss sustained, shall be the
                        amount of the award; And provided farther, That if it
                            shall be established that any person shall present a false statement, in
                            part or in whole, for property either not possessed or not destroyed, or
                            in excess of just valuations, with the intent to defraud, the petition
                            of such person shall be dismissed without any allowance whatever; And
                            provided further, That no petition shall be entertained from any
                        corporation or from the county of Franklin for losses sustained; And Provided further, That each statement presented
                        for adjudication shall be accompanied by an affidavit, made before some
                        officer competent to administer oaths and affirmations under the laws of
                        this State, stating that the claimant has never directly or indirectly, by
                        word or act, given aid, comfort, countenance or encouragement to the
                        traitors, whether in arms or otherwise, that he or she has never
                        communicated, or attempted or taken means to communicate, to them, or any of
                        them, any information which could in any way be of advantage to them.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 3. That said appraisers shall, as soon as they shall have finished
                        their duties, make return to the Auditor General of all the petitions
                        presented to them, with the awards thereon; and when such return has been
                        filed, the said sum of five hundred thousand dollars shall be apportioned to
                        said awards pro rata by the Auditor General, and
                        his warrant shall be drawn upon the Treasurer in favor of the persons to
                        whom the awards and appointment have been made, and the sums thus
                        ascertained to be due respectively to sufferers shall be paid to them, or
                        their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, upon them receipting for
                        the same, which receipts shall state the amount paid, and authorize the
                        State to receive from the General Government said sums out of any money
                        which may hereafter be appropriated by Congress to compensate them for
                        losses sustained by the war.</p>
                    <p>SECTION 4. The said appraisers shall be paid the sum of five dollars each per
                        day, when actually employed in the discharge of their duties, for a period
                        not exceeding sixty days, and they shall be allowed one clerk who shall be
                        paid the sum of three dollars per day, whose duty it shall be to keep a
                        record of the testimony in each case, so that it may be transmitted to the
                        Auditor General with the awards; and the salaries of said appraisers and
                        clerk, together with necessary expenses for stationary and giving notice,
                        and so forth, shall be paid out of the Treasury out of any money not
                        otherwise appropriated, after approval by the proper accounting officers of
                        the State.</p>
