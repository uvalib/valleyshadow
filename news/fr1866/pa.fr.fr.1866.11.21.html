                    <p>At length the political struggle is over, and the verdict of the nation has
                        been pronounced decisively against the policy and conduct of President
                        Johnson. Congress has been sustained as no Congress within our recollection
                        was ever before sustained. After the desertion of the chief of its choice,
                        his betrayal of the patronage of the government into the hands of the enemy,
                        and his open and unscrupulous canvass of the whole country against us, the
                        Republican party stands this day as compact, firm and without break as ever
                        did any party in the republic. It has separated itself from the public
                        patronage within the control of the President without sustaining any loss of
                        strength, and carries every Northern State solidly and triumphantly. We have
                        held New Jersey with a grasp that defies the combined strength of the
                        government patronage and the railway monopoly, and have elected a
                        Legislature in which there is no longer one majority in either house, but a
                        clear, unmistakeable majority of five in the Senate and six in the House,
                        whereby we have secured a decided majority on joint ballot, and shall thus
                        be able to elect a United States Senator to fill the vacancy created by the
                        death of Mr. Wright. New Jersey now takes her place positively in the rank
                        of Republican States, having elected to Congress four Republicans out of
                        five members chosen.</p>
                    <p>In Delaware we have made a strong and active canvass, and although not
                        successful in carrying the State, have reduced the Democratic majority so
                        much as to leave little doubt that with another such a canvass we shall be
                        able to redeem little Delaware from the hands of the enemy, if we have the
                        aid of so able a chairman of the State Central Committee as Mr. S. M.
                        Harrington, who managed the recent canvass. The whole of the other States,
                        except Maryland, that voted on Tuesday, have gone Republican, and rebuked
                        executive usurpation in unmistakable tones. President Johnson's appeal to
                        the people has thus been answered, and unless all his professions of
                        submission to the popular will be empty pretences, it is his duty now to bow
                        to this decision, and make his policy and action accord with that of the
                        people's representatives in Congress. He chose to ignore the present
                        Congress as not fairly representing popular sentiment on the subject of
                        reconstruction, and he pleaded his own cause on the stump so effectually for
                        us, that a new Congress has been elected as overwhelmingly Republican as its
                        predecessor.</p>
                    <p>We have by this victory defeated the plot he had concocted to set up a bogus
                        Congress, by the aid of the unadmitted members from the ten rebellious
                        States and the Northern and Border State Democrats and weak-kneed
                        Republicans, and so the great republic has tided over another formidable
                        danger. Through the whole remainder of his administration, President Johnson
                        will be confronted by just such a Congress as the present one. Doubtless he
                        will now, without entirely changing his policy, make such fair seeming
                        professions as may in his estimation lead the Republicans to hope for his
                        return to their lines. During the whole of last session he kept playing fast
                        and loose on the subject of appointments and removals, and the moment that
                        Congress adjourned he commenced to make a sweep, and has continued it ever
                        since. We are, therefore, of opinion that it ought to make no difference to
                        any Republican member of Congress what professions the President may now see
                        proper to make.</p>
                    <p>The power lodged in the hands of Congress by the Constitution should be used
                        freely to take from the President the power he has abused, and to establish
                        some permanent system of appointments to office, based on competitive
                        examinations, by appointing officers selected by some one else than Andrew
                        Johnson. The general sentiment of the country now is to the effect that the
                        autocratic power of the national Executive is fraught with peril to our
                        liberties and free institutions, and ought to be reduced. President Johnson
                        himself has given a proof of it in his bold declarations on the stump that
                        by means of the patronage at his command he could make himself dictator. If
                        he really thinks so, he must be prepared to join the effort which the public
                        now demands for the abolition of all offices that possibly can be dispensed
                        with, and the removal of the great majority of the patronage from the
                        absolute disposal of the one man power.</p>
                    <p>One fact is rendered painfully evident by the result of this election.
                        Wherever slavery has existed down to the period of the war, there the people
                        seem to cling even to the remnants of all the old prejudices and castes and
                        institutions, and there they make the sternest and most determined
                        resistance to everything in the way of liberal progress. Weak as slavery was
                        in Delaware and Maryland, it seems to be still, even after its death,
                        possessed of the power to control the political action of both States. It is
                        manifest that the entire south must undergo some general purgation before we
                        shall see the last of her intense sectionalism, or be done with the troubles
                        she gives us in politics.</p>
                    <p>If the people of that unhappy section can see the philosophy of this
                        election, they will recognize that the north is as perfect a unit now on the
                        subject of reconstruction as it was on the subject of the war. The south
                        evidently fancied that, having the Democratic party and the national
                        Administration on its side, it could easily manage to obtain enough Northern
                        aid to thrust aside the Republicans. But these influences have not had
                        strength enough to carry a single Northern State, nor to break the
                        two-thirds majority of the Republicans in Congress. By this time the South
                        ought to learn how weak and helpless a thing the Democratic party of the
                        North is, and how it must inevitably drag down all who join their fortunes
                        with it.</p>
                    <p>The great lesson, however, of this struggle is that the Republican party
                        exists from necessity, and is in no degree under the control of those who
                        are regarded as its leaders. Treachery cannot destroy it, nor official
                        influence crush it out. So far from proving retrograde, its course is onward
                        continually, and its strength and power increase instead of diminishing. It
                        has survived the loss of the national Administration and the defection of
                        its chosen chief, and is stronger and greater out of office than it ever was
                        in. Its enduring vitality is in its principles and its unyielding devotion
                        to republican liberty. President Johnson has run a muck at it, and by this
                        time he must be satisfied that he has very greatly underrated and
                        misunderstood it. But being by nature too obstinate to give way, the
                        President must now be made to feel how circumscribed his power for mischief
                        is made by the terms of that Constitution to which he has so often appealed.
                        The people look confidently to Congress to meet boldly and firmly the
                        defiance that has been hurled at that body, and to exercise the legitimate
                        powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.<br>North

<b>The President and the People</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Presently, reports the article, there is an enormous divide between the
                    "dominant sentiment of the country" and the "position of the President," a fact
                    confirmed by the results of the late election. To bridge the gap, it concludes,
                    President Johnson must "conform his policies as nearly as possible" to those
                    promulgated by the Republicans in Congress.<br>

                        Detroit, said:--"I never believed in negro equality. I believe God made us
                        for his own wise purpose a superior race. We have proved ourselves by our
                        inventions in science, history and philosophy, to be superior. I do not
                        believe in Indian equality. I do not believe in Chinese equality, nor in
                        Malay equality. God made us the superior race, and with it the greater
                        responsibilities. But God forgive me, if while I think so, I would endeavor
                        to grind down lower this oppressed race. Our principle is liberty to all. We
                        all shall meet at the same judgement bar. But I think I can say without
                        impiety, I wish He had made all these races white, for He had done so, there
                        would not be a Democrat to-day."</p>

                    <p>MRS. PARTINGTON ON FASHION.--"There is one thing sure," said Mrs. Partington:
                        "the females of the present generation are a heap more independent than they
                        used to be. Why I saw a gal go by to-day that I know belongs to the
                        historical class of society, with her dress all tucked up on her knee, her
                        hair all buzzled up like as if she hadn't had time to comb it for a week,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have always regarded the proposed constitutional amendments as definite
                        terms offered to the States lately in rebellion, the acceptance of which by
                        them would insure them representation in Congress and full enjoyment of the
                        rights and privileges which belong peculiarly to sovereign States. We are
                        well aware of the fact, that many members of Congress voted for their
                        passage in the belief that they would afterwards be rejected by the South,
                        and that then an opportunity would be afforded to press upon the country
                        another and different plan of reconstruction. These men were and still are
                        radically and intensely hostile to the plan of re-adjustment embodied in
                        these amendments, honestly believing that other guaranties than are therein
                        contained are indispensable to the future peace and security of our
                        institutions. But however this may be, we have never doubted that the faith
                        of Congress and the nation was pledged to a full and free admission of these
                        States, whenever they might honestly comply with these terms. The people so
                        understood it and in an issue made between the Executive and Congress
                        sustained the latter in a most positive and unequivocal manner.</p>
                    <p>Touching this subject, the popular decision as rendered in the late elections
                        has a peculiar significance. It is not confined to any one particular point
                        of difference between these two branches of power, but is comprehensive and
                        covers every issue that was raised between them. The issue was first made as
                        to whether reconstruction was necessary, and if necessary, whether there was
                        any power in Congress to determine the manner of that reconstruction? By a
                        popular majority never equalled in this country the people decided these
                        questions affirmatively. The next issue was as to the terms proposed by
                        Congress. The people passed upon these also and they received an endorsement
                        equally as positive and unequivocal. The matter stands now as an agreement
                        between the sections, signed and sealed by the one of the parties, and ready
                        to be executed by the other. Its validity and binding force depends entirely
                        upon the ratification of the remaining party. If that be refused or withheld
                        the instrument is of no effect, and neither Congress nor the nation can be
                        bound by its terms. It has all the essentials of a contract, and to be
                        binding upon either it must be ratified by both. Should the South see proper
                        to ratify it and do so in the manner required by law there can be no
                        question that the faith of the nation would be pledged to yield the
                        consideration that it offered. To refuse it would be to repudiate the
                        obligations of a solemn contract proposed by itself and urged upon the
                        acceptance of the States. Notwithstanding the hostility of many in Congress
                        to the proposed amendments, and their earnest desire for a reconstruction
                        that would essentially remodel and improve our national edifice, we have
                        never doubted that the above considerations would compel them to observe
                        faithfully the terms of the contract they themselves had signed.</p>
                    <p>So far the South has manifested no disposition to accept the terms offered.
                        On the contrary she has evinced an unwillingness that we cannot hope to
                        overcome within any reasonable period. Left to herself she would never have
                        questioned the right of Congress to impose conditions nor murmured against
                        the conditions themselves; but encouraged and deluded by false hopes held
                        out to her by a faithless Executive she has assumed a defiant attitude, and
                        demands as a right what she should sue for as a favor. In view of her
                        probable refusal the question naturally suggests itself,--what then shall be
                        done? Shall Congress accede to her demands and admit her without terms, or
                        propose other and different terms for her acceptance? One or other must be
                        done. The former is impossible, rendered so by the recent expression of the
                        popular will, if by nothing else. The people have solemnly determined that
                        the condition of the country is such that reconstruction is a necessity.
                        Their decision cannot be disregarded and in the nature of things it is
                        irreversible. Neither sullen indifference nor outspoken defiance on the part
                        of the South can change it.</p>
                    <p>What then shall these terms be? We cannot afford to be less generous then
                        than now, but we can afford to be more just. The amendments now proposed
                        were designed to restore the Union with the least possible inconvenience to
                        the people of the South and with the fewest possible restraints consistent
                        with the peace and security of the Government. They were dictated by
                        considerations of mercy as well as expediency. The next must be dictated by
                        considerations of justice as well. If the South will not consent to the
                        disfranchisement of her leading, active Rebels, men who conceived the design
                        of overthrowing the Government and lent their best efforts to the
                        accomplishment of their purpose, then the nation will require of her the
                        complete disenthrallment of the millions of loyal black men scattered
                        throughout her borders and their elevation to all the rights and privileges
                        of citizenship. This will be rendering simple justice to men whose legality
                        needs no guarantees and at the same time extending generous pardon to men
                        who have made themselves liable to the severest penalties. The magnanimity
                        and generosity of the nation will not be less, but rather greater, and the
                        effect will be to raise all men up rather than drag any down. Universal
                        amnesty for impartial suffrage--in these terms justice, generosity and
                        expediency meet each other. If the South shall longer persist in her refusal
                        to accept the terms offered, let us take advantage of her refusal, and
                        rebuild the nation's walls on the sure foundation of equal rights.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have received a communication from an intelligent and reliable Republican
                        of Gettysburg, in reply to the article signed "Adams," questioning the
                        validity of the Senatorial instructions in Adams. We omit the introduction,
                        as it is not necessary to the proper understanding of the question. The
                        writer says:</p>
                    <p>The resolution was offered declaring Gov. Curtin to be the choice of the
                        Republicans of Adams for U. S. Senator. A motion was made to substitute the
                        name of Thaddeus Stevens, which was lost, ayes 7, nays 37. The amendment
                        being lost, the original resolution was adopted without opposition. The
                        seven votes for Mr. Stevens were not anti-Curtin,
                        but Mr. Stevens, by reason of his eminent abilities and great public
                        services, has a strong hold on the affections of the people of Adams county,
                        for many years the place of his residence, and some of the delegates, while
                        warm friends of Gov. Curtin, thought that Mr. Stevens should be complimented
                        with the vote of Adams. The majority of the delegates, while admiring Mr.
                        Stevens abilities and services, thought that he would be more useful to the
                        nation in his present position as the "Great Commoner" and leader of the
                        popular branch of Congress. But for this desire to compliment Mr. Stevens,
                        the vote for Gov. Curtin would have been unanimous. No other candidate could
                        under any circumstances command even the show of support in Adams as against
                        Gov. Curtin. We very much fear that "Adams" is not well booked up, or he
                        would not have perverted the decided vote of our Convention into "two dozen
                        ayes and one dozen nays." We have no doubt that our Senator will obey the
                        wishes of the Republican voters of both counties in his district, by helping
                        elevate our present worthy Chief Magistrate to the distinguished position to
                        which the people of Pennsylvania are determined
                        to elect him.<br> TRUTH.<br> GETTYSBURG, November 16, 1866.</p>
