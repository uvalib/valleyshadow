                    <p>No intelligent reader of this journal for six months past, will expect us to
                        manifest surprise because President Johnson has formally separated himself
                        from the Union organization, as he did on the 18th inst. by his veto of the
                        Freedman's Bureau bill. While earnestly desiring to sustain him to the very
                        verge of the sacrifice of principle and truth, we could but illy conceal our
                        well settled conviction that his complete apostasy was predetermined and but
                        a question of time. While professing to be within the pale of the Union
                        party, he was laboring untiringly, not to promote its success, and thereby
                        the peace and safety of the Nation, but to demoralize its ranks, corrupt its
                        leaders and destroy its vitality. He would have done as he did last week in
                        the fall of 1865, had he felt assured that his perfidy was appreciated and
                        his power for evil within its ranks at an end; but blinded as he was by his
                        inordinate ambition, he was no less infatuated with the hope of dividing the
                        party that crowned him with honors he knows not how to wear, and for months
                        we have seen his persistent efforts within our ranks to capture as many
                        camp-followers and as much baggage as possible to carry off to the common
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>His perfidy to his country and to the loyal men who sustained him in the dark
                        days of trial, is now history. His message to Congress on its meeting in
                        December was carefully prepared to express everything and nothing--he
                        employed language but to conceal ideas, not to express them. In the face of
                        his accepted wishes for a different result, New York, Pennsylvania, New
                        Jersey and Ohio had voted overwhelmingly against the principles he meant to
                        enforce upon Congress, and he recoiled from his own wrong for a season; but
                        at last treason became impatient and loyal men had ceased to trust, and he
                        plunged into political suicide as if he were ambitious to make the name of
                        Tyler respected. The Freedmen's Bureau bill was but the pretext, not the
                        cause, for his sweeping deliverance in behalf of traitors. True, he objects
                        to the bill because of various details. He pronounces it an undue tax upon
                        the people, but like a third-rate pettifogger he withholds the important
                        fact that the main purpose of the bill was to make the freedmen's labor
                        remunerative to themselves and to the government. He declaims against
                        pensioning them upon the bounty of the country, but omits to say that it
                        extends equal aid to the poor whites who have been stricken in the dust by
                        treason's war. He elaborates the dangerous power it confers, as if he
                        confessed his unfitness to exercise it, inasmuch that the patronage by the
                        bill became his own to wield wisely or unwisely as he might see proper. He
                        protests against the exercise of the military power contemplated by the
                        enactment, as if forgetful that he now holds the rebel States under martial
                        law, and that he could so exercise the authority conferred as to free it
                        from all the rigors of military government. He denounces it as
                        unconstitutional, as if oblivious of the fact that he recommended it himself
                        less than three months ago, and that the amendment to the constitution
                        abolishing slavery provides that Congress shall make all needful rules and
                        regulations to carry the amendment into effect. All these pretended
                        arguments, however plausibly woven, are for the simple and weak--he has
                        another and evidently a more sincere argument for those who know well his
                        meaning.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">President Johnson vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau bill
                            because the Traitors demanded it</emph>. This is the simple, unvarnished
                        truth, and the whole truth, and the Nation must look it in the face. The
                        writer hereof was his sincere and earnest friend in the Convention that
                        nominated him for the Vice Presidency. We felt that if any man could be
                        trusted it was Andrew Johnson--the man who had braved treason in the Senate,
                        himself a Southern Senator, and who had been hunted like a stag with a price
                        on his head by every traitor in Tennessee, and had stood unscathed in the
                        terrible struggle. But the sequel shows how sadly were the loyal men
                        mistaken, and in deepest sorrow, but never in anger or disappointment, we
                        have been compelled to complain of his fidelity and fitness for the
                        responsible trust to which he was chosen. We lamented his bitter, revengeful
                        hate of conquered traitors immediately after his succession to the
                        Presidency, as was manifested in his daily speeches to every individual or
                        delegation that would afford him the opportunity, and trembled for the
                        redeemed Republic lest a mad ruler should blot it out in blood; and next we
                        see the traitor, whose life and property and citizenship he seemed to seek
                        with relentless vengeance, sweeping off his pardons, gradually becoming his
                        trembling counselor, next his friend, and then his master; and at last the
                        same men who inaugurated causeless war and ridged our whole fair land with
                        the graves of our martyrs, become the only people for whom he pleads or
                        whose interests he would promote. <emph rend="italic">He distinctly
                            announces in his veto message, that there can be no legislation
                            affecting the rebel States, until they have full representation and
                            participate in the enactment of such laws, and this is the whole sum and
                            substance of his veto.</emph> The treason he once denounced as the
                        highest of crimes, must suffer no penalties, must not even be humiliated by
                        protection to the victims of brutal slavery, until they themselves shall be
                        in Congress to be the judges of their own crimes. They must determine what
                        shall be the fruits of the war. They must come into our Senate and Congress,
                        dripping with the blood of our brave brethren murdered by their unholy
                        ambition to overthrow the best government of the world, and in the very
                        temple of our rescued liberties, surrounded by the hallowed graves of our
                        fallen heroes, and where their legislation must reach a million homes
                        bereaved by treason's swift-winged angel of death--there they are to be
                        clothed with honors and the vanquished become the victors in expounding the
                        teachings of the sword. This is the President's only argument, and it is not
                        misunderstood. His special pleading in the shape of objections to the
                        details of the bill might have caused regret among the Union men of the
                        country, but when he demanded the highest honors of the Nation for the
                        treason he but a few months ago declared "must be made infamous," and would
                        crown it with the laurels of victory, while the slave, ignorant, brutalized
                        and rendered helpless by the exactions of bondage, is turned loose upon the
                        mercy of those who most hate him because he was faithful to the government
                        while his master was faithless, he invites for himself a depth of infamy in
                        our crimsoned history in which none but himself can be his parallel.</p>
                    <p>A president has fallen, and the hoarse salutes of cannon and the blazing
                        bonfires throughout the land, with the wild revelry of men who rejoiced at
                        our country's disasters and mourned at its triumphs when in deadly strife
                        with treason, proclaim that perfidy has won what neither the sword of the
                        traitor nor the ballot of his natural ally could achieve; and wherever
                        treason has a votary, there is gladness! But a people who have appalled the
                        world with their sacrifices for Justice and Freedom are not thus to be
                        crushed or driven into wrong. This rescued Nationality, a fidelity unshaken
                        by treachery, and a future that gives cheering promise of all that is
                        beneficient and great, are theirs; and, though brief authority may forsake
                        virtue and worship at the altar of the country's foes, we shall not despair
                        of the Republic! It will live in fulfillment of its great mission for
                        mankind, when its cruel foes and faithless friends have passed into
                        forgetfulness, or are remembered only to excite the scorn or pity of the
                        happiest and noblest people of the world.</p>

                <summary>In light of Johnson's veto of the Freedmen's Bill, there is little doubt
                    that a deep chasm has developed between the president and the Republicans. The

                    <p>Congress decided on the 19th inst. by a vote of 82 to 58 that Gen. Coffroth
                        was entitled to the seat as representative from the district as having the
                            <emph rend="italic">prima facia</emph> right, and he was sworn
                        accordingly. He is, therefore, for the time-being the member, and Gen Koontz
                        is required to go into a regular contest if he would gain the position to
                        which his people fairly and legally elected him in October 1864. At best he
                        cannot hope to get a final decision for several months to come, and even
                        then, judging from the recent vote, it may be doubtful whether justice will
                        be done to him and the loyal people who elected him.</p>
                    <p>We have heretofore so fully discussed the law and the facts of this case that
                        we do not care to renew it now. It is enough to know that, judged either by
                        law or equity, Gen. Coffroth had no more right to a seat in the present
                        Congress than we have, and the action of the House is but paying a premium
                        for unscrupulous politicians to defy the laws of the State, and corrupt
                        election officers to disregard the vote of the people. <emph rend="italic"
                            >Gen. Coffroth has not a shadow of claim for the seat that is not based
                            upon his own deliberate fraud upon the people of his district</emph>. No
                        intelligent member of the House could fail to see that Gen. Koontz received
                        a majority of the aggregate vote, and was deprived of the certificate that
                        would have secured him the seat, for the simple reason that Gen. Coffroth
                        and his friends, who controlled the election boards, by an insolence
                        defiance of the law and the vote, and by perjury, refused to give it to him.
                        If Congressmen can read English, they could see it declared so plainly that
                        no average fool could err about it, that return judges in this State are
                        positively required to compute the whole vote returned, to reject no part
                        thereof, and to certify in accordance with the vote. This the copperhead
                        return judges refused to do. They deliberately nullified the law they were
                        sworn to support, and a Republican Congress has sanctioned the fraud.</p>
                    <p>It may do for such men as Gen. Coffroth, who never had much reputation to
                        lose, to say that he is entitled to profit by his own fraud; but there can
                        be no technical connivance equal to the task of justifying the Union
                        Congressmen who have voted to sustain a bold whole-cloth fraud upon their
                        Union brethren in this district. All the Union members from Pennsylvania,
                        who may be presumed to know something of the laws which govern our
                        elections, voted solid to vindicate justice; but the Republicans of the West
                        seem to have determined that neither law nor justice should prevail in the
                        determination of this case. The truth is that a portion of them had basely
                        bartered the seat involved in this contest for Coffroth's vote on the
                        constitutional amendment last year, and they have acted as was denominated
                        in the bond. We affirm that this is the only explanation that can be given
                        for the vote consistent with truth, and Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, could probably
                        give the particulars. Disgraceful as was the original contract, its
                        fulfillment is rendered doubly so by the blatant disloyalty of Gen.
                        Coffroth, when struggling to regain his party standing at home after he had
                        cast the vote demanded of him.</p>
                    <p>By the admission of Gen. Coffroth, what the law of Pennsylvania declares to
                        be perjury and fraud, and what the people of the district condemned last
                        fall by an overwhelming majority, is clothed with respectability; an
                        earnest, faithful and loyal man, who was fairly elected, is turned out, and
                        a violent disloyalist, too weak even to transfer himself securely by
                        contract to the right side, will misrepresent the people of this district
                        during most, or perhaps all the period of the present session. Well, since
                        things can't be otherwise, they must be as they are; but the next time that
                        Congress agrees in advance to approve a fraud to promote a fool, they should
                        give those who are to be cheated timely notice to get out of the way!</p>
