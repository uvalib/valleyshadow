<b>The Test Oaths</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article summarily dismisses President Johnson's argument that the test
                    oath should be modified or repealed because there are not enough men to fill the
                    national offices who can take the pledge.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The plea of the President and two or three of his Cabinet Ministers for a
                        repeal or modification of the test oath is, that there are not men enough to
                        be found in the South to fill the national offices, who can take that oath.
                        The Union men of Alabama, however, effectually exploded this plea, by
                        enrolling themselves and demonstrating by actual count that there are, in
                        that State alone, nineteen thousand men who did not bow the knee to Baal;
                        and the Judiciary Committee of the House at Washington offer the further
                        fact that there were forty-two thousand men in the Union army drawn from
                        every Southern State except South Carolina.</p>
                    <p>But the case of Mr. Giers, of Alabama, recently made public, shows that the
                        difficulty does not grow out of lack of men who can take the oath, but out
                        of the preference which the administration naturally feels for men who were
                        tainted with the Rebellion. Mr. Giers was an applicant for an appointment as
                        Commissioner for the collection of direct taxes in that State. He bore
                        recommendations signed by Abraham Lincoln, November 13, 1863; by Andrew
                        Johnson, Sept. 30, 1864; by Gen. Thomas, May 14, 1865; and by Gen. Grant,
                        Feb. 18, 1866. Mr. Andrew Johnson endorsed him as "a gentleman of integrity
                        and respectability; and one of the few in the country who stood firm to the
                        Union;" and Gen. Grant endorses him as "competent and reliable."</p>
                    <p>Yet this true, loyal, competent and reliable man was not appointed. He was willing and able to take the test-oath; but he
                        was thrust aside and the place conferred upon one F. W. Sykes, a member of
                        the Rebel legislature of Alabama, and who cannot therefore take the
                        test-oath. And Mr. McCulloch, through whose department this appointment was
                        made, asks Congress to modify or repeal that oath because he cannot find
                        men, qualified for office, who cannot subscribe to it!</p>
                    <p>There is no such dearth of loyal men at the South as the Administration would
                        have us believe. There are enough of them and to spare, for all the national
                        offices. But the trouble is they are not Johnson men. They can take the
                        test-oath, but do not belong to the "Incorruptible Host." They find the
                        rebels, to whom they have been opposed for five weary years, all full of
                        devotion to the President, and naturally enough they do not like to follow
                        where such men lead. Hence the Administration ignores them, and asks
                        Congress to repeal the test-oath because it is an impossibility to fill the
                        national offices otherwise.<br>Pittsburgh

<b>"They Vote As They Fought"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors comment on an article from last week's Valley Spirit, which
                    reported on the organization of a soldiers' club in York county. According to
                    the Repository's rival, one of the veterans' first actions was to pass a
                    resolution in support of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Heister Clymer.
                    The editors sarcastically note that a similar process is unfolding throughout
                    the South as members of Lee's demobilized army return home and cast their
                    support for like-minded unpatriotic politicians.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The above is the caption of an article in the Spirit of last week, with reference to a club recently organized in
                        the Borough of York, the members of which claim to be veterans of the late
                        war. Judging from the resolutions adopted, and which are commended by the
                            Spirit to the soldiers of this country, we do
                        not hesitate to say that the assertion of the Spirit is literally true. We notice that about this time the
                        veterans of Lee's army throughout the South are adopting similar resolutions
                        with singular unanimity, and we have no doubt that they will vote to support
                        them with the same singleness of purpose. The Spirit not having stated definitely to which army the York veterans
                        belong, the matter might have remained in doubt, but the following
                        resolution adopted by them settles their status decidedly:</p>
                    <p>"Resolved--That we belive the Hon. Hiester Clymer,
                        the Democratic candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania, holds upon all the
                        great principles of public policy views similar to our own, and is a firm
                        supporter of President Johnson, and that therefore we will support him with
                        our voices and votes."</p>
                    <p>During the war of the rebellion, Mr. Clymer was a Senator of Pennsylvania,
                        and the recognized leader of his party in the State. On the records of that
                        body are to be found his views on public policy as represented by his
                        speeches and votes. We propose to present a few of them. At the beginning,
                        in common with the Democratic party, he admitted the right of secession, and
                        denied the right of the nation to preserve its integrity by resisting the
                        rebellion. When the war had actually begun, and the rebels were advancing
                        upon the borders of our State, threatening invasion, and a loan of $500,000
                        was proposed for the defence of the State, it was against Mr. Clymer's
                        "views of public policy" and he accordingly voted no.</p>
                    <p>It was against his "views of public policy" that any conscription bill should
                        be passed and a draft made to reinforce the armies of the Union, and relieve
                        the brave men at the front struggling against overwhelming odds, and so he
                        voted.</p>
                    <p>It was against his "views of public policy," and against his indignant
                        protest and vote, that the soldiers from Pennsylvania, who were exposing and
                        losing their lives in the cause of the country, were allowed to vote.</p>
                    <p>It was against his "views of public policy" that 180,000 colored soldiers
                        were employed, who thereby served their country and occupied the place of a
                        corresponding number of white men.</p>
                    <p>In short, the only instance known where his "views of public policy" were
                        affirmative, were in 1864, when he and his friends declared the war "a
                        failure," and the rebellion consequently a success, or when measures were
                        proposed to embarrass our own government or aid and abet the rebellion
                        morally and materially, as far as was prudent without committing the overt
                        act.</p>
                    <p>And we must do Mr. Clymer the justice to say, that the "views of public
                        policy" he held during the war, are still consistent with those he holds
                        now. Although he and his friends were perhaps premature in declaring the war
                        a failure at Chicago in 1864, it will not be denied that they are exerting
                        themselves manfully to make it a failure now. When, with the assistance of
                        the man whom the resolution of the York veterans declares they delight to
                        honor with Mr. Clymer, the rebel States are again represented in Congress by
                        such patriots as Davis, Stephens, Cobb, Breckenridge and others of that ilk,
                        then indeed will the war be a failure, as far at least as the hopes and
                        expectations of loyalty, christianity, and civilization are concerned.</p>
                    <p>Such a consummation will, however, be devoutly wished for and ardently urged
                        by all supporters of Mr. Clymer's "views of public policy." It would suit
                        Lee's veterans exactly--they see in it a future payment of back pay,
                        bounties and pensions--the Southern people see in it payment of the
                        Confederate debt and relief from their share of the tax for the payment of
                        our debt--to say nothing of the possible reduction of the negro to a state
                        of Slavery not inferior to his former condition.</p>
                    <p>The advantages it presents to loyal men, and especially to those who have
                        been soldiers in the Union Army, is not so clear. To the loyal people at
                        large the issue will be repudiation of your own debt or assumption of the
                        rebel debt. Loyal soldiers are competent to judge for themselves what regard
                        will be paid to their rights, when Davis, Stephens, Breckenridge, &amp;
                        Co. are once more seated in the United States Senate, and a host of other
                        rebels in the lower House, who will have a supervision of the subjects of
                        pensions, equalization of bounties, &amp;c. Union soldiers have had a
                        taste of their legislation already in the State of Kentucky, where by act of
                        Assembly Union soldiers are held responsible for all acts done during the
                        war, even in the line of their duty, while on the other hand rebel soldiers
                        are expressly exempted. The "civil rights bill," passed by a Union Congress
                        over the President's Veto, is all that stands now between the Kentucky Union
                        soldier and rebel prosecution and persecution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clymer's "views of public policy" are so well defined, that it is not
                        worth while to refer to those of his competitor. Every true soldier
                        instinctively turns to the gallant soldier who leads the Union column in
                        this State in the present struggle, and will be found shoulder to shoulder
                        with him in the last and perhaps greatest contest in which our country will
                        be called to engage, and which is to decide whether indeed the war is a
                        failure, and we are betrayed into the hands of our enemies.</p>
                    <p>With General Geary will be the men who were always to be found in the front
                        of the battle. With Heister Clymer will be found the supporters of his
                        policy and "my policy," the grand army of deserters, draft rioters, Lee's
                        veterans and the York veterans--who will of course all "vote as they
                        fought."</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The state supreme court adjourned the Harrisburg term without issuing a
                    judgement on the constitutionality of the congressional act disfranchising
                    deserters. Reports indicate that the justices may render a decision "on some

<b>The Memphis Riots</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In compliance with a resolution from the House, the Secretary of War sent
                    that body General Stoneman's report on the Memphis Riot. According to Stoneman's
                    findings, rioters under the influence of whiskey, including "police, firemen,
                    and rabble, and negro-haters in general with a sprinkling of Yankee-haters,"
                    unleashed an orgy of destruction that resulted in the murder of 24 blacks in the
                    first three days of May. The report attributes the violence in part to the
                    simmering hostility between white residents of the city and black troops
                    stationed nearby. The source of the tension stems from the fact that the black
                    troops were used as "instruments" of the government, given the unenviable task
                    of executing unpopular orders, which often brought them "in contact with the
                    law-breaking portion of the community and the police."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Secretary of War sent on Thursday last to the House, in compliance with a
                        resolution of that body, the report of General Stoneman relative to the
                        recent Memphis riots. The latter says that upon investigation by the
                        commission, it appears there were killed out-right twenty-four negroes,
                        eight of whom were discharged soldiers. The 3d colored artillery had been
                        stationed at Memphis since its organization, and consequently were not under
                        the best of discipline. Large numbers of the men had what they call families
                        living in South Memphis, contiguous to the fort in which the soldiers were
                        stationed.</p>
                    <p>These soldiers had been used as instruments to execute the orders of
                        Government agents, such as provost marshals, bureau agents, etc., and
                        consequently had been more or less brought directly in contact with the
                        law-breaking portion of the community and the police, which is far from
                        being composed of the best class of residents here, but principally
                        Irishmen, who consider the negro as his competitor and natural enemy. Many
                        negro soldiers have, from time to time, been arrested by the police, and
                        many whites, including some of the police, have been arrested by the negro
                        soldiers, and in both cases those arrested have not unfrequently been
                        treated with a harshness altogether unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>After giving the particulars of the riot, General Stoneman concludes by
                        saying: "The rioters were composed of the police, firemen and rabble, and
                        negro-haters in general with a sprinkling of Yankee-haters, all led on and
                        encouraged by demagogues and office-hunters, and most of them under the
                        influence of whisky." It appears in evidence before the commission that John
                        Creighton, recorder of the city, made a speech to the rioters, in which he
                        said: "We are not prepared, but let us prepare to clear every negro s-- of a
                        b-- out of town." Very few paroled confederates were mixed up with the
                        rioters on Tuesday and Wednesday, the large portion being registered voters.
                        Who commenced the incendiarism on Wednesday night remains to be
                    developed.</p>
