                    <p>It would seem that in subserviency and servility, the modern is no
                        improvement on the old Democracy. The Declaration of Independence, even
                        according to the most orthodox Democratic interpretation of that instrument,
                        was popularly supposed to have established the principle, that white men at
                        least were free and equal in this country. It has always been our boast that
                        we have no Orders of nobility, no class distinctions, nothing in short that
                        elevates one white man above another, except it be intelligence. Each
                        citizen of this Republic whether high or low, rich or poor, well born or
                        obscurely born, has ever been taught to consider himself one of the
                        Sovereigns, and the inferior of no other citizen socially or politically.
                        All this we repeat was the popular supposition, but for forty years before
                        the commencement of the great Rebellion it was an equally popular delusion.</p>
                    <p>During those forty years a privileged class had sprung up. The system of
                        slavery in the South had produced legitimate fruits. As between white men,
                        the rich had become richer and the poor poorer, until at last some two or
                        three hundred thousand controlled the destinies of eight millions. These
                        gentlemen earning their bread in the sweat of other men's brows, and living
                        in luxury and idleness, had ample opportunity to arrange matters to suit
                        themselves. Sending their own children to Northern Colleges, they permitted
                        no free schools among themselves lest forsooth the negro might be
                        instructed, and in consequence poor white men's children received no
                        education. Owning their own labor, they had no occasion to employ white
                        men--and as a result those who remained in competition with the unpaid negro
                        labor, were soon sunk into such a state of ignorance, poverty and
                        degradation, that the slaves themselves looked down upon and despised them
                        as "poor white trash." This state of things exactly suited the privileged
                        class--the poor white men they controlled through their prejudices
                        engendered from ignorance, and the slaves through fear. They were masters of
                        the situation. They permitted nothing to be published among themselves which
                        could shake their dominion and all publications from abroad were carefully
                        excluded as "incendiary documents." The very gospel of a great and just God
                        was preached in their interest. Setting matters thus satisfactorily at home,
                        they at the same time did not neglect their interests abroad. Wisely sending
                        their best men to Washington, and keeping them there as long as they would
                        consent to serve, they soon obtained such weight in national affairs as
                        enabled them to take possession of the general government. The offices were
                        filled with their creatures, and the army and navy were the pension lists
                        for their children. Making themselves the balance of power in political
                        matters, it was long a doubtful struggle between the two great parties of
                        the country. Whig and Democratic, which should abase themselves to most to
                        conciliate them and gain their coveted influence. It was reserved for the
                        Democratic party to be successful in this honorable (?) contest, and in
                        consequence the Whig party went out of existence. The new allies now had all
                        their own way, that is, the one as masters, the others as very humble
                        servants. The Southerners in the plenitude of their power, lorded it
                        everywhere. They pervaded the North, and whether it was being a servant or a
                        Congressman, or casting a bone, in the shape of an office, to a Democratic
                        politician, it was done with such an air of magnificent disdain that they
                        were immediately dubbed "chivalry." Their demands for new concessions of
                        power were endless, and the Democracy with their brows in the dust always
                        yielded more than was asked. But in the meantime the nation was becoming
                        alarmed and dissatisfied, and the dissatisfaction made itself visible in the
                        popular vote which gradually left the allies in a minority, although by our
                        system, which gives to Delaware and Florida the same power in the government
                        as New York and Pennsylvania, they still contrived to retain power. But the
                        end was approaching. Believing themselves to possess all the courage and
                        chivalry of the country, looking upon the North as a nation of tradesmen so
                        immersed in business and wedded to the almighty dollar, as to be lost to all
                        considerations, of courage and patriotism; relying on the long continued
                        abject servility of the Democratic party, these Southern gentlemen renewed
                        their demands and pressed them until the civil war was the result.</p>
                    <p>From the trials and sufferings of that war arose another popular supposition.
                        It was supposed that Northern men had shown they possessed courage and
                        manhood of the highest order. That they had governed themselves with an
                        ability in the midst of a civil war, which showed that the people thoroughly
                        understood their system of government, knew its advantages were determined
                        to preserve its destination and demonstrate that the Republic was not an
                        experiment.</p>
                    <p>It now seems that this was also a popular, though pleasing delusion. The
                        Democratic papers, among others the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, think
                        that in the reconstruction of the Government, we had better have from the
                        Southern States "<emph rend="italic">honest, well-born, wealthy,
                        manly</emph> representatives" in other words those honest gentlemen (?)
                        Davis, Stephens, Breckinridge, Toombs et. al. who precipitated the
                        Rebellion, and who did us the honor to govern us in other days. But we are
                        not to insist that the Southern States shall be represented by such "<emph
                            rend="italic">lying, craven, passionless, poverty stricken scum of
                            renegades</emph>" as Botts, Maynard, Stokes and the hundreds of other
                        Union men who remained true to us through tears and blood, who were robbed
                        and plundered by the honest gentlemen above referred to until they became
                        poverty stricken, but who for the cause counted life itself not too great a
                        sacrifice. (The words in italics are a reprint in the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph> from the New York <emph rend="italic">Citizen</emph>.)
                        The effects of "my policy" have been so invigorating that the "<emph
                            rend="italic">well born representatives</emph>" are fast recovering from
                        any slight disability they may have experienced from the severe treatment of
                        the last four years. They are again resuming their former impudence and
                        swagger, and are rapidly reducing their democratic allies to their old
                        contemptible position. They have ordered a convention at Philadelphia on the
                        14th inst. which will present the usual spectacle of Southern arrogance and
                        copperhead servility. Their courage increases as their condition improves
                        and they are again beginning to bluster and threaten as of old, and of
                        course are aped by their allies. At the recent Democratic meeting in Reading
                        all the speakers from the great Blair down to Clymer, threatened the country
                        with civil war and woes innumerable.</p>

                <summary>The editors argue that slavery undermined the "popular supposition" that
                    class distinctions did not exist in American society. The peculiar institution
                    not only relegated blacks to an inferior position but created an incredible
                    economic divide among whites as well. Unfortunately, the editors contend, the
                    legacy of the antebellum order has not yet been destroyed, as seen by the
                    election of former "southern gentlemen" to Congress and other positions of
                    power.</summary>

                <summary>Reports that John A. Light made "a beautiful ascension" in his balloon last
                    Saturday, which was viewed by an "immense concourse of people" who came out to
                    observe the "wonderful feat of science." After rising to the point where the car
                    was no longer visible, Light's aircraft travelled about eight or ten miles,
                    before touching down upon Mr. Lowry's farm, near Waynesboro. The flight lasted
                    close to an hour.</summary>

                <summary>Michael Greenawalt, known by most as "Moses," died suddenly last Monday on
                    his way home after attending to some business at the bank. It is believed that
                    the cause of his death was apoplexy. Two days later, Eve C. Mohler, wife of
                    Samuel Mohler, passed away while she was working in the cellar of her house.
                    Evidently Mrs. Mohler ruptured a blood vessel leading from her heart to her
                    lungs, resulting in her death within minutes.</summary>
