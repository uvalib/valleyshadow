<b>Union Organization</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial urges Union men to organize themselves because they will face
                    a "horde of corruptionists, under the lead of Andrew Johnson and Senator Cowan"
                    in the next election. These two men, it avers, "are in constant consultation
                    with our foes and their chief aim is to overthrow the organization that called
                    them to official station." "Having saved the Republic from the deadly grasp of
                    treason," it declares, "let us not shrink from the duty of preserving it from

                    <p>
                        To the People of Chambersburg:
                    </p>
                    <p>At a convention called by the citizens of the School District last winter,
                        for the purpose of locating a Normal School in this district, a resolution
                        was passed that each county, if it thought proper, should send to the
                        Superintendent of Public Schools at Harrisburg, on or before the 5th of
                        June, 1866, the amount that either county would subscribe for the purpose,
                        and that county subscribing the largest amount was to be designated as the
                        place where the Normal School should be located. The time for sending our
                        proposition to the Superintendent at Harrisburg agreeably to the above
                        resolution, is drawing to a close, and the day for final action on your part
                        is before you. By the liberality of the Legislature, a large sum of money is
                        thrown into your midst, and you must draw upon your good judgements and wise
                        discretion for its profitable investment. It may be stated in general terms
                        that no investments will pay in this locality, that requires the constant
                        and large use of coal, because as we are now situated the cost of
                        transportation to this point no large establishment could pay profitably.
                        While minor objects may engage the attention of a few, your true object
                        should be to invest in such an undertaking as will increase the population
                        of your town and neighborhood, enlarge the demand for country produce and
                        draw to your various stores, trades, occupations and public houses a new and
                        outside population, now foreign to our town, and further, it should be a
                        permanent establishment, for it must be apparent to every intelligent mind,
                        that to support and maintain successfully the extensive and expensive new
                        buildings erected here by the enterprise of our capitalists, we must greatly
                        enlarge our trade and business relations or we go down and languish as a
                        town. We think the requisites above mentioned will all be met in case you
                        are successful in getting the Normal School of this district located near
                        this place.</p>
                    <p>Your only rival is in Cumberland County, and some of her capitalists, with
                        commendable enterprise, are subscribing largely to have the school located
                        near Newville. Now, in the first place, in the erection of the buildings
                        necessary to entertain all these scholars and students, a large amount of
                        mechanical labor and material will be needed; and in this way the very money
                        you may subscribe for this purpose will be returned to many of you before
                        many days. In the second place, this institution would bring into our midst
                        in a short space of time nearly one thousand people from different parts of
                        the district and State; these persons will have to be fed, clothed, boarded;
                        their friends and relatives will visit them during their stay here, and thus
                        go to swell the numbers in our midst. This, on an investment of fifty
                        thousand dollars, would, we are fully convinced, pay better and longer than
                        any other enterprise that has yet been suggested to you from any quarter.</p>
                    <p>We have spoken thus far of remuneration in a pecuniary way; but there is
                        another aspect to this enterprise of a far reaching and grander aim--an
                        argument that will come home to the head, and heart, and conscience of every
                        parent and lover of education in the country; we mean that it will afford a
                        cheap and thorough education to all the children of the town and
                        neighborhood. It will make our town the focus of all the educational
                        interests of the counties that form our district, and exert a healthy moral
                        influence over our community at large. If these suggestions do not move you
                        to act promptly in the matter, we have nothing else to offer, but we trust
                        your own good sense will suggest more potent reasons, if any are needed, and
                        that with one voice you will exclaim "Let the building go up, let it rise,
                        let it rise, let the earliest rays of the morning sun smile upon its proud
                        proportions, and the latest gleam of departing day linger and play upon its
                        summit; let its gates be thrown wide open and the children of the
                        Commonwealth throng its aisles, to seek amidst its hallowed precincts that
                        which neither riches, nor family, nor pomp, nor power, can give nor take
                        away!"<br> ANDREW McELWAINE,<br> P. M. SHOEMAKER,<br> J. W. DOUGLAS.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>At the late Convention of School Directors the following resolution was
                        unanimously adopted:</p>
                    <p>"Resolved that this convention heartily approves of the efforts that have
                        been made to secure the location of the Normal School of the 7th district
                        within the limits of Franklin Co., and that the directors of each School
                        District are hereby appointed solicitors to procure the subscription of
                        stock in said school in their respective localities, and to report to the
                        committee, J. W. Douglass, P. M. Shoemaker and A. M'Elwain; the amount of
                        stock subscribed on or before the 1st day of June next."</p>
                    <p>We are highly gratified with the action taken by this convention,
                        representing as it does the educational interests of the county, and trust
                        that no effort will be spared to consummate the noble project.</p>
                    <p>For the information of all concerned, we would say, that of the counties of
                        Cumberland, Adams, Franklin, Fulton, Bedford, Huntingdon and Blair, which
                        compose the district, none except Cumberland are competing with Franklin for
                        the location of the school. Franklin is more central and is likely to
                        command a larger patronage than any other county. The Railroads now
                        completed and those about to be made make it easily accessible from all
                        points. Healthful and pleasant, rich in agricultural products and blessed
                        with good water, it will attract to its towns, villages and rural districts
                        a much heavier population than they have at present, provided it has good schools. This increase of population will
                        enhance the value of property, swell our revenue and promote business of all
                        kinds. If the Normal School be located in our midst these results must
                        follow, and in addition to this it will bring some 600 or 700 students to
                        spend yearly the cost of their tuition, boarding and a great part of their
                        clothing in our county.</p>
                    <p>The school will be a permanent source from which to supply our county with
                        good teachers, a convenient institution in which to educate our sons and
                        daughters, and will exert a wholesome influence on our literary and social
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the advantages presented to our people to induce prompt
                        attention in this matter. Some will inquire what is the design and what is
                        the nature of a Normal School? Its primary province is to educate teachers
                        for our Common Schools, but it will also afford a more substantial education
                        to other students than can be had elsewhere. It will be at all times under
                        the strict supervision of the School Department, its own trustees, and the
                        Co. Superintendents of the Counties composing the district.</p>
                    <p>Its Principal and professors will be elected by the trustees, and the
                        trustees by the stockholders, and will be a corporate body and sole owners
                        and proprietors of the property of the school. The State,--if the buildings,
                        grounds and arrangements come up to the requirements of the law (which can
                        be seen in the school laws) will recognize the school as a State Normal
                        School, which, according to law, can receive donations, legacies and
                        appropriations which inure to the benefit of the stockholders. To the
                        schools already established, the State has appropriated some $15,000 each,
                        and this school will doubtless receive the same favorable consideration. The
                        school will not be a source of expense but of profit to the County, and at
                        the same time a permanent and convenient resort for our own teachers and
                        children.</p>
                    <p>The stock subscribed to this school will be in shares, say twenty dollars per
                        share, and any person holding a certificate of one or more shares will be
                        entitled to vote for trustees. We would now say that active measures will be
                        taken in Cumberland Co. to secure the school, and as the committee must be
                        in possession of full information from all parts of the county in order to
                        make their proposition of bona fide subscription
                        before the 5th of June--all Directors should be prompt in discharging their
                        duties in this matter.</p>
                    <p>For the benefit of Directors, and others interested, we append a form to be
                        signed by those desiring to subscribe to the stock:</p>
                    <p>"We the undersigned, for and in consideration of the benefits that will
                        accrue to us from the location of a Normal School in our county, hereby bind
                        ourselves, our heirs and assigns, to pay to the Trustees of the Normal

                        put opposite our respective names, to be held a stock in said institution,

<b>Local Items--Death of a Soldier</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>James McGeehen, a resident of Chambersburg, died last Wednesday at the
                    Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Prior to his passing, McGeehen was a
                    member of Co. K, 107th, Reg. Penn. Vols, and took part in many of the bloodiest
                    battles of the early war. He escaped unhurt from the various encounters until
                    July 1, 1863 when he was wounded in the thigh at Gettysburg. Initially, it was
                    believed that his leg would have to be amputated, but his quick recovery pushed
                    doctors to reconsider their decision. Soon after, the soldier was able to move
                    around on crutches, leading them to think everything was fine. Unfortunately for
                    McGeehan, his injury became infected, necessitating the removal of the limb. The
                    soldier traveled to Philadelphia to undergo the procedure, but never recovered
