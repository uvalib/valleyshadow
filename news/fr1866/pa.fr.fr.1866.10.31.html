<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Just as President Johnson supported the rebels of New Orleans when they

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>WHEN the rebels of New Orleans conspired to murder the Union men of that
                        city, as was conclusively shown to the President by official testimony, he
                        disregarded the authority to Gov. Wells, and transferred the authority of
                        the rebel Attorney General, so that the butchery should not be interrupted.</p>
                    <p>When the rebels of Maryland want to nullify the constitution and the laws of
                        Maryland to enable rebels to vote, and Gov. Swann sustains them, the
                        President announces that hereafter he will
                        respond to any call of a Governor for assistance to enforce the laws in his
                        own way. As no loyal Governors are likely to need the President's
                        assistance, he feels safe in adopting a general principle to aid Gov. Swann
                        and the rebels in Maryland.</p>

<b>Who Shall Dictate Terms?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although it is clear from the results of the latest elections that
                    northerners "will consent to no policy of reconstruction that falls short of the
                    acceptance of the proposed constitutional amendments," the editors explain,
                    white southerners refuse to acquiesce to such demands. Rather than accept the
                    "magnanimous terms of reconstruction" offered by the North, they "have again
                    listened to the promises of succor from a faithless President and the broken and
                    demoralized Democracy, only to find both overthrown by the people."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Enough is now known of the sentiment of the North to convince the most
                        obdurate, that the people will consent to no policy of reconstruction that
                        falls short of the acceptance of the proposed constitutional amendments. The
                        issue was fairly made in the great States, and they have with one voice
                        demanded the adoption of the proposed change in our organic law.</p>
                    <p>Had the elections been but half as decisive in favor of the Democracy, the
                        verdict would have been pronounced a condemnation of the amendments, and
                        they would have fallen. But, since the people have decided for the
                        amendments and against the policy of Andrew Johnson, the President and the
                        leading journals and managers of the Democracy, persist in advising the
                        South not to accept the amendments. The President, in his singular
                        blindness, advises against the adoption of the amendments even in the face
                        of the palpable fact that during his entire term he will be as powerless as
                        he is now, to bring about any more favorable adjustment to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>The Democrats of the North misled the South into war, and then were compelled
                        to desert and betray their friends they had pledged to defend. But for the
                        assurance from the North that war could not be urged against the South
                        without plunging the North into anarchy, the rebellion would never have been
                        inaugurated. Betrayed thus once by perfidious counselors, it would seem
                        reasonable to suppose that the South would not again be misled and betrayed
                        by the same power. But it is even so. Instead of accepting magnanimous terms
                        of reconstruction, the rebels have again listened to the promises of succor
                        from a faithless President and the broken and demoralized Democracy, only to
                        find both overthrown by the people.</p>
                    <p>The last hope of aid from the President and the Democracy is gone. Not a
                        single Northern State will vote Democratic this year, and the next Senate
                        and House will be more strongly Republican than the present Congress. It is
                        with this power that the Southern States must deal. It is the power of the
                        people, endorsed and strengthened by their direct and solemn verdict. The
                        President cannot, dare not, attempt to disregard it. He can do it only by
                        revolution, and in that role he could not exercise his office in a single
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The issue is therefore plainly presented to the rebellious States. They have
                        made causeless, wanton, bloody war. Their own arbiter has given its fearful
                        judgement against them, and from it there is no appeal. They have, by the
                        constitution and the laws, forfeited citizenship, property and even life,
                        and their rights are only the rights of disfranchisement, confiscation, or
                        the right to die as the law demands. They have not, either by moral or legal
                        rules, any voice in the government they spurned and sought to dismember by
                        the sword. They have no claim other than that which appeals to the
                        magnanimity of the victors, and reminds us that we are all of one nation and
                        should be again one brotherhood.</p>
                    <p>But the North desires to welcome the rebellious States again into the folds
                        of the Union, and while it would be boundless in its generosity, it dare not
                        be entirely forgetful of justice. It seeks no wanton humiliation, no measure
                        of vengeance; but it must make treason and rebellion odious, and must
                        protect the living and those who are to live hereafter from a repetition of
                        the bloody drama that has just shadowed the land. It asks the adoption of
                        the constitutional amendments and the modification of local laws in
                        conformity therewith, as South Carolina has already done, and the work of
                        reconstruction will be finished.</p>
                    <p>The persistent objection that the North would follow the acceptance of the
                        amendments with new exactions, is doubtless used by the same men who have
                        ever misled the South, to defeat reconstruction. The North would gladly meet
                        the South on the platform of the amendments, and if they should once agree
                        upon that basis of restoration, the time would be passed for any men or
                        combination of men to delay the admission of the rebellious States. On the
                        contrary, the sentiment of the people, which is the great power that directs
                        the action of Congress, would demand the most generous terms on all
                        collateral questions. The men who would move first to bring about the
                        adjustment would be the first to be restored to the full rights of
                        citizenship, and thenceforth the whole policy of the people would be toward
                        the removal of all elements of discord between the two sections.</p>
                    <p>The North is firm to the point of its demand--beyond that it would allow no
                        mere sectional feeling to retard the complete restoration of the rebel
                        States. It demands the amendments. It demands universal justice--equality
                        for all before the law and submission to the paramount authority of the
                        general government. It wants no more--it will take no less; and that once
                        given it will seek to heal our common wounds, and invite all sections, in
                        interest and affection, to our free institutions.</p>
                    <p>The South cannot dictate other terms of reconstruction, even though they come
                        from the very throne of prostituted power itself. If it will not assent to
                        the propositions made in generous and patriotic purpose by the North, it
                        will only arouse and make more exacting the supreme power of the
                        government--the twenty millions of people who have preserved their
                        government by countless sacrifice. They will enforce what the South fails to concede, and they will enforce it
                        with penalties. They will bring the South into loyal harmony with the
                        logical teachings of the war--kindly if they can, but otherwise if they
                        must. They have now submitted to all the people engaged in rebellion the
                        determination of this question--disfranchising the only class South that was
                        true to the Union. If the vanquished white man will not accept the proffer
                        of the North, he will thenceforth be voiceless in the reconstruction of the
                        rebellious States, and the measure of the penalties will be the measure
                        essential to the prompt and enduring solution of the problems left as the
                        legacies of the war.</p>
                    <p>We entreat the South not to be willfully blinded to their best interests, and
                        to the interests of all. They can restore these States any day on better
                        terms than delay and agitation can possible give them. Have they not been
                        deceived and betrayed enough by the defeated and powerless Democracy? Have
                        they not seen enough of the invincible determination of the North to counsel
                        a prompt and cordial assent? If they have not, then are they strangers to
                        wisdom, and their own worst foes. Let reason resume its sway and we shall
                        soon have enduring Peace and universal Justice.</p>
