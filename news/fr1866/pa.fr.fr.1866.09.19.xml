                <summary>A transcript of the address delivered by Thad Stevens at Bedford, Pa., on
                    September 4, 1866. Throughout the speech, Stevens stresses that it is Congress,
                    not the President, that is constitutionally bound to prescribe the terms under
                    which the southern states may re-join the Union.</summary>

                    <p>Considerable interest has been, and still is, felt throughout the country in
                        relation to the real position of these great leaders of our Army and Navy,
                        upon the great questions that now agitate the land. The fact that they
                        compose part of the Presidential escort in the "electioneering tour" now
                        being made by his Accidency Andrew Johnson has given ground for the fear
                        that they too have fallen under the blandishments of power, and may prove
                        recreant to the principles for which they fought so gallantly during the
                        recent rebellion, and are now so greatly honored by their fellow-citizens.
                        But of this there is no fear. Andy Johnson is a cunning old political
                        trickster. He knew well that the presence of these popular heroes with his
                        party on their tour to the grave of the gallant Douglas, would call out
                        thousands of people wherever there would be the faintest chance of seeing
                        them--and hence Gen. Grant and Admiral Farragut were politely informed that
                        "the President <emph rend="italic">requested</emph> their company on his
                        contemplated tour." It is well known in military circles that a <emph
                            rend="italic">request</emph> from a superior is equivalent to <emph
                            rend="italic">a command</emph>, and cannot be denied; and Andy Johnson
                        being the Constitutional Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the
                        United States, Gen. Grant and Admiral Farragut were compelled to dance an
                        unwilling and unpleasant attendance upon their chief, or be guilty of a
                        great personal and official disrespect.</p>
                    <p>Many efforts have been made by the President, and his satellite Seward to get
                        Gen. Grant and Admiral Farragut to say something--if only a dozen
                        words--that might be tortured into some kind of a sanction of "my policy,"
                        but thus far without success. These heroes, who put down the rebellion and
                        saved the Union, are too deeply attached to the prosperity and happiness of
                        their beloved country to yield any countenance to the schemes of those who
                        for years past have been seeking its destruction.</p>
                    <p>But whilst Gen. Grant will not, and does not, define his position by speeches
                        made "on the same line" with the President, he does unbosom himself to his
                        old personal friends without reserve. Gen. John A. Logan, the Union
                        candidate at large for Congress in Illinois is, and has been for years past,
                        one of Gen. Grant's most intimate friends, and well acquainted with his
                        feelings and opinions. In a speech recently made by Gen. Logan to an immense
                        Union gathering at Galena, Illinois, Gen. Grant's former home, he said that
                        "Gen. Grant is in favor of the principles of the Union Republican party, and
                        an ardent supporter of the Constitutional Amendments proposed by Congress;
                        that it is a bitter duty he and Admiral Farragut have to perform in
                        following the President in his mad career over the country--but that the
                        people should rest content, for whenever the time comes that they should
                        show their hands, both Gen. Grant and Admiral Farragut would not only SPEAK
                        but ACT." <emph rend="italic">Now</emph> they are tongue-tied, but <emph
                            rend="italic">then</emph> they will be free to choose between <emph
                            rend="italic">Treason</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Duty</emph> to the
                        nation; and none need doubt how they will decide.</p>

                <summary>The editors assuage any concerns over the decision by Grant and Farragut to
                    accompany President Johnson on his "electioneering tour," contending that, by
                    virtue of their position within the armed services, they are required to obey
                    the command of a superior officer. Thus, they avow, the officers presence with
                    Johnson does not signify support for his election effort or his policies, only
                    the fulfillment of their obligations.</summary>

                    <p>THE declarations of the most distinguished leaders of the Democracy, and the
                        threats of their more prominent journals leave us no room to speculate as to
                        the course they are determined to pursue in case they succeed in electing a
                        sufficient number of Democratic Congressmen in the North to constitute--with
                        the Southern Representatives added--a quorum of the House. In this even they
                        propose, in utter defiance of existing laws, to unite with rebels and set up
                        another Congress, and thus precipitate the country into another rebellion,
                        the issue of which they fondly hope will be more favorable to the enemies of
                        Republican Government.</p>
                    <p>If their designs were less infamous we might accord them candor in publishing
                        them to the country, but the purpose is so outrageous, the scheme so full of
                        sedition and usurpation, that the avowal of it seems rather the defiant
                        threat of desperate and abandoned men, emboldened by familiarity with
                        treason and conscious of their own villainy. From the recent utterances of
                        the President no one can doubt that he understands these designs, and that
                        he is ready and willing to act his part in the plot. He does not hesitate to
                        denounce the present Congress as an unconstitutional body and its more
                        prominent members as traitors. He will seize the first opportunity that is
                        presented to rob it of its power and recognize as legal and constitutional
                        the insurrectionary body composed of Copperheads and Rebels.</p>
                    <p>The probability of their electing a sufficient number of Democrats in the
                        North to enable them to perform this <emph rend="italic">coup d'etat</emph>
                        is very remote, but the bare possibility of such a result is enough to
                        excite the gravest apprehensions, and should arouse the most indifferent to
                        a just appreciation of the importance of the approaching election.</p>
                    <p>A loyal Congress so far has defeated the treachery of the President and the
                        designs of unrepentant Rebels. Let the next Congress be made of just such
                        stuff as the present one and the perfidy of the Executive will be made
                        harmless and the rage of his friends impotent. In order that the people of
                        this district may know exactly who and what they vote for, let Mr. Sharpe
                        declare publicly and unequivocally for which body he is a candidate, whether
                        for the insurrectionary one the President and Mr. Blair hope to organise in
                        defiance of law, composed of disqualified Rebels from the South and their
                        sympathisers from the North, or the one that will meet in conformity with
                        existing laws and be composed of loyal men? The people have a right to know
                        to which of these he aspires.</p>

                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>The recent rise in U. S. securities has elevated the Secretary of the
                        Treasury to the top-notch of self-esteem, in the belief that that event was
                        brought about entirely by his extraordinary financiering in May last, and
                        which I described in my letter published in the REPOSITORY of 25th July
                        following. I dislike to be instrumental in letting down that embodiment of
                        public finance, compared with whom the far-famed Nicholas Biddle, Esq., was
                        but a baby of a year old, to a more natural level; but facts are stubborn
                        things, and it is a fact potent that our worthy Secretary can take, <emph
                            rend="italic">in fact</emph>, not the slightest particle of credit to
                        himself for the recent rise in 5-20 Bonds, or any other gold interest
                        bearing security. That rise is based entirely upon the change in public
                        affairs in Europe, as it is not difficult to demonstrate.</p>
                    <p>When in May last the Bank of England raised its rate of discount to ten per
                        cent. per annum, English capitalists found a ready demand, from the hitherto
                        customers of that bank, for all the money they might think proper to loan
                        them at a less than bank rate, and upon bank terms, as to the time and
                        security; while any rate between 5 and 10 per cent. was better than any of
                        our U. S. securities offered. Hence an immediate cessation in the insular
                        European demand for U. S. bonds was the inevitable result of the rise to
                        such an unusual figure in the rate of Bank of England discount, and a
                        consequent depression in value of our 5-20 bonds at a time when nearly six
                        months interest had to mature upon them. So much for insular Europe. Then,
                        as to continental Europe, immediately followed the German war.</p>
                    <p>Germany, as is well known, had been through her capitalists the largest
                        foreign purchaser of U. S. 5-20 bonds from their first issue, in 1863, to a
                        period immediately preceding the commencement of the late trans-Rhemish war.
                        Then, instead of being purchased, German bond holders became anxious to
                        realize, for the purpose of aiding their government in prosecuting a war
                        that was considered just and proper. The consequence was 5-20's came over to
                        New York from Germany by millions of dollars worth, and sold in a short time
                        as low as par in several instances where forced sales were made; while 2 1/2
                        premium in currency was the quotation in the market. This continued while
                        the prospect of war continued, but a somewhat short time, it is true; and as
                        soon as peace was proclaimed a consequent reaction naturally resulted. Those
                        who, the month previous, realized at a loss were now as anxious to buy
                        again, as there is no long security in the European market that pays as high
                        a rate of interest as our 5-20 bonds, and the recent advance in them
                        followed naturally as the previous decline.</p>
                    <p>In this whole movement New York speculators who had money and nerve and
                        judgement--three items which all speculators need more or less of--must have
                        profited largely. The Secretary engineered the sale of the government gold
                        to their profit, and, then, circumstances over which he had no control, as
                        he had got rid of his surplus gold, engineered the 5-20's to their profit;
                        and so that they may set down 1866 as a white year in their calendar, and
                        laugh heartily at the idea of the Secretary believing that the people should
                        be obliged to him for the enhanced value of government securities, and
                        consider the advantage of his recommending the propriety of putting a 5 per
                        cent gold interest paying loan upon the market with the respect and
                        confidence due to him.</p>
                    <p>Such an exhibition of inordinate variety affords but another item to the mass
                        of already extant weighty testimony that he is totally unequal to the
                        position he fills. The dawnings of a foreign war appeared in the horizon a
                        month before the Bank of England raised her rate of interest, or the first
                        German bondholder attempted to realize the past spring upon his U. S.
                        securities. But the Secretary "did not see it." He was studying how he could
                        slaughter the gold speculators by wiping them out at one fell swoop. His
                        scheme fully matured, he immediately let slip his dog of war, and with what
                        result has been shown. Europe or her wars gave him not the slightest
                        concern. To corner the gold men was his game, and in ten days he played it
                        out, to a dead loss to government and a clear profit of $40,000 to his
                        brother in law, Peter M. Myers, Esq., broker, Wall Street, N. Y., and to
                        number of others, names not given, in probably, according to the funds they
                        invested, much larger amounts. A. Belmont, Esq., it is said, having cleared
                        over a million.</p>
                    <p>A wise man filling the position of the Secretary, would have noticed the
                        dawning of a European war, watched its rise, and held the government gold
                        ready to buy up the government securities which he would know must certainly
                        be returned to our shores with the first blow struck by one foreign power
                        against another. Then, by the purchase, for government account, of those
                        tens of millions of dollars of 5-20 bonds which were bought in New York,
                        during the months of June and July last, with that very gold which our
                        present Secretary had thrown away, the Treasury of the United States would
                        be in pocket just what was shared by those whom our Secretary seems to have
                        been put into office to favor, viz: the bankers and capitalists of New York
                        and elsewhere; and the people of the United States would have occasion to do
                        that which there is no prospect, evidently, of them having a chance to do
                        while the present incumbent holds his seat, namely, thank their stars that
                        they have the head of a financier upon the shoulders of their Secretary of
                        the Treasury.<lb/> Yours to command.<lb/> Bobtail.</p>

                <summary>A "disturbance" between Democrats and Republicans broke out in front of the
                    Court House last Monday that culminated in a pitched battle in which "stones
                    were freely used." Several injuries were reported, though none of them serious.
                    As expected there are many "contradictory statements," consequently the article
                    refrains from attributing blame for the violence.</summary>
