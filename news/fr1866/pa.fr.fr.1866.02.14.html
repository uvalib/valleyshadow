<b>What Shall Be The Guarantees</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although some members of Congress have advocated enfranchising the former
                    slaves and confiscating the estates of disloyal white southerners to remedy the
                    volatile situation in the South, these measures are wholly impractical, say the
                    editors. To counter the treasonous sentiments pervading the region, Congress
                    must guarantee basic rights for the freedmen and women and must ensure that
                    slavery will not return simply under the guise of a different name. The editors
                    contend that the amendment recently introduced by Thad Stevens is a "step in the
                    right direction."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The emancipated slave cannot now be enfranchised. The fact is conclusive and
                        theories are fruitless. Many earnest and faithful men have looked to
                        universal suffrage in the rebel States as the main guarantee for future
                        peace and fidelity; but there can be none so blind as not to see that it is
                        one of the issues that cannot enter into the practical solution of the
                        problem of re-construction. Mr. Stevens but reflected the convictions of
                        four-fifths of all classes in his recent speech, when he said--"I hold that
                        the States have a right, and always have had it, to fix the elective
                        franchise within their own States." Mr. Sumner may deliver his most
                        classical and eloquent essays in opposition to the doctrine, but he will be
                        left behind and almost solitary in the great struggle.</p>
                    <p>Confiscation is one of the issues of the past. It would be but just, but the
                        nation has progressed beyond it in the adjustment of the grave questions
                        arising from the war. The Executive is adverse to it. Peace brought with it
                        that magnanimity that ever characterizes a great and brave people, and
                        confiscation was not demanded. Even with a crushing debt created by
                        causeless war, the loyal people seemed to prefer to bear its burdens rather
                        than demand its payment by those who wantonly forced it upon us. A test vote
                        on the subject recently in Congress, showed but a small minority in favor of
                        it. It is dead--let us deal with living, practical issues.</p>
                    <p>The emancipated slave, let it not be forgotten, was the faithful ally of the
                        government in its deadly struggle with treason. He betrayed no warrior clad
                        in his country's blue. He was ever ready to aid the fleeing fugitive from
                        rebel pest-houses and prisons. He found them in the swamps and hiding-places
                        and ministered to their wants; and often led them by the north star, his
                        finger-board of freedom, to safety within our lines. Nor did he stop with
                        sympathy--he filled up our shattered ranks, when the North was on the verge
                        of despair, and fifty thousand of his sable race sleep with the martyrs of
                        the Republic.</p>
                    <p>Of the inhabitants of the rebel States the freedmen stand alone, as a class,
                        in unqualified loyalty to the government. He is disfranchised. In most
                        States he is without the natural right to make or enforce a contract. He
                        cannot testify in the courts, and is without means to protect his person,
                        his property or his family. His late master hates him because he has been
                        unjust to him, and his injustice has in the fullness of time been measurably
                        avenged. He has forfeited life, property and citizenship by his treason; but
                        now he struggles as of old to pervert the very genius of our government and
                        blot it with oppression.</p>
                    <p>One of the first guarantees to be demanded and perfected in the
                        reconstruction of the rebel States is the complete protection of the
                        emancipated slave. If Congress shall fail to do this wisely and well, then
                        will treason win in the councils of the nation what it lost by the sword,
                        and we shall have slavery, in the guise of freedom, more object and
                        tyrannical than before. If any State shall be admitted to full fellowship
                        that refuses entire equality to all its people before the law, without
                        regard to caste or color, it will be a blistering stain upon the national
                        escutcheon, and will be a staggering blow at the very vitals of our free
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>The President has pronounced against any amendment of the organic law; but
                        the loyal people are not content thus to endanger the government by clothing
                        present and future traitors with power to renew the discord the sword has
                        silenced. The nation has emancipated over four millions of slaves, and all
                        bow to the justice of the act; but they were not emancipated to be abandoned
                        to a more cruel fate than Slavery. Their emancipation imposes the duty of
                        protection, and it cannot be evaded or discarded to gratify ambition or to
                        silence the last invention of treason--the cry of war of races. They must be
                        made equal before the law, or their condition as freedmen will be worse than
                        ever was slavery; and to Congress, and to Congress alone, do the loyal
                        people of the nation look for this small measure of justice. The rebel
                        States have already refused it; some in whole, some in part, and only the
                        arm of the organic law can be equal to the task of maintaining "life,
                        liberty and the pursuit of happiness" for the freedmen of the States lately
                        in rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The proposed amendment to the constitution passed by the House recently,
                        although not all that the case demands, is the best step in the right
                        direction that has yet been taken. It does not propose any violent change in
                        social or political rights, but concedes all such questions to the people of
                        the States. It declares to those States that they can enfranchise their
                        negroes or not, just as they choose. They can do it by degrees, by
                        wholesale, or never do it, as they may prefer; but it declares, also, that
                        the people who have no voice in the selection of Congressmen, shall have no
                        representation there--in other words: that the former slave owners shall
                        cease to be represented in Congress by disfranchised freedmen. Its adoption
                        will reduce the representation of the rebel States in Congress one-third,
                        and leave them the option to regain their old representation, and even an
                        increase of it, whenever they determine to extend the elective franchise.
                        Already prominent men in the South have started the agitation. The Richmond
                            Whig advocates limited negro suffrage in
                        Virginia. Hon. Wm. A. Graham, formerly a rebel Senator and now Senator elect
                        from North Carolina, has declared in favor of qualified negro suffrage in
                        that State; and Hon. John Bell and Gen. Pillow have advised its adoption in
                        Tennessee. We believe that the adoption of the amendment will accomplish
                        more for the freedmen, by the voluntary action of the Southern people, than
                        any measure of Congress aiming at the attainment of direct and positive
                        political advantages for them.</p>
                    <p>The guarantee of complete protection to the emancipated slave must be
                        perfected before rebel States are re-admitted, or it can never be
                        accomplished; and when that is done, we submit that the protection of our
                        own credit, the repudiation of the rebel debt, and the paramount duty of all
                        citizens and States to the general government, are grave issues which should
                        not be left to the uncertain policy of the future. It is clear that no
                        measure looking to the supremacy of loyalty in the nation will ever be
                        adopted after rebels are admitted to fellowship and representation; and it
                        is no injustice to a conquered people, who exhausted themselves to overthrow
                        the government, to leave to loyalty, not to treason, the perfection of the
                        safe-guards deemed essential to the future peace and prosperity of the
                        Union. We appreciate the embarrassments under which the Union majority in
                        both branches of Congress habitually labor in this work of justice and
                        security; but in their hands are these issues entrusted by a faithful
                        people, and it is for them to act wisely and patriotically for the safety of
                        the Republic. They should sacrifice no attainable good because all that
                        should be accomplished cannot be won. They are the guardians of Justice and
                        Freedom; let them be faithful to their sacred trust, and spare no efforts to
                        make the Union, regenerated in its richest blood, true alike to its
                        patriotic founders and to its heroic defenders.</p>

<b>The President and the Negroes</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>From the recent meeting between "a delegation of Negroes and President
                    Johnson," contends the editorial, it has become clear that the President intends
                    to veto the bill granting suffrage to blacks in the District of Columbia. This
                    decision, along with his position on a number of "vital issues," it suggests,
                    will place him at odds with a "decided majority of Congress." Should the
                    President prevail in this battle with Congress, "the vanquished, not the
                    victors" will "have triumphed in the reconstruction of the Union."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give in to-day's paper the detailed account of the recent interview
                        between a delegation of Negroes and President Johnson. It will be seen that
                        the President improved the occasion to give his views fully on the question
                        of the enfranchisement of their race, and the special importance of his
                        expressions arises from the fact that he clearly fore-shadows his veto of
                        the bill now pending in the Senate extending suffrage to the colored people
                        in the District of Columbia.</p>
                    <p>We are not surprised at the expressions of opinion made by President Johnson.
                        But a short time before, he authorized a publication indicating his aversion
                        to any amendment of the constitution. A few Union members faltered, but the
                        amendment fixing a just basis of representation passed soon thereafter by
                        more than the requisite two-thirds, and it is morally certain that the
                        Senate will pass both the negro suffrage bill for the District of Columbia
                        and the amendment adopted by the House.</p>
                    <p>The resolution proposing an amendment to the constitution does not require
                        the approval of the President; but the bill for the enfranchisement of the
                        negro in the District cannot become a law without his signature unless
                        passed over his veto by a two-thirds vote--a result not probable after a
                        Presidential veto. The country will, we apprehend, soon witness a decided
                        majority of Congress at variance with the President on several most vital
                        issues, and we fear greatly that the end will be the defeat of all measures
                        essential to the future peace and safety of a loyal people, who have just
                        rescued their government by appalling sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>We do not choose to discuss the position of the President on the status and
                        future protection of the freedmen, but the reflection is irresistible that
                        he regards the question with singular forgetfulness of the crime of treason.
                        "The question comes up," he says, "whether these two races, (the rebels and
                        freedmen) situated as they were before, without time for passion and
                        excitement to be appeased, and without time for the slightest
                        improvement--whether the one should be turned loose upon the other and be
                        thrown together at the ballot-box with the enmity and hate existing between
                        them. Will not this commence a war of races?"</p>
                    <p>The negroes who had felt the driver's lash, were allowed to hear the
                        interrogatory, but not to answer it, or we should probably have heard that
                        if the rebel hates the negro it is because the one was faithful to the
                        government and the other faithless; and that if a war of races will follow
                        enfranchisement, it is because the perfidious white man, who has drenched
                        his land in blood to destroy his own inheritance, will inaugurate and
                        prosecute that war.</p>
                    <p>The question of suffrage is wisely left to the States. All parties excepting
                        the President himself, who has regulated it in his reconstruction
                        experiments, agree that it is not competent for Congress to declare the
                        negro enfranchised anywhere out of the District of Columbia; but it is due
                        to justice and to law, that it be denied because such is the law, and not
                        because unrepentant traitors threaten the nation with a series of petty
                        revolutions. Granted that Congress has no right to enfranchise the
                        emancipated slave, by what right, by what law, does the rebel, still stained
                        with the blood of our brethren sacrificed in wanton war, threaten us with a
                        war of races if a loyal black man is conceded the same rights mercifully
                        conceded to a conquered rebel? The right of the rebel under the law is to
                        die; to expiate his crime--the right of the freedmen under the law is
                        protection. Must his appeal for it be answered by the fear that traitors may
                        be offended?</p>
                    <p>We must confess that the logic of the President does not accord with
                        enlightened freedom or the claims of justice. If after four years of fearful
                        war to overthrow treason, the prejudices of the traitor, who lives and

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>The establishment of a Normal School in Franklin County, is a question of
                        great moment to its citizens at the present time. Every parent and every
                        good citizen feels the necessity of providing good schools for the rising
                        generation. Year after year, as the time for opening our schools approaches,
                        the attention of School Directors is directed to the important subject of
                        securing the requisite number of well qualified teachers. Parents are
                        anxious in each particular locality as to whom the education of their
                        children is to be entrusted. The Directors meet to consider the applications
                        of candidates for the schools of their respective districts. At once they
                        feel the delicacy of their situation as the chosen representatives of the
                        patrons of their school. They know full well that their predecessors have
                        too frequently failed to give satisfaction in the selection of
                        teachers.They, themselves, perhaps, in their private positions as patrons,
                        have often blamed School Directors for the appointment or non-appointment of
                        particular applicants. They have asked and reiterated the question. Why do
                        our directors not give us better teachers? They have, perhaps, insinuated
                        that impure motives have governed their action; and almost desponding of
                        good schools at home they have, at considerable expense, sent their children
                        from home to be educated. Now, however, they occupy the responsible position
                        of making the selection themselves; they meet for the purpose of engaging
                        teachers for a district having from 10 to 20 schools, and at once are
                        confronted by the stubborn fact that not more than half the number of
                        competent teachers make application for situations. At that and subsequent
                        meetings, through much tribulation, they toil under the burden of their
                        trust, and finally, fill the schools with good teachers, doubtful
                        apprentices and a few who have been rejected at their first meeting. They
                        are at once made the targets, as their predecessors before them, of the
                        shaft of abuse and crimination deserved or undeserved, until, if duty does
                        not prompt them to a better course, they turn with the disgust from the
                        thankless business of "making brick without straw," while their task masters
                        mercilessly require the "full tale of brick." This is but a faint picture of
                        the history of School Directors for the past few years. Indeed it has always
                        been and must still be the experience of these officers wherever the supply
                        of teachers is not equal to the demand. What then must be the remedy for
                        this state of things? Evidently take means for increasing the supply. We do
                        not say that no one can teach successfully without a professional training
                        in a Normal School. No doubt by a few sessions of experimenting, and perhaps
                        by mistakes which are permanently fatal to their pupils; or here and there a
                        genius "apt to teach" by instinct, some have risen to eminence in their
                        profession. But the great fact remains that these do not afford an adequate
                        supply of teachers for our schools. How, then, will a Normal School remedy
                        this defect in the supply? The Normal School is a school for training
                        teachers in their profession, other schools only undertake to make scholars,
                        who must afterwards learn the business of teaching. The Normal School has a
                        chair on the "Theory and Practice of Teaching." In order to train the
                        teacher, there is in the Normal School a model school. In this model school
                        under the supervision of a Professor the graduating class are trained to
                        teach the branches required in our Common Schools. Here the student gets an
                        experience which enables him to classify his school, and teach it
                        successfully, as soon as he enters his profession. Shall we not exert all
                        our energies to secure such a school in our county? Many from our own county
                        will go to such a school near home who would not go abroad. Many others will
                        come from abroad to be educated here who will be attracted by our pleasant
                        and salubrious valley and will remain amongst us. The expenses of educating
                        our sons and daughters in a school near home will be much lighter than they
                        would if they must go abroad. Every interest, educational, agricultural,
                        mechanical, and mercantile will be promoted by bringing money into our
                        county. All have an interest, all should interest themselves in this great
                        project.</p>

                        Frederick Douglass first advancing for that purpose. Geo. T. Downing then
                        addressed the President as follows:--We present ourselves to your Excellency
                        to make known with pleasure the respect which we are glad to treasure for
                        you; a respect which is your due as our Chief Magistrate. It is our desire
                        for you to know that we come feeling that we are friends, meeting as
                        friends. We should, however, have manifested our friendship by not coming to
                        further tax your already burdened and valuable time. But we have another
                        object in calling. We are in a passage to equality before the law. God hath
                        made it by opening a red sea. We would have your assistance through the
                        same. We come to you in the name of the United States, and are delegated to
                        come by some who have unjustly worn iron manacles on their bodies; by some
                        whose minds have been trammeled by class legislation in States called free.</p>
                    <p>The colored people of the States of Illinois, Wisconsin, Alabama,
                        Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland,
                        Pennsylvania, New York, New England States, and District of Columbia, have
                        specially delegated us to come. Our coming is a marked circumstance noting
                        determined hope; that we are not satisfied with an amendment prohibiting
                        slavery, but that we wish it enforced with appropriate legislation. This is
                        our desire. We ask for it intelligently, with the knowledge and conviction
                        that the fathers of the revolution intended freedom for every American, that
                        they should be protected in their rights as citizens and equal before the
                        law.</p>
                    <p>We are Americans, native-born Americans. We are citizens, we are glad to have
                        it known to the world, as bearing no doubtful record on this point. On this
                        fact, and with confidence in the triumph of justice, we base our hopes. We
                        see no recognition of color or race in the organic law of the land. It knows
                        no privileged class, and therefore we cherish the hope that we may be fully
                        enfranchised, not only here in this district, but throughout the land. We
                        respectfully submit that rendering anything less than this will be rendering
                        to us less than our just dues; that granting anything less than our full
                        rights will be a disregard of our just rights, of disrespect for our
                        feelings.</p>
                    <p>If the power that be do so it will be used as a license, as it were, or an
                        apology for any community, or for individuals, thus disposed to outrage our
                        rights and feelings. It has been shown in the present war that the
                        Government may justly reach the strong arm into States and demand from them,
                        from those who owe it allegiance, their assistance and support. May it not
                        reach out a like arm to secure and protect its subjects upon whom it has a
                        like claim?</p>
                    <p>Frederick Douglass advanced and addressed the President, saying:--Mr.
                        President, we are not here to enlighten you, sir, as to your duties as the
                        Chief Magistrate of the Republic, but to show our respect, and to present in
                        brief the claims of our race to your favorable consideration. By the order
                        of Divine Providence you are placed in a position where you have the power
                        to save or destroy us--to bless or to blast us; I mean our whole race. Your
                        noble and humane predecessor placed in our hands the power to assist in
                        saving the nation, and we do hope that you, his able successor, will
                        favorably regard the placing in our hands of the ballot, with which to save
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We shall submit no argument on that point. The fact that we are subjects of
                        Government and subject to taxation, subject to volunteer in the service of
                        the country, subject to being drafted, subject to bear the burdens of the
                        State, makes it improper that we should ask to share in the privileges of
                        this condition. I have no speech to make on this occasion. I simply submit
                        these observations as a limited expression of the views and feelings of the
                        delegation with which I have come.</p>
                    <p>REPLY OF THE PRESIDENT</p>
                    <p>The following is substantially the response of the President:--In reply to
                        some of your inquiries, not to make a speech about this matter, for it is
                        always best to talk plainly and distinctly about such questions, I will say
                        that if I have not given evidence in my former course that I am a friend of
                        humanity, and to that portion of it which constitutes the colored
                        population, I can give no evidence hereafter. Everything that I have had,
                        both as regards life and property, has been periled in this cause, and I
                        feel and think that I understand (not to be egotistic) what should be the
                        true direction of this question, and what course of policy would result in
                        the amelioration and ultimate elevation not only of the colored, but the
                        great mass of the people of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I say that if I have not given evidence that I am a friend of humanity, and
                        especially the friend of the colored man, in my past conduct, there is
                        nothing that I could now do that would. I repeat, all that I possessed,
                        life, liberty and property, have been put up in connection with that
                        question, when I had every inducement held out to take the other course, by
                        adopting which I would have accomplished, perhaps, all that the most
                        ambitious might have desired.</p>
                    <p>If I know myself and the feelings of my own heart, they have been for the
                        colored man. I have owned slaves and bought slaves, but I never sold one. I
                        might say, however, that practically, so far as my connection with slaves
                        has gone, I have been their slave instead of their being mine. Some have
                        even followed here, while others are occupying and enjoying my property with
                        my consent. For the colored race my means, my time, my all has been periled,
                        and now, at this late day, after giving evidence that is tangible, that is
                        practical, I am free to tell you that I do not like to be arranged by some
                        who can get up handsomely-rounded periods, deal in rhetoric and talk about
                        abstract ideas of liberty, who never periled life, liberty, or property.</p>
                    <p>This kind of theoretical, hollow, unpractical friendship amounts to but very
                        little. While I say that I am a friend of the colored man, I do not want to
                        adopt a policy that I believe will end in a contact between the races,
                        which, if persisted in, will result in the extermination of one or the
                        other. God forbid that I should be engaged in such a work now. It is always
                        best to talk practically and in a common sense way. Yes, I have said, and I
                        repeat it here, that if the colored man in the United States could find no
                        other Moses, or any Moses that would be more able and efficient than myself,
                        I would be his Moses to lead him from bondage to freedom; that I would pass
                        him from a land where he had lived in slavery to a land (if it were in our
                        reach) of freedom. Yes, I would be willing to pass with him the rough the
                        Red Sea to the land of promise, to the land of liberty; but I am not
                        willing, under either circumstances, to adopt a policy which I believe will
                        only result in the sacrifice of his life, and the shedding of his blood. I
                        think I know what I say; I feel what I say, and I feel assured that if the
                        policy urged by some be persisted in, it will result in great injury to the
                        white as well as to the colored man. There is a great deal of talk about the
                        sword in one hand accomplishing one end, and the ballot accomplishing
                        another at the ballot-box. These things all do very well, and sometimes have
                        forcible application.</p>
                    <p>We talk about justice, we talk about right. We say that the white man has
                        been in the wrong in keeping the black man in slavery as long as he has.
                        That is all true. Again, we talk about the Declaration of Independence, and
                        equality before the law. You understand all that, and know how to appreciate
                        it. But now let us look each other in the face. Let us go to the great mass
                        of colored men throughout the slave States. Let us take the condition in
                        which they are at the present time (and it is bad enough we all know), and
                        suppose by some magic you could say to every one, "You shall vote
                        to-morrow." How much would that ameliorate their condition at this time?
                        Now, let us get closer up to this subject and talk about it.</p>
                    <p>What relation has the colored man and the white man heretofore occupied in
                        the South? I opposed slavery upon two grounds. First, it was a great
                        monopoly, enabling those who controlled and owned it to constitute an
                        aristocracy, enabling the few to derive great profits and rule the many with
                        an iron rod, as it were; and that is one great objection to it in argument,
                        its being a monopoly. I was opposed to it, secondly, upon the abstract
                        principle of slavery. Hence in getting clear of a monopoly we were getting
                        clear of slavery at the same time. So, you see, there were two right ends
                        accomplished in the accomplishment of one.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--Mr. President, do you wish--</p>
                    <p>The President--I am not quite through yet. Slavery has been abolished. A
                        great national guarantee has been given, one that cannot be revoked. I was
                        getting at the relation that subsisted between the white and the colored
                        man. A very small proportion of white persons, compared with the whole
                        number of such, owned the colored people of the South. I might instance the
                        State of Tennessee in illustration. There were twenty-seven non-slaveholders
                        to one slave-holder, and yet that slave power controlled the State. Let us
                        talk about the matter as it is.</p>
                    <p>Although the colored man was in slavery there, and owned as property in the
                        sense and in the language of that locality and of that community, yet in
                        comparing his condition and his position there with the non-slaveholder, he
                        usually estimated his importance just in proportion to the number of slaves
                        that his master owned with the non-slaveholder. Have you never lived upon a
                        plantation?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--I have, your Excellency.</p>
                    <p>The President--When you could look over and see a man, who had a large
                        family, struggling hard upon a poor piece of land, you thought a great deal
                        less of him than you did of your own master.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--Not I.</p>
                    <p>The President--Well, I know such was the case with a large majority of you in
                        those sections; where such is the case, we know there is an enmity; we know
                        there is a hate. The poor white man, on the other hand, was opposed to the
                        slave and his master, for the colored man and his master combined kept him
                        in slavery by depriving him of a fair participation in the labor and
                        productions of the rich lands of the country. Don't you know that a colored
                        man in going to hunt a master (as they call it) for the next year, preferred
                        hiring to a man who owned slaves rather than one who did not. I know the
                        fact, at all events.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--Because they treated him better.</p>
                    <p>The President--They did not consider it quite as respectable to hire to a man
                        who did not own negroes as to hire to one who did.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--Because he wouldn't be treated as well.</p>
                    <p>The President--Then that is another argument in favor of what I am going to
                        say. It shows that the colored man appreciates the slave owner more highly
                        than he did the man who didn't own slaves. Hence the enmity between colored
                        man and the non-slaveholders. The white man was permitted to vote before
                        government was derived from him. He is part and parcel of the political
                        machinery, not by rebellion or revolution.</p>
                    <p>And when you come back to the object of this war you find that the abolition
                        of slavery was not one of the objects. Congress, and the President himself,
                        declared that it was waged on our part in order to suppress the Rebellion.
                        The abolition of slavery has come as an incident, and as an incident we
                        should give it the proper direction. The colored man went into this
                        Rebellion a slave. By the operation of the Rebellion he came out a freedman,
                        equal to freedmen in other portions of the country.</p>
                    <p>Then there is a great deal done for him on this point. The non-slaveholder
                        who was forced into the Rebellion, and was as loyal as those who lived
                        beyond the limits of the State, was carried into it, and his property, and
                        in a number of instances the lives of such were sacrificed, and he who has
                        survived has come out of it with nothing gained, but a great deal lost.</p>
                    <p>Now, upon a principle of justice, should they be placed in a condition
                        different from what they were before? On the one hand one has gained a great
                        deal. On the other hand one has lost a great deal, and in a political point
                        of view, scarcely stands where he did before. Now we are talking about where
                        we are going to begin. We have got at the hate that existed between the two
                        races.</p>
                    <p>The query comes up whether these two races, situated as they were before,
                        without preparation, without time for passion and excitement to be appeased,
                        and without time for the slightest improvement, whether the one should be
                        turned loose upon the other and be thrown together at the ballot-box with
                        this enmity and hate existing between them? The question comes up, will we
                        not then commence a war of races? I think I understand this thing, and
                        especially is this the case when you force it upon a people without their
                        consent.</p>
                    <p>You have spoken about Government. Where is power derived from? We say it is
                        derived from the people. Let us take it so, and refer to the District of
                        Columbia by way of illustration. Suppose, for instance, here, in this
                        political community, which to a certain extent must have government, must
                        have law; and putting it now upon the broadest basis you can put it, take
                        into consideration the relation which the white has hitherto borne to the
                        colored race, is it proper to force upon this community, without their
                        consent, the elective franchise without regard to color, making it
                        universal?</p>
                    <p>Now, where do you begin? Government must have a controlling power, must have
                        a lodgement. For instance; suppose Congress should pass a law authorizing an
                        election to be held, at which all over twenty one years of age, without
                        regard to color, should be allowed to vote, and a majority should decide at
                        such election that the elective franchise should not be universal, what
                        would you do about it? Who would settle it? Do you deny that first great
                        principle of the right of the people to govern themselves? Will you resort
                        to an arbitrary power, and say a majority of this people shall receive a
                        state of things they are opposed to?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--That was said before the war.</p>
                    <p>The President--I am now talking about a principle, and not what somebody else
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Downing--Apply what you have said, Mr. President, to South Carolina, for
                        instance.</p>
                    <p>The President--Suppose you go to South Carolina, suppose you go to Ohio, that
                        does not change the principle at all. The query to which I have referred
                        still comes up when the Government is undergoing a fundamental change. The
                        government commenced upon this principle, it has existed upon it, and you
                        propose now to incorporate into it an element that did not exist before.</p>
                    <p>I say the query comes up, in undertaking this thing, whether we have a right
                        to make a change in regard to the elective franchise in Ohio, for instance;
                        whether we shall not let the people in that State decide the matter for
                        themselves?</p>
                    <p>Each community is better prepared to determine the depository of its
                        political power than anybody else, and it is for the Legislature, for the
                        people of Ohio, to say who shall vote, and not for the Congress of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>I might go down here to the ballot-box to-morrow and vote directly for
                        universal suffrage, but if a great majority of this people said no, I should
                        consider it would be tyrannical and arbitrary in me to attempt to force it
                        upon them without their will. It is a fundamental text in my creed that the
                        will of the people must be obeyed when fairly expressed. Is there anything
                        wrong or unfair in that?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass, smiling--A great deal of wrong, Mr. President, with all
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>The President--It is the people of the States that must for themselves
                        determine this question. I do not want to be engaged in a work that will
                        commence a war of the races. I want to begin the work of reparation. If a
                        man demeans himself well, and shows evidence that this new state of affairs
                        will operate, he will be protected in all his rights and given every
                        possible advantage by the State or community in which he lives when they
                        become reconciled socially and politically to certain things. Then will this
                        new order of affairs work harmoniously. But forced upon the people before
                        they are prepared for it, it will be resisted and work inharmoniously. I
                        feel a conviction that forcing this matter upon the people, upon the
                        community, will result in the injury of both races, and the ruin of one or
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>God knows I have no desire but the good of the whole human race. I would it
                        were so that all you advocate could be done in the twinkling of an eye. But
                        it is not in the nature of things, and I do not assume or pretend to be
                        wiser than Providence, or stronger than the law of nature. Let us now seek
                        to discover the laws governing this question. There is a great law
                        controlling it. Let us endeavor to find out what that law is, and conform
                        our action to it.</p>
                    <p>All the details will then properly adjust themselves, and work out well in
                        the end. God knows that anything I can do I will do in the mighty process by
                        which the great end is to be reached. Anything I can do to elevate the
                        races, to soften and ameliorate their condition, I will do, and to be able
                        to do so is the sincere desire of my heart. I am glad to have met you, and
                        thank you for the compliment you have paid me.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--I have to return your kind thanks, Mr. President, for so kindly
                        granting us this interview. We did not come here expecting to argue this
                        question with your Excellency; but simply to state what were our views and
                        wishes in the premises. If we were disposed to argue the question, and you
                        would grant us permission, of course we would endeavor to controvert some of
                        the positions you have assumed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Downing--Mr. Douglass, I take it that the President, by his kind
                        expressions and his very full treatment of the subject, must have
                        contemplated some reply to the views which he has advanced, and in which we
                        certainly do not concur, and I say this with due respect.</p>
                    <p>The President--I thought you expected me to indicate, to some extent, what my
                        views were on the subject touched upon in your statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Downing--We are very happy indeed, to have heard them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--If the President will allow me I would like to say one or two
                        words in reply.</p>
                    <p>The President--What I have done is simply to indicate what my views are, as I
                        suppose you expected me to from your address.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--My own impression is that the very thing that your excellency
                        would avoid in the Southern States, can only be averted by the very measure
                        that we propose, and I would state to my brother delegates, that because I
                        perceive the President has taken strong ground in favor of a given policy,
                        and distrusting my own ability to remove any of those impressions which he
                        has expressed, I thought we had better end the interview with the expression
                        of our thanks. (Addressing the President) But, if your Excellency, would be
                        pleased to hear, I would like to say a word or two in regard to that one
                        matter of the enfranchisement of the black as a means of preventing the very
                        thing which your Excellency seems to apprehend--that is, a conflict of
                        races.</p>
                    <p>The President--I repeat, I merely wanted to vindicate my views in reply to
                        your address, and not to enter into any general controversy, as I could not
                        well do so under the circumstances. Your statement was a very frank one, and
                        I thought it was due to you to meet it in the same spirit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--Thank you, sir.</p>
                    <p>The President--I think you will find, so far as the South is concerned, that
                        if you will all inculcate their ideas in connection with your own, that the
                        colored people can live and advance in civilization to better advantage
                        elsewhere, than crowded together in the South. It would be better for them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--But the masters have the making of the laws, and we cannot get
                        away from the plantations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President--What prevents you?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--We have not the simple right of locomotion through the Southern
                        States now.</p>
                    <p>The President--If the master now controls him or his action, would he not
                        control him in his vote?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass--Let the negro once understand that he has a right to vote, and
                        he will raise a party in the Southern States among the poor, who will rally
                        with him. There is this conflict that you speak of between the wealthy
                        slaveholder and the poor man.</p>
                    <p>The President--You touch right upon the point there. There is this conflict,
                        and hence I suggest emigration. If he cannot get employment in the South, he
                        has it in his power to go where he can get it.</p>
                    <p>In parting the President said that they were both desirous of accomplishing
                        the same ends, but proposed to do so by following up different roads.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglass, on turning to leave, remarked to his fellow delegates, "The
                        President sends us to the people, and we will have to go and get the people
                        right."</p>
                    <p>The President--Yes, sir; I have great faith in the people. I believe they
                        will do what is just, and have no doubt they will settle this question
                        right, and hope that it will be submitted to them for final action.</p>
                    <p>The delegation then bowed and withdrew.</p>
