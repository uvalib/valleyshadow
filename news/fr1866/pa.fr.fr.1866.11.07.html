                    <p>The New York Nation closes a long article on the
                        election by the following well-timed remarks:</p>
                    <p>"The verdict has been given against the President. His past course is not
                        only condemned, but he is informed as plainly as possible that he must mend
                        his ways--that he is neither a leader or restorer, but simply a stop-gap.
                        What we want at this point is statesmen to take up the work of
                        reconstruction, botched though it be, and complete it on the great
                        principles which the country has once more affirmed. What we do not want is a bevy of sharp attorneys to distract
                        and rend the nation with a tedious and farcical but exciting trial, in which
                        we should wait and fret while counsel wrangled and chopped logic. We have a
                        two-thirds majority in both Houses. We can do whatever we think just and
                        expedient. Let us do it if need be over Mr. Johnson's head. He has now
                        received a solemn warning that he is to execute and not to legislate. Let us
                        see that he executes faithfully. Should he neglect or fail to do his duty
                        now, he will sin against the light, and we can then proceed to punish him,
                        with the consciousness that we have not taken him unawares, and that we have
                        not saddled him with duties to the discharge of which neither his education,
                        nor his head, nor his conscience is equal. To heal the wounds left by civil
                        war and lift millions of people out of bondage and darkness into liberty and
                        light, is the most sublime and awful task which was ever imposed on a
                        legislature. In a moment of weakness, or confusion, or thoughtlessness, we
                        all connived at or acquiesced in its assumption by one weak, ignorant, and
                        overelated man. He has failed miserably. Let us cast him
                        aside--contemptuously, if you will; but for mercy's sake do not let us treat
                        the world at such a crisis to the paltry and degrading spectacle of a whole
                        nation trying him judicially for having been presumptuous, conceited,
                        obstinate, uneducated, and for having passed the flower of his years as a
                        little village politician of a slave State. All this is his misfortune and
                        our shame, but no lawyer's tongue can ever make it a crime worthy of any
                        heavier penalty, if heavier penalty there be, than a nation's scorn and
                        rebuke.</p>

<b>The Trouble in Maryland</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors criticize Gov. Swann, of Maryland, for his disregard of the

                    rendered "the Union cause in the early part of the war," his subsequent betrayal
                    of those principles has greatly diminished the level of support for him.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gov. Swann, of Maryland, seems anxious to secure for himself a like fame with
                        Andrew Johnson. He is advancing with rapid strides over the same path to the
                        same goal, and has but a short way yet to travel. The pillory is before him
                        and in sight. If he has mistaken it for a shining goal he can blame no one
                        but himself, for it is surrounded with sufficient shame and ignominy to
                        enable any one to discern its true character. When once he has reached it,
                        and become the mock and scorn of the loyal people he has so foully betrayed
                        he will have time to reflect on a truth he had done well to consider before
                        he started on his course--"Corruption wins not more than honesty."</p>
                    <p>Gov. Swann was elected by the people of Maryland, not so much on account of
                        his ability, as in recognition of the service he had rendered the Union
                        cause in the early part of the war, and because the loyal people of the
                        State reposed entire confidence in his patriotism as a citizen and integrity
                        as a man. He had been identified with the struggle in Maryland ever since
                        treason attempted to drag the State from the Union, and had borne an
                        honorable part through it all. He was hated by the rebels of that State,
                        just as his illustrious prototype had been by the rebels of Tennessee, and
                        for the same reason. Of all others he seemed to be the man in whose hands
                        could be safely entrusted the interests of the State, and of her loyal
                        people. With a generous and grateful enthusiasm they elected him Governor,
                        only to find that their confidence had been misplaced, and that what they
                        had taken to be patriotism and integrity were but the meretricious
                        adornments of a political gambler. He has chosen a time to betray the men
                        who have been his friends and the friends of the government, when he thought
                        he could do them the most injury and himself the greatest service. The
                        object of his perfidy is the restoration of power of the men who attempted
                        in '61 to carry the State over to the Confederacy, and the consideration for
                        it is his promised political advancement. By a constitutional amendment,
                        adopted at the close of the war, all who had participated in the rebellion
                        were disfranchised and none were allowed to vote except such as would take
                        the oath of loyalty prescribed in the amendment. The strict enforcement of
                        the provisions of this amendment by means of a registry law resulted in
                        placing the power of the State in the hands of the loyal men. It is Gov.
                        Swann's purpose now to prevent a strict enforcement of the law, so that all
                        may vote and rebels henceforth be as potential at the ballot-box as loyal
                        men. To this end he has appointed registrars throughout the State of known
                        Rebel sympathies, and has directed them to put a "liberal construction" upon
                        the law, which is well understood by all to mean that they shall not regard
                        sympathy with treason as a disqualification, and that they shall virtually
                        nullify the laws.</p>
                    <p>In the city of Baltimore thousands were added to the lists of qualified
                        voters who had served in the armies of the Confederacy, and other thousands
                        who had been disqualified by reason of aid and comfort rendered to the
                        rebellion. At a recent election in that city, these registers were
                        disregarded by the Union election judges, and the votes of men who were
                        notoriously disloyal were rejected, in conformity with law. The displacement
                        of the Police Commissioners, who appointed the election judges, was
                        determined upon. Charges were preferred against them, and after a hearing
                        before the Governor, which was but a mockery of justice, the order for the
                        removal was published and their successors appointed. This proceeding was
                        had in the exercise of a very doubtful authority, and not only so, but in
                        utter disregard of established and recognized forms of justice. The charges
                        that had been preferred were not sustained by the evidence, but on the
                        contrary the efficiency and good conduct of the Police department was shown
                        by witnesses whose credibility and respectability could not be impeached.
                        The Commissioner determined not to yield to the decision of the Governor but
                        to appeal to the Courts, and, until by them adjudged guilty, to continue in
                        the exercise of their duties. The attempt was made by the Commissioners
                        appointed by the Governor on Saturday last to set up their authority, and
                        having been qualified by the Sheriff they proceeded to give their orders and
                        appoint their subordinates. They were at once arrested on the charge of
                        inciting to riot and disturbance, and in default of bail were committed to
                        jail by Judge Bond, who wisely decided that although he could not determine
                        their right to exercise the office, yet he was charged to a certain extent
                        with preserving the peace of the city, and was bound to issue the process of
                        the Court against men who were attempting to assert by violence claims,
                        which, if just, could be enforced at law.</p>
                    <p>A writ of habeus corpus was applied for and
                        obtained from an inferior court in behalf of the Commissioners, and served
                        upon the Warden of the jail, who it appears has three days in which to make
                        his return. Should he decline to make a return to this writ until the third
                        day, which seems probable, there will be no conflict of authority and
                        consequently no disturbance on the day of the election.</p>
                    <p>This action, taken by the regular Police Commissioners, in pursuance of law
                        will most probably defeat the perfidy of Gov. Swann and avert what seemed to
                        be an impending calamity. In his nefarious plot to subject the Union men of
                        Maryland to Rebel rule, Governor Swann has been advised and encouraged by
                        Andrew Johnson. He has not presumed to move a step in the matter except by
                        his counsel and direction, and what Swann has boldly attempted to execute in
                        Maryland was drafted and designed by his master in Washington. It was
                        contemplated at one time to use the military power of the United States for
                        the purpose of installing the new Commissioners and its assistance was
                        freely promised Gov. Swann. The manly and independent action of Judge Bond
                        in the matter makes it impossible for Mr. Johnson to redeem his promise. He
                        dare not interfere with the Courts. His usurpations must stop there and Gov.
                        Swann be taught how dangerous it is "to hang on princes' favors."</p>

<b>Senatorial Instructions</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors reiterate their justifications for the proposed reforms to the
                    system of selecting the Republican party's choice for Senator.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In order that no Republican may misunderstand the question of instructions
                        for U. S. Senator, we recapitulate the circumstances which made the party
                        desire it and the purposes the party have in view.</p>
                    <p>Before the election, the Republican candidate for Assembly voluntarily and
                        solemnly pledged himself to respect instructions made after the election,
                        and desired it not to be done during the contest lest it should endanger our
                        success. With this all were satisfied, and all who desire to observe good
                        faith are satisfied today.</p>
                    <p>The request for a Convention came from a large number of the leading and most
                        active Republicans of the county, and was not the result of the personal
                        desire or effort of any individual. It was moved in as a matter of justice
                        to the whole party, and if it shall advance any particular candidate for
                        Senator, it must be because the party honestly and earnestly desires to
                        promote the success of that candidate. It appealed to the people--the
                        highest tribunal of the party, and it could have no selfish or personal ends
                        to attain.</p>
                    <p>The Republican Committee, in the fullest meeting held for years, decided with
                        but one dissenting vote, to call for the expression of the preference of the
                        party for U. S. Senator, and the People of the party will express that
                        choice in their delegate elections on Saturday next. The right of the party
                        to express its preference for Congress, Assembly, Prothonotary and even
                        County Auditor is conceded by all, and its right to express its preference
                        for the most important office to be filled in the State, will not be denied
                        by honest and sane men.</p>
                    <p>The policy of instruction is not new in any part of the State or Nation. Our
                        ablest and best statesmen have been instructed, both before and after their
                        election, and none but those who have become abandoned to honor and virtue
                        have disregarded them when they came from the power that created them. The
                        People elect their representatives to obey their wishes and protect their
                        interests. They are the masters--the representatives the servants. They
                        confer honors and give expression to their interests, and the recipient of
                        their trust discharges his highest duty by official deference to their will.
                        Instructions can therefore be no reflection, in any degree, on a public
                        servant. On the contrary, the representative who desires to perform his
                        duty, will ever welcome an authoritative expression of the wishes of the
                        people who have delegated their power to him, so that he may be faithful to
                        his trust.</p>
                    <p>Instructions cannot be regarded as offensive to any candidate for U. S.
                        Senator who may not be preferred. Lancaster instructs for Mr. Stevens, but
                        surely that choice expresses no disrespect for, or want of confidence in,
                        Gov. Curtin, Col. Forney or Mr. Grow. If any candidate should feel aggrieved
                        because the Republicans of Franklin or Lancaster preferred one of the other
                        distinguished gentlemen named for the office, the offended candidate simply
                        demonstrates how utterly unworthy he is of the high honor to be conferred.</p>
                    <p>The assumption that to express a preference for U. S. Senator may prejudice
                        the interests of the border counties in the matter of damages, is not the
                        creation of an honest purpose. Who of the candidates for U. S. Senator
                        demands the support of this county for that high office, and threatens the
                        border with legislative failure if it is not given him? We cannot believe
                        that there are any such aspirants for a seat in the highest legislative
                        tribunal of the Republic. If there is one such, the people of Franklin would
                        spurn his pretensions and his bribe.</p>
                    <p>No honest Republican can have any distracting issue with his brethren on the
                        question of instructions. Republicans may honestly differ as to who should
                        be elected U. S. Senator, as they differ about lesser nominations, but when
                        the voice of the party is declared by its highest authority--the same
                        tribunal that determines the claims of every candidate for every other
                        office--all who do not mean to subvert its solemn judgement and defraud the
                        people of their noblest gift, will yield cordial obedience to the majesty of
                        their will. The weak and the corrupt may be bewildered by brief authority to
                        forgetfulness of the supreme power of the people, and insolent disregard of
                        their wishes, but their day of retribution must come, and he upon whom it
                        falls will be ground to powder.</p>

<b>Harrisburg</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Horace, the Repository's Harrisburg correspondent, relates that the chief
                    topic of discussion in the state capital is the "summary removal" of the
                    Baltimore Police Commission by Gov. Swann. Swann's actions are seen as a blatant
                    attempt on the part of the Democrats to "enable the rebels of Maryland to vote
                    and control the State of Maryland, in defiance of the Constitution and laws of
                    the State." In other news from Harrisburg, says Horace, a "cruel hoax" was
                    perpetrated in an attempt to discredit Col. Stumbaugh and undermine the attempts
                    to reform the selection process for Senator. Apparently, an address purporting
                    to come from Stumbaugh was sent to the offices of the Telegraph and inserted in
                    that journal. The piece "forbid" Stumbaugh's supporters from expressing "any
                    choice for the important office of U. S. Senator."<br>

                    expressing his views of the great question of re-construction and of the issue

                    the attention of McGrath who kept an eye on him, believing that he was the
