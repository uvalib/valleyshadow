<b>Another Veto! Civil Rights Denied to Loyal Men in Rebel States!</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A copy of President Johnson's veto of the Civil Rights Bill.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Senate of the United States:
                    </p>
                    <p>I regret that the bill which has passed both Houses of Congress, entitled "An
                        Act to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and
                        furnish the means of their vindication," contains provisions which I cannot
                        approve consistently with my sense of duty to the whole people, and my
                        obligations to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I am, therefore, constrained to return it to the Senate, the House in which
                        it originated, with my objections to its becoming a law. By the first
                        section of the bill all persons born in the United States, and not subject
                        to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are declared to be
                        citizens of the United States. This provision comprehends the Chinese of the
                        Pacific States, Indians subject to taxation, the people called Gipsies, as
                        well as the entire race designated as blacks, people of color, negroes,
                        mulattoes and persons of African blood.</p>
                    <p>Every individual of these races, born in the United States is by the bill
                        made a citizen of the United States. It does not propose to declare or
                        confer any other right of citizenship than "Federal citizenship." It does
                        not purport to give these classes of persons any status as citizens of States, except that which may result from
                        their status as citizens of the United States.
                        The power to confer the right of State citizenship is just as exclusively
                        with the several States as the power to confer the right of Federal
                        citizenship is with Congress. The right of Federal citizenship thus to be
                        conferred on the several excepted races before mentioned, is now for the
                        first time proposed to be given by law. If, as is claimed by many, all
                        persons who are native born are by virtue of the Constitution citizens of
                        the United States, the passage of the pending bill cannot be necessary to
                        make them such.</p>
                    <p>If, on the other hand, such persons are not citizens, as may be assumed from
                        the proposed legislation to make them such, the grave question presents
                        itself whether, when eleven of the thirty-six States are unrepresented in
                        Congress at this time, it is sound policy to make our entire colored
                        population, and all other excepted classes citizens of the United States.
                        Four millions of them have just emerged from slavery into freedom. Can it be
                        reasonably supposed that they possess the requisite qualifications to
                        entitle them to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United
                        States? Have the people of the several States expressed such a conviction?
                        It may also be asked whether it is necessary that they should be declared
                        citizens in order that they may be secured in the enjoyment of the civil
                        rights proposed to be conferred by the bill? Those rights are, by Federal as
                        well as State laws, secured to all domiciled aliens and foreigners, even
                        before the completion of the process of naturalization, and it may be safely
                        assumed that the same enactments are sufficient to give like protection and
                        benefits to those for whom this bill provides special legislation.</p>
                    <p>Besides, the policy of the Government, from its origin to the present time,
                        seems to have been that persons who are strangers to and unfamiliar with our
                        institutions and our laws, should pass through a certain probation, at the
                        end of which, before attaining the coveted privilege, they must give
                        evidence of their fitness to receive and to exercise the rights of citizens,
                        as contemplated by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The bill, in effect, proposes a discrimination against a large number of
                        intelligent, worthy and patriotic foreigners, and in favor of the negro, to
                        whom, after long years of bondage, the avenue of freedom and intelligence
                        have just now been suddenly opened. He must, of necessity, from his previous
                        unfortunate condition of servitude, be less informed as to the nature and
                        character of our institutions, than he who, coming from abroad, has, to some
                        extent, at least, familiarized himself with the principles of a Government
                        to which he voluntarily intrusts life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. Yet
                        it is now proposed, by a single legislative enactment, to confer the rights
                        of citizens upon all persons of African decent born within the extended
                        limits of the United States, while persons of foreign birth, who make our
                        land their home, must undergo a probation of five years, and can only then
                        become citizens upon proof that they are of good moral character, attached
                        to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well
                        disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.</p>
                    <p>The first section of the bill also contains an enumeration of the rights to
                        be enjoyed by these classes so made citizens in every State and Territory of
                        the United States. These rights are to make and enforce contracts, to sue,
                        be parties and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and
                        convey real estate and personal property, and to have full and equal benefit
                        of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is
                        now enjoyed by white citizens. So, too, they are made subject to the same
                        punishment, pains and penalties in common with white citizens, and to none
                        others. Thus a perfect equality of the white and colored race is attempted
                        to be fixed by Federal law in every State of the Union over the vast field
                        of State jurisdiction covered by these enumerated rights. In no one of these
                        can any State exercise any power of discrimination between the different
                        races. In the exercise of State policy over matters exclusively affecting
                        the people of each State, it has frequently been thought expedient to
                        discriminate between the two races.</p>
                    <p>By the statute of some of the States, Northern as well as Southern, it is
                        enacted, for instance, that no white person shall intermarry with a negro or
                        mulatto. Chancellor Kent says, speaking of blacks, "that marriages between
                        them and the whites are forbidden in some of the States where slavery does
                        not exist, and they are prohibited in all the slave-holding States; and when
                        not absolutely contrary to law, they are revolting, and regarded as an
                        offense against public decorum." I do not say that this bill repeals State
                        laws on the subject of marriage between the two races, for as the whites are
                        forbidden to intermarry with the blacks, the blacks can only make such
                        contracts as the whites themselves are allowed to make, and therefore
                        cannot, under this bill, enter into the marriage contracts with the whites.</p>
                    <p>I cite this discrimination, however, as an instance of the State policy as to
                        discrimination, and to inquire whether, if Congress can abrogate all State
                        laws of discrimination between the two races in the matter of real estate,
                        of suits, and of contracts generally, Congress may not also repeal the State
                        laws as to the contract of marriage between the races? Hitherto every
                        subject embraced in the enumeration of rights contained in this bill has
                        been considered as exclusively belonging to the States; they all relate to
                        the internal policy and economy of the respective States. They are matters
                        which, in each State, concern the domestic condition of its people, varying
                        in each according to its own peculiar circumstances and the safety and
                        well-being of its own citizens.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to say that upon all these subjects there are not Federal
                        restraints. As for instance, in the State power of legislation over
                        contracts, there is a Federal limitation that no State shall pass a law
                        impairing the obligations of contracts; and as to crimes that no State shall
                        pass an expost facto law; to money that no State
                        shall make anything but gold and silver a legal tender. But where can we
                        find a Federal prohibition against the power of any State to discriminate as
                        to most of them, between aliens and citizens, between artificial persons,
                        called corporations, and national persons, in the right to hold real estate.</p>
                    <p>If it be granted that Congress can repeal all State laws discriminating
                        between whites and blacks in the subjects covered by this bill, why, it may
                        be asked, may not Congress repeal, in the same way, all those laws
                        discriminating between the two races on the subject of suffrage and office.
                        If Congress can declare, by law, who shall hold lands, who shall testify,
                        who shall have capacity to make a contract in a State, then Congress can by
                        law also declare who, without regard to race or color, shall have the right
                        to sit as a juror or as a judge, to hold any office, and finally to vote, in
                        every State and Territory of the United States. As respects the Territories,
                        they come within the power of Congress, for as to them the law-making power
                        is the Federal power; but as to the States, no similar provision exists,
                        vesting in Congress the power to make rules and regulations for them.</p>
                    <p>The object of the second section of the bill is to afford discriminative
                        protection to colored persons in the full enjoyment of all the rights
                        secured to them. By the preceding section it declares that "any person who,
                        under color of the law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, shall
                        subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State or territory
                        to the deprivation of any right secured or protected by this act, or to
                        different punishment, pains or penalties, on account of such person having
                        at any time been held in a condition of slavery, or involuntary servitude,
                        except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly
                        convicted, or by reason of his color or race than is prescribed for the
                        punishment of white persons, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on
                        conviction shall be punished by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or
                        imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both in the discretion of the
                        court."</p>
                    <p>This section seems to be designed to apply to some existing or future law of
                        a State or Territory, which may conflict with the provisions of the bill now
                        under consideration. It provides for counteracting such forbidden
                        legislation by imposing a fine and imprisonment upon the legislators who may
                        pass such conflicting laws, or upon the officers or agents who shall put or
                        attempt to put them into execution. It means an official offense, not a
                        common crime committed against law upon the person or property of the black
                        man. Such an act may deprive the black man of his property, but not of the
                        right to hold property. It means a deprivation of this right itself, either
                        by the State judiciary or the State Legislature. It is, therefore, assumed
                        that, under this section, members of State Legislatures who should vote for
                        laws conflicting with the provisions of this bill, that judges of the State
                        courts who should render judgements in antagonism with its terms, and that
                        marshals and sheriffs who should, as ministerial officers, execute processes
                        sanctioned by State laws and issued by State judges in execution of their
                        judgements, could be brought before other tribunals, and there subjected to
                        fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duties which such State
                        laws might impose.</p>
                    <p>The legislation thus imposed invades the judicial power of the State. It says
                        to every State court or judge, "If you decide that this act is
                        unconstitutional; if you refuse, under the prohibition of a State, to allow
                        a negro to testify; if you hold that, over such a subject matter, the State
                        law is paramount, and under color of a State law refuse the exercise of the
                        right to the negro, your error of judgement, however conscientious, shall
                        subject you to fine and imprisonment." I do not apprehend that the
                        conflicting legislation, which the bill seems to contemplate, is likely to
                        occur as to render if necessary at this time to adopt a measure of such
                        doubtful constitutionality.</p>
                    <p>In the next place this provision of the bill seems to be unnecessary, as
                        adequate judicial remedies could be adopted to secure the desired end
                        without involving the immunities of Legislatures always important to be
                        preserved in the interest of public liberty, without assailing the
                        independence of the judiciary, always essential to the preservation of
                        individual rights, and without impairing the efficiency of ministerial
                        officers, always necessary for the maintenance of public peace and order.
                        The remedy proposed by this section seems to be in this respect not only
                        anomalous, but unconstitutional, for the Constitution guaranties nothing
                        with certainty if it does not insure to the several States the right of
                        making and executing laws in regard to all matters arising in their
                        jurisdiction, subject only to the restriction that in cases of conflict with
                        the Constitution and constitutional laws of the United States, the latter
                        should be held to be the supreme law of the land.</p>
                    <p>The third section gives the District Courts of the United States exclusive
                        "cognizances of all crimes and offences committed against the provisions of
                        this act," and concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Courts of the United
                        States of all civil and criminal cases affecting persons who are denied or
                        cannot enforce in the Courts or judicial tribunals of the State or locality
                        wherever they may be, any of the rights secured to them by the first
                        section; and the construction which I have given to the second section is
                        strengthened by this third section, for it makes clear what kind of denial
                        or deprivation of the rights secured to them by the first section was in
                        contemplation. It is a denial or deprivation of such rights "in the courts
                        or judicial tribunals of the State." It stands therefore, clear of doubt
                        that the offense and penalties provided in the second section are intended
                        for the State judge who, in the clear exercise of his functions as a judge,
                        not acting ministerially but judicially, shall decide contrary to this
                        Federal law.</p>
                    <p>In other words, when a State judge, acting upon a question involving a
                        conflict between a State law and a Federal law, and bound according to his
                        own judgement and responsibility, to give an impartial decision between the
                        two, comes to the conclusion that the State law is valid and the Federal law
                        is invalid, he must not follow the dictates of his own judgement, at the
                        peril of fine and imprisonment. The legislative department of the Government
                        of the United States thus takes from the judicial department of the States
                        the sacred and exclusive duty of judicial decision, and converts the State
                        Judge into a mere ministerial officer, bound to decide according to the will
                        of Congress.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that in the States which deny to persons whose rights are secured
                        by the first section of the bill any one of these rights, all criminal and
                        civil cases affecting them, will, by the provision of the third section come
                        under the exclusive cognizance of the Federal tribunals. It follows that if
                        in any State which denies to a colored person any one of all those rights,
                        that person should commit a crime against the laws of the State, murder,
                        arson, rape, or any other crime, all protection or punishment through the
                        courts of the State are taken away, and he can only be tried and punished in
                        the Federal courts. How is the criminal to be tried if the offense is
                        provided for and punished by Federal law, that law and not the State law is
                        to govern.</p>
                    <p>It is only when the offense does not happen to be within the purview of
                        Federal law that the Federal Courts are to try and punish him. Under any
                        other law, then resort is to be had to the common law as modified and
                        changed by State legislation, so far as the same is not inconsistent with
                        the Constitution and laws of the United States. So that over this vast
                        domain of criminal jurisprudence, provided by each State for the protection
                        of its own citizens, and for the punishment of all persons who violate its
                        criminal laws, Federal law, wherever it can be made to apply, displaces
                        State law.</p>
                    <p>The question here naturally arises, from what source Congress derives the
                        power to transfer to Federal tribunals certain classes of cases embraced in
                        this section? The Constitution expressly declares that the judicial power of
                        the United States shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under
                        this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which
                        shall be made under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors,
                        other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime
                        jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;
                        to controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of
                        another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the
                        same State claiming land under grants of different States; and between a
                        State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.</p>
                    <p>Here the judicial power of the United States is expressly set forth and
                        defined, and the act of September 24th, 1789, establishing the judicial
                        courts of the United States, in conferring upon the Federal courts
                        jurisdiction over cases originating in State tribunals, is careful to
                        confine them to the classes enumerated in the above-recited clause of the
                        Constitution. This section of the bill undoubtedly comprehends cases and
                        authorizes the exercise of powers that are not, by the Constitution, within
                        the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. To transfer them to
                        those courts would be an exercise of authority well calculated to excite
                        distrust and alarm on the part of all the States, for the bill applies alike
                        to all of them, as well to those that have not been engaged in rebellion. It
                        may be assumed that this authority is incident to the power granted to
                        Congress by the Constitution, as recently amended, to enforce, by
                        appropriate legislation, the article declaring that neither slavery nor
                        involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party
                        shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any
                        place subject to their jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>It cannot, however, be justly claimed that, with a view to the enforcement of
                        this article of the Constitution, there is at present any necessity for the
                        exercise of all the powers which this bill confers. Slavery has been
                        abolished, and at present nowhere exists within the jurisdiction of the
                        United States, nor has there been, nor is it likely there will be, any
                        attempt to renew it by the people or the States. If, however, any such
                        attempt shall be made, it will become the duty of the General Government to
                        exercise any and all incidental powers necessary and proper to maintain
                        inviolate the great law of freedom.</p>
                    <p>The fourth section of the bill provides that officers and agents of the
                        Freedmen's Bureau shall be empowered to make arrests, and also that other
                        officers may be specially commissioned for that purpose by the President of
                        the United States. It also authorizes circuit courts of the United States
                        and the superior courts of the Territories, to appoint, without limitation,
                        commissioners, who are to be charged with the performance of quasi-judicial
                        duties.</p>
                    <p>The fifth section empowers the commissioners, so to be selected by the
                        Courts, to appoint in writing under their hands, one or more suitable
                        persons, from time to time, to execute warrants and other prosecutions
                        desired by the bill. These numerous official agents are made to constitute a
                        sort of police in addition to the military, and are authorized to summons a
                            posse commitatus, and even to call to their
                        aid such portions of the land and naval forces of the United States, or of
                        the militia, as may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which
                        they are charged. This extraordinary power is to be conferred upon agents
                        irresponsible to the Government, and to the people to whose number the
                        discretion of the commissioners is the only limit, and in whose hands such
                        authority might be made a terrible engine of wrong, oppression and fraud.</p>
                    <p>The general statutes regulating the land and naval forces of the United
                        States, the militia, and the execution of the laws, are believed to be
                        adequate for every emergency which can occur in time of peace. If it should
                        prove otherwise Congress can at any time amend those laws in such a manner
                        as, while subserving the public welfare, not to jeopardize the rights,
                        interests and liberties of the people.</p>
                    <p>The seventh section provides that a fee of ten dollars be paid to each
                        commissioner in every case brought before him, and a fee of five dollars to
                        his deputy or deputies for each person he or they may arrest and take before
                        any such commissioner, with such other fees as may be deemed reasonable by
                        such commissioner in general for performing such other duties as may be
                        required in the premises. All these fees are to be paid out of the Treasury
                        of the United States, whether there is conviction or not; but in case of a
                        conviction they are to be recoverable from the defendant. It seems to me
                        that under the influence of such temptation bad men might convert any law,
                        however beneficent, into an instrument of persecution and fraud.</p>
                    <p>By the eighth section of the bill, the United States Courts, which sit only
                        in one place for white citizens, must migrate, the marshal and district
                        attorney, and necessarily the clerk, although he is not mentioned, to any
                        part of the district, upon the order of the President, and there hold a
                        court, for the purpose of the more speedy arrest and trial of persons
                        charged with a violation of this act; and there the judge and the officers
                        of the Court must remain, on the order of the President, for the time
                        designated. The ninth section authorizes the President, or any such person
                        as he may empower for that purpose to employ such part of the land or naval
                        forces of the United States, or of the militia, as shall be necessary to
                        prevent the violation and enforce the due execution of this act. This
                        language seems to imply an important military force, that is to be always at
                        hand, and whose only business is to be the enforcement of this measure over
                        the vast region where it is intended to operate.</p>
                    <p>I do not propose to consider the policy of this bill. To me the details of
                        the bill are fraught with evil. The white race and the black race of the
                        South have hitherto lived together under the relation of master and
                        slave--capital owning labor. Now, suddenly, that relation is changed; and as
                        to ownership, capital and labor are divorced. They stand now each master of
                        itself, in this new relation one being necessary to the other.</p>
                    <p>There will be a new adjustment, which both are deeply interested in making
                        harmonious. Each has equal power in settling the forms, and if left to the
                        laws that regulate capital and labor, it is confidently believed that they
                        will satisfactorily work out the problem. Capital, it is true, has more
                        intelligence, but labor is never so ignorant as not to know its own value,
                        and not to see that capital must pay that value.</p>
                    <p>This bill frustrates that adjustment; it intervenes between capital and
                        labor, and attempts to settle the questions of political economy through the
                        agency of numerous officials, whose interest it will be to ferment discord
                        between the two races, so far as the breach widens their employment will
                        continue, and when it is closed, their occupation will terminate in all our
                        history, in all our experience, as a people living under Federal and State
                        law. No such system as that contemplated by the details of this bill has
                        ever before been proposed or adopted to establish for the security of the
                        colored race safeguards which go infinitely, beyond any that the General
                        Government has ever provided for the white race. In fact, the distinction of
                        race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and
                        against the white race.</p>
                    <p>They interfere with the municipal legislation of the States, with the
                        relations existing exclusively between a State and its citizens, or between
                        inhabitants of the same State, an absorption and assumption of power by the
                        General Government which, if acquiesced in, must sap or destroy our
                        federated system of limited powers, and break down the barriers which
                        preserve the rights of the States. It is another step or rather stride
                        towards centralization, and the concentration of all legislative powers in
                        the National Government. The tendency of the bill must be to resuscitate the
                        spirit of rebellion and to arrest the progress of those influences which are
                        more closely drawing around the States the bonds of union and peace.</p>
                    <p>My lamented predecessor, in his proclamation of the 1st of January, 1863,
                        ordered and declared that all persons held as slaves within certain States
                        and parts of States, therein designated, were and thenceforward should be
                        free; and further, that the Executive Government of the United States,
                        including the military and naval authorities thereof, would recognize and
                        maintain the freedom of such persons. This guaranty has been rendered
                        especially obligatory and sacred by the amendment of the Constitution
                        abolishing slavery throughout the United States. I therefore fully recognize
                        the obligation to protect and defend that class of our people whenever and
                        wherever it shall become necessary, and to the full extent compatible with
                        the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Entertaining these sentiments, it only remains for me to say that I will
                        cheerfully co-operate with Congress in any measure that may be necessary for
                        the promotion of the civil rights of the freedmen, as well as those of all
                        classes of persons throughout the United States by judicial process, under
                        equal and impartial laws, in conformity with the provisions of the Federal
                        Constitution. I now return the bill to the Senate, and regret that in
                        considering the bills and joint resolutions, forty-five in number, which
                        have been thus far submitted for my approval, I am compelled to withhold my
                        assent from a second measure that has reached the sanction of both Houses of
                        Congress.<br> ANDREW JOHNSON.<br> WASHINGTON, D.C., MARCH 27.</p>

<b>Another Blow At Freedom</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors criticize the President for his decision to veto the Civil
                    Rights Bill, despite the fact that the legislation passed both the Senate and
                    House of Representatives by decisive margins. Despite Johnson's claims
                    otherwise, they declare, the bill does not propose to confer any "extraordinary
                    rights" to blacks, rather it simply calls on the government to protect their
                    "natural rights" as citizens.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 2d of February last the U. S. Senate passed a bill to protect the
                        civil rights of all classes of people in the several States, by the decisive
                        vote of 33 to 12--5 not voting, who would have added 3 to the minority and 2
                        to the majority. A full Senate would thus have given 35 votes for the bill
                        and 15 against it. On the 13th of March the bill was passed finally in the
                        House by the decisive vote of 111 to 38--34 not voting, 26 of whom are Union
                        and 8 Democratic. The House had made some material amendments to the bill,
                        and when it returned to the Senate on the 15th of March, it was passed
                        finally without a call of the yeas and nays. In the Senate the Union
                        Senators voted solid for the bill, excepting Van Winkle, of W. Va., and
                        Nesmith, of Oregon. It will thus be seen that even the most of the Union
                        Senators who sustained the President in his veto of the Freedmen's bill,
                        voted for the passage of the Civil Rights bill.</p>
                    <p>Giving, as we do, the message in full in our columns to-day, it is needless
                        to discuss the veto touching either its fundamental doctrine or its details.
                        Its foundation stone is given in a single sentence, wherein he says that
                        "the grave question presents itself whether, where
                            eleven of the thirty-six States are unrepresented in Congress at this
                            time, it is sound policy to make our entire colored population
                        and all other excepted classes, citizens of the United States,"--an awkward
                        attempt to revamp the monstrous doctrine of Taney, that negroes have no
                        rights which a white man is bound to respect. The objections in detail may
                        be summed up in another single sentence from the message, in which he says
                        that "this bill, in effect, proposes a discrimination against large numbers
                        of intelligent, worthy, and patriotic foreigners, and in favor of the negro,
                        to whom, after long years of bondage, the avenues of freedom and
                        intelligence have just now been suddenly opened"--a declaration that might
                        have come with some fitness from a Five Points' ward orator, addressing the
                        "intelligent, worthy and patriotic foreigners" who inaugurated the negro
                        riots of 1863. It is just barely possible, judging from this feature of the
                        veto, that President Johnson has learned some time within the past four
                        years, that the negro was treated as a citizen when troops were wanted to
                        protect him from rebel vengeance within the fortifications of Nashville, and
                        that the "intelligent, worthy and patriotic foreigners," were not then
                        treated as citizens and took no part in the struggle for the life of the
                        Republic unless it was done voluntarily; but if so, it has certainly escaped
                        his memory. The negro owed allegiance to our government, and was called upon
                        to mingle his blood with the white to defend a common nationality, while the
                        foreigner was regarded as owing allegiance to another government until he
                        established his citizenship in accordance with the laws of the country.</p>
                    <p>Bear in mind that the Civil Rights bill just vetoed did not propose to confer
                        any conventional or extraordinary rights upon the negro. It provided for
                        protecting him in natural rights of the citizen only--in life, liberty and
                        property. It gives him in the rebel States just the same
                            rights he now enjoys in Pennsylvania, and much less than he now
                        enjoys in many of the Northern States. It guaranteed to him only the power
                        "to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties to suits, give evidence,
                        to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal
                        property, and to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for
                        the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens." This
                        is the sum and substance of the offense of the Civil Rights bill, and for
                        this it is pronounced by a President of the United States, in the style and
                        with the animus of the lowest type of the petty demagogue, an "attempt" to
                        consummate "a perfect equality of the white and black
                            races in every State in the Union." This perfect equality
                        consists in allowing the negro to own and sell such property as his industry
                        may acquire; to make and enforce contracts for the compensation of his own
                        labor; to be a witness in courts composed of white judges and jurors and
                        thus give his humble aid in the administration of justice, and to protect
                        his person and his household from violence or wrong. Beyond this, under the
                        bill in question, he would be in the rebel States, as he is in Pennsylvania,
                        a mere hewer of wood and drawer of water; taxed without representation and
                        his life pledged for the defence of the government in whose direction he is
                        denied the right of the ballot.</p>
                    <p>But there is an omission in the veto message that is as deceptive to the
                        uninformed mind, as the groveling appeal against negro equality is intended
                        to be with the cultivated prejudices of large classes, who seem to consider
                        themselves so poorly endowed that the negro may outstrip them in the race of
                        progress and ambition. The Civil Rights bill was not intended any more for
                        the protection of four millions of emancipated slaves than for the million
                        or more of whites in the rebel States who are obnoxious to the charge of
                        devotion to the unity of the Republic. In every State lately in rebellion
                        there are thousands of whites who maintained their loyalty even in the
                        darkest days which shadowed our flag, and they are now as effectually
                        ostracized in most of the insurgent States, as the despised freedmen. Many
                        of them, indeed most of them, are and always were, poor and had not been
                        brutalized into treason by exercising the lordly master's prerogatives over
                        his slaves; and their fidelity to the Union is now deemed a crowning crime
                        by the State authorities which have been brought into being by the
                        President. We beg to remind Andrew Johnson that there are many such in
                        Tennessee; that but few shared his good fortune to command armies to protect
                        themselves while maintaining their loyalty with their lives in constant
                        peril; that they had not strong fortification and body-guards and army corps
                        to keep them from dangling to the trees for the amusement of "erring
                        brethren," as had Andrew Johnson when he exercised the duties of Military
                        Governor and administered the laws just as far as the Union armies held
                        possession of the territory of the State. The present Governor of the State,
                        who varied his experience in Tennessee between rebel prisons, repeated rebel
                        attempts upon his life to receive the price upon his head, and occasional
                        peace and protection with the Military Governor in Nashville, has but a few
                        weeks ago declared that the rebels are rapidly regaining their supremacy in
                        the State under the policy of the President; and that in many sections, all
                        the local officers being defiant rebels, no Union man is safe in either
                        person or property. The same fiends who would have hung Andrew Johnson two
                        years ago, and who now have him bewildered with their fatal friendship, turn
                        with renewed malignity against the humble Union men of Tennessee who are
                        without the protection of the law, because they feel warranted in so doing
                        by the treachery of the man who reached the Chief Magistracy of the nation,
                        by the votes of loyal men sorely tried and sadly bereaved by treason.</p>
                    <p>The message has but one lesson, or rather a repetition of many less positive
                        lessons of the past. President Johnson has resolved to make all perfidy of
                        history pale before his own, and to espouse the cause of copperheads and
                        rebels to the uttermost. Treason with him has ceased to be a crime, and must
                        be henceforth rewarded with honor and power rather than be punished and made
                        infamous; and he seems determined to pursue his madness until the nation
                        shall drink the bitter cup of humiliation and woe to the very dregs. But we
                        do not despair of the Republic. The patriotic People who have saved it in
                        its past perils will not falter in their holy duty now. Alike in behalf of
                        the hopeful living and the martyred dead, they will maintain Justice and
                        Freedom in every struggle, and doom to ignominy and shame the traitors who
                        have so causelessly made every household mourn.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>OUR Harrisburg correspondent foreshadows the probable plan to be adopted by
                        President Johnson to defeat the Union men in Pennsylvania next fall. The
                        chief instrument in this grateful work will be the Hon. Edgar Cowan, who was
                        elected by the Union men to the United States Senate. He is to dispense the
                        patronage of the President so as to compass the demoralization of the Union
                        ranks if possible. Like Johnson he is to practice the hypocrisy of
                        professing to be in and of the Union party, in order the more effectually to
                        deceive, distract and weaken the loyal men. Appeals will be made to the
                        ambition and cupidity of Union men on every hand, and political honors and
                        emoluments will be proffered with a lavish hand to such as may prove weak
                        enough to do like Post Master Cleaveland, of Connecticut--wear the Union
                        uniform and vote the copperhead ticket. It is not yet certain just what the
                        President and his debauched Senator will present as their plan of
                        operations. If it will promise the more certainly to elect Mr. Clymer
                        Governor, a convention of office-holders and quasi Unionists with copperhead variations will be held and Mr.
                        Cowan will be nominated for Governor; and similar nominations will be made
                        in debateable Congressional districts where a sufficient number of Union
                        camp followers can be gathered together to go through the motions of forming
                        tickets. This plan was well thought of some weeks ago; but since then the
                        Clymer leaders, who really own and manage the Cowan and Johnson side-show,
                        fear that the concern is so wanting in attractions that nobody would
                        patronize it, and they will in the end be compelled to do as they have done
                        in Connecticut--go over body and breeches to the copperheads and vote their
                        ticket.</p>
                    <p>We don't object to Mr. Cowan supporting and voting the copperhead ticket. It
                        is most natural that he should do so. He is the creature of the President,
                        the President is the creature of the copperheads and rebels, and Cowan but
                        works the thing out to a logical result; but we shall object to any such
                        desecration of the Union name and flag to shelter the deliberate treachery
                        they contemplate against the Union party. They have but one aim--to
                        demoralize, to divide, to betray, to destroy it. Let the Union men be
                        fore-warned and they will be fore-armed. Their only safety is in their
                        unfaltering integrity; in the most faithful devotion to principle. If they
                        shall be true to their vital principles, the People will be true to
                        themselves and to their country, and copperheads and treacherous Unionists
                        will share the common fate of all enemies of Freedom and Justice in the
                        loyal States.</p>

                    <p>SKETCH OF THE 21st PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY--We have received a pamphlet written
                        by Mr. J. D. Hartman, son of the Rev. D. Hartman, now of Salona, Clinton
                        county, containing a "Resume of the Travels and Doings of the 21st Penna.
                        Cavalry while in the U. S. Service," from which we make up the following
                        sketch of its history. It is our design to give as complete a history of
                        every regiment or company from Franklin county as we can gather, and for
                        that purpose have at present on our table the diary of an officer of the
                        77th Regiment, giving the incidents of one of the many campaigns of that
                        veteran regiment, and "we expect to receive from the same officer the
                        materials for a complete history of that organization. We hope to be
                        assisted in preserving the record of Franklin county in the war by many of
                        the officers and soldiers who went out to battle for the Union.</p>
                    <p>The 21st Penna. Cavalry, after having served as six months volunteers, was
                        re-organized at this place, on the 21st day of February, 1864, and lay
                        encamped about four miles from town, near Back Creek, on the Bedford Pike,
                        until the 16th of May, 1864, when it was ordered to the front. Taking up the
                        line of march to Washington, the regiment encamped the first night at
                        Gettysburg, Pa., the second night at Frederick, Md., and at the end of the
                        third day had reached their destination. After marching through Georgetown
                        and Washington, with colors flying and band playing, they took up their
                        quarters at camp Stoneman. The next morning the regiment was ordered to
                        embark at Giesboro Point, Md., for Belle Plain landing, Va., but the order
                        was afterwards countermanded and they were marched back again to Camp
                        Stoneman. Many were the surmises as to the reason of the order being
                        countermanded, but it became apparent in a few days, and is explained by a
                        stanza from a ballad of the 21st, written by an officer of the regiment:</p>
                    <p>"We left the town of Chambersburg our journey to pursue,<br> A regiment of
                        cavalry of soldiers brave and true,<br> And as we marched to Washington our
                        hearts were light and gay,<br> But there we were dismounted on the 21st of
                        May."</p>
                    <p>On the 22d, the regiment marched, as "flat-foot cavalry," from Camp Stoneman
                        to Camp Chase, on Arlington Heights, were they received their infantry
                        equipments and the thanks of the War Department for submitting so quietly to
                        the change. If the truth must be told, however, growl after growl, and curse
                        after curse, were uttered in consequence, though the men were consoled with
                        the idea that the change was only temporary--sixty or ninety days--and that
                        they were to be used only as guards for wagon trains, forts, &amp;c. Mr.
                        Hartman says they did guard forts as infantry, but they were required to
                        take them first. On the morning of the 23d the regiment was marched to
                        Alexandria, about seven miles distant, and over very muddy roads, where it
                        was embarked on board three steamers and conveyed down the Potomac and up
                        the Rappahannock to Port Royal, with the exception of Co. D, Capt.
                        Hollinger, which was on detached service at Pottsville, Pa. From Port Royal
                        the regiment was marched to join the army of the Potomac, encamping the
                        first night on the banks of a small creek near Newtown, Va., on the second
                        night at the Mattapony river, and on the third at the Pamunky, joining the
                        army next day at Old Church, near Cold Harbor.</p>
                    <p>The regiment was attached to the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps, and
                        the next day, being the 3rd of June, participated in the famous and bloody
                        battle of Cold Harbor. Almost the very first shells thrown into the regiment
                        by the enemy killed Lieut. Richard Waters, of Co. E, and the 21st suffered
                        severely in this engagement, losing 57 men killed and wounded in a single
                        charge. It was in this battle Col. Wm. H. Boyd, commanding the regiment, was
                        so severely wounded in the neck, while sitting on a log coolly surveying the
                        rebel lines through his field glass. Many other officers were wounded.</p>
                    <p>After fighting all day under a galling flank fire, and without anything to
                        eat, or drink, the men were relieved about 7 P. M., and taken to the rear,
                        where they drew rations and rested for the night, expecting to go again in
                        the morning. The next morning, however, on being taken down to the place it
                        was found the rebels had left, evacuating the ground they had held so
                        stubbornly the day before. From this place the regiment was marched to
                        Gaines' Mill, which they reached at sunrise after marching the whole night,
                        and after two days were moved to the Chickahomeny river, from which again
                        they moved on the 12th of June, with the grand army, to Petersburg, Va., the
                        front of which was reached after a long and tiresome march of four days. The
                        21st participated in the battle in front of Petersburg of the 18th of June,
                        behaving gallantly, and losing many men killed and wounded. Among the latter
                        was Major Gillis, wounded in the knee, Lt. Col. Mossen and several other
                        officers. On the afternoon of the 23d the regiment again participated in a
                        heavy battle on the Jerusalem plank road, losing only three men and one
                        officer wounded, and none killed. A day or two after this last battle
                        occurred an epoch in the history of the 21st, two days rations of soft bread
                        and onions being dealt out to the men, the former a luxury which they had
                        not tasted since leaving Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>After the battle of the 21st of June the men worked on the forts and other
                        fortifications for some weeks, but on the evening of the 29th of July were
                        ordered to hold themselves in readiness for a fight. On the next day, the
                        30th of July, 1864, a day ever memorable in the history of Chambersburg for
                        our great calamity, and equally famous, as our readers will remember, as the
                        day when a mined rebel fort was blown into the air, and a great battle
                        ensued disastrous to the Union arms by the mistakes of one of our generals,
                        which was participated in by the 21st. On the 18th of August one division of
                        the 5th Corps struck the Weldon Railroad at the Yellow House, the 21st
                        cavalry alone tearing up and destroying three miles of the road, while the
                        other portions of the division repelled the foe. Gen. Beauregard swore he
                        would re-take the road, or drive his men to hell in the attempt, and on the
                        22d attacked our forces, a brigade of rebels charging this regiment, with
                        poor success. In this engagement, which lasted from 1 P. M. until dark, the
                        21st lost 27 men wounded and two or three killed, no officers. After this
                        battle the men were again put to work building forts, breastworks and
                        batteries, and for a while did nothing but dig, chop and shovel.</p>
                    <p>At this time, and for a long time before, the 21st was commanded by Major O.
                        B. Knowles, of the 3d Battalion. About the 1st of September it was
                        transferred to the 3d Brigade of the Division. This brigade was made up of
                        the 21st Cavalry and the 187th P.V., and was commanded by Major Knowles. A
                        few days later the 187th were ordered to Pennsylvania and this regiment
                        alone constituted the 3d Brigade.</p>
                    <p>On the 30th of September the 3d Brigade, including the 187th, participated in
                        the battle of Poplar Grove Church, driving the rebel line and capturing some
                        prisoners and six guns, with a loss in the 21st of only eleven men. After
                        being relieved, the regiment was again ordered to the "front" on the evening
                        of the same day, and were taken into a large field and there ordered to lie
                        down. Soon afterward the rebels came in sight and fired a volley, which had
                        but little effect. Seeing they could not drive our men from their position
                        in that way they soon withdrew, and the 21st was relieved and marched back
                        to the place where they had rested the night before.</p>
                    <p>It was now rumored about camp that the men were to be mounted. The same
                        ballad quoted above says:</p>
                    <p>"Now we've been dismounted about six months or more,<br> And always did our
                        duty on old Virginia's shore,<br> But soon we'll have our horses, for we
                        have seen the worst,<br> And be no more flat-foot cavalry, but the mounted
                        21st."</p>
                    <p>And on the 16th of October the regiment received their horses and cavalry
                        equipments and went to the front again "the mounted 21st." They were
                        attached to the 3rd Brigade, Colonel Charles Smith, 1st Maine Cavalry
                        commanding, of the 2d Division of Cavalry, Gen. Gregg. On the 27th the
                        regiment participated in the Battle of Hatcher's Run, at first with some
                        success, driving the rebels and taking some 80 prisoners and 15 wagons
                        loaded with old pork and corn meal, but were afterwards compelled to fall
                        back, losing a great many men in killed, wounded and prisoners.</p>
                    <p>After this the regiment went into winter quarters. About the 1st of March
                        following it was transferred to the 2nd Brigade, Gen. Gregg commanding, and
                        about the middle of the month was joined by Co. D from Pottsville. When Gen.
                        Sheridan took charge of the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac, three
                        companies of the 21st--D, K, and C--were detailed as escort. The 21st was in
                        the grand and last campaign of the army, under Gen. Sheridan, until after
                        Lee's surrender, when it was sent to Danville, N. C., and soon afterward to
                        Lynchburg, Va., and the adjoining Court Houses to do guard duty. On the 8th
                        of July an order came to muster the regiment out of the service, which was
                        done on the 10th. The next day it started home, arriving at City Point on
                        the 13th and at Baltimore and Harrisburg on the 18th of July, 1865.</p>
