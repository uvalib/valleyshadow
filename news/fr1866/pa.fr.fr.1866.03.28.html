<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the editors, any pretense that President Johnson is not a

                    his decision to openly endorse the Democrats in Connecticut.<br>

                    <p>The bill to protect all persons in their civil rights and to furnish the
                        means for their vindication, has passed both houses of Congress and only
                        requires the signature of the President to become a law. As a good many
                        anticipate a veto of the act, its important provisions are herewith given:
                        The first section is as follows: All persons born in the United States and
                        not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians, not taxed, are hereby
                        declared to be citizens of the United States; and such citizens of every
                        race and color without regard to any previous condition of slavery or
                        involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party
                        shall have been duly convicted, shall have the same right in every State and
                        territory of the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue
                        parties and give evidence, to inherit; purchase, lease or sell, hold and
                        convey real and personal property; and to full and equal benefit to all laws
                        and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by
                        white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains and
                        penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or
                        custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
                    <p>The second section is as follows: That any person who, under color of any
                        law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom, shall subject or cause to be
                        subjected any inhabitant of any State or territory to the deprivation of any
                        right secured or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains or
                        penalties, on account of such person having at any time been held in a
                        condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for
                        crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason of his
                        color or race than is prescribed for the punishment of such persons, shall
                        be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished by a
                        fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding one
                        year, or both in the discretion of the Court.</p>
                    <p>The third section gives the United States Courts exclusive jurisdiction of
                        the cases arising under this act, and also concurrently with the Circuit
                        Court of the United States, civil and criminal, affording persons who are
                        denied or cannot enforce in the Courts or judicial tribunals of the seat or
                        locality where they may be any of the rights secured to them by the first
                        section of this act, and of any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal had

                        any cause whatever, by any officer, civil or military, or other person, for
                        any arrest or imprisonment, trespasses, or wrongs done or committed by
                        virtue of or under color of authority derived from this act or the act
                        establishing a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees, and acts
                        amendatory thereof; or for refusing to do any act upon the ground that it
                        would be inconsistent with this act, such defendant shall have the right to
                        remove such cause for trial to the proper District or Circuit Court in the
                        manner prescribed by the act relating to habeas
                        corpus and regulating judicial proceedings in certain cases.</p>
