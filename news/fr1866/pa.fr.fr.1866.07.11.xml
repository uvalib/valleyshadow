                    <p>The following opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of Huber vs. Reilly,
                        was read by Justice Strong:</p>
                    <p>The act of Congress under which the defendant below justifies his refusal to
                        receive the vote of the plaintiff is the one approved on the 3rd day of
                        March, 1865. The twenty-first section is the only one applicable to this
                        case, and it is as follows: "And be it further enacted, that in addition to
                        the other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion from the military or
                        naval service, all persons who have deserted the military or naval service
                        of the United States, who shall not return to said service, or report
                        themselves to a Provost Marshal within sixty days after the proclamation
                        hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily
                        relinquished and forfeited their rights of citizenship, and their rights to
                        become citizens; and such deserters shall be forever incapable of holding
                        any office of trust or profit under the United States, or of exercising any
                        rights of citizens thereof; and all persons who shall hereafter desert the
                        military or naval service, and all persons who being duly enrolled, shall
                        depart the jurisdiction of the district in which he is enrolled, or go
                        beyond the limits of the United States, with intent to avoid any draft into
                        the military or naval service, duly ordered, shall be liable to the
                        penalties of this section." This is followed by a clause authorizing and
                        requiring the President to issue his proclamation setting forth the
                        provisions of the section, and we know judicially that this was done on the
                        11th of March, 1865.</p>
                    <p>The act of Congress is highly penal. It imposes forfeiture of citizenship and
                        deprivation of the rights of citizenship, as penalties for the commission of
                        a crime. Its avowed purpose is to add to the penalties which the law had
                        previously affixed to the offence of desertion from the military or naval
                        service of the United States, and it denominates the additional sanctions
                        provided as penalties. Such being its character, it is, under the well known
                        rule of law, to receive a strict construction in favor of the citizen.</p>
                    <p>The constitutionality of the act has been assailed on three grounds. The
                        first of these is that it is an <emph rend="italic">ex post facto</emph>
                        law, imposing additional punishment for an offence committed before its
                        passage, and altering the rules of evidence so as to require different and
                        less proof of guilt than was required at the time of the perpetration of the
                        crime. The second objection is, that the act is an attempt by Congress to
                        regulate the right of suffrage in the States, or to impair it, and the third
                        objection is that the act proposes to inflict pains and penalties upon
                        offenders before and without a trial and conviction by due process of law,
                        and that it is therefore prohibited by the bill of rights.</p>
                    <p>In the view which we take of this case, and giving to the enactment the
                        construction which we think properly belongs to it, it is unnecessary to
                        consider at length, either of these objections to its constitutionality. It
                        may be insisted, with strong reason, that the penalty of forfeiture of
                        citizenship imposed upon those who had deserted the military or naval
                        service prior to the passage of the act is not a penalty for the original
                        desertion, but for persistence in the crime, for failure (in the language of
                        the statute) to return to said service, or to report to a Provost Marshal
                        within sixty days after the issue of the President's proclamation. If this
                        is so, the act of Congress is in no sense <emph rend="italic">ex post
                        facto</emph>, and it is not for that reason in conflict with the
                        constitution. Its operation is entirely prospective. If a drafted man owes
                        service to the Federal government, every new refusal to render the service
                        may be regarded as a violation of public duty, a public offence for which
                        Congress may impose a penalty. And as it is the duty of every court to
                        construe a statute, if possible, so "<emph rend="italic">ut res magis
                            valeat, quam pereat</emph>," that construction of this act must be
                        adopted which is in harmony with the acknowledged powers of Congress, and
                        which applies the forfeiture of citizenship to the new offence described as
                        failure to return to service, or to report to the Provost Marshal.</p>
                    <p>The second objection also assumes more than can be conceded. It is not to be
                        doubted that the right to regulate suffrage in a State, and determine who
                        shall, or who shall not be a voter, belongs exclusively to the State itself.
                        The constitution of the United States confers no authority upon Congress to
                        prescribe the qualification of electors within the several States that
                        compose the Federal Union. Congress is indeed empowered to make regulations
                        for the time, place and manner of holding elections for Senators and
                        representatives, or to alter those made by the legislature of a State,
                        except those in relation to the places of choosing Senators, but here its
                        power stops. The right of suffrage at a State election is a State right, a
                        franchise conferrable only by the State, which Congress can neither give nor
                        take away. If, therefore, the act now under consideration is in truth an
                        attempt to regulate the right of suffrage in the States, or to prescribe the
                        conditions upon which that right may be exercised, it must be held
                        unwarranted by the constitution. In the exercise of its admitted powers,
                        Congress may doubtless deprive an individual of the opportunity to enjoy a
                        right that belongs to him as a citizen of a State, even the right of
                        suffrage. But this is a different thing from taking away or impairing the
                        right itself. Under the laws of the Federal government, a voter may be sent
                        abroad in the military service of the country, and thus deprived of the
                        privilege of exercising his right, or a voter may be imprisoned for a crime
                        against the United States, but it is a perversion of language to call this
                        impairing his right of suffrage. Congress may provide laws for the
                        naturalization of aliens, or it may refuse to provide such laws. Its action
                        or non-action may thus determine whether individuals shall or shall not
                        become citizens of the United States, and I cannot doubt as a penalty for
                        crime against the general government, Congress may impose upon the criminal
                        forfeiture of his citizenship of the United States. Disfranchisement of a
                        citizen as a punishment for crime, is no unusual punishment. Barker vs. the
                        People, 20 Johns, 458. If by the organic law of a State, citizens of the
                        United States are only allowed to vote, the action or non-action of Congress
                        may thus indirectly affect the number of those entitled to the right of
                        suffrage. Yet after all, the right is one which its possessor holds as a
                        citizen of a State, secured to him by the State constitution, and to be held
                        on the terms prescribed by that constitution alone. It is an integral part
                        of the State government.</p>
                    <p>But it is not a correct view of the act of Congress now before us to regard
                        it as an attempt to override State constitutions or to prescribe the
                        qualifications of voters. The act makes no change in the organic law of the
                        State. It leaves that as before, to confer the right of suffrage as it
                        pleases. The enactment operates upon an individual offender, punishes him
                        for violation of the federal law, by deprivation of his citizenship of the
                        United States, but it leaves each State to determine for itself whether such
                        an individual may be a voter. It does no more than increase the penalties of
                        the law upon the commission of crime. Each State defines for itself what
                        shall be the consequence of the infliction of such penalties. And with us it
                        is still our own constitution which restricts the right of suffrage, and
                        confers it upon those only who are inhabitants of the State, and citizens of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>The third objection against the validity of the act of Congress would be a
                        very grave one, if the act does in reality impose pains and penalties before
                        and without a conviction by due process of law. The fifth article of the
                        amendments to the constitution ordains "that no person shall be held to
                        answer for a capital or other infamous crime, unless on a presentment, or
                        indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval
                        forces, or in the militia, when in actual service, in time of war or public
                        danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put
                        in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case
                        to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or
                        property without due process of law." The sixth article secures to the
                        accused in all criminal prosecutions certain rights, among which are a
                        speedy and public trial, by a jury of the vicinage, information of the
                        nature and cause of the accusation, face to face presence with the witnesses
                        against him, compulsory process for his own witnesses, and the assistance of
                        counsel. The spirit of these constitutional provisions is briefly that no
                        person can be made to suffer for a criminal offence unless the penalty be
                        inflicted by due process of law:--What that it has been defined, but never
                        better than it was both historically and critically by Judge Curtis, of the
                        Supreme Court of the United States, in Dell vs. Murray et al, 18 Howard 272.
                        It ordinarily implies and includes a complainant, a defendant and a judge,
                        regular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial according to some
                        settled course of judicial proceeding. It must be admitted there are a few
                        exceptional cases. Prominent among these are summary proceedings to recover
                        debts due to the government, especially taxes and sums due by defaulting
                        public officers. But I can call to mind no instance in which it has been
                        held that the ascertainment of guilt of a public offence, and the imposition
                        of legal penalties, can be in any other mode than by trial according to the
                        law of the land or due process of law, that is the law of the particular
                        case, administered by a judicial tribunal authorized to adjudicate upon it.
                        And I cannot persuade myself that a judge of elections or a board of
                        election officers, constituted under State laws, is such a tribunal. I
                        cannot think they have power to try criminal offenders still less to adjudge
                        the guilt or innocence of an alleged violator of the laws of the United
                        States. A trial before such officers is not due process of law for the
                        punishment of offences, according to the meaning of that phrase in the
                        constitution. There are, it is true, many things which they may determine,
                        such as the age and residence of a person offering to vote, whether he has
                        paid taxes, and whether if born an alien he has a certificate of
                        naturalization. These things pertain to the ascertainment of a political
                        right. But whether he has been guilty of a criminal offence, and has as a
                        consequence, forfeited his right, is an inquiry of a different character.
                        Neither our constitution nor our law has conferred upon the judges of
                        elections any such judicial functions. They are not sworn to try issues in
                        criminal cases. They have no power to compel the attendance of witnesses,
                        and their judgement if rendered would be binding on no other tribunal.</p>
                    <p>Even if they were to assume jurisdiction of the offence described in the act
                        of Congress, and proceed to try whether the applicant for a vote had been
                        duly enrolled and drafted, whether he had received notice of the draft,
                        whether he had deserted and failed to return to service or failed to report
                        to a Provost Marshal, and whether he had justifying reasons for such
                        failure, and if after such trial they were to decide that he had not
                        forfeited his citizenship all this would not amount to an acquittal. It
                        would not protect him against a subsequent similar accusation and trial. It
                        would not protect him against trial and punishment by a court martial.
                        Surely that is no trial by due process of law, the judgement in which is not
                        final, decides nothing, but leaves the accused exposed to another trial in a
                        different tribunal and to the imposition by that other tribunal of the full
                        punishment prescribed by law.</p>
                    <p>Moreover it is not in the power of Congress to confer upon such a tribunal,
                        which is exclusively of State creation, jurisdiction to try offences against
                        the United States. Notwithstanding the decision in Buckwalter vs. United
                        States (11 S. &amp; R., 193) which was an action for penalties, declared
                        to be recoverable as other debts, the doctrine seems a plain one, that
                        Congress cannot put any of the judicial power of the United States in the
                        courts of any other government or sovereignty. Martin vs. Hunter's lessee, 1
                        Wheaton, 304, 330, Eby vs. Peck, 7 Con., 242, and Scoville vs Canfield, 14
                        Johns, 338. And clearly if this is so Congress cannot make a board of State
                        election officers competent to try whether a person has been guilty of an
                        offence against the United States, and if they find him guilty to enforce a
                        part of the prescribed penalty.</p>
                    <p>If therefore the act of March 3, 1865, really contemplates the infliction of
                        its prescribed penalty or any part of it without due process of law, or if
                        it attempts to confer upon the election officers of a State the power to
                        determine whether there has been a violation of the act incurring the
                        penalty, and to enforce the penalty or any part of it, it may well be
                        doubted whether it is not transgressive of the authority vested in Congress
                        by the constitution.</p>
                    <p>But such is not the fair construction of the enactment. It is not to be
                        presumed that Congress intended to transgress its powers, and especially is
                        this true when the act admits of another construction entirely consonant
                        with all the provisions of the constitution.</p>
                    <p>What then is its true meaning? As already observed, forfeiture of citizenship
                        is prescribed as a penalty for desertion, an additional penalty, not for an
                        offence committed before the passage of the act, but for continued desertion
                        and failure to return or report. It is not a new consequence of a penalty,
                        but it is an integral part of the thing itself. Nor is it the whole. It is
                        added to what the law had previously enacted to be the penalty of desertion,
                        as imprisonment is sometimes added to punishment by fine.</p>
                    <p>It must have been intended, therefore, that it should be incurred in the same
                        way, and imposed by the same tribunal that was authorized to impose the
                        other penalties for the offence. It would be very absurd to suppose that two
                        trials and two condemnations for one crime were intended, or that it was
                        designed that a criminal might be sentenced in one count to undergo a part
                        of the punishment denounced by the law, and be punished in another court by
                        the imposition of the remainder. The law as it stood when the act of 1865
                        was passed, had provided a tribunal in which alone the crime of desertion
                        could be inflicted. The consequences of conviction may be noticed in other
                        courts, but the tribunal appointed by the law for that purpose is the only
                        one that can determine whether the crime has been committed, and adjudge the
                        punishment.</p>
                    <p>The act of March 3d, 1865, is not to be considered apart from the other
                        legislation respecting the crime of desertion. It is one of a series of acts
                        pertaining to the same subject matter. It must, therefore, be interpreted
                        with them all in view. This is an admitted rule of statutory construction.
                        So long ago as Rex vs. Soxdale, 1 Burrows, 147, Lord Mansfield said when
                        speaking of acts of Parliament, "that all which relate to the same subjects,
                        notwithstanding some of them may be expired or not noticed, must be taken to
                        be one system and construed consistently." So Chancellor Kent, in the first
                        volume of his commentaries, 463-4, said "it is to be inferred that a code of
                        statutes relating to one subject was governed by one spirit and policy was
                        intended to be consistent and harmonious in its several parts and
                        provisions." In looking through the numerous acts of Congress relating to
                        desertion from military or naval service it is plainly to be seen that they
                        all contemplate a regular trial and conviction prior to the infliction of
                        any penalty, and court martials are constituted and regulated for such
                        trials. The twentieth article of war, enacted on the 10th of April, 1806,
                        (Brightly's Dig., 75,) is in these words: "all officers and soldiers who
                        have received pay, or have been duly enlisted in the service of the United
                        States, and <emph rend="italic">shall be convicted</emph> of having
                        deserted, the same shall suffer death or such other punishment as by <emph
                            rend="italic">sentence of court martial</emph> shall be inflicted."
                        Other enactments have been made at different times respecting the
                        punishments to be inflicted for the offence. The punishment of death in time
                        of peace was abolished in 1830. Corporeal punishment by stripes was
                        abolished by the act of May 2d, 1833, that section of the repealing act was
                        itself repealed, "so far as it applies to any enlisted soldier <emph
                            rend="italic">who shall be convicted by a general court martial of the
                            crime of desertion</emph>." By the act of January 11, 1812, an
                        additional penalty was prescribed for desertion, and it was declared that
                        "such soldier shall and may be tried by a court martial and punished."
                        Brightly's Dig., 89. The 13th section of the act of March 3d, 1863, which
                        declared that any person failing to report after due service of notice that
                        he had been drafted, shall be deemed a deserter, enacted that such a person
                        "shall be arrested by the Provost Marshal and sent to the nearest military
                        post <emph rend="italic">for trial by Court Martial</emph>, unless upon
                        proper showing that he is not liable to military duty, the board of
                        enrollment shall relieve him from the draft." All these acts of Congress
                        manifestly contemplate trial for desertion by court martial and the
                        infliction of no punishment or forfeiture, except upon conviction and
                        sentence in such courts. The act of 1806 provided for general courts
                        martial, and made minute and careful regulations for their organization, for
                        the conduct of their proceedings, and for the approval or disapproval of
                        their sentences. Subsequent acts made some changes, but they have not
                        restrained the jurisdiction or diminished the powers of such courts.</p>
                    <p>It is to such a code of laws, forming a system devised for the punishment of
                        desertion, that the 21st section of the act of March 3d, 1865, was added. It
                        refers plainly to pre-existing laws. It has the single object of increasing
                        the penalties, but it does not undertake to change or dispense with the
                        machinery provided for punishing the crime. The common rules of construction
                        demand that it be read as if it had been incorporated into the former acts.
                        And if it had been, if the act of 1806, and its supplements had prescribed
                        that penalty for desertion or failure to report within a designated time
                        after notice of draft (which the act of 1863 declares desertion) should be
                        punished on conviction of the same with forfeiture of citizenship and death,
                        or in lieu of the latter such other punishment as by the sentence of a
                        court-martial may be inflicted, would any one contend that any portion of
                        this punishment could be inflicted without conviction and sentence?
                        Assuredly not. And if not, so must the act of 1865 be construed now. It
                        means that the forfeiture which it prescribes, like all other penalties for
                        desertion, must be <emph rend="italic">adjudged</emph> to the convicted
                        person after trial by a court-martial and sentence approved. For the
                        conviction and sentence of such a court there can be no substitute. They
                        alone establish the guilt of the accused, and fasten upon him the legal
                        consequences. Such we think is the true meaning of the act, a construction
                        that cannot be denied to it without losing sight of all the previous
                        legislation respecting the same subject matter, no part of which does this
                        act profess to alter.</p>
                    <p>It may be added that this construction is not only required by the
                        universally admitted rules of statutory interpretation, but it is in harmony
                        with the personal rights secured by the constitution, and which Congress
                        must be presumed to have kept in view. It gives to the accused a trial
                        before sworn Judges, a right to challenge, an opportunity of defense, the
                        privilege of hearing the witnesses against him, and of calling witnesses in
                        his behalf. It preserves to him the common law presumption of innocence,
                        until he has been adjudged guilty according to the forms of law.</p>
                    <p>It gives finality to a single trial. If tried by a court-martial and
                        acquitted, his innocence can never again be called in question, and he can
                        be made to suffer no part of the penalties prescribed for guilt. On the
                        other hand, if a record of conviction by a lawful court be not a
                        prerequisite to suffering the penalty of the law, the act of Congress may
                        work with intolerable hardships. The accused will thus be obliged to prove
                        his innocence whenever the registry of the Provost Marshal is adduced
                        against him. No decision of a board of election officers will protect him
                        against the necessity of renewing his defense at every subsequent election,
                        and each time with increased difficulty arising from the possible death or
                        absence of witnesses. In many cases this may prove a gross wrong. It cannot
                        be doubted that in some instances there were causes that prevented a return
                        to service or a report, by persons registered as deserters by Provost
                        Marshals, that would have been held justifying reasons by a court martial,
                        or at least would have prevented an approval of the court's sentence. It is
                        well known also that some who were registered deserters, were at the time
                        actually in the military service as volunteers, and honorably discharging
                        their duties to the government. To hold that the act of Congress imposes
                        upon such the necessity of proving their innocence without any conviction of
                        guilt, would be an unreasonable construction of the act, and would be
                        attributing to the national legislature an intention not warranted by the
                        language and connection of the enactment.</p>
                    <p>It follows that the judgement of the court below upon the case stated was
                        right. The plaintiff not having been convicted of desertion and failure to
                        return to the service or to report to a Provost Marshal, and not having been
                        sentenced to the penalties and forfeitures of the law, was entitled to vote.</p>
                    <p>And now, to wit, June 20, 1866, the judgement of the Court of Common Pleas of
                        Franklin county is affirmed.<lb/> Geo. W. Woodward,<lb/> Chief Justice.</p>
                    <p>WOODWARD C. J.-I concur in the conclusion stated in the above opinion, and in
                        most of the reasoning by which that conclusion was reached. But I do not
                        concur in treating the act of Congress as a valid enactment, for I believe
                        it to be an <emph rend="italic">ex post facto</emph> law in respect to all
                        soldiers except such as committed the crime of desertion <emph rend="italic"
                            >after</emph> the date of the law. This is not a case of desertion
                        subsequent to the enactment, but prior to it, and the penalties of the
                        offence are such as were fixed by law when the offence was committed, and it
                        is not competent for the legislature to increase them except for future
                        cases.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We give in to-day's paper the decision of the Supreme Court, delivered by
                        Justice Strong, in the somewhat notorious deserter case of Huber vs. Reilly.
                        Although the record before the court raised every issue pertaining to the
                        act of Congress, the court has apparently decided nothing more than was
                        necessary to affirm the judgement of the court below.</p>
                    <p>The opinion of Judge Strong is not marked by that judicial candor that should
                        ever characterize the decisions of our courts, and especially our court of
                        last resort. He assumes in express terms <emph rend="italic">not</emph> to
                        decide the question of the constitutionality of the law of Congress
                        disfranchising deserters; but he <emph rend="italic">does</emph> decide in
                        plain terms, that the mode of ascertaining guilt prescribed by Congress is
                        in conflict with the constitution because it is not due process of law. The
                        act of Congress assumed to <emph rend="italic">declare</emph> the
                        citizenship of the deserter forfeited, and provided that the record of the
                        Marshal shall be conclusive evidence of the crime--as has ever been the
                        practice in the military regulations of all nations--until it is disproved.
                        The law makes no provision for any other conviction to ascertain the offence
                        and enforce the penalty, and Judge Strong holds that such process is not
                        conviction within the terms of the constitution, and thereby judicially
                        declares that feature of the conscription act unconstitutional. He might
                        with equal propriety, and with much more candor, have stated frankly that
                        the act is an infraction of the bill of rights, and therefore void. Had he
                        said so frankly, the purpose and effect of the decision would have been
                        clearly understood both by the profession and the people. As it is, the
                        court disclaims assailing the constitutionality of the law, and yet in the
                        most vital manner does in fact assume to overthrow an act of Congress passed
                        in the exercise of the most important power delegated to it by the
                        constitution.</p>
                    <p>If the judicial tribunals of Pennsylvania can set aside one feature of the
                        conscription law upon the ground of want of due process of law, any other
                        State may nullify the same power on any other ground. South Carolina would
                        probably declare it unconstitutional because it assumes to coerce States out
                        of their fancy for nullification, and thirty-six different States could set
                        it aside within their respective jurisdiction for thirty-six different
                        reasons. If the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania can assure the government that
                        there is, under the decision, even a vestige of practical power left with
                        Congress to raise and support armies and to regulate the land and naval
                        forces, we would be profoundly grateful to it for some explanation of the
                        ground on which such assurance is based. It may be so, but we must plead a
                        want of sufficient perspicacity to discern it. If the decision is sustained,
                        it will prove a complete and sweeping amnesty to deserters, and treachery
                        and loyalty will share equally the blessings of a redeemed Republic, while
                        the exactions and bereavements of the struggle will remain only to those who
                        were faithful in the day of national peril.</p>

                <summary>The editorial criticizes the state supreme court's decision in the Huber
                    vs. Reilly case, asserting that it sets a dangerous precedent. "If the judicial
                    tribunal of Pennsylvania can set aside one feature of the conscription law upon
                    the ground of want of due process flaw," it declares, "any other State may
                    nullify the same power on any other ground."</summary>

                <summary>Although several Union men in Franklin county have voiced their support
                    behind a move to reconvene the legislature for an extra session in order to
                    ratify the amendment recently approved by Congress, the article urges them to
                    proceed with caution. Instead, it calls for the measures to be "submitted to the
                    people," which will provide "a degree of sanctity and positiveness that the
                    rebellious States will not disregard."</summary>

                <summary>"An Ex-Representative" disputes the claim made in a letter that appeared in
                    the Repository last week asserting that a significant portion of the Union party
                    of Philadelphia has endorsed Frederick Brewster in the Senate race. The author
                    of the letter contends that it is Col. William B. Thomas, Collector of the Port,
                    in fact, who commands the most support among the city's Republicans.</summary>
