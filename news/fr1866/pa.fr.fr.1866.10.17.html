<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes that the Union County Committee will hold a meeting to discuss
                    potential candidates to nominate for U. S. Senator, which is the "most important

<b>"The Green Spot"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The official returns from the county have given the Republicans a 200 vote
                    majority. Though in previous years the Democrats blamed their poor performances
                    on low voter turn out, the editors contend that such rationalizations cannot be
                    employed this year because "the contest was a fair one." The "vote was a full
                    one, and the result was a complete defeat of the Democracy."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The official vote given in to-day's paper establishes the political
                        complexion of this county beyond dispute. Upon the largest poll by over 700
                        ever cast in the county, it gives a Republican majority of 200, and the vote
                        of the Republicans varies but little from the highest to the lowest, with
                        half a score of candidates to be voted for. While the Democracy has usually
                        been found in a small minority after elections, it has always been said that
                        their vote was not out, or that soldiers had voted here who should have
                        voted elsewhere; but this year the contest was a fair one; the vote was a
                        full one, and the result is a complete defeat of the Democracy. While the
                        Republican ticket was a good and strong one, it is not to be denied that the
                        Democratic ticket had a decided advantage in having Mr. Sharpe on it for
                        Congress. In addition to the interest felt by his party to carry the
                        Congressman, his nomination appealed strongly to his many personal friends
                        in his party to poll their fullest vote for him; and the whole ticket on
                        that side had every element of personal strength. Aside from the great issue
                        to be decided, the Democrats had the advantage in the contest in this
                        county, and had their skill and discretion been equal to their sources of
                        power, they would have made additional strength out of their patronage. But
                        their bungling, awkward, open sale of their plunder brought them no votes
                        and made the betrayed Republicans work only the more earnestly.</p>
                    <p>Franklin county has now witnessed her severest political contest, and her
                        political character is fixed for years to come. With good nominations and
                        judicious management it must steadily increase the majority on the right
                        side. The Democracy can not in ten years to come make another such struggle.
                        With this defeat comes despair, and until the Republicans invite them to
                        effort by some palpable mistake, they will not again rally as a hopeful
                        party. They must now confess that the county is against them, and all its
                        important offices are filled for three years by true men. They will subside
                        for a year or two until some great occasion calls them to the hope of
                        victory in the State, when they may re-inspire their shattered ranks and
                        unfurl some new banner as occasion may require.</p>
                    <p>There is the "Green Spot!" Every man on the Union ticket elected, and her
                        voice unflinchingly for Freedom, for Justice, for ending Peace and
                    Union!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The election of Gen. Koontz, by the decisive majority of 645, over
                        confessedly the ablest and strongest Democrat in the district, is one of the
                        richest fruits of the Republican triumph. We have no rude huzzas to fling in
                        the face of a discomfited foe so worthy of our best steel as is Mr. Sharpe.
                        He fought the fight with wonderful ability and tireless energy, considering
                        the mountain of Johnson debauchery that ever clouded him and weighed him
                        down, and gained slightly in four of the counties of the district on his
                        party vote in the face of the most stubborn devotion to party lines we have
                        ever witnessed. Doubtless the advantage he gained by Gen. Koontz's illness
                        and inability to canvass four of the counties personally, gave him his gains
                        outside of this county; but even in the aggregate they are inconsiderable
                        and do not even measurably break the crushing effect of his fall.</p>
                    <p>There are hundreds of men who voted reluctantly against Mr. Sharpe; but they
                        did it in obedience to the imperious demands of an imperiled nationality.
                        Whatever may be his individual views, his identity with the party that was
                        treason's only hope when it plunged us into causeless war, and that gave it,
                        through its leaders, constant aid and encouragement during the progress of
                        the war, was the insuperable barrier that excluded the support of the men
                        who feared the triumph of traitors if his party succeeded. When Montgomery
                        Blair spoke in Bedford, Fulton and Chambersburg in his behalf, he left
                        nothing for him but the funeral rites to be performed. Whether Mr. Sharpe
                        meant to accept the extreme Johnson policy of resorting to revolution to
                        restore traitors to Congress, it mattered not. It was enough that such a
                        policy was advocated; that its adoption was even probable, however remotely,
                        and that only the Democratic party would attempt it if it should be
                        attempted. There are times when doubts are fatal, and even more fatal than
                        avowed realities, and in this tempestuous sea of doubt Mr. Sharpe floundered
                        before the people. Added to this the constitutional amendments, which no
                        loyal man could read carefully and oppose, Mr. Sharpe made the common error
                        of supposing that the subtle sophistries and technicalities common to the
                        law would prevail before the supreme tribunal of the people. In this he
                        signally failed. Less versatile and apt in political discussion than in
                        legal disputation, he attempted the most strained and absurd construction of
                        the first amendment, and confronted the prevailing sense of justice that is
                        cherished by all classes of the people, and gained nothing by his persistent
                        pettifogging on the question. How much of these follies be gathered from
                        others, we know not; but it is charitable to suppose that he did not
                        originate the palpable absurdity that the amendment of the constitution and
                        the civil rights bill would force negroes into the front pews of our
                        churches, make them jostle us at elections, and impose penalties upon
                        ministers if they did not marry them to whites.</p>
                    <p>The position of Gen. Koontz was well defined and well understood. He was in
                        favor of the Civil Rights bill; he was in favor of the constitutional
                        amendments, he was opposed to rebel representation without just guarantees
                        and penalties, and he demanded for all classes and conditions of mankind
                        equality before the law, as it is conceded by all tribunals in Pennsylvania.
                        He was for Congress and against the President, and the people had implicit
                        confidence in his ability and integrity to maintain his principles under all
                        circumstances. Not only because of his unfaltering devotion to the right do
                        the Republicans rejoice at his election; but the magnitude of the victory is
                        heightened by the shameless frauds by which he was deprived of his seat for
                        seven months. On this wrong the people have passed, and they have nobly
                        vindicated him. He well merits the proud honors he wears, and for three
                        sessions of Congress to come the faithful people of the 16th district can
                        feel the grateful consciousness that the fruits of treason's war shall be
                        gathered in their fullness for Freedom and Justice.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>THE Union County Committee will meet on Monday next, at one o'clock, at the
                        office of Capt. Geo. Eyster, the Secretary, to decide whether the
                        Republicans of Franklin county shall be permitted to express their
                        preferences for U. S. Senator in an authoritative manner; and if so, in what
                        way it shall be done.</p>
                    <p>Surely the Committee will not for a moment entertain the idea of denying so
                        fair and reasonable a request, made as it is by a large number of
                        Republicans who are ever among the foremost in struggling for victory.
                        Instead of over 100 names to such a request, this town alone would have
                        given 500 to the letter had it been deemed necessary.</p>
                    <p>The U. S. Senator is the most important office the State has to fill. It
                        lasts for six years, and the incumbent is the representative of the State in
                        the highest legislative tribunal of the nation. Most naturally, therefore,
                        do the Republicans of Franklin desire to have a voice in determining so
                        momentous a question.</p>
                    <p>Before the election the agitation of the question could not have aided in our
                        great victory; and as our Representative was pledged distinctly to obey any
                        authoritatively expressed wish of the party, the discussion of that question
                        was needless. Now the office is to be filled, and the party will be but just
                        to its high duties and relieve our representatives by fairly and calmly
                        expressing its choice.</p>
                    <p>The party has its authorized and recognized tribunal in its conventions. They
                        are its supreme authority, expressing as they do the wishes of the
                        Republican people. The same high power that created our Representatives, is
                        confessedly competent to speak for the party in the selection of U. S.
                        Senator, and we doubt not that our Representatives will cheerfully and
                        cordially obey the power that gave them their honors.</p>
                    <p>Adams, the other county of the Senatorial district, has already instructed
                        for Gov. Curtin. If this county shall do likewise, Senator M'Conaughy will
                        of course willingly respect it; if it instructs otherwise, he will be at
                        liberty to decide between the two expressions.</p>
                    <p>The State of Pennsylvania, which should be first in power in the councils of
                        the Nation, was betrayed by Cooper, and gain by Cowan, and mingled
                        imbecility and opposition to the great interests of the State, have been the
                        rule in our Senators--ability and fidelity the exception.</p>
                    <p>This triumph must not be so sacrificed. The People will not err, and our
                        Representatives will of course be glad to carry out their wishes. No
                        injustice can thus be done to any one, and certainly none can reasonably
                        complain.</p>

                    <p>The total vote of the county is 8405, the largest ever cast at any election.
                        The highest ever cast before was 7,683 for President in 1864--being 722 less
                        than that given on the 9th inst. This most extraordinary vote, coming as it
                        did solely from the permanent residents of the county, without the pretense
                        on either side that soldiers or other imported voters effected the result,
                        shows how earnest were the people on the great issues presented. Even during
                        the war, when our nationality trembled in the balance, the people did not
                        manifest more interest than they have manifested on the issue of rebel
                        representation.</p>
                    <p>This large vote clearly settles the permanent political complexion of the
                        county. The Democrats cannot pretend that their vote was not out, for they
                        have polled 285 votes more than they ever cast before for any candidate.
                        They will therefore abandon the contest for supremacy in the county, and the
                        Republicans have but to be faithful and prudent to maintain their success
                        from year to year by gradually increasing majorities. The highest vote
                        received for any of the Republican candidates is 4325 for Strickler, and the
                        lowest received is 4248 for Stumbaugh, being a variance of but 77 votes from
                        one extreme to the other in a poll of 4,300. M'Dowell, Strickler and
                        Heintzelman lead the ticket and have each above 200 majority.</p>

                    <p>It will be seen that in every fair contest in the county the Republicans have
                        carried the county since 1854, by a majority ranging from 17 in 1862 to 779
                        in 1854. In 1857 they lost the county by having two candidates for Governor
                        against Packer, who had 129 majority.</p>

                    <p>ELECTION NIGHT IN CHAMBERSBURG--JOYS AND SORROWS OF POLITICS.--The annual
                        return of general election day was this year unusually big with fate. It
                        dawned on brighter hopes and witnessed sadder disappointments than almost
                        any of its predecessors. Both parties greeted the morning sun that shone on
                        the eagles of Austerlitz, and with unabated zeal the contending armies
                        fought it out contesting every inch. The boys had their fun, and their
                        chestnuts, and their apples, and were jolly with the promise of magnificent
                        bonfires in the evening. The doubtful voters were generally run through
                        early and allowed to spend the remnant of the day in obscurity, while the
                        leaders looked after the more important voters not yet run through the mill.
                        The Republicans were earnest, defiant and confident, and had the field in
                        both wards before the day was half spent, and the Democracy were prepared to
                        yield something on their sanguine figures before the polls closed. But they
                        were still confident. They had the South Ward sure--so all their managers and poll-directors insisted. Some of
                        their knowing-ones put it up to 30, and a few even above that; but the
                        Republicans laid aside their paper calculations and put out their best
                        efforts to carry the ward. It was nobly, untiringly fought, and nobly won.</p>
                    <p>At last the sun was sinking behind the western hills, and for the first time
                        in the history of elections, the votes were all polled. At six o'clock the
                        Republicans had their work done, and in the three boxes of Guilford and the
                        two wards there were not six votes wanting or expected half an hour before
                        closing time. The great battle was fought, and all hands had to sit down and
                        await the tale of the tickets. Occasionally the amusement of voting was
                        varied by a street-fight, or a heated discussion on the great issues between
                        two political stars; but there were few bloody noses, and no bones broken.
                        One knock-down in the North Ward cleared the polls for a few minutes as the
                        combatants swung around the circle over a pile of bricks, but peace soon
                        regained her serene sway and all was lovely again.</p>
                    <p>At last the old town-clock tolled out the signal hour of seven, and down went
                        the windows, and the officers proceeded to count. Both parties retired from
                        the field to their headquarters--the Republicans to the office of McClure
                        &amp; Stewart, and the Democracy to the office of McLellan &amp;
                        Kimmell. As they were next door to each other in the same building, each
                        could watch the faces of the other, and on all sides there beamed the smiles
                        of hope and confidence. Around both doors were the boys, bewildering
                        everybody with huzzas for Geary and for Clymer, and around the court-house
                        steps were sundry sleepers who had voted early and drank often and seen that
                        their neighbors drank. Once in a while one of them would roll over and groan
                        out--"hurrah (hic) for Clymer--let's drink," but both parties were too full
                        of expectation to look after the fallen heroes. At last a cheer broke out up
                        Main Street and it swelled as it came thundering toward the diamond. It was
                        for Geary, and the faces in the Democratic household were pale. Nearer and
                        nearer the chorus came, until amidst the cheers could be heard--"South ward
                        22 for Geary!" It was the death-knell to the Democracy. Their lights went
                        out at once; their leaders departed--some to their homes and others to
                        explain the disaster over the flowing bowl. Soon after the North Ward came
                        with 167 for Geary. Then came Guilford with but 22 for Clymer, and next came
                        Mercersburg with her crusher of 191; little Green with her brain-clout of
                        102; Washington with her stunner of 72 and Antrim with 22. The hopes of the
                        Democracy faded out by inches as these figures crowded in upon them, and
                        soon afterwards Allegheny, Philadelphia, Dauphin and a few other counties
                        reported settled the question of Geary's election. A few of their braver
                        spirits stood the grief, and faced disaster with jolly heroism; but one by
                        one they dropped off until there was not one to be found upon the street to
                        tell the story of the great Democratic overthrow of 1866.</p>
                    <p>Our reporters were directed to call on the heads of the various Democratic
                        Bureaus in Chambersburg and get official statement of their operations in
                        the late canvass. This duty was undertaken soon after the Mercersburg
                        returns were received, and notwithstanding the earnest efforts of our
                        efficient corps, they had great difficulty in getting the correct data. The
                        chief managers of both Bureaus were found trying to explain the election to
                        the town pump, and afterwards were engaged in a fierce pugilistic struggle
                        with a black lamp-post, which they mistook for a "buck-nigger" trying to get
                        into a front pew in the church. With much difficulty the altercation was
                        arrested, but the papers of the Bureaus were found in the most confused
                        state. After using our most powerful magnifying glasses, and two of our
                        compositors on unintelligible copy, we are able to present what seems to be
                        a correct statement of the potency of the two Bureaus in the late election.
                        While the fruits may be regarded as insufficient for the outlay, it must be
                        considered that probably the managers were as much to blame as the Bureaus.

                    <p>It is proper to say in justification of the officers of this Bureau that they
                        promised more than double what they paid out, and that they expected a much larger vote for their ticket as the
                        result of their labors. Why the people did not vote as they promised amidst
                        the profusion of country produce, the officers are unable to explain. They
                        generally concur in the theory however, that they did not vote the
                        Democratic ticket mainly because they voted the other ticket.</p>
                    <p>Our reporters had rather more difficulty in getting the accounts of the other
                        Bureau into shape, owing to the multiplicity of promises out for each
                        office, many of which were not recorded. The following, however, is regarded
                        as about a correct statement of the operations of</p>

                    <p>It is due to the managers of this Bureau to say that they promised many more
                        offices, but had no record of them, as the memoranda of the office was in
                        fearful confusion, and they confidently expected 234 votes as the result of
                        their labors. At the time our reporter left, they were endeavoring to
                        account for the other 233 votes, but we could not wait for the solution of
                        the problem. Mr. Sharpe was figuring it out on a board fence with a chunk of
                        charcoal; Kimmell was lost in a maze of figures he had made in the town pump
                        with a piece of chalk; and Keyser had the gable-end of his office covered
                        with mathematical hyeroglyphics; but all seemed in vain. But one vote could
                        be accounted for on an expenditure, actually and positively promised, of
                        $19,800. We are credibly informed that since the election both institutions
                        have been closed up and have gone into Mr. Duncan's hands as a receiver. It
                        is fair to presume that they have had their day, and the next election will
                        not witness the beneficient operations of the Bureaus.</p>
                    <p>OUR REPORTERS VISIT THE WOUNDED.</p>
                    <p>After Waynesboro had dashed up her 72; Mercersburg her 191; Antrim her 22,
                        and Fayetteville had thundered to the tune of 59 and Old Green with her 103,
                        we sent our reporters out, about the "wee sma' hours" to look after the
                        wounded and report their condition. After a protracted search and
                        prognosticating each case carefully, we received the following report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe, wounds numerous and fatal, but patient, vigorous and merry in the
                        throes of dissolution. Was injured most severely by a Somerset.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kimmell could not be found, but on his door was his card, evidently
                        prepared in the agony of bleeding wounds, bearing this inscription: "Non est, de gustibus, non disputandum!"</p>
                    <p>Mr. Keyser, struck by a spent shot before the regular action commenced, and
                        had retired beyond danger. Had miscalculated range of enemy's guns and was
                        hit by mistake on his part, case considered hopeful.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Duncan, Stenger, Douglas and others were all more or less injured,
                        but their recovery is considered probable. A considerable number of the
                        wounded were shot in the neck, but in no case had the arteries been cut.</p>
                    <p>THE BATTLE FIELD.</p>
                    <p>By this time the contending parties had been separated. The victors had the
                        field and the vanquished had retired. Here and there were to be heard the
                        deep guttural sounds of the fallen, and the inspired voices of the
                        triumphant, but beyond the skirmishing Captain Whiskey kept up around the
                        camps of both parties, the conflict had ceased. Geary was elected by 18,000;
                        Sharpe was beaten 700, and the whole county ticket was triumphant. Bully for
                        the People; bully for the Voters' Commissary Bureau; bully for the
                        Corruption Bureau; bully for the Old Flag; bully for everybody and the rest
                        of mankind.</p>
                    <p>SURRENDER OF THE INSURGENTS.</p>
                    <p>The following correspondence has been brought in by our vigilant reporters,
                        and is vouched for by them as genuine. It will be seen that after a
                        protracted negotiation the Democratic Insurgents have surrendered on the
                        conditions proposed by Mr. Myers, who commanded the Loyal forces.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>SIR:--The result of this day must convince you of the hopelessness of further
                        resistance on the part of your shattered, discordant and demoralized forces
                        in this struggle.</p>
                    <p>I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the
                        responsibility of any further effusion of country produce, by asking of you
                        the surrender of that portion of the political insurgents under your
                        unfortunate command.</p>
                    <p>Very Respectfully, your, &amp;c.,<br> MYERS,<br> Commanding Loyal

                        To Samuel Myers, Commanding Loyal Forces:
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR:--I have received your note of this date. Though not entirely of the
                        opinion you express of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of
                        my command, I most feelingly reciprocate your desire to avoid the useless
                        effusion of valuable country produce; and therefore, before considering your
                        proposition, ask the terms you will offer on condition of my surrender.</p>
                    <p>Your obedient servant,<br> KIMMELL,<br> Commanding Dem. Insurgent Forces.</p>
                    <p>COMMANDER MYERS' TERMS.</p>
                    <p>UNION HEAD QUARTERS,<br> Chambersburg, Oct. 11--11:42 1/2 P. M.</p>
                    <p>
                        To F. M. Kimmell, Commanding Democratic Insurgent
                            Forces:
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR--Your note of this evening asking the conditions on which I will accept
                        the surrender of the Democratic Insurgent Forces under your command, is just
                        received.</p>
                    <p>In reply, I would say that peace being my first desire, there are but a few
                        conditions I must insist on, viz:</p>
                    <p>1. That the men surrendered shall be disqualified for assailing the loyal
                        cause, either in peace or in war.</p>
                    <p>2. That they shall forever be disqualified for draft or negro riots, and for
                        becoming or aiding deserters.</p>
                    <p>3. That they shall henceforth make reputable speeches on all subjects they
                        may discuss.</p>
                    <p>4. That they shall not shed innocent blood gratis in the butcher shops before
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>5. That they shall abolish the Voters' Commissary Bureau, and cease bartering
                        rations for votes.</p>
                    <p>6. That they shall cease selling A. J.'s offices in open market for votes,
                        and especially shall not offer one office to seventeen men, and then give it
                        to none of them.</p>
                    <p>7. That they shall cease ever apologizing for and aiding, encouraging, and
                        abetting treason.</p>
                    <p>8. That they shall punish traitors by some other process than putting them
                        into the Senate and in Congress.</p>
                    <p>9. That they shall not derange the currency by exchanging greenbacks for
                        wood, cord for cord.</p>
                    <p>Upon the acceptance of the foregoing terms, your men will be paroled, and the
                        officers will each be allowed to retain side-arms and baggage as follows:</p>
                    <p>One nigger on the brain.</p>
                    <p>One nigger in each wood-pile.</p>
                    <p>One nigger bureau.</p>
                    <p>One nigger forbidden to marry their daughters.</p>
                    <p>One nigger female forbidden to marry them.</p>
                    <p>One nigger of the mixed persuasion.</p>
                    <p>One nigger--in a horn.</p>
                    <p>All nigger cards, hand-bills, placards, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>It is to be understood, however, that the above articles are solely for
                        private use, and they are not to be flaunted into the face of the public to
                        the disgust of every honest and decent citizen, as heretofore.</p>
                    <p>Hoping that the terms proposed will be accepted, and that this fearful and
                        profitless effusion of beef, mutton, flour, country produce, truth, offices,
                        &amp;c., on the part of your forces will forever cease, believe me,</p>
                    <p>Yours Respectfully,<br> MYERS,<br> Commanding Loyal Forces.</p>
                    <p>COMMANDER KIMMELL SURRENDERS.</p>
                    <p>DEMOCRATIC INSURGENT HEAD-QUARTERS,<br> Chambersburg, Oct. 10--12:30 A. M.</p>
                    <p>
                        To Samuel Myers, Commanding Loyal Forces:
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR:--I have your letter covering proposed terms for the surrender of my
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Having twice hurled my command into the conflict, only to suffer
                        discomfiture; believing that my men cannot fight successfully, as at present
                        equipped, even if they would; that they would not fight under me if they
                        could, I accept the situation, and shall surrender with the consent of
                        friend and foe.</p>
                    <p>You can therefore take my command, such as it is, as it is useless to me as I
                        am to it, and the effusion of blood and country produce on the voter's
                        altar, shall now cease,</p>
                    <p>Yours Submissively,<br> KIMMELL,<br> Com. Dem. Insurgent Forces.</p>
                    <p>This correspondence and surrender approved October 9, 1866.</p>
                    <p>His ANDREW [graphic of liquor bottle] JOHNSON mark.</p>
                    <p>We bespeak for the paroled men the kindest consideration of the public. Their
                        nerves are sadly shattered by the conflict, and they are in constant
                        apprehension of the advancement of the negro into their family circles,
                        their churches, their altars, their firesides, and their elections. They are
                        entitled to the profoundest commiseration, and they will doubtless receive
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Thus has ended the ever memorable political conflict of 1866.</p>
