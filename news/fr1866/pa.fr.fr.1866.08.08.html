<b>Richmond and Its Battle-Fields</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Though the war has ended, the legacy of the Confederacy continues to thrive
                    in Richmond and its environs. As proof, the article points to the antebellum
                    elite's continued hold on power, the overwhelming presence of Confederacy
                    paraphernalia in public buildings, and the enduring mistreatment of blacks.<br>

<b>A Southern Prison</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece contains a vivid description of the horrible conditions and
                    surrounding geography at the prisoner of war camp in Florence, the "infamous
                    South Carolina prison pen" where 2,378 Union soldiers died at the hands of their
                    "'chivalrous'" keepers.<br>

<b>The Spectre of Retribution</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors question the legitimacy of the dire warnings issued by the
                    Philadelphia Age concerning the likelihood that the "Rebel-Johnson" Convention
                    will be terrorized by Republicans intent on disrupting the event. Yet, even if
                    such an act did occur, the editors explain, it would be highly hypocritical for
                    the Philadelphia Age to complain since it failed to rebuke the Democrats of
                    Louisiana for the violence they perpetrated at the Constitutional Convention in
                    1864 and most recently in the New Orleans Massacre.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Philadelphia Age of Thursday has a
                        doubled-leaded editorial of a column and a half, under the caption of "The
                        Voice of Warning," the prayer of which is--"In God's name let us have
                        peace!"</p>
                    <p>Naturally anxious to ascertain what had so unstrung the nerves of the Age, we found upon a glance at its incoherent
                        mutterings and its mingled threats and cries for protection, that it fears
                        the return of the rebel-copperhead victories of Memphis and New Orleans to
                        roost in the Philadelphia convention. It therefore is frightened out of all
                        propriety, and implores the firemen, the business men, the solid men, the
                        merchants, the killers, the bouncers, and all the rest of mankind to give it
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>A Philadelphia correspondent of one of the New York papers happened to say
                        that the Rebel-Johnson convention "is regarded with disfavor" there, and
                        that "the returned soldiers and fire companies freely and openly declare
                        that they intend to break up the gathering." Upon this information brought
                        in by way of New York, the Age is bowed down with
                        grief and fear, and it begs with fitful flashes of cowardice and bombast
                        that its dear rebel friends shall be let alone.</p>
                    <p>Of course the Philadelphia Convention will be protected fully in its rights
                        as a deliberative body. It will be made up of ex-rebel Vice Presidents,
                        Generals, Colonels, Senators, Congressmen, &amp;c., from the South; of
                        the Woods, the Vallandighams, the Hughes's and their followers of the North,
                        and it will meet in the city of all others conspicuous for loyalty--a city
                        that has sacrificed more noble sons upon the bloody altar of treason than
                        any other in the Union. Returned soldiers may feel but little pride in the
                        assembling of such a body of men in Philadelphia, but they will not imitate
                        the conduct of the men who are to lead the convention, as displayed in the
                        New York butcheries of 1863 or the Memphis or New Orleans massacres of 1866.
                        There will be peace, unless defiant treason shall flagrantly violate it, and
                        the Age's favorite hot-house of treachery will be
                        at liberty to do its work.</p>
                    <p>A word to the Age as to New Orleans and
                        Philadelphia. A constitutional convention, elected by the loyal people of Louisiana, met in 1864 and framed a
                        most magnanimous constitution, under which rebels fill every important
                        office in the State to-day. The men who were then in open, deadly war
                        against the government, have returned and now occupy the places of honor and
                        trust and make and administer the laws of the State. In accordance with a
                        resolution of the convention, it was recently recalled to meet in New
                        Orleans, but not until the approval of the rebel Governor had been obtained
                        and the assurance given that it would be protected in its deliberations. It
                        could do no harm, whatever its purposes, for the whole power of the State,
                        executive and judicial, is in the hands of traitors. It was a perfectly
                        lawful assembly--certainly in no sense lawless, and it had a right to expect
                        protection.</p>
                    <p>When it met, the rebels who were in the ranks of Dick Taylor's army when it
                        originally assembled in 1864, but who have since become the governing class,
                        resolved that as Union men are a source of constant annoyance and
                        irritation, they should be murdered and thus exterminated. The rebel
                        Governor had some sense of justice, and he asked protection for the
                        convention, but they instantly deposed him, and telegraphed the President
                        that the Governor had betrayed them! With the power of the State thus
                        usurped by the Lieut. Governor and Attorney General under the direct
                        sanction of the President, and with Monroe as Mayor of the city, they at
                        once pronounced the convention a "lawless body," because it was composed of
                        loyal men, and the systematic murder of the members was commenced. Some
                        forty persons, black and white were butchered, with the hearty approval of
                        the President, and with a ready apologist in the Age. The President instead of directing the military to preserve the peace as he should have done,
                        peremptorily ordered them to sustain the civil authorities, and thus they
                        were under the command of a rebel Mayor, who was the chief of the murderers!</p>
                    <p>On the 14th of August the rebels of the South, (there will not be a single
                        loyal exception) and their sympathizers of the North will meet in
                        Philadelphia. They will come, as they say, to consult upon the condition of
                        political affairs--just as did the Louisiana Convention. It will be a lawful
                        assembly, because not forbidden by law, as was the Louisiana Convention. The
                        civil authorities of Pennsylvania and of Philadelphia have no sympathy with
                        traitors, just as the rebel authorities of New Orleans and Louisiana have no
                        sympathy with loyal men. The Age may not wish the
                        parallel to go farther, but for the sake of truth, we shall pursue it.</p>
                    <p>It is not fairly a supposable case, but for the sake of proper illustration
                        permit us to suppose that Mayor M'Michael, who has ardently supported the
                        government, should regard an assembly of rebels and semi-rebels as a lawless
                        body, made up to a large extent of men whose lives have been justly
                        forfeited by treason; and suppose that Gov. Curtin should consult only his
                        loyal instincts and treat an assembly of murderous traitors and their
                        abetters as an insult to the law and to loyal society, and therefore the
                        State and City Executives should invite the lawless to murder the
                        representatives on the pretext of suppressing an unlawful body. Suppose
                        farther, that President Johnson, in the midst of the massacre, should
                        instruct the military "to support the civil
                        authorities," instead of requiring them to preserve the peace, and
                        the end would be the suppression, by murder and arrests, of the proposed
                        convention, so that Gen. Meade would be enabled to report officially to
                        Washington (as did Gen. Baird of New Orleans) that the riots had been
                        suppressed and "about forty persons have been killed and
                            a large number wounded, nearly all being friendly to the
                        convention!" Would the Age have excuses at
                        hand for the civil authorities, for the murderers, and for the chief
                        accessary, the President, as it has had for just such acts in New Orleans?</p>
                    <p>Will the Age study the parallel, and inform its
                        readers of what it really thinks of the crimsoned victories of its friends
                        in Memphis and New Orleans? Is protection to all classes in Philadelphia a
                        right any more sacred than in other cities or sections of the Union? If not,
                        will the Age join us in demanding protection to
                        life, person, property and opinion in every State in the Union? If its party
                        will but do so, the spectre of retribution that now haunts it would speedily
                        vanish, and there would be peace throughout the length and breath of the
                        land.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The President of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention of 1864, in
                        accordance with the authority especially conferred upon him by that body,
                        recalled it to meet recently in New Orleans, and Gov. Wells, a devoted rebel
                        and as such elected Executive of the State, approved the call. The
                        Convention could do nothing more than meet and address the people, and was
                        therefore certainly not a lawless assembly. It could have made no changes in
                        the organic law, and could force no new or objectionable statutes upon the
                        State. The courts are thoroughly rebel and would not allow any body of men
                        to harm any others than loyal citizens. The Convention met, and was at once
                        greeted with a mob, inspired by the rebel Lieut. Governor, Attorney General
                        and Mayor Monroe--the same who was rebel Mayor when the Union forces
                        captured the city. Attorney General Herron telegraphed President Johnson
                        that Gov. Wells had betrayed them, (the rebels) and of course the President
                        at once rushed to the rescue of his friends. The result was the dispersion
                        of a peaceable convention by murder. Many of its members who were leading
                        Union men were killed, and a free butchery of the negroes followed of
                        course. The military were directed by the President to obey the rebel Mayor
                        Monroe, and in the name of law and order, the rebels butchered Union men and
                        negroes until their vengeance was glutted. The following is the President's
                        dispatch to the rebel Attorney General, thus utterly ignoring Gov. Wells,
                        who had been deposed by the mob and put in jail:</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, Monday, July 30th, 1866.<br>To Andrew S.
                            Herron, Attorney Gen. of Louisiana:</p>
                    <p>You will call on Gen. Sheridan, or whoever may be in command, for sufficient force to sustain the civil authorities in
                            suppressing all illegal or unlawful assemblies who usurp or
                        assume to exercise any power or authority without first having obtained the
                        consent of the people of the State.</p>
                    <p>If there is to be a Convention, let it be composed of delegates chosen from
                        the people of the whole State.</p>
                    <p>The people must be first consulted--no changing the organized laws of the
                        State.</p>
                    <p>Usurpation will not be tolerated.</p>
                    <p>The law and the Constitution must be sustained, and thereby peace and
                        order.<br> ANDREW JOHNSON</p>
                    <p>The "civil authorities" consisted of an Attorney General who has usurped the
                        position of the Executive, and the rebel Mayor of the city. They being
                        lawful dignitaries, all that they pronounced unlawful was to be suppressed.</p>
                    <p>The following despatches to the Tribune show how
                        the riot progressed:</p>
                    <p>FIRST DISPATCH.<br> New Orleans, July 30--3 P. M.</p>
                    <p>The riot is progressing with frightful results. President Johnson telegraphed
                        the military to support civil authorities. Mayor Monroe and his police
                        force, sympathizing with the Rebel element, have broken up a peaceable
                        assemblage of loyal men, killing and wounding a number of the Convention.
                        Gov. Hahn is dangerously wounded and locked up in jail. An indiscriminate
                        massacre of Union men is going on. God help the colored people. Gen. Baird
                        has forsaken them; no troops have yet arrived. Gen. Sheridan is absent, but
                        expected to return to-night. Two Confederate flags have been raised and the
                        city is in their possession. Gov. Wells is a prisoner in their hands.</p>
                    <p>SECOND DISPATCH.<br> New Orleans, July 30--9 P. M.</p>
                    <p>The troops have been marched into the city, and martial law proclaimed. Gen.
                        Kautz has been made Military Governor of the city. I have just visited the
                        State-House, where the members of the Convention and Union men were
                        slaughtered; it presents a ghastly appearance, the floor is literally
                        flooded with blood of our best Union men. Comparatively, quiet has been
                        restored, but it is regarded as the calm before the storm. Many Union men
                        are known to have been murdered. Gen. Baird is responsible for this,
                        inasmuch as he had no troops in the city, although warned of what has
                        transpired. Gen. Sheridan's staff have behaved very gallantly. All Union and
                        peaceable citizens pray for the return of Gen. Sheridan.</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, July 31.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the military authorities, from 8 o'clock last evening to this
                        writing (4 p. m.) the city has been comparatively quiet. Dr. Dostie is not
                        dead. I have just seen him; but it is impossible for him to live twenty-four
                        hours. He is riddled with bullets, and pierced through the bowels with a
                        sword-cane. Gov. Hahn, the Hon. John Henderson, Dr. Hare, Hon. S. S. Fish,
                        the Hon. George Haares, the Rev. Mr. Hanson, Hon. Alfred Shaw, Mr. Enhurst,
                        Capt. John Burk and others were dangerously wounded. When Gov. Hahn was
                        taken to the station-house, he was covered with blood. These men were shot
                        while in the hands of the police. Capt. Loup, 1st New Orleans infantry, was
                        brutally murdered by a policeman while standing inoffensively on the corner
                        of the street. There was a preconcerted plan to massacre all Union men. The
                        fire bells gave a signal, and the firemen armed with knives and pistols,
                        rushed through the streets to a general rendezvous, and commenced and
                        indiscriminate slaughter of colored men. I cannot ascertain the name of a
                        single policeman killed. Mayor Monroe boasts that the President will restore
                        him, and replace civil law within 12 hours. If he does, God help Union men.</p>
                    <p>The following additional particulars are replete with interest, and fix the
                        responsibility for this terrible Massacre clearly upon the rebels and the
                        President:</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, Wednesday, August 1--6 P. M.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to martial law and the presence of troops, the city is comparatively
                        quiet. The Rebel press, afraid of the consequences of this riot, are
                        attempting to shift the blame on the negroes, when it is well known the
                        police, and the fire department, and things generally, were organized for
                        the purpose of massacring the members of the Convention and other Union men.</p>
                    <p>The Times, a notorious Rebel sheet, says "To see
                        negroes mutilated and literally beaten to death as they sought to escape was
                        one of the most horrible pictures it has ever been our ill fortune to
                        witness." A military commission, of which the gallant Major-Gen. J. A. Mower
                        is President, has been organized to investigate and report upon all facts
                        connected with the late riot.</p>
                    <p>The following telegraphic correspondence explains itself:</p>
                    <p>WAR DEPARTMENT, July 21, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        To his Excellency Gov. Wells.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been advised that you have issued a proclamation convening the
                        Convention elected in 1864. Please inform me under and by what authority
                        this has been done, and by what authority this Convention can assume to
                        represent the whole people of the State of Louisiana.<br> ANDREW JOHNSON.</p>
                    <p>The Governor's reply is as follows:</p>
                    <p>STATE OF LOUISIANA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.<br> New Orleans, July 28, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        To his Excellency, Andrew Johnson, President of the U.
                            S.:
                    </p>
                    <p>Your telegram is received. I have not issued any order convening the
                        Convention of 1864. The Convention was reconvened by the president of that
                        body, by virtue of a resolution authorizing him to do so, and in that event
                        for him to call on the proper officers of the State to issue writs of
                        election for delegates in unrepresented parishes. My proclamation was issued
                        in response to that call. As soon as vacancies can be ascertained, they will
                        be filled, and then the whole State will be represented in the
                        Convention.<br> J. MADISON WELLS, Governor.</p>
                    <p>The telegraph of the President to Attorney-General Herron is regarded as a
                        virtual overthrow of the Constitution of the State, superseding the
                        Governor, who, by Article 59 of the Constitution, is charged with seeing the
                        laws executed. The Rebel Gen. Herron is therefore military dictator, and, by
                        President Johnson's order, the troops are placed at his disposition. Union
                        men are preparing to leave the State en masse, under the impression that the
                        Government will not protect them. Gen. Sheridan has returned, and will
                        sustain martial law until after a thorough examination is made by the
                        commission, unless, as is feared, the City Government is given back to the
                        Rebel murderers of our Union by the President's orders.</p>
                    <p>Mayor Monroe's letter of the 25th ult. to Gen. Baird, in reference to the
                        Convention, is published. He says it is his intention to disperse this
                        unlawful assembly. Gen. Baird replies in a lengthy letter, and says:</p>
                    <p>I cannot understand how the Mayor of a city can undertake to decide so
                        important and delicate a question as the legal authority upon which a
                        Convention claiming to represent the people of the entire State bases its
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Gov. Wells has applied for military protection, his life having been
                        threatened.</p>
                    <p>DISPATCH FROM GEN. SHERIDAN.</p>
                    <p>In order that the following from Gen. Sheridan may be fully understood, it
                        should be stated that he was absent from New Orleans when the disturbances
                        commenced:</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, August 1--1:30 P. M.</p>
                    <p>
                        Gen. U. S. Grant, Washington, D. C.:
                    </p>
                    <p>You are doubtless aware of the serious riot which occurred in this city on
                        the 30th. A political body, styling itself the Convention of 1864, met on
                        the 30th for, as it is alleged, the purpose of remodeling the present
                        Constitution of the State. The leaders were political agitators and
                        revolutionary men, and the action of the Convention was liable to produce
                        breaches of the public peace. I had made up my mind to arrest the head men
                        if the proceedings of the Convention were calculated to disturb the
                        tranquility of the Department, but I had no cause for
                            action until they committed the overt act. About 40 whites and blacks
                            were killed, and about 160 wounded. Everything is now quiet, but
                        I deem it best to maintain a military supremacy in the city for a few days,
                        until the affair is fully investigated. I believe the sentiment of the
                        general community is great regret at this unnecessary cruelty, and that the Police could have made any arrest they saw
                            fit without sacrificing lives.<br> P. H. Sheridan, Maj. Gen.</p>
                    <p>LATER FROM GEN. SHERIDAN.</p>
                    <p>It seems that Gen. Sheridan has hastened to correct his first dispatch. As he
                        had not been in New Orleans for some time before the riots nor during the
                        riots, he had evidently sent his first dispatch upon information obtained
                        wholly from the rebel authorities. The very next day, however, he began to
                        understand that it had not been a riot, but a deliberately planned massacre
                        of Union men, and he so telegraphed Gen. Grant promptly, but so far his second dispatch has been suppressed by the
                        President. Its receipt in Washington, however, became positively
                        known, and the New York Times (Johnson organ)
                        states the fact, as do the Tribune, the
                        Philadelphia Press and the Ledger. The following are the special dispatches to those papers
                        from Washington. The Tribune says:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sheridan telegraphs to-day to Gen. Grant that the riot was not the
                        result of a mere mob, but a preconcerted and prearranged
                            plan of weeks for the slaughter of Union men! The dispatches of
                        the Associated Press are tempered to suit the latitude from whence they are
                        sent, and are dictated by the disloyal State officials. Attorney-General Herron, who was an officer in the Rebel service,
                            virtually ranks Gen. Sheridan, as by the order of the President the
                            military are subject to the call and disposition of the civil
                            authorities. Rumor here to-night says Gen. Sheridan will resign
                        on account of the President's conduct in this affair, and the embarrassing
                        position loyal officers are placed in.</p>
                    <p>The Ledger and New York Times have the following dispatch:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sheridan, in a dispatch from New Orleans to Gen. Grant, received to-day,
                            states that the riot in that city was not the effect
                            of a hastily congregated mob, as has been represented, but was the
                            result of a preconcerted and prearranged plot of the Rebels to slaughter
                            the leading Union men of the State, and that there is evidence that the
                            plan was concerted weeks ago. Sheridan also gives it as his opinion that
                            it is but the commencement of the Rebel plan to rid Louisiana of Union
                            men. Officers from the South-West say there are only about 1,200
                        United States troops serving in Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>The dispatch to the Press is as follows:</p>
                    <p>It is stated on good authority that Gen. Grant received a further dispatch
                        to-day from General Sheridan in relation to the New Orleans riot. He says it
                        was not the work of an excited mob, but was the
                            execution of a preconcerted plan on the part of the rebels to slaughter
                            the leading Union men of the State, and was concocted weeks ago.
                        He expresses the opinion that further acts of violence will be attempted if
                        opportunity occurs. The dispatches of the Associated Press are well known to
                        have been filtered through rebel agents, and many of them are said actually
                        to have been dictated by the State officials themselves.</p>
                    <p>Will Andrew Johnson let the people see Sheridan's last dispatch?</p>
                    <p>LATEST FROM THE MASSACRE.</p>
                    <p>New Orleans, August 2, 1866.</p>
                    <p>The Military Commission appointed to investigate the massacre of Union men
                        took Dr. Dostie's deposition to-day. The Hon. John Henderson and the Rev.
                        Mr. Horton were too weak to give evidence. The Rev. Mr. Jackson, the Hon.
                        Oscar Paynot, the Hon. E. Dupaty, and the Hon. George Howe are among the
                        dangerously wounded not heretofore reported. Gov. Hahn and the Hon. S. S.
                        Fish are badly wounded, but will recover. I saw them to-day in the hospital.
                        The sworn testimony before the Commission will prove that the massacre of
                        Monday was one of the most blood-thirsty events that has ever stained the
                        page of history.</p>
                    <p>It will be sworn that a well-known, respected and peaceable citizen
                        remonstrated with the mob and police for their butchery, when the mob cried,
                            "D--n them, kill them! The President is with us.
                            Haven't we seen his order to-day?" The back door of the Institute
                        was nailed up during the massacre, to prevent the escape of those inside.
                        Arrangements were made by the Chief of Police, with A. B. Griswold &amp;
                        Co., to furnish the populace with pistols.</p>
                    <p>The pistols were furnished as agreed. A. B. Griswold &amp; Co., are the
                        firm of Hyde, Goodrich &amp; Co., the largest manufacturers of arms for
                        Rebels during the late Rebellion. Their property was confiscated upon that
                        account, and subsequently returned. Nothing but the powerful arm of the
                        military prevents a recurrence of the scenes of Monday.</p>
