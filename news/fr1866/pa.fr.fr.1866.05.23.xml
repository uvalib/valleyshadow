                    <p>The following startling facts from the Doylestown <emph rend="italic"
                            >Intelligencer</emph> are worthy of the candid consideration of every
                        loyal man:</p>
                    <p>One of the public questions which comes nearest home to the minds of the
                        people is that of equalizing the basis of Congressional representation. The
                        Reconstruction Committee of Congress, in their report, which has just been
                        adopted by an immense majority in the House, makes this a precedent to the
                        admission of the Rebel communities as States into the Union. It should be
                        constantly kept in mind that the demand of these recent Rebels, and of their
                        Northern allies, is that they shall come back into the Union, not as equals,
                        but as superiors; not wielding the same power as that wielded by the same
                        number of voters in the loyal States, but a vastly greater power, so that,
                        man for man, each late rebel shall count for nearly twice as much in
                        influence upon all national questions as a loyal man, so that in the House
                        of Representatives and in the election of a President he shall have two
                        votes to the loyal man's one. How monstrous this demand is will be apparent
                        from the consideration of a few figures, which we herewith present:--The
                        total vote cast in 1860 in the eleven Rebel States was only 867,024. They
                        could not poll as many now within a hundred thousand. The two States of New
                        York and Pennsylvania cast at the last Presidential election 1,303,428
                        votes, or 406,404 <emph rend="italic">more</emph> votes than the eleven
                        Rebel States combined. New York and Pennsylvania have <emph rend="italic"
                            >four</emph> Senators; the Rebel States have <emph rend="italic"
                            >twenty-two</emph>! But even this does not fully show the glaring
                        injustice of the case. Each Rebel Congressman will represent only 14,000
                        voters; each Pennsylvania or New York Congressman represents 25,000 voters.
                        At the rate upon which the Rebels will be represented, Pennsylvania and New
                        York <emph rend="italic">ought</emph> to have <emph rend="italic"
                            >ninety-three</emph> Congressmen instead of only fifty-five. But after
                        the apportionment of 1870, unless the basis of representation shall have
                        been equalized, the Rebel States will have a still more unjust advantage,
                        for they will have added to their basis of representation two-fifths of all
                        the colored population of the South. This will give them from twenty to
                        thirty more Representatives than they could claim under the old system,
                        before emancipation. The power of <emph rend="italic">one</emph> voter in
                        the South will be greater than that of <emph rend="italic">two</emph> voters
                        in the Northern States. <emph rend="italic">This</emph> is the desirable
                        entertainment to which, under the names of justice and mercy and
                        magnanimity, the people of Pennsylvania are invited. Hiester Clymer is the
                        champion of this scheme for robbing the people of Pennsylvania of their just
                        rights, that <emph rend="italic">superior power</emph> may be given to the
                        Rebels.</p>

                <summary>The article cautions loyal men to remain attentive to the legislative
                    changes that the rebels and their northern sympathizers are striving to enact.
                    These laws, it points out, would admit the former rebels to the Union "not as
                    equals, but as superiors" who, when the votes were tallied, would "account for
                    nearly twice as much in influence upon all national questions as a loyal man."</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that the House of Representatives has appointed a committee
                    to investigate the riot that occurred in Memphis at the beginning of May and
                    resulted in deaths of scores of ex-slaves. The evidence, such as the fact that,
                    in contrast to the 60 or 70 blacks who died in the melee, no white person was
                    injured, appears to suggest that the riot was the product of an "unprovoked
                    assault on blacks" by whites, including members of the city's notoriously racist
                    police force.</summary>

                    Johnson and his administration's reconstruction policies. Though true Union men
                    of the State do not sanction such behavior, aver the editors, they regard his

                    <p>MR. SHARPE has burst upon the circle of Democratic aspirants for
                        Congressional honors in this district like a star shooting from its sphere,
                        and his flight to the front has been so brilliant that his competitors seem
                        to be utterly obscured in the conflict. Gen. Coffroth has been manipulating
                        for himself with untiring industry, and has on all occasions proclaimed that
                        none but himself can be elected, while Judge Kimmell has been regarded as
                        willing to be overwhelmed with the nomination. But in a most unexpected
                        moment, Sharpe darts out upon the political horizon, and takes his rivals as
                        thunder did the toad. They may have vitality enough to recover and make a
                        fight; but if so, it will be because Sharpe surrenders the vantage ground he
                        has so suddenly and so completely attained.</p>
                    <p>This thunder-clap comes from the cool breezes of the glades--from the frosty
                        sons of the Alleghenies, and it comes rugged as their native hills. A letter
                        signed by the Bears, Gaither, Hugus and others, embodying the brains and
                        leadership of the Democracy of Somerset, appears in the last <emph
                            rend="italic">Democrat</emph>, recommending Mr. Sharpe for Congress, and
                        the paper sanctions the appeal editorially in a series of telling blows
                        directed against the other aspirants, especially Gen. Coffroth. It will have
                        no one as a standard-bearer who has ever betrayed the party, of which Gen.
                        Coffroth will take notice, and it insists that nothing but Sharpe's
                        immaculate purity and transcendent ability will save the Democracy from
                        defeat in the coming contest,--a compliment Mr. Sharpe will please prepare
                        himself to vindicate. It's no odds, as Toots would say, how the thing works
                        when the practical solution of the nomination is to be arrived at, as the
                        Union men mean to elect the Congressman, whether Sharpe, Kimmell, Coffroth,
                        "or any other man," takes the blurred and blotted banner of the Democracy.
                        If Sharpe means to avail himself of the advantage gained by the exquisite
                            <emph rend="italic">coup de etat</emph> of his friends, we do him the
                        kind office to remind him that when he gets the nomination, like the young
                        bear, his chief troubles will be ahead of him still. Always sympathising
                        with the hindmost and unfortunate, we beg to present our profoundest
                        condolence to Gen. Coffroth. We have a reasonable share of first class
                        sympathy reserved also for Judge Kimmell if he desires the commodity, and we
                        are not unmindful that Mr. Sharpe will need an unusual quantity after the
                        gales of October.</p>

                    "comes from the cool breezes of the glades" where "the frosty sons of the

                    <p>My sole is 2 full for utterenz. I hev had a refreshun sezin; I hev herd 2
                        sound gospil surmens, and nary nigger menshuned in em wunst. Only sinners
                        wuz askt 2 repent and go to glori, and ime bound for the promist land.
                        Halleluger! I left mi charge at Confedirit X Rodes, Ky., with mi old female
                        friend Garret Davis, whilst I sought to reQperate my failing helth by a
                        voyage 2 the see shoar. I was desirous also 2 see what those traitors Bucher
                        and his agitant Gen. Howard was about at the Mary-Anniversarys. Greeved am I
                        2 say that they hev not shown a proper distress at the calamnity which has
                        overtakin our beloved bretheren and sisters of the Sunny South, resulting
                        from the tyranicle corse of Mr. Anna Dickinson and Miss Wendell Philips.</p>
                    <p>From watchin the corners in New York, I visited the gory field of Gettysburg,
                        where hecatomes of the noblest suns of the South was offered 2 appese the
                        insasheate blood thurstiness of wolfish Aberlishunists; but alas! no
                        Nashunal Mounerment is a rearin 2 mark the spot whure they ly. I call upon
                        the democracy, headed by the God-like Andy Johnson, 2 rase a dime
                        conterbushun a la Vallandigum 2 rear a mounerment which shill overtop the
                        Aberlishunist 1, &amp; proov 2 risin gennerashuns that the Democracy
                        never forgits its friends--never! Halleluger! The conterbushuns may be cent
                        to the undersined.</p>
                    <p>Notisin a brass band approachin as I arrove into Chambersburg on Saturday eve
                        last, I thot my friends woz intendin to giv me the grand recepshun du my
                        distinguished talents and serveces in the Democratic party, and after it had
                        discoursed its music a spell, I stept forred, throwen back the curling lox
                        from my massive brow, placed one hand serenely in my buzim and striking a
                        classic attitood, was about 2 begin "Countrymen &amp; Lovers," when the
                        crowd called out "Curtain! Cutain! Curtain!" I looked around 2 see if any
                        curtain or drapery was to be histed, and finding none, was about to procede
                        2 remark as much, when a lo Abberlishernist interrupted me by sain: "See
                        here, you confounded ape! what you standin there in the Guvners way for! Get
                        out o' here!" And with no reverence for the cloth which covered my manly
                        form, he pushed me roodly aside between 2 niggers who hadn't been washed
                        since before the war, and hed been sot there as a spescial boka for Gov.
                        Curtin. Ah! What a <emph rend="italic">curtain</emph> to be dropt twixt me
                        and a triumphant resepshun! My feelins was hurt and I indignantly retired. I
                        will just say here that that brass band is the poorest, meenest,
                        contemptiblest brass band as ever tooted onto a horn. I wod rather heir a
                        cord of tom cats onto a wood house roof at nite 1000 times.</p>
                    <p>And now I hev got back 2 the Press-by-tear-ien' church, where I started. As I
                        remarked, the surmun was pew-er gospil, but what delited me most was the
                        site of a niggers gal-lery wunst moar. What bizness has niggers on the same
                        floar with white folks? Are they goin to the same hevin? or is there any
                        hevin or hereafter for niggers? Ef I thot niggers was going to sit down with
                        me in Abraham's bosom, I'd resine my charge in disgust. There is a bare
                        possibility of thar going to the same hevin with white folks, but I don't
                        believe it. Why how would a nigger look robed in white? It wouldn't be
                        harmonious.</p>
                    <p>I was speshully pleased with the gloomy appearance of the aujience room, for
                        tho hevin is brite and calculated 2 make a man cheerful it is well in this
                        world of sin and sorrow to keep the spirits down by every artificul means,
                        so's to enjoy hevin the moar--when we git thare. So make your rooms "dank
                        and dreary"--its so impressive on the minds of children.</p>
                    <p>And now I must cloas with a delicate allushun 2 the quire. "When Music,
                        Heavenly Maid, was young," (which is quotations) I suppose she looked
                        eggactly like 1 of those beautiful gurls in the quire, leastways she ought
                        2. They was luvly and it did me good 2 see how lite harted they was! When
                        one stoppd rite in the middle of a verse, sung to that morneful old tune
                        Windham, and laffed at a sister singer who had made a mistake, and whispered
                        acrost the melojium 2 another to tell her about it, and when another threw a
                        comikle leer out of the N. E. corner of the right eye, because the
                        melojiumist's right hand little finger struck D flat instead of D natural,
                        and his left hand didn't come to time on the "Sownoress bass," and when
                        another thought it didn't make any differens with the Lord whether she sat
                        or stood to sing or sung at all or not, I thought "You are censible, you
                        little 'festive cusses.'" No use in feeling bad when one can help it. It
                        used ter be thought adviseable to feel the centiments we sung and show it in
                        our axions and tones &amp; mayhap tears, and I hev seen an aujience
                        weep--yes, I hev seen old white headed christians, who orto hev known
                        better, cry rite out because some unfashionable quire kept grindin out
                        pathos insted of pew-er singin. But I did hev to laff at that base singer
                        pumpin wind into the melojium. He was a fine lookin feller--looked like a
                        dekin. To appearens he was the body of the quire--the lite house--the
                        steeple. His was the "ORA-de-profundis (which is lattin for 2 lips round a
                        kavern). Whera should we look for the movement but 2 him? Where should we
                        look for the expresshun but to him? Where should we look for the--should we
                        look for the--! Yes, sir, right there! Just see at him with his left hand
                        onto the pump handle and his him book in his rite. "Right shoulder shift,"
                        Left shoulder down, head careens. "Right shoulder shift." Head floats again.
                        Left shoulder rises. As you were! Right shoulder shift. Left shoulder down.
                        Head bobs again. Right shoulder shift. <emph rend="italic">Frons
                        erectus</emph> (wich again is lattin). Left shoulder looms up agin from
                        behind mulojium. How cood U expect expresshun outo such a man? Gabriel would
                        have tried to stuff his pinyun inter his mouth to keep from laffin. Imagen
                        the effect whilst this him was sung:</p>
                    <p>(Pump) Sinners turn (pump) why will ye die? (pump)<lb/> God your Ma (pump)
                        ker asks you why? (pump)</p>
                    <p>Here, 2 compose myself, I went to studyin the gloomy walls, onto the which a
                        black shadder had been cast from the nigger gal-lery. I must say that a
                        church as wants pump music shood own a boy 2 run the pump. A nigger might do
                        it, only he's no bizness onto the same floor with white folks. You might,
                        however, run a handle up in 2 the nigger gal-lery 2 him.</p>
                    <p>I hope the Democracy won't forget 2 send me the monyermental fund, fur the
                        erecshun of the Gettysburg toom stone. I need it.<lb/> Yours truly,<lb/>

                    Templeton had been living in Shippensburg during the prior year. Evidently, he

                    session of the legislature failed to include a bill increasing the fees paid to
                    District Attorneys in Franklin county, fixing the cost of indictment in the Oyer
                    and Terminer at $12 and $6 for every bill ignored. Costs for bill and
                    prosecution in Quarter Sessions will remain $7 split between the parties, and $5
                    for all other bills prosecuted and ignored by the Quarter Sessions.</summary>
