                        was getting tired of telling,<br> What had oft been told before;<br>
                        Saying things I thought most cutting,<br> Suddenly there came a
                        butting,<br> And a wooly head was stuck in,<br> Stuck in at my office

                    <p>I was tired of darkey capers,<br> And bent close above my papers,<br>
                        Hoping thus the black intruder<br> Would go wander from my door.<br> But I
                        hoped and wished most vainly;<br> For he knocked and butted, plainly<br>

                        And I've come to ask in reason,<br> Is this now a proper season<br> To

                    <p>Ask your soldiers who extended<br> Help and succor as they wended<br>
                        Dubious paths 'mid Southern forest,<br> Faint and weary, sick and
                        sore?<br> Who it was that always waved them<br> Onward, praying God to
                        save them,<br> And return them as he gave them<br> To their homes and

                        asunder,<br> And the black and white stood close al-<br> Lied amidst the
                        battle's roar<br> If the fear of gun or halter<br> Ever caused us once to
                        falter?<br> If a fighting reputation<br> Did not greet the colored

                    note that any attempt to disfranchise deserters "must be made entirely effective
                    now, or it will never be done."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Senator M'Conaughy has read a bill in place relating to the votes of
                        deserters, which is now in the hands of the judiciary committee. It recites
                        in a preamble, the provisions of the act of Congress disfranchising
                        deserters, and also recites the fact that none but citizens have ever been
                        electors in the State. It then imposes a penalty of fine and imprisonment
                        upon election officers for receiving the votes of deserters; also upon
                        persons offering such votes, and upon any persons who advise and encourage
                        such persons to vote. The Adjutant General of the State is required by its
                        provisions to furnish an official list of all the deserters in the State, as
                        shown by the records, and file with the clerk of the quarter sessions in
                        each county, a certified list for the county, which record shall be received
                        as prima facie evidence of the fact of desertion;
                        but the person offering to vote may be sworn and disprove the record by his
                        own testimony before the election board, subject to the usual penalty for
                        perjury.</p>
                    <p>We do not assume to say whether this bill is right, or that it will meet the
                        peculiar circumstances of the case; but the fact that an able lawyer has
                        offered it, and that it will doubtless pass the careful revision of the
                        judiciary committee, gives assurance that, if passed at all, it will be
                        framed for practical results rather than to meet the wide-spread conviction
                        that deserters should not vote. Had the legislature acted on this vital
                        question several years ago, as did Ohio and some other States, there would
                        have been no difficulty in framing a law to meet the case fully; but when
                        legislation is to be perfected after the commission of the offence, and
                        nearly half the judicial tribunals and election boards mean to defy such
                        laws in any and every way they can, the perfection of a bill is by no means
                        an unimportant duty. To this end we bespeak for the proposed measure the
                        most careful consideration of the many able legal minds of the legislature,
                        so that we shall not enact laws to see them successfully defied.</p>
                    <p>The Union men of the legislature should appreciate the fact that the laws
                        relating to the disfranchisement of deserters must be made entirely
                        effective now, or it will never be done. Before two different courts of this
                        State, in Cumberland and Fayette, election officers have been compelled to
                        pay costs for refusing to nullify the act of Congress; and in Crawford, we
                        believe, election officers have been convicted for accepting such votes, and
                        there are now scores of actions on the case or indictments pending which
                        will be decided in the same conflicting manner. We do not hope to have the
                        law so settled by the Supreme Court during the present year, as to make all
                        accept a common duty and enforce it; and to the legislature, therefore, this
                        question is presented surrounded with many and grave embarrassments. The
                        time is past for any legislature that will not stand the highest judicial
                        test. The necessities of war belong to history; the laws of peace again
                        abide with us, and legislatures and courts must conform thereto. Instead of
                        the safety of the people being the supreme law now, in the supremacy of law
                        is alike the safety of the people and of the government.</p>
                    <p>We have in Pennsylvania not less than thirty thousand deserters. When treason
                        plunged us into causeless war and had grappled with the nation in deadly
                        conflict, they spurned their own priceless inheritance, and with matchless
                        perfidy to themselves and their country, they refused their aid to save the
                        noblest government of the world. They eminently deserve to be henceforth
                        aliens to the institutions they refused to maintain and strangers to the
                        great birth-right of American citizenship; but the retribution, however
                        just, must have all the sanctity and ceremony of law. What we desire is that
                        the remedy shall be complete in all the requirements of both law and
                        justice, and then a faithful people can enforce obedience in all sections of
                        the State.</p>

                    make any return of persons liable to military duty, treating the enrolling act

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>We closed our last article by stating, that when an unusual demand for gold
                        exists, our banking institutions speedily become drained of their gold, or
                        refuse, in violation of their obligations, to pay it out. This refusal is a
                        disregard of the requirements of law ordinarily regulating the operations of
                        these institutions, but they trust to the leniency of the legislatures, and
                        the public, for a continuance of their privileges, and begin to retrace all
                        their financial footsteps, preparatory to resuming the redemption of their
                        paper at as early a day as possible. In order to re-occupy a position, in
                        which they can again hope to do so, they contract their circulation, calling
                        for the payment of as much of the paper of individual debtors, as is
                        available. In the year 1837, the bank note circulation was $149,185,890. In
                        1843 it amounted to only $58,000,000. The sudden contraction of the currency
                        is a public calamity, ruinous to thousands of enterprising business men, who
                        had reason to regard themselves as in a prosperous condition. By decreasing
                        the quantity of the circulating medium, they render it more difficult for
                        their debtors to pay. No accommodations can longer be obtained from the
                        banks which heretofore had constituted the fountain from which flowed freely
                        the money that had served as the very life blood of the business community.
                        Other lenders are scarce and cautious. The banks, although delinquent
                        themselves in the payment of their notes, are exacting from their debtors.
                        In order to meet individual indebtedness lands must be sold. Purchasers are
                        few--prices are low--ruin and suffering abound. This has been the history of
                        banking under that law, with a currency composed of paper, resting on a
                        specie basis for its redemption.</p>
                    <p>Whether the present system of national banking, although undoubtedly in many
                        respects an improvement on the late state system, will, as claimed by its
                        advocates, obviate the evils of these calamitous expansions, and
                        contractions, remains to be proven. The old system embraced all the checks
                        and guards against the undue issue of paper, and penalties for the
                        enforcement of its redemption, that the jealous watchfulness and ingenuity
                        of a hostile, dominant political influence could devise. But it is a
                        self-evident fact, that in a country whose commercial intercourse with other
                        sections of the world results in an annual balance of indebtedness against
                        it, unless gold is a production of the soil of that country to an amount
                        exceeding that balance, a paper currency based on specie is an unreliable
                        representation of value. Unfortunately for the country, the balance of trade
                        is too frequently adverse to us. Excessive importation has too frequently
                        been succeeded by financial ruin and prostration of business.</p>
                    <p>It is manifest, we must either abandon our ruinous foreign expenditures, or
                        relinquish the idea of ever possessing a stable paper currency, based on
                        specie for its credit and redemption, unattended, occasionally with the
                        evils and disaster mentioned. Mr. Stillwell, of New York, in a recent
                        article in opposition to the views of Secretary M'Culloh, and advocating a
                        still more expansive paper currency than that now authorized by law, argues
                        that "the market price in this country on all imported goods is controlled
                        by prices in Europe, the tariff and the demand for exchange or gold. Every
                        per cent on the price of gold or exchange above par, is added to the price
                        of imported goods, in other words it acts like a tariff upon imported goods,
                        and this addition to the costs of imports is called protection to home
                        production or industry, because it enables the producer at home to get a
                        higher price." If the protection herein claimed has reference as it most
                        certainly should, to producers of articles competing with those of foreign
                        manufacture, is in my opinion delusive.</p>
                    <p>In what manner is the producer of the home article benefited? The high price
                        of gold raises at once that of every article that can be made to produce
                        gold abroad, including grain, flour, cotton, &amp;c. The advance in the
                        price of these necessaries of life steadily increases the cost of labor and
                        material to the home manufacturer. So that when he deducts the increase of
                        his expenses from the augmented price of his wares, he will realize but
                        little protection from that source.</p>
                    <p>Money, although regarded, as before stated, as a measure of value, is
                        considered by Mr. Carey, of Mass., who ranks high among the political
                        economists of the day, "a commodity, influenced by the law of supply and
                        demand." He argues that when wheat is abundant, a bushel of that grain will
                        command less wheat for a dollar, than when the currency is contracted and
                        money scarce." In other language, when money is scarce, it is dear, when
                        plenty it is cheap.</p>
                    <p>Hence arises the rule, sustained by the history of the markets of the
                        country, that the increase of the volume of currency of the country, is
                        always attended with a corresponding advance in the price of almost all
                        articles of consumption. In countries in which the currency is a metallic
                        one, and necessarily of limited extent, all articles of production are
                        proportionately low. On this subject Secretary McCulloh writes, "a reduction
                        of the currency reduces prices, and as prices are reduced, the demand for it
                        falls off, so that, paradoxical as it may appear, a diminution of the
                        currency may in fact increase the supply."</p>
                    <p>The truth of the latter part of this quotation, could only be realized when
                        business had had time to accommodate itself to the altered state of the
                        currency, certainly, not immediately subsequently to a contraction. The
                        Secretary admits in his report to Congress, that if the war could have been
                        prosecuted on a specie basis, the advance in prices occasioned by the demand
                        of the Government could have been held in reasonable check, but that, with a
                        paper money, all articles needed, responded in price to the daily increase
                        of the currency. On the 1st January, 1837, when the bank notes in
                        circulation amounted to $150,000,000, flour was $10 per bbl. On the --
                        January, 1843, when circulation was 58,000,000, flour fell to $4.69. It is
                        true, however, that the price of flour does not always furnish a correct
                        index of the effect of the currency on the markets, it being so much
                        influenced by the state of the foreign markets, and extent and quality of
                        crops of grain. But in the instance given, the diminution of price was
                        attributable to the reduction of the amount of, and consequent appreciation
                        of the currency. If the foregoing view is a correct one, a sufficient cause
                        for the present inflated prices would be found in our at present redundant
                        currency. The bank note circulation of this country in 1860 was
                        $207,000,000. Now, the paper currency, including United States notes amounts
                        to almost $800,000,000. In view of these facts, Mr. M'Culloh proposes a
                        reduction of the currency, by the gradual
                        withdrawal from circulation of the United States notes. This he deems
                        necessary, in order to moderate prices, check speculation, and restore
                        business to a healthy condition. The present apparent prosperity of the
                        country is a delusion, that, if not wisely controlled, will, ere many years,
                        be dispelled by the utter prostration of business and credit, and the
                        consequent suffering and want of thousands now happy in fancied security and
                        wealth. After the withdrawal from circulation of the U. S. notes, proposed
                        by the Secretary, the National Banks would doubtless augment their
                        circulation to the maximum allowed by law, which at present is $300,000,000.
                        The accommodation furnished by that volume would be ample for all the
                        legitimate necessities of business. In opposition to these views Mr.
                        Stillwell, of New York, a gentleman of eminence as a financier, advocates a
                        continuance of the present state of a redundant currency, and attributes the
                        present inflated prices to the ordinary influences of the law of supply and
                        demand. He argues, that in this country for several years past we have had
                        more buyers than sellers, and a very insufficient supply--hence the rise in
                        prices. That nearly 2,000,000 of the producing
                        classes of the country were withdrawn from their daily pursuits, and
                        converted into consumers. That during the war thousands of millions of
                        dollars worth of property were unprofitably consumed. In support of the
                        position, that prices respond promptly to the increase or diminution of
                        demand, he instances some facts that are worthy the reflection of any person
                        desiring to arrive at accurate conclusions, relative to the questions we
                        have been considering.</p>
                    <p>Two years after the commencement of the war, cotton in bags was scarce, and
                        advanced in price to one dollar per pound. Manufactured cotton was then
                        plenty, and did not advance half as much. At the close of the war, cotton in
                        bags became more plenty, and fell more than fifty per cent. Manufactured
                        cotton being then scarce, after a short depression, suddenly rose to a
                        greater price than before. He instances California, in which country, when
                        the currency was gold, a few years since, the price of labor and every
                        article of consumption, owing to the great demand and short supply, rose
                        above any of the prices we are now paying here in currency for the same
                        articles.</p>
                    <p>He also attributes the advance in prices, in part, to the high rates of
                        exchange, which as before stated, he claims acts as a tariff on all imported
                        goods. Now, it is questionable whether the high rates of exchange are not
                        the result, in part at least, of the depreciation of the paper currency,
                        increased to redundancy. Gold and exchange have advanced, only in comparison
                        with a currency many times the amount of the gold it professes to represent.
                        In addition to demand and supply, and high exchange, he enumerates the
                        tariff and internal revenue laws, as influencing prices. Consistently
                        adhering to his main position that demand and supply regulates all prices,
                        he attributes the varying price of gold at different periods of the war,
                        solely to the foreign demand being greater or less. He attributes the fall
                        in gold, subsequent to the close of the war, to the reduction of the demand
                        for gold occasioned by the sale of $300,000,000 worth of bonds of the United
                        States in Europe. Was this fall not rather owing to the appreciation of our
                        paper, occasioned by the termination of the war? Had the war continued the
                        Government would have become still more heavily burdened with debt, until
                        her credit would have been ruined. It was the belief in the ability of the
                        Government to suppress the rebellion, and ultimately to liquidate her
                        indebtedness, that sustained the credit of the Government during the war.
                        But when, upon the termination of the war, belief became certainty,
                        increased confidence in the solvency of the Government, at home and abroad,
                        was the natural result. United States notes appreciated as well as United
                        States bonds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stillwell argues that the withdrawal of U. S. notes would be ruinous to
                        the business of the country. If withdrawn gradually as proposed, leaving a
                        larger currency than we enjoyed previous to the war substituted for it, how
                        can it produce such disastrous effects, especially if increase or diminution
                        in the quantity does not influence prices? It is true debtors, including the
                        government, would be compelled to pay their debts in a currency dearer than
                        the one in which they were contracted. This they had reason to expect when
                        their indebtedness was created; and they of all classes most require a
                        remedy for existing financial evils. Should the monetary revulsion,
                        glimmerings of which some fancy they already see in the distance, be visited
                        upon us, individual credit, at least, would be annihilated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. S. argues that the credit of the government is better security for the
                        ultimate redemption of the currency than any specie basis that can be
                        devised, and that the value of the National bank notes being thus
                        satisfactorily secured, the quantity that the banks should be allowed to
                        issue, should be unlimited, except by the law of supply and demand. This is
                        begging the question. How secure the value with an undue quantity? True, he
                        state elsewhere that money is "that which redeems debts, and is not itself a
                        subject for redemption," and adds that "coined
                        paper or legal tenders are an addition to gold, not a substitute for it."
                        This would certainly be a very pleasant view of that portion of its
                        indebtedness for the government to take, but I fear that it is one that but
                        few holders of its notes would enjoy.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the deduction I would make relative to the inquiry first
                        herein propounded, is that the present inflated prices are attributable to
                        the combined influence of the following causes, which decrease in degree of
                        effect in the order in which they are enumerated: redundant currency;
                        unusual demand for and short supply of most articles of consumption; the
                        internal revenue exactions and the tariff.</p>
                    <p>There are some other questions, somewhat discussed in this article, that your
                        readers may determine for themselves. I have already occupied more of your
                        columns than I had intended.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the second week of court proceedings, the following cases were "disposed
                    of by jury verdicts. J. W. Douglas vs. Nicholas Bonebrake--Feigned issue, framed
                    to try the validity of a judgement given by John Ditch to David Royer, Trustee
                    of Mary Ditch, wife of John Ditch. Verdict for the plaintiff. Peter Stenger vs.
                    J. Philip Roman--Feigned issue, framed to try the validity of a judgement given
                    by Hezekiah Easton to the defendant in this issue. Plaintiff claimed judgement
                    was usurious and in violation of a contract between Easton and the defendant.
                    Verdict for the defendant. Louisa McKesson, Executor of S. R. McKesson, dec'd,
                    vs. William Adams. Judgement opened. Defendant bought a farm in Montgomery
                    township from Samuel R. McKesson, the farm having been purchased by McKesson at
                    a Sheriff's sale as the property of Jacob Rinehart and wife. Mrs. Rinehart has
                    made a contract with Frederick Foreman prior to the Sheriff's sale to put out a
                    crop of wheat and in consideration of the lateness of the season he was to have
                    two-thirds of the products which he carried off. The defendant claimed to have
                    the value of this wheat deducted from the judgement he had given for purchase
                    money. He failed in his claim. Verdict for plaintiff for $605.42. Philip Karper
                    vs. Benjamin Cook and John Noel. Summons in debt founded on two promissory
                    notes. Noel being endorser for Cook. Cook made no defence. The counsel for Noel
                    rested their defence on the ground of lunacy and the habitual drunkenness of the
                    defendant. There was much conflicting testimony. Verdict for the plaintiff for
                    $769.29. William Wilhelm vs. D. S. Reisher. Assumpsit. Plaintiff is a cattle
                    broker of Baltimore and had a contract with defendant to purchase and send to
                    market cattle for their joint profit. The defendant contended there was a
                    partnership and that plaintiff had mistaken his action--Account Render being his
                    remedy. After repeated asseverations and denials by the parties as to this
                    point, a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff by agreement for $1,800. Marcy
                    C. Miller vs. John H. Hartle. Ejectment for a mill and tract of land in Antrim
                    township. Title was admitted in Michael Zellar, who made a deed to Henry Miller
                    and Henry Miller, Jr., went into possession. Henry Miller, Jr., shortly after
                    died. The defendant purchased the property in question from Henry Miller, Sr.,
                    during his lifetime and went into possession. This action was brought by the
                    widow of the younger Henry Miller and the question at issue was for whom the
                    deed was intended, the plaintiff claiming the title by parol gift form the
                    father to the son, aside from the fact asserted that the deed was intended for
                    him. Verdict for the defendant.<br>(Names in announcement:  J. W.

                        Mrs. Rinehart had made a contract with Frederick Foreman prior to the
                        Sheriff's sale to put out a crop of wheat and in consideration of the
                        lateness of the season he was to have two-thirds of the products, which he
                        carried off. The defendant claimed to have the value of this wheat deducted
                        from the judgement he had given for purchase money. He failed in his claim.
                        Verdict for plaintiff for $605.42. Brewer and Sharpe for Plff.; Kimmel and
                        M'Lellan for defendant.</p>
                    <p>Philip Karper vs. Benjamin Cook and John Noel. Summons in debt founded on two
                        promissory notes. Noel being endorser for Cook. Cook made no defence. The
                        counsel for Noel rested their defence on the ground of lunacy and the
                        habitual drunkenness of this defendant. There was much conflicting
                        testimony. Verdict for the plaintiff for $769,29. Geo. Eyster, Kimmell,
                        McLellan and Rowe for Pl'ff. Sharpe, Brewer and Gehr for defendant.</p>
                    <p>William Wilhelm vs. D. S. Reisher. Assumpsit. Plaintiff is a cattle broker of
                        Baltimore and had a contract with defendant to purchase and send to market
                        cattle for their joint profit. The defendant contended there was a
                        partnership and that plaintiff had mistaken his action--Account Render being
                        his remedy. After repeated asseverations and denials by the parties as to
                        this point, a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff by agreement for $1800.
                        Brewer and Sharpe for the plaintiff. Kimmell and McLellan for defendant.</p>
                    <p>Mary C. Miller vs. John H. Hartle. Ejectment for a mill and tract of land in
                        Antrim township. Title was admitted in Michael Zellar, who made a deed to
                        Henry Miller, and Henry Miller, Jr., went into possession. Henry Miller,
                        Jr., shortly after died. The defendant purchased the property in question
                        from Henry Miller, Sr., during his lifetime and went into possession. This
                        action was bought by the widow of the younger Henry Miller and the question
                        at issue was for whom the deed was intended, the plaintiff claiming the
                        title by parol gift from the father to the son, aside from the fact asserted
                        that the deed was intended for him. Verdict for the defendant. Reilly and
                        Sharpe for the plaintiff; Kimmell and M'Lellan for defendant.</p>

<b>Local Items--The Normal School</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece laments the fact that local residents' interest in establishing a
                    normal school in Chambersburg has cooled since the project was initially
                    proposed. Because of its proximity to border counties and Virginia and Maryland,

                    number of students, which would inevitably add a significant infusion of cash to
