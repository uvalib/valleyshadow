                    <p>It is a curious fact that though the Yankees promise themselves an early
                        conquest of the South, and a speedy termination of the war, they are unable
                        at this time to show decided demonstrations of fight at but two point in the
                        Confederacy--Charleston and Chattanooga. They have just been whipped out of
                        Texas, been terribly defeated in Louisiana, are fully matched by the
                        indomitable Price in Arkansas, and are standing stock still before Lee in
                        Virginia! Even at Charleston, they and their approaches to the city
                        contested and ostructed [sic] at every point with no early prospect of
                        securing their much coveted prise [sic], and at Chattanooga the great army
                        of the Cumberland is beseiged [sic] and threatened with disaster by Bragg.
                        Really the Yankees must be the most hopeful or the most blinded and deluded
                        people on the earth, to anticipate the early conquest of the south, in the
                        light of such a condition of things as these facts present. A cause was
                        never more hopeless--never so desperate and impossible of accomplishment as
                        that which they have so rashly undertaken, nor has there been a time since
                        the commencement of the war, when the prospect of the South were so bright
                        and cheering as at this moment.</p>

<b>Our Finances</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A long and thorough discussion of the state of the Confederate currency,

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our last issue, we adverted to the present depreciated condition of our
                        currency, as being the question above all others save the failure of our
                        arms in the field most fraught with danger to our cause, and most urgently
                        demanding the serious consideration and prompt action of our Confederate and
                        State governments. The opinion expressed that the excess in the volume of
                        the currency, is the original and persistent cause of our financial
                        difficulties, will not likely meet with a single dissentient [sic] voice.
                        That the depreciation in the value of the currency is attributable directly
                        to this cause alone, we do not think can be confidently asserted. We know
                        that those who write on the subject would fain [sic] attribute no importance
                        to the want of confidence of our people in the ultimate success of our
                        cause, for fear of fostering such a spirit by holding it up to the people as
                        an existent fact. But, although they are right in the assumption that the
                        people with great unanimity confidently believe in our final success, yet
                        the human mind is prone to view the events of the future as probabilities,
                        which seldom partake of the nature of what we term moral certainties. The
                        views of the future too, are altogether different according to the
                        intelligence and disposition of the individual, whether he be the sanguine
                        enthusiast, who can see already a people basking in the sunshine of
                        prosperity, and peace and plenty, or the poor dupe of his own dark fancies,
                        who sees the evidence of ruin, and desolation and starvation staring him in
                        the face at every turn. People will calculate chances, and though the cause
                        to which we refer has its effect in making men prefer real estate or
                        property of almost any kind to treasury notes or Confederate bonds, yet the
                        most prominent cause of the depreciation of those notes must be attributed
                        to their redundancy. But there is another cause of still greater moment and
                        which now, beforehand, exerts its baneful influence in its effect. The
                        people can't see how the Government is to pay its debts save by repudiation,
                        a word which is the embodiment of so monstrous a heresy in national morals
                        and national policy, that even before it shows its hideous form in the
                        noon-day sun as a national act, it exerts its influence for the production
                        of evil. But more of this anon.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, another cause of the depreciation of our currency which is
                        not often considered. It must be remembered that prior to the war the whole
                        South was literally flooded with products of Northern and European
                        manufactures, embracing the whole amount of its imports, and requiring a
                        certain volume of currency to effect the exchanges in their distribution to
                        the farther limits of the Confederacy. The staples of the South usually
                        exported to meet these demands exist at present stored away in its
                        warehouses, and are not changing hands as they do in times when their [sic]
                        is an outlet for them in foreign trade. It follows, that even if the volume
                        of the currency had remained the same as at the beginning of the war, it
                        would have depreciated in proportion to the excess it bore to the
                        necessities of trade under a system of blockade, and much more when the
                        volume was further increased by the issue of treasury notes. In addition to
                        this fact the first issues of these notes were distributed through the
                        States of Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, and in fine
                        all that portion of the Confederacy now partially or wholly in the hands of
                        the enemy. As in our defensive policy we gradually withdrew our forces from
                        these regions, the currency becoming useless was also contracted within
                        narrower limits for effecting the exchanges for a less amount of property
                        and fewer business transactions, where by its excess was made still more
                        manifest. We have thus adverted to the principal causes of the deplorable
                        financial condition into which the country has been plunged. That it
                        originated in bad policy when we were entering upon the war, will be
                        generally conceded. Instead of levying a tax sufficient to meet the expenses
                        of the Government in the very commencement of our struggle, for fear perhaps
                        of producing discontent amongst some portions of our people, or for other
                        reasons, we have incurred the responsibilities and dangers of a financial
                        system calculated to embarrass the wisest legislation. If an issue of
                        treasury notes had then become necessary, the Government had it in its power
                        to supply itself with an amount of specie at low rates sufficient to pay the
                        interest on a corresponding issue of its interest bearing bonds, which at
                        that time would have been in great demand at a much higher premium than any
                        other stocks in the market. From the sale of these bonds large profits would
                        have been realized, directly, owing to the high premium at which they would
                        have sold, and if the investments thus made had exceeded the issue of
                        treasury notes indirectly in the effect of the consequent check upon the
                        prices of those articles necessary to carry on the war. But a different
                        policy was adopted--The Government committed its first great blunder in
                        attempting to wage war upon a credit system simply, and that too of a kind
                        of credit which in expanding the volume of the currency gave origin to a
                        rise in prices, and consequently to an increased expenditure demanding a
                        still further issue of its notes. Thus at every increase of the circulation
                        the prices rising correspondingly, the issue of treasury notes and the
                        increase of expenditure became alternately causes and effect. No timely
                        legislation was afterwards adopted to arrest the progress of the evil, and
                        thus we find ourselves, when its deplorable consequences are becoming
                        intolerable, obliged to discuss the means by which successful [illegible]
                        may be applied.--The remedy we</p>

                    <p>It is well known that an army of Yankees, several thousand in number, have an

                        adjoins Greenbrier county. At the very hour mentioned, namely, three
                        o'clock, P.M., they are daily subjected to a drill, in which they go through
                        all their various military exercises. Is it not probable, &amp; more
                        than probable that these serial soldiers were produced by the same cause
                        which produce the spectre [sic] of the Brocken, and other similar
                        apparitions? That owing to the accidental condensation of some atmospheric
                        vapors at the precise time they were drilling, on the evening particularly
                        specified--an atmospherical speculum was formed by the hand of nature in the
                        mountainous locality of Mr. Piercy's residence, and that the figures seen by
