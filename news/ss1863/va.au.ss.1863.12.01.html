<b>Victory Or Annihilation</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A strong appeal from the pulpit for a steadfast commitment to a
                    continuation of the war. Using scripture and emotional rhetoric, the Bishop from
                    Georgia paints a dismal picture of the consequences of defeat for the South.<br>

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"Dr. Elliott, the patriotic Bishop of Georgia, in a late sermon preached
                    in Savannah, exhibits the alternative before us in a few sentences pregnant with

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Forward, my hearers, with our shields locked and our trust is God, is our
                        only movement now. It is too late even to go backward. We might have gone
                        backward a year ago, when our armies were victoriously thundering at the
                        gates of Washington, and were keeping at bay the Hessians of the West had we
                        been content to bear humilation [sic] for ourselves and degradation for our
                        children. But even that is no longer left us. It is now victory or
                        unconditional submission; submission not to the conservative and Christian
                        people of the North, but to a party of infidel fanatcs, [sic] with an army
                        of needy and greedy soldiers at their backs. Who shall be able to restrain
                        them in their hour of victory? When that moment approaches, when the danger
                        shall seem to be over and the spoils are ready to be divided, every outlaw
                        will rush to fill their ranks, every adventurer will rush to swell their
                        legions, and they will sweep down upon the South as the hosts of Attila did
                        upon the fertile fields of Italy. And shall you find in defeat that mercy,
                        which you did not find in victory? You may slumber now, but you will awake
                        to a fearful reality. You may lie upon your beds of ease, and dream that
                        when it is all over you will be welcomed back to all the privileges and
                        immunities of citizens, but how terrible will be your disappoinment [sic]!
                        You will have an ignoble home, overrun by hordes of insolent slaves and
                        rapacious soldiers. You will wear the badge of a conquered race. Pariahs
                        among your fellow creatures, yourselves degraded, your delicate wives and
                        gentle children trust down to menial service, insulted, perhaps dishonored.
                        Think you that these victorious hordes, made up in the large part of the
                        sweepings of Europe, will leave you any thing? As well might the lamb expect
                        mercy from the wolf. Power which is checked and fettered by a doubtful
                        contest is very different from power victorious, triumphant and
                        irresponsible. The friends whom you have known and loved at the North; who
                        have sympathized with you in your trials, and to whom you might have looked
                        to for comfort and protection, will have enough to do then to take care of
                        themselves. The surges that sweep over us will carry them away in its
                        refluent tide. Oh! for the tongue of a prophet, to paint for you what is
                        before you, unless you repent and turn to the Lord, and realize that "His
                        hand is upon all them for good that seek Him." The language of Scripture is
                        alone adequate to describe it: "The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon
                        is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness. They that did feed
                        delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet
                        embrace dunghilia. They ravished the women of Zion and the maids in the
                        cities of Judah. They took the young men to grind, and the children fell
                        under the wood. The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
                        mourning. The crown has fallen from our heart; wo [sic] unto us that have
                        sinned."</p>

                    cruising the Bay of Bengal and keeping Northern ships confined to their harbors.

<b>Mr. Stuart's Scheme</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A summary of a letter from Mr. Stuart to the Richmond Whig explains more
                    fully his economic plans and seeks to address the concerns of adversaries of the
                    plan. Stuart calls for the government to cease currency production and to apply
                    an export duty on cotton, tobacco, and naval stores. While some object to the
                    burden these duties will place on producers of these goods, Mr. Stuart argues
                    that when a good is scarce and desirable, the increased cost will be passed on
                    to the consumer (i.e. foreign markets) rather than borne by the producer.<br>
