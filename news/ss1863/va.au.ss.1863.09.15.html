                    <p>Executive Department, <br>Richmond, Va., Sept. 7, 1863. </p>
                    <p>
                        Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Delegates:
                    </p>
                    <p>In this crisis I have deemed it advisable to convene you in extraordinary
                        session, in order that the freshly chosen representatives of the people may
                        consult and devise such measures as will be calculated to meet the existing
                        emergency in public affairs. The war has now been in progress for more than
                        two years and a half, and has been prosecuted against us with a ferocity
                        unparalleled in all past struggles between contending parties. It has been
                        conducted upon the avowed principle of subjugating us, either by force of
                        arms or by visiting upon our people the horrors of famine. Hence it is, that
                        foiled and defeated again and again upon the field of battle, they have
                        adopted the policy of desolating our farms, destroying our crops, burning
                        our dwellings, stealing and carrying away our property, leaving our wives
                        and children to perish by the slow tortures of starvation. It is no longer a
                        war for the preservation of the old Union, as it was originally proclaimed
                        to be, but it has degenerated into a war for the emancipation of our slaves;
                        and this purpose the Administration at Washington propose to accomplish,
                        even if the extermination of the white race, of all ages, sexes and
                        conditions, of the Southern Confederacy shall be the result. We have no
                        alternative therefore, but to defend ourselves with all the power, energy
                        and ability we can command. We must succeed, if we would be a free and
                        independent people, worthy of the illustrious ancestry from which we
                        descended. To succeed we must have union, harmony, concert, conciliation,
                        courage, energy and determined resolution on the part of rulers and people.
                        We must cultivate one towards another the noble virtues of prudence,
                        toleration, charity and forbearance.</p>
                    <p>With these general remarks, I proceed to the consideration of such subjects
                        are of special interest at this time, and in my judgment demand legislative
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The subject first in importance, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, is
                        the best means of providing an adequate force for the local defence of the
                        State against invasion or raids, and for the execution of the laws in case a
                        resort to force shall at any time become necessary. The entire military
                        force of the State has been absorbed by the conscription law, and we are
                        thus left, in a time of greatest peril, with no militia organization for the
                        defence of the Commonwealth. This want can be and must be supplied with as
                        little delay as practicable.</p>
                    <p>As to the plan of raising this force, I am aware there is much diversity of
                        opinion. The difference, however, is reconcilable, if the subject is
                        considered and discussed in a patriotic spirit.</p>
                    <p>Let a force to consist of all able-bodied persons between the ages of sixteen
                        and sixty, not in the Confederate service, be organized, corresponding with
                        the force now organized in the cities of Richmond, Petersburg and Lynchburg.
                        Let them be regularly enroled [sic], formed into companies, battalions and
                        regiments, and officered in such manner as will be most likely to secure
                        efficient, intelligent and energetic men. They should be drilled at proper
                        intervals, so as to be well instructed in the evolutions and the manuel
                        [sic], and prepared for efficient service whenever the necessity shall
                        arise. The act should also define what is local defence, as there is much
                        contrariety of opinion in regard to it. Some think that local defence
                        consists in remaining at home, and under no circumstances to be taken out of
                        the city or county in which the company is organized. This, in my view, is a
                        most mistaken notion of the meaning of the term "local defence" and if it is
                        to prevail, will work great mischief, and render the organization of little
                        value in giving protection to our people. My opinion is, that if the city of
                        Richmond can be defended more certainly fifty miles from it than immediately
                        around, or in it, that locality is the proper place for its defence, and the
                        local militia should be required to make the defence there. The officer
                        charged with the defence of any particular locality is presumed to be better
                        acquainted with the mode of defending it, and the best point for defending
                        it successfully, and he should direct all troops so as best to secure the
                        end desired.</p>
                    <p>The object of such organization should be, to give adequate protection to all
                        parts of the Commonwealth. We must not only provide for the defence of the
                        counties, cities and towns, by the local forces in and immediately around
                        them, but we must, under the law which is proposed to be passed, have
                        authority to order other contiguous counties to their aid and support. A
                        force, whose operations are to be confined by county, city or town
                        boundaries, can prove of but little value in checking raids, or in executing
                        and enforcing obedience to the laws.</p>
                    <p>This organization should be mad to embrace the foreign population who are
                        located amongst us. This foreign population may be said to consist of three
                        classes: First, those who have been regularly naturalized, and who are
                        therefore citizens embraced by our laws relating to the public defence;
                        second, those who are domiciliated amongst us, and have been living in our
                        midst and prosecuting various branches of business, and who left their
                        native land with no purpose or intention of returning to it; and lastly,
                        those who are temporarily sojourning amongst us. The first class are in
                        service under the militia laws, and the second class should be required to
                        go into service for public defence of the soil on which they reside. The
                        latter class, who are sojourners, engaged in no regular business, should be
                        exempt. I recommend, therefore, that in your legislation upon this subject,
                        the second class above referred to, shall be clearly and distinctly
                        embraced.</p>
                    <p>On this subject I desire to present another recommendation, in regard to the
                        act passed by your predecessors on the 20th day of November, 1862,
                        authorizing persons of certain religious denominations in the State to
                        exempt themselves from military service in the war, by the payment of five
                        hundred dollars each. Subsequently Congress passed an act of like character;
                        and these persons availed themselves of it, and wee discharged from
                        liability to all military service in the Confederate army. I regard this
                        provision as substantially a violation of the Constitution, inasmuch as it
                        grants exemptions to certain classes of persons, which are not granted to
                        others.</p>
                    <p>In this war, all classes who reside amongst us should be required to perform
                        duty of some sort, if they are within the military age. If they are
                        unwilling to bear arms, there are various other duties connected with the
                        army and the general defence which they can perform, and which they should
                        be required to perform. They are citizens, property holders to a large
                        extent, interested therefore in all that concerns other citizens, and should
                        be required to perform their part. In some countries this class of persons
                        are required to aid in the construction of fortifications, and I see no just
                        reason why they should not required to do so here. This branch of service
                        must be maintained by somebody; and if their religious convictions will not
                        allow them to go into the ranks for the defence and maintainance [sic] of
                        the common cause, why cannot they do this?</p>
                    <p>It will not do to say that they are opposed to war, and can do nothing that
                        will tend to its prosecution. The law is based upon the principle that they
                        are bound to do something--otherwise they would not be taxed the sum of $500
                        each. That money goes into the treasury, and is drawn therefrom to defray
                        the expenses of the war--and to this extent at least, they are aiding and
                        supporting it. If they can aid to the extent of five hundred dollars in
                        money, can they not aid by labor or other service?</p>
                    <p>A state of war imposes a personal obligation upon every citizen within the
                        military age, and he should be required to discharge it. When the country is
                        invaded, our dwellings burned, our lands laid waste, our property destroyed
                        or carried away, our citizens imprisoned, it is their duty to step forward
                        promptly and aid in repelling the invader. Ministers and members of other
                        religious denominations, equally as conscientious, are in the field. I
                        recommend, therefore, that this law be repealed.</p>
                    <p>Besides these provisions, stringent regulations should be adopted to prevent
                        desertion or straggling from service without leave. It ought to be made the
                        duty of the local militia to arrest any officer or soldier found aboard from
                        his corps without a furlough, and cause him to be forthwith returned to his
                        position or delivered to the nearest provost marshal. The officers in
                        command in any city or county through which such persons might be passing or
                        sojourning, might be invested with like authority, and be clothed with power
                        to detail a sufficient number of men to make the arrest effective, and to
                        compel the parties in default to render the service to which they are
                        liable. It might also with propriety be made the duty of company officers,
                        at regular intervals, to report all persons who have not been exempted and
                        who are liable to conscription, that our armies may be kept full and
                        efficient, and at all times be prepared to meet and repel the enemy. Any act
                        you may pass should provide for the speedy and certain punishment of all who
                        fail or refuse to obey lawful orders, and prescribe some mode for the
                        removal of incompetent or unfaithful officers. The experience of the last
                        two years renders legislation upon this subject necessary.</p>
                    <p>* * * Virginia went into this contest after the most serious and calm
                        consideration--with a firm resolve to do her whole duty to herself and her
                        Confederate sisters--to take all the consequences, however horrible they
                        might be. Her people never quailed--nor have they murmured under the
                        repeated wrongs and aggressions they have suffered. She was not the first to
                        enter this struggle, nor will she be the first to die for peace--unless that
                        peace be accompanied by an unqualified recognition of the independence of
                        the Southern Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>The General Assembly, at its last session, prescribed that no Confederate
                        issues of a date anterior to April 6th, 1863, should be received in payment
                        of State taxes. I am unable to comprehend either the State taxes. I am
                        unable to comprehend either the wisdom or policy of this legislation. It is
                        calculated to impair confidence in the currency of the Confederate
                        Government, and indeed is almost the only currency in circulation in the
                        greater portion of the State.</p>
                    <p>When the government casts suspicious upon its currency, and the State
                        governments and the banks and railroad companies do the same thing, the
                        people may well become alarmed. The consequences cannot fail to be most
                        disastrous. We cannot change the action of Congress, but we can remedy the
                        errors of our own legislation, and thus show that we are disposed to uphold
                        the credit and currency of the Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>On the 29th day of August last a requisition was made upon me by the
                        Secretary of War for 5,340 slaves, to work upon the fortifications around
                        Richmond. Copies of the papers are herewith submitted to your consideration;
                        and I particularly invite your attention to the draft made upon the several
                        counties. The apportionment upon the counties seems to be entirely
                        arbitrary, and bears very unequally. In some cases five per cent of the
                        slaves is called for, and in other cases less than one per cent. Thus,
                        Amelia, with upwards of 7,000 slaves assessed with taxes in 1862 is required
                        to furnish 50, while Alleghany with less than 700, is required to furnish
                        30. The county of Albemarle, with 12,631, is called upon for 200, while
                        Brunswick, with 9,212, is called upon for 250. The county of Augusta, with
                        4,800, is called upon for 80, while the county of Rockingham, with 2,164, is
                        called upon for 100. Hanover, with 8,621, is called upon for 30, while
                        Prince Edward, with 6,998, is called upon for 150. These examples will
                        suffice to show how unequally this burden is distributed; and I trust that
                        some amendment will be made to the law, which will afford protection against
                        such inequality.</p>
                    <p>The law requires that "the value of such slaves as may escape from the
                        Confederate authorities and not return to their owners, or be seized or be
                        killed by the public enemy, or may, by want of due diligence on the part of
                        the authorities of the Confederate States, in any manner be lost to the
                        owners, shall be paid by the Confederate States to the owners of such
                        slaves; and in like manner compensation shall be paid for any injury to
                        slaves arising from the want of due diligence on the part of the authorities
                        of the Confederate States." Many cases of peculiar hardship, arising from
                        the loss of slaves, have been brought to my attention, and much complaint
                        has been made by the owners, in consequence of the fact that they have not
                        received the value as provided for in this act. In several cases the only
                        slave capable of field labor that the owner possessed has been lost, and
                        compensation not having been made, he has been unable to supply his place.
                        If the value had been promptly paid, the hardship in such cases would have
                        been greatly relieved. I invoke your early attention to this subject, of so
                        much importance to our common constituents.</p>
                    <p>Since the commencement of this war, Virginia has been called upon to mourn
                        over the loss of many of her gallant sons; but of all her jewels, the most
                        brilliant was the illustrious Lieutenant General Thomas J. Jackson--a
                        graduate of West Point--highly distinguished in the Mexican war, and at the
                        opening of the present war a quiet unpretending professor in our State
                        Military Institute. He was called from the professor's chair to the field;
                        and his sagacity, his energy and the unparalleled success which crowned his
                        efforts, won for him a reputation that made him the pride of his own
                        State--endeared him to the people of the Confederacy--attracted to him the
                        attention of the nations of the earth, and compelled the respect and
                        admiration even of those heartless enemies who have drenched our land in
                        blood, and brought wailing and lamentation to the firesides of thousands of
                        their own misguided people! For decision of character--for stern and
                        unbending resolution--for pure and elevated patriotism--for sound and
                        inflexible integrity, and for prompt and energetic action, he was surpassed
                        by no man of his times. The record of his achievements will constitute some
                        of the brightest pages in the history of the war, when that history shall
                        have been written. His reputation as a military leader of the highest
                        ability and merit, has been fairly and firmly established in the judgment of
                        the army and the country, and his name will be honored and his fame will be
                        cherished.</p>
                    <p>"While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls a wave."</p>
                    <p>The extortioner is still pursuing his heartless traffic and amassing his
                        gains. The war to him is a Godsend, and he would not have it terminated for
                        any earthly consideration. He shares none of its hardships--he suffers none
                        of its dangers. He has, perhaps, hired a substitute, who, for a pecuniary
                        consideration, agreed to be shot at in his place. Such men are found every
                        where throughout the Confederacy; and it is time something were done to put
                        an end to their money making business.</p>
                    <p>I have been investigating this subject, in hope that I would be able to make
                        some practical recommendation that would check, if it did not eradicate this
                        evil. In the first volume of the Revised Code of 1819, page 551, I find an
                        act which was passed in 1777, entitled "an act to prevent forestalling,
                        regrating, engrossing and public vendues [sic];" which, with very slight
                        amendments, would, if re-enacted, check in a great measure this growing
                        evil. I invite your attention to it, and recommend that some similar act be
                        passed at this session.</p>
                    <p>The finances of the State are in a highly prosperous condition--much more
                        prosperous, indeed, than could have been anticipated, under the
                        circumstances which surround us. The numerous demands made upon the revenue
                        is increasing, and the people, with that noble spirit which has ever
                        characterized Virginians, cheerfully pay their taxes, and thus maintain the
                        credit and uphold the character of the commonwealth.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The news received from Charleston, since the issue of last week, has been
                        alternately bad and good--in butcher's phrase, "with a streak of lean, and a
                        streak of fat." On the 6th, the bombardment was kept up all day without
                        intermission, and about 150 of our men were killed and wounded at batteries
                        Wagner and Gregg. It is supposed that the loss of the enemy was very great.</p>
                    <p>The enemy having advanced their sappers up to the very moat of Wagner, and it
                        being impossible to hold the island longer, Gen. Beauregard ordered the
                        evacuation, which was executed between 8 P.M. and 1 A. M., with success. We
                        spiced the guns of Wagner and Gregg, and withdrew noiselessly in forty
                        barges. Only one barge, containing twelve men, was captured.</p>
                    <p>On the 7th, Admiral Dahlgreen demanded the surrender of fort Sumter, when
                        Gen. Beauregard replied that he could have it when he should take and hold
                        it, and that before that time such demands were puerile and unbecoming. At 6
                        o'clock P. M. the iron-clads and monitors approached Fort Sumter closer than
                        usual and opened a hot fire against it. One batteries on Sullivan's Island,
                        including Fort Moultrie, replied heavily.</p>
                    <p>After our forces evacuated battery Wagner, the enemy garrisoned it with a
                        negro regiment--the 54th Massachusetts and the detested flag of that State
                        now waves over that battery. On the 8th about noon the enemy fired the
                        village of Moultrieville, on Sullivan's Island, in several places with
                        incendiary shell.</p>
                    <p>On the night of the 8th, the enemy, about midnight, approached in about
                        thirty barges with the view of capturing Fort Sumter by assault. Our forces
                        were not taken by surprise, as the enemy expected, and at the proper time,
                        Fort Moultrie and Battery Bee opened upon them, simultaneously with the
                        infantry in Fort Sumter.</p>
                    <p>The Yankees succeeded in landing a portion of the force at the ruin, but
                        after fifteen minutes contest, in which the Charleston Battalion fought
                        chiefly with brick bats and hand grenades, were driven back, and retreated
                        in disorder.</p>
                    <p>The following is Gen. Beauregard's official despatch.</p>
                    <p>CHARLESTON, Sept. 9, 1863.</p>
                    <p>To Gen. S. Cooper.--During last night thirty of
                        the enemy's launches attacked Fort Sumtor [sic]. Preparations had been made
                        for such an event. At a concerted signal all the batteries bearing on
                        Sumter, assisted by one gunboat ram properly located, were thrown out. The
                        garrison behaved with gallantry and coolness, Maj. Elliott commanding the
                        post. The enemy was completely repulsed, leaving one hundred and fifteen
                        prisoners, thirteen officers included, from 4 boats and colors. Nobody hurt
                        on our side. <br>G. T. Beauregard, <br>Gen. Com'd'g. </p>
                    <p>The enemy brought with them the flag which waved over Sumter when Gen'l
                        Beauregard caused Maj. Anderson to haul it down. They hoped to replace it
                        upon the Fort, amid the extravagant rejoicings of the whole Yankee nation;
                        but alas for them,</p>
                    <p>"The best laid schemes o' mice and men <br>Gang aft aglee" </p>
                    <p>and the flag was captured by our men, and will never rejoice the Yankees by
                        waving over Fort Sumter. That cherished object has been defeated--that dear
                        hope has been crushed in the bud, and deep is the mortification, and great
                        is the disappointment of the whole Yankee nation. They will not relish
                        codfish for several months.</p>
                    <p>On the 10th nothing of interest occurred.</p>
                    <p>On the 11th one of our shells from [illegible] Island exploded the enemy's
                        magazine at Battery Gregg, causing great confusion there.</p>
