<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish in this issue the Impressment Bill as it passed both Houses of
                        Congress, and congratulate the producers on having a law passed which
                        guarantees to them "just compensation" for whatever may be impressed. We
                        would advise all concerned to preserve this copy of the "Spectator"
                        containing it, as they may wish to refer to it at a future time. Now that
                        Congress has passed a bill legalizing impressments, and guaranteeing "just
                        compensation," it becomes the duty of producers to yield cheerful compliance
                        with its requisitions, and to prepare to raise as much of all kinds of
                        products as possible for the subsistence of the army and the people
                        generally. We hope every farmer will now do his duty, by raising as much
                        corn and oats, and as many potatoes, beans, and vegetables of all kinds, as
                        possible. He should, also, raise as many cattle, sheep and hogs as he can.
                        Let there be a generous and active rivalry among our farmers, each striving
                        to excel the other in the amount of his products. There is now every reason
                        why the farmer should raise all he can. The motives of interest, patriotism
                        and humanity all combine in urging him to use his best efforts to produce an
                        abundance of all the necessaries of life. It is his individual interest to
                        do so, because he will receive "just compensation" for all his products that
                        may be impressed, and that will guarantee to him a good price. There never
                        was such an opportunity offered to farmers before to make money. If they do
                        not make a great deal of money out of the next crop, it will be because they
                        have neglected to raise one. They have nothing now to dread at the hands of
                        impressment officers, and by raising good crops they will advance their own
                        interests and soon have the pleasure of handling nearly as much money as a
                        Quartermaster. Patriotism invokes the farmers to raise a plenteous harvest;
                        for the soldiers in the field, who are fighting for the liberty and
                        independence of our country, must be supplied with a sufficiency of food,
                        and for this supply they are wholly dependent upon the farmers.</p>
                    <p>Humanity appeals to the farmer to speed the plough and increase his crops;
                        for widows and orphans, whose husbands and fathers have sacrificed their
                        lives upon the altar of their country's defence, must have meat and bread,
                        and unless the farmer raises the necessary supplies, gaunt famine will cross
                        the thresholds of many houses, and inflict suffering inconceivable upon
                        innocent women and children.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason why there should be even scarcity, much less want, in this
                        country of genial climate and productive soil. If there shall be not only a
                        sufficiency but an abundance, in this country [illegible] be the fault of
                        the farmers who work the land, but fail to use the means to make it
                        fruitful. They will be unprofitable servants who buried the talent which had
                        been confided to them. A great responsibility now rests upon the farmers,
                        and we hope and believe that they will acquit themselves as they should. We
                        look to the farmers with hope and confidence.</p>
