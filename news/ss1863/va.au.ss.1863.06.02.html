                    <p>It is well remarked by Adam Smith, that too great economy of living on the
                        part of the mass of a people is a great evil, and often induces famine; for
                        it leaves no room for retrenchment in case of scarcity, by failure of crops
                        or other causes. Thus, if the potato crop fails in Ireland, or the rice crop
                        in India, the people have no means of subsistence; for no food is cheaper
                        than these products, and the people cannot retrench expenses and purchase
                        other food. But a people accustomed to live on corn, meat, vegetables and
                        various other products, may, if one crop fails, live by economizing on
                        others, or sell a portion of their crops and buy a cheaper food.</p>
                    <p>We of the South have ever been the most wasteful livers in the world. Our
                        tables groan under meats; and foreigners deride us for our wasteful use of
                        provisions of all kinds. We habitually consume three times as much as is
                        conducive to health. Now, this leaves us room for retrenchment of expenses.
                        What we throw away on our tables, give to our dogs, and riding and other
                        pleasure horses, is enough, of itself, to support our whole population. We
                        are never in danger of famine, or of scarcity, if we will but retrench
                        expenses and live occasionally as other nations live constantly. Nine-tenths
                        of civilized mankind do not eat meat habitually, and do not esteem it a
                        necessary of life. More than half of civilized mankind do not even use bread
                        as an every day article of living. They live chiefly on fruits and
                        vegetables. We expect no such necessity here, but it is pleasant to remember
                        what a large margin we have for reduction of expenses, and to recollect, in
                        time of war, that we might live on much less than we do, and yet be happy
                        and healthful.--Sentinel.</p>

<b>Another "Youthful Indiscretion."</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article discusses the controversy surrounding a disputed silver set.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our "Card," in the last Spectator, we quoted
                        and copied all that had been said, in either the
                            Vindicator or the Spectator in relation to the "beautiful silver set, which was
                        captured and sent as a present to Mrs. Col. A. W. Harman," and we also
                        stated distinctly that "no further notice had been taken of the subject in
                        either the Vindicator or the Spectator." It would seem to be impossible, then, that we could
                        have done any injustice to the Editor of the Vindicator. He complains, however, of the following passage in our
                        card: </p>
                    <p>"3. It remains to be seen whether Colonel Harman will succeed by the strong
                        hand in preventing all inquiry into a transaction which, as stated by his
                        own friend and relative, places him in an attitude of having first violated
                        all the usages of civilized warfare by the plunder of private property, and
                        then having, in violation of his duty to his own Government, appropriated
                        the plunder to his private use."</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that the only knowledge the public has of the "beautiful
                        silver set" is derived from the Vindicator, whose
                        editor is a friend and relative of Colonel A. W. Harman. It was, therefore,
                        proper, in speaking of the matter, to refer to it "as stated by his own
                        friend and relative." The Vindicator had stated-- </p>
                    <p>1st. That a beautiful silver set had been captured; and,</p>
                    <p>2d. That it had been sent as a present to Mrs. Col. A. W. Harman.</p>
                    <p>Now, it will hardly be denied that, as a general rule, it is a violation of
                        the usages of civilized warfare to seize the silver plate belonging to
                        private persons; nor, will it be pretended that it is not the duty of
                        officers and soldiers to deliver to the Government all property captured by
                        them. The violation of these established rules of warfare by the Yankee
                        invaders of our country has been justly held up by us to the execration of
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>The Vindicator did not inform the public by whom
                        this capture was made, or who it was that sent the present. The offence was described, but the name of the offender was not given. When, however, Colonel A.
                        W. Harman undertook to resent our reference to the affair as an allusion to him as a "party fling" at him, and as a criticism upon him as a military officer, the offender, who had engaged in a transaction which, as represented by
                        his own friend and relative, placed him in the attitude described by us,
                            stood distinctly forth, self-betrayed and
                            self-convicted by his own conduct. If this affair admit of any
                        explanation consistent with propriety, none has yet been given; and we
                        predict that it will not answer to throw the blame of it upon some poor
                        devil of a "private soldier." We have already heard a hint that the silver so much admired by the editor of the Vindicator has turned out to be mere pewter!--May we venture to inquire whether such is
                        the fact? As the editor of the Vindicator seems
                        to be so exceedingly anxious that his position in reference to this affair
                        of the "beautiful silver set," which he first published to the world, should
                        not be misunderstood, or misinterpreted, or misrepresented, we suggest that
                        it would be well if he would distinctly define his position in reference
                        thereto, and let the public know whether he approves or disapproves the transaction
                        which he had the distinguished honor first to bring to the light. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the first time in memory of the oldest inhabitant these two counties have
                        voted together in a political election. As a native of Rockingham living in
                        Augusta, we record the fact with sincere pleasure. The social and business
                        intercourse between the two counties has been steadily increasing for many
                        years and we know of no two communities in which there is a more general
                        agreement among the people upon all matters unconnected with old party
                        politics. The overthrow of the old government was a severe blow to the
                        people of both counties, who agreed in a feeling of strong attachment to the
                        Union. The call to arms in defense of the rights of Virginia was responded
                        to in both with a zeal and alacrity which attracted the admiration of the
                        whole State. The firmness and patience with which the calamities of the war
                        have been borne and the cause of the country upheld by both counties will
                        constitute a record of enduring honor to both.</p>
                    <p>The representative honored by the first concurrent voice of these two
                        counties holds a proud position--but he should remember that it is one which
                        has its responsibilities. He will be looked to by the people of both
                        counties to carry into his representative duties the same forgetfulness of
                        party and the same love of country which has been exhibited by his
                        constituents; and from him, as a public servant to whom much of public
                        confidence has been given, much of earnest fidelity and devotion to duty
                        will be expected.</p>

                    <p>In some localities and some circles there is still a great hankering after
                        the fashion and show of the past. Fabulous prices are still paid for
                        bonnets, when a little practice will enable any young lady to plait a bonnet
                        in which she might appear as proud as a queen, and more lovely than she ever
                        did before. It is a time when plainness should be regarded a great virtue.
                        Every dollar sent abroad for unnecessary things is so much taken from the
                        ability to achieve the independence of the country in the pending struggle,
                        which involves the happiness and very existence of the nation.--Fashionable
                        committees--which are fortunately only local--should elevate themselves in
                        all respects to the height of the crisis, and by their example inculcate the
                        policy which is enjoined by every consideration of public duty and
                        patriotism--the policy to buy nothing that is unnecessary, and nothing we
                        can make ourselves. This is Independence. </p>

                    <p>The advocates of peace in New York seem to be making inglorious efforts at
                        this time to bring the war to a close. A correspondent of the New York Express advocates the organization of a peace
                        party, separate and distinct from the other two parties. He says that a
                        majority of the whole people are in favor of peace, for one reason and
                        another, but each of the present parties is afraid to say so, because of the
                        political advantage the other might derive from the avowal. The time has
                        come, he says, when peace men must organize and abandon old party
                        associations.--"The exigencies of the case, the impending dangers, the wrong
                        policy, if not the cowardice and dishonesty of parties and party leaders,
                        and the insecurity of having war on the tongue when peace is in the heart,
                        all combine to call the opponents of this cruel and destructive conflict to
                        open, bold and concerted action." </p>
                    <p>The New York News, published by Ben Wood, a
                        brother of the Ex-Mayor and a member of the Washington Congress, which was
                        suppressed by Lincoln a year ago but recently started again, is out and out
                        for peace. In a later issue it says: </p>
                    <p>The call which has been issued for a Mass State Convention for Peace, to be
                        held in this city on the 3d of June, proves that the prevailing sober second
                        thought of the people has at length become grounded in the conviction that
                        every effort to sustain the Union by force of arms must prove a failure, and
                        that the time has come to substitute conciliation and concession for the
                        unavailing ruinous employment of mere brute force. In spite of every effort
                        that is made to keep up the war excitement, facts speak too clearly for
                        themselves to render delusion any longer possible, and the history of two
                        years of unparalleled slaughter and disaster, during which period the South
                        has been growing every day stronger and more united, while the North has
                        experienced the naturally calamitous results of having attempted a war of
                        subjugation, have abundantly demonstrated that results which have not been
                        attained hitherto, can still less be accomplished hereafter with the means
                        that have been employed.</p>
                    <p>Had the Northern States been mindful of the unchanging teaching of history,
                        the ruinous war which has desolated the country for over two years, cost
                        over a half a million of lives, the expenditure of thousands of millions of
                        treasure, and misery which the Almighty mind alone can appreciate, would
                        never have taken place.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Steadily and noiselessly but rapidly, the war is assuming that final phase
                        which indicates that the passions of our foe have triumphed over the
                        conventional humanities of civilized war, and that henceforth, the ferocity
                        of the savage is to minister to the aims ofa [sic] tyrant.</p>
                    <p>Our enemies have successfully relied on various agencies for accomplishing
                        our subjugation each one of which has failed. The "Union sentiment" of the
                        South was every where to rise up on the march of their armed men. The rebels
                        were to be swiftly intimidated into submission by the display of force. They
                        were to be speedily crushed out under the heel of grand armies. But all
                        these have failed. They have found the Confederates true and brave and
                        powerful. They next attempted to excite servile insurrection, and to make
                        the poor negro do for them what they had not the courage or the power to do
                        for themselves. This, too, has failed. They have now as their last resort
                        entered upon a course of cruelty and a policy of desolation which throw down
                        the barriers of civilized hostilities. We have met them as enemies of our
                        country--we have henceforth to meet them as enemies of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Read the innumerable accounts of non-combatants, old men, and women, and
                        little children, driven from their homes without a reason in the world, and
                        threatened with instant death if they dare to return. Read the countless
                        "Army Orders" of Banks and Barnside and Rosecranz and Hunter, not to speak
                        of such as Milroy and McNeil, in which exile and confiscation are denounced
                        as the punishment of honor, and the death penalty is hung up in constant
                        terror. And follow the march of the enemy's armies: Private property burnt,
                        the implements of husbandry sought out and destroyed, the food of the people
                        seized to the last meal, and the purpose OPENLY PROCLAIMED to prevent the
                        cultivation of the soil or the harvesting of crops, as the means of
                        "starving" us into subjection.</p>
                    <p>When the Russians desolated their own country before the march of Napoleon,
                        as a means of staying his advance, it was regarded as a savage expedient of
                        a rude and unpolished people, and as of very doubtful lawfulness. But no one
                        pretends that an INVADING army has a right to blot out the face of nature,
                        and reduce a country to desolation. This, however, the Yankees are
                        attempting to do. In addition to these things, they are assuming to visit
                        death penalties, on allegations of pretended treason, against citizens and
                        soldiers employed in our service. They are still attempting to turn from
                        their allegiance and their duty the poor, simple-minded race, whom Yankee
                        cupidity was permitted, under the Providence of God, to introduce among us.
                        To do this, they are employing expedients which mark them not as soldiers,
                        but as brutal incendiaries--utterly indifferent of the fate of the negro,
                        and anxious only to effect our ruin by whatever means.</p>
                    <p>On all these questions we are now face to face, with our enemies. Any day's
                        battle, or any day's skirmish, may precipitate upon us the issue which in
                        any case is near at hand, relative to the enemy's negro regiments and their
                        Yankee associates. The cries of our outraged citizens, our aged men, our
                        little children, our ladies, are heard in all our borders. Burning
                        homesteads[,] a ruined husbandry, a desolated land, and the infernal cry of
                        "STARVATION to the rebels!" tell us that we are now standing for our lives,
                        against demons incarnate. Captive officers stripped of their garments in the
                        streets, old men trotted like oxen through the mud, and the agonies and
                        horrors of Yankee prison-houses, add their colors to the picture.</p>
                    <p>Let us leave it to our Government to guide our measures amid the grave scenes
                        which are upon us, and which we may not evade if we would. Let us be
                        vigorous, but let us also be careful to be RIGHT. We must not yield
                        ourselves to mere passion. We must not throw away the guidance of reason at
                        the very time that we need all the lights of wisdom and experience. Let us
                        do right for its own sake. We owe the world small homage for favors or for
                        its good opinion. We appeal to history and to GOD.--Sentinel.</p>
