<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A communication in the Rockingham Register signed
                        "Tenth Legion," and one in the Vindicator signed
                        "Augusta," bearing marks of having been written by the same individual, urge
                        the people to vote for Gov. Letcher for Congress on the ground that he has
                        been denounced in extravagant and unjust terms. Will "Tenth Legion" and
                        "Augusta" be good enough to inform the public who it was that "hounded" and
                        "maligned," "hunted down" and "villified" him, and why they wish to visit
                        the sins of others upon the head of Col. Baldwin. The writer in the Vindicator uses this language: "Hunted down,
                        villified by interested political hucksters and mountebank politicians, who
                        felt no responsibility, who had and have never given any tangible evidence
                        of a heartfelt interest in the cause of the South, and who have not the
                        brains to comprehend the vast difficulties which environ high official
                        positions in such a crisis as that through which we are now passing,
                        &amp;c." </p>
                    <p>Why not say who these "political hucksters and mountebank politicians" are,
                        who "have never given any evidence of a heartfelt interest in the cause of
                        the South?" To what political household do they belong? Why not designate
                        and visit the exposure and punishment upon the persons guilty of the offence
                        mentioned, instead of trying to make a victim and scape-goat of Col.
                        Baldwin? Is he to be punished for the offence of others? Is that the code of
                        punishment approved by these advocates of the election of Gov. Letcher?</p>
                    <p>"Tenth Legion" informs the good people of Rockingham that, "A refusal to vote
                        for him (Gov. Letcher) would be a palpable and direct condemnation of
                        themselves." How is this? In what way would they be condemning themselves in
                        voting for Col. Baldwin? In voting for him for Congress they would be vindicating the
                        wisdom of their former course when they elected him a member of that body.
                        If they vote against him, they will condemn their
                        former conduct in electing him. The people have no reason to regret the
                        choice they then made, and will not practice the injustice of condemning a
                        man without a reason therefor[e]. </p>
