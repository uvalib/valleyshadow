                    <p>During the retreat of the Yankees thro' Tazewell county in their late
                        unprofitable raid on Wytheville one of their number fell behind on
                        Bluestone, and was met in the road by Misses Martha and Nannie Hendrickson,
                        daughters of John Hendrickson, a refugee from the county of Fayette. Miss
                        Martha ordered the Yankee to deliver up his gun, which he refused to do: not
                        in the least daunted, this brave young lady advanced upon him, and siezing
                        [sic] his gun, gave him a peremptory order to surrender. This he did, and
                        the two noble girls marched him to the house of the nearest neighbor, and
                        kept him closely guarded for five and six hours, until some of our soldiers,
                        in pursuit of the Yankees, relieved them of their prisoner.</p>
                    <p>Such is a plain, unvarnished statement of a fact that adds one more item to
                        the long list of noble deeds performed by the daughters of the South in this
                        war. After the pursuit of the Yankees was abandoned by our forces north of
                        Abb's valley, John Marrs pursued them alone for several miles, killing two,
                        wounding several, and capturing eight or nine horses.</p>
                    <p>To Colonel May, of Kentucky, and his brave men, the country owes a debt of
                        gratitude for the bold and determined manner in which he kept up the pursuit
                        from the beginning to the end of the chase. He pursued them steadily for
                        seventy-five miles, without eating or sleeping, fought them twice, killing
                        seven, wounding many more, capturing 27 prisoners, and over one hundred
                        horses, without losing a man. --[Examiner]. </p>

                    <p>On the small farms throughout this section all is life, activity and
                        industry. Many a woman who never before held a plow, is now seen in the
                        corn-field--many a young girl who would have blushed at the thought before
                        of handling a plow-line, now naturally and unconsciously cries, "gee up
                        Dobbin," to the silvery tones of which the good brute readily responds, as
                        if it were a pleasure to comply with so gentle a command.--Many a Ruth, as
                        of old, is today binding and gleaning in the wheat-field, but, alas! no Bess
                        is there to console or to comfort. The picture of the rural soldier's home
                        is at this time but a picure [sic] of primitive life. Throughout the
                        country, at every farm house and cottage, the regular sound of the loom, as
                        the shuttle flies to and fro, with the whirl of the spinning wheel, is
                        heard, telling of home industry. Cotton fabrics, of neat, pretty figures,
                        the production of home manufacture, are now almost wholly worn in Tennessee,
                        instead of calicoes.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>After more than two years of warfare scarcely equalled in the number,
                        magnitude and fearful carnage of its battles--a warfare in which your
                        courage and fortitude have illustrated your country and attracted not only
                        gratitude at home, but admiration abroad--your enemies continue to struggle
                        in which our final triumph must be inevitable. Unduly elated with their
                        recent successes, they imagine that temporary reverses can quell your spirit
                        or shake your determination, and they are now gathering heavy masses for a
                        general invasion in the vain hope that by a despearte [sic] effort success
                        may at length be reached.</p>
                    <p>You know too well, my countrymen, what they mean by success. Their malignant
                        rage aims at nothing less than the extermination of yourselves, your wives
                        and children. They seek to destroy what they cannot plunder. They propose as
                        the spoils of victory that your homes shall be partitioned among the
                        wretches whose atrocious cruelties have stamped infamy on their Government.
                        They design to incite servile insurrection and light the fires of
                        incendiarism whenever they can reach your homes, and they debauch the
                        inferior race, hitherto docile and contented, by promising indulgence of the
                        vilest passions as the price of treachery. Conscious of their inability to
                        prevail by legitimate warfare, not daring to make peace lest they should be
                        buried from their seats of power, the men who now rule in Washington refuse
                        even to confer on the subject of putting an end to outrages which disgrace
                        our age, or to listen to a suggestion for conducting the war according to
                        the usages of civilization.</p>
                    <p>Fellow citizens, no alternative is left you but victory, or subjugation,
                        slavery, and the utter ruin of yourselves, your families, and your country.
                        The victory is within your reach.--You need but stretch forth your hands to
                        grasp it. For this and all that is necessary is that those who are called to
                        the field by every motive that can move the human heart, should promptly
                        repair to the post of duty, should stand by their comrades now in front of
                        the foe, and thus so strengthen the armies of the Confederacy as to ensure
                        success. The men now absent from their posts would, if present in the field,
                        suffice to create numerical equality between our force and that of the
                        invaders--and when with any approach to such equality have we failed to be
                        victorious? I believe that but few of those absent are actuated by
                        unwillingness to serve their country; but that many have found it difficult
                        to resist the temptation of a visit to their homes and the loved ones from
                        whom they have been so long separated; that others have left for temporary
                        attention to their affairs with the intention of returning, and then have
                        shrunk from the consequences of their violation of duty; that others again
                        have left their posts from mere restlessness and desire of change, each
                        quieting the upbraidings of his conscience, by persuading himself that his
                        individual services could have no influence on the general result. These and
                        other causes (although far less disgraceful than the desire to avoid danger,
                        or to escape from the sacrifices required by patriotism,) are nevertheless,
                        grievous faults, and place the cause of our beloved country, and of
                        everything we hold dear, is imminent peril. I repeat, that the men who now
                        owe duty to their country, who have been called out and who have not yet
                        reported for duty, or who have absented themselves from their posts, are
                        sufficient in number to secure as victory in the struggle now impending.</p>
                    <p>I call on you, then, my countrymen, to hasten to your camps, in obedience to
                        the dictator of honor and of duty, and summon those who have absented
                        themselves without leave, or who have remained absent beyond the period
                        allowed by their furloughs, to repair, without delay, to their respective
                        commands; and I do hereby declare that I grant a general pardon and amnesty
                        to all officers and men within the Confederacy, now absent without leave,
                        who shall, with the least possible delay, return to their proper posts of
                        duty; but no excuse will be received for any delay beyond twenty days after
                        the first publication of this proclamation in the State in which the
                        absentee may be at the date of the publication. This amnesty and pardon
                        shall extend to all who have been accused of, or who have been convicted and
                        are undergoing sentence for, absence without leave or desertion, excepting
                        only those who have been twice convicted of desertion.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I conjure my countrywomen--the wives, mothers, sisters and
                        daughters--of the Confederacy, to use their all-powerful influence in aid of
                        this call, to add one crowning sacrifice to those which their patriotism has
                        so freely and constantly offered on their country's altar, and to take care
                        that none who owe service in the field shall be sheltered at home, from the
                        disgrace of having deserted their duty to their families, to their country,
                        and to their God.</p>
                    <p>Given under my hand, and the seal of the Confederate States, at Richmond,
                        this 1st day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
                        and sixty-three.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We would invite the attention of the public generally, and of stragglers and
                        deserters from the army particularly, to the appeal from their posts of
                        duty, to return immediately, and avail themselves of the pardon granted to
                        all who will return to their commands by the 20th of this month. All who
                        return by that time will be pardoned, and those who refuse to do so will be
                        punished as deserters. All who are in confinement will be released and
                        returned to their respective commands. Those who were confined in Castle
                        Thunder in Richmond, 1080 in number, have been released, and sent rejoicing
                        to join their commands in the field. To stragglers and deserters, the time
                        between this and the 20th instant, is a period of jubilee, in which their
                        bonds are broken and the stigma of disgrace erased from their characters, if
                        they return promptly, as they should to their commands. To those who fail to
                        avail themselves of the privilege thus granted, but little, if any, mercy
                        will be shown. If there be any stragglers or deserters in this section of
                        the State, we would appeal to them, as they value their characters, love
                        their country, and dread ignominious punishment, to return at once to their
                        posts of duty. There are soldiers improperly absent from their commands,
                        perhaps quite a number, who do not see or read the newspapers at their
                        homes, and if left to that source of information alone, will not he informed
                        of the President's address; or, if they are, will hear of it too late to
                        respond fully to the appeal, by returning to their respective commands in
                        time to avail themselves of the pardon, which it proffers.</p>
                    <p>We would, therefore, in the language of a correspondent of the "Sentinel,"
                        suggest "that the old and influential citizens of the country, who take the
                        newspapers, or who become otherwise informed as to the character and terms
                        of this address, proceed without delay to make it known in their respective
                        neighborhoods throughout the Confederacy. Let them, as a sacred duty, give
                        the information to every soldier and officer improperly absent from the army
                        whom they may see; and, if necessary, make it their special business to seek
                        such soldiers at their homes, to read to them the address, urge on them its
                        importance, and to furnish those who may need it (if any) with the means of
                        transportation to rejoin their commands. If this be done at once, in every
                        neighborhood, not only will these soldiers get this information with
                        certainty and in proper time, but the influence and weight of character of
                        the old men of the whole community, will be brought to bear practically in
                        aid of the President's address.</p>
                    <p>Stragglers and deserters take advantage of the universal sympathy of our
                        people for the soldiers, and impose upon them. An Aid of one of our
                        distinguished Generals, in writing to the editor of the "Enquirer" upon the
                        subject, says: "Let the people be warned that in feeding any straggling soldier, they may be aiding desertion, certainly encouraging a vice nearly as bad
                        practically--that of straggling. Let them be informed that no matter how
                        plausible the tale of the straggler, it is always
                        false; and designed to deceive the unwary.--No good soldier is ever
                        separated from his command, unless from sickness, or on furlough, or under
                        orders. When from the first cause, provision is made for the transportation
                        of such as are unable to walk; and if any are found away from the army, and
                        not in charge of the persons designated to take care of the sick, be assured
                        that absentees are stragglers. In the second
                        case, no man ever straggles when going home on furlough; and, besides, no
                        man gets a furlough now; so that any soldier who pretends to have a furlough
                        (unless a sick furlough) is probably a deserter, certainly a straggler. In
                        the third case, (absence under orders) the orders will show why the soldier
                        is absent; and when thus absent he is nearly always accompanied by a
                        commissioned or noncommissioned officer. </p>

                        the idea that in case of subjugation by our enemy, the worst that could

                        "Constitution as it is," &amp;c., it is time for them to awake from that
                        dream. For us, in case of being overcome in the field, there is to be no
                        Constitution and no law. The entire possession of the whole Southern
                        country, with every house and estate; the absolute fee-simple of all the
                        land, with its "woods and waters, mills and fishings, to have and to hold

                        enemy fights, and without the prospect of which he would not strike another
                        lick. To fully attain this, it will be necessary for the Yankees to abolish
                        the Constitution entirely, so far as regards us Confederates. We must be
                        left without rights, without legal remedies, an inferior race creeping on
                        the face of our own land. To make all ready for this sweeping operation
                        (which they think they will be in condition to enforce some time next
                        winter) the Yankee legislators, it seems, are preparing an ingenious law.
                        The design of this law is thus explained by the N. York "Times": </p>

                        up early in the next session. The law is now construed that after the death
                        of the traitor, the estate reverts to his heirs, which renders the intended
                        working of the act practically void."</p>
