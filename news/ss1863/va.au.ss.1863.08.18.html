<b>To The Soldiers Of The Confederate States</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An appeal from Jefferson Davis for the populace to redouble their efforts
                    in the war effort. He details the preparations that the enemy forces are making
                    for an invasion and reminds the readers that the result of a Northern victory
                    would be "subjugation, slavery, and the utter ruin of yourselves, your families,
                    and your country." He takes a fairly soft view on the numerous soldiers absent
                    from their regiments and attributes their absence to homesickness and the need
                    to take care of their affairs. He believes that fear of punishment is causing
                    many who would return to hesitate. In order to rectify this situation, "The
                    President declares a general amnesty and pardon and assures the public that with
                    the return of these soldiers the Confederacy will be able to secure victory in
                    the impending battle."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>After more than two years of warfare scarcely equalled [sic] in the number,
                        magnitude and fearful carnage of its battles--a warfare in which your
                        courage and fortitude have illustrated your country and attracted not only
                        gratitude at home, but admiration abroad--your enemies continue a struggle
                        in which our final triumph must be inevitable. Unduly elated with their
                        recent successes, they imagine that temporary reverses can quell your spirit
                        or shake your determination, and they are now gathering heavy masses for a
                        general invasion in the vain hope that by a despearte [sic] effort success
                        may at length be reached.</p>
                    <p>You know too well, my countrymen, what they mean by success. Their malignant
                        rage aims at nothing less than the extermination of yourselves, your wives
                        and children. They seek to destroy what they cannot plunder. They propose as
                        the spoils of victory that your homes shall be partitioned among the
                        wretches whose atrocious cruelties have stamped infamy on their Government.
                        They design to incite servile insurrection and light the fires of
                        incendiarism whenever they can reach your homes, and they debauch the
                        inferior race, hitherto docile and contented, by promising indulgence of the
                        vilest passions as the price of treachery. Conscious of their inability to
                        prevail by legitimate warfare, not daring to make peace lest they would be
                        hurled from their seats of power, the men who now rule in Washington refuse
                        even to confer on the subject of putting an end to outrages which disgrace
                        our age, or to listen to a suggestion for conducting the war according to
                        the usages of civilization.</p>
                    <p>Fellow citizens, no alternative is left you but victory, or subjugation,
                        slavery, and the utter ruin of yourselves, your families, and your country.
                        The victory is within your reach.--You need but stretch forth your hands to
                        grasp it. For this and all that is necessary is that those who are called to
                        the field by every motive that can move the human heart, should promptly
                        repair to the post of duty, should stand by their comrades now in front of
                        the foe, and thus so strengthen the armies of the Confederacy as to ensure
                        success. The men now absent from their posts would, if present in the field,
                        suffice to create numerical equality between our force and that of the
                        invaders--and when with any approach to such equality have we failed to be
                        victorious? I believe that but few of those absent are actuated by
                        unwillingness to serve their country; but that many have found it difficult
                        to resist the temptation of a visit to their homes and the loved ones from
                        whom they have been so long separated; that others have left for temporary
                        attention to their affairs with the intention of returning, and then have
                        shrunk from the consequences of their violation of duty; that others again
                        have left their posts from mere restlessness and desire of change, each
                        quieting the upbraidings of his conscience, by persuading himself that his
                        individual services could have no influence on the general result. These and
                        other causes (although far less disgraceful than the desire to avoid danger,
                        or to escape form the sacrifices required by patriotism,) are, nevertheless,
                        grievous faults, and place the cause of our beloved country, and of
                        everything we hold dear, in imminent peril. I repeat, that the men who now
                        owe duty to their country, who have been called out and who have not yet
                        reported for duty, or who have absented themselves form their posts, are
                        sufficient in number to secure us victory in the struggle now impending.</p>
                    <p>I call on you, then, my countrymen, to hasten to your camps, in obedience to
                        the dictates of honor and duty, and summon those who have absented
                        themselves without leave, or who have remained absent beyond the period
                        allowed by their furloughs, to repair, without delay, to their respective
                        commands; and I do hereby declare that I grant a general pardon and amnesty
                        to all officers and men within the Confederacy, now absent without leave,
                        who shall, with the least possible delay, return to their proper posts of
                        duty; but no excuse will be received for any delay beyond twenty days after
                        first publication of this proclamation in the State in which the absentee
                        may be at the date of the publication. This amnesty and pardon shall extend
                        to all who have been accused of, or who have been convicted and are
                        undergoing sentence for, absence without leave or desertion, excepting only
                        those who have been twice convicted of desertion.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I conjure my countrywomen--the wives, mothers, sisters and
                        daughters--of the Confederacy, to use their all-powerful influence to those
                        which their patriotism has no freely and constantly offered on their
                        country's altar, and to take care that none who owe service in the field
                        shall be sheltered at home, from the disgrace of having deserted their duty
                        to their families, to their country, and to their God.</p>

                    <p>Again do I call upon the people of the Confederacy--a people who believe that
                        the Lord reigneth, and that His overruling Providence ordereth all
                        things--to unite in prayer and humble submission under His chastening hand,
                        and to beseech His favor on our suffering country.</p>
                    <p>It is meet that when trials and reverses befal [sic] us we should seek to
                        take home to our hearts and consciences the lessons which they teach, and
                        profit by the self-examination for which they prepare us. Had not our
                        successes on land and sea made us self-confident and forgetful of our
                        reliance on Him? Had not the love of lucre eaten like a gangrene into the
                        very heart of the land, converting too many among us into worshippers of
                        gain and rendering them unmindful of their duty to their country, to their
                        yellow-men and to their God? Who then will presume to complain that we have
                        been chastened or to despair of our just cause and the protection of our
                        Heavenly Father?</p>
                    <p>Let us rather receive in humble thankfulness the lesson He has taught us in
                        our recent reverses, devoutly acknowledging that to Him, and not to our own
                        feeble arms, are due the honor and the glory of victory; that from him, and
                        not to our own feeble arms, are due the honor and the glory of victory; that
                        from Him, in His paternal Providence, come the anguish and sufferings of
                        defeat, and that, whether in victory or defeat, our humble supplications are
                        due at His footstool.</p>
                    <p>Now, therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, President of these Confederate States, do
                        issue this, my proclamation, setting apart Friday, the 21st day of August
                        ensuing, as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer; and I hereby do invite
                        the people of the Confederate States to repair, on that day, to their
                        respective places of public worship, and to unite in supplication for the
                        favor and protection of that God who has hitherto conducted us safely
                        through all the dangers that environed us.</p>

                        States, at Richmond, this twenty-first day of July, in the year of our Lord,
                        one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Proclamation of the President, and the published Orders of General Lee,
                        indicate the great importance and necessity of gathering in all the absent
                        soldiers, and of bringing to an end the vice of straggling. The country
                        joins the President and the Generals in imploring the soldiers who have been
                        derelict, to hasten at once to their places, where they will be generously
                        received. We fervently trust that these solemn appeals and this universal
                        entreaty will prove effectual; and that no soldier, after so liberal an
                        offer, will permit himself to be longer numbered among the delinquents.</p>
                    <p>But the people have a high duty to perform in this matter. Already they have
                        been appealed to by the President, and the influence of ladies especially
                        invoked, to cause the return of absentees to their posts. If this be done in
                        the right way and with the proper zeal, there is not a man now aloof from
                        his regiment who will not be beset by influences which he cannot resist. He
                        will feel that the disgrace of skulking is intolerable, and he will be
                        anxious to reinstate himself in the good opinion of his friends by a speedy
                        return to duty.</p>
                    <p>Let every one exert himself to hasten back to the army all who are improperly
                        away. Listen to the earnest call which comes over the hills of Virginia from
                        Gen. Lee. Listen to the earnest, affectionate appeal which the President
                        sends out to his countrymen. Listen to these, as they cry out in this crisis
                        of the country's fate; and let father and mother implore their son--let wife
                        go down on her knees to her husband--let sister appeal to brother with all
                        her wealth of affection--let maiden entreat lover as for the most precious
                        boon--let friend urge friend with all the power of persuasion--and let each
                        and all implore the objects of their solicitude not to stain their names
                        with an infamy so indelible as that of deserting on staying away from their
                        standards in such a tremendous hour as this, and when the calls of their
                        chieftains are ringing in their ears. Oh, it is a shame that will descend to
                        children. [Sentinel.</p>

                    <p>EXECUTIVE MANSION, <br>Washington, July 30, 1863. </p>
                    <p>It is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens of
                        whatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are duly
                        organized as soldiers in the public service. The law of nations, and the
                        usages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no
                        distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public
                        enemies. To sell or enslave any captured person on account of his color and
                        for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a
                        crime against the civilization of the age. The Government of the United
                        States will give the same protection to all its soldiers, and if the enemy
                        shall sell or enslave any one because of his color, the offense shall be
                        punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in our possession. It is,
                        therefore, ordered, that for every soldier of the United States killed in
                        violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed, and for
                        every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall
                        be placed at hard labor on the public works, and continue at such labor
                        until the other shall be released, and receive the treatment due a prisoner
                        of war.</p>

                        Virginia is the backbone of the Confederacy, and that with Lee's army beaten
                        and Virginia occupied the war will be at an end. It may be, and it now looks
                        like it, that the great and final battle will crimson the soil of the dear,

                        to a subject which calls loudly for reform, and which, if not checked, has,
                        and will continue to inflict immense injury upon our country. The subject is
                        this: A high functionary in the army quarters his troops, or it may be
                        prisoners, upon the premises of an individual, with the full assurance that
                        he shall not sustain any injury, to his crops, fences, &amp;c. Well,
                        now, what is the result?--The commanding officer, gives his orders, leaves
                        his men to the care of others under his command, while his attention is
                        called to other business, or his own private pursuits. These sub-officers,
                        care little what the men do. Instead of enforcing the injunctions, laid upon
                        them, by their superior officer, the men are allowed to roam, where they
                        please, inflicting serious damage upon the rights and property of
                        individuals. A day of settlement arrives and he is only allowed about one
                        half the amount of damages that he has incurred by the wanton injury imposed
                        upon him. Have not the insolent foe inflicted upon us injury enough, that
                        our own army officers, and men should help to fill up the cup of misery? It
                        is a burning shame that such proceedings should be allowed in a land among a
                        civilized people, who are contending in the field of battle, for the highest
                        and noblest principals that can actuate and govern the human heart--Liberty
                        and Independence. I hope the evil will at once be arrested. God and the
                        country know, the Jews and vile speculators have inflicted great damage upon
                        their bleeding country, but hope, they will soon be placed, where they can

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On yesterday a week, the military authorities here received intelligence that
                        the enemy, in considerable force, had made their appearance at Moorefield,
                        the county seat of Hardy, and were probably contemplating an attempt to
                        reach this place. This caused some excitement here for a short time, and
                        preparations were being made to "welcome them with bloody hands to
                        hospitable graves." Gen. Imboden moved his command up the Valley with the
                        view of keeping it between the enemy and this place. He came up as far as
                        Bridgewater, in Rockingham county, eight miles Southwest of Harrisonburg,
                        when he learned that the enemy, if they had contemplated a raid into this
                        section, had abandoned the idea for the present. The enemy seem to have left
                        portions of their forces at Moorefield, Martineburg and other places. We
                        think it probably that they are stationing their forces to guard against
                        apprehended raids on the part of our troops. There is no excitement here at
                        this time, as there seems to be no probability of a visit by the Yankees.
                        There is no truth in the statements of the Richmond papers that there were
                        conflicts between the forces of General Imboden and the enemy in Brock's Gap
                        on Monday and Tuesday of last week. The "reliable gentleman" on the Central
                        train proved, as usual, to be a lineal descendant of the world renowned
                        Munchausen. There was no conflict at any of the gaps, because the enemy did
                        not make their appearance at any of them.</p>

                    <p>Heads up! Why that long face and gloomy countenance? You must be bilious, and
                        should take a blue pill; for there is no cause for discouragement even, much
                        less for despondency. The prospects of the enemy have never been so bad at
                        this moment, and we have never been so near the end of our trials. The
                        much-dreaded conscription act of the enemy will avail them little, and they
                        can never venture upon another.--We have now sufficient men in the pay, if not in the service, of the Confederacy to defeat the enemy at all points. All
                        that is necessary is to get them to their posts of duty. The danger, if any
                        exists, is not in the strength and numbers of the enemy, but in the
                        remissness of our own officers and soldiers, who are at home or hiding in
                        the woods instead of being with their more gallant comrades in the "tented
                        field." The Confederate Government has now about as many men in its pay as it can well afford to support; and, unless
                        there be a real and exigent necessity, it would be bad policy to take more
                        men from their homes, where they are producers, to convert them into
                        consumers, and thus, at the same time, diminish the resources of the
                        country, whilst greater burdens are imposed upon the Government. The
                        President says: "The men now absent from their posts would, if present in
                        the field, suffice to create numerical equality between our forces and that
                        of the invaders--and when, with any approach to such equality, have we
                        failed to be victorious?" The President ought to be good authority, and upon
                        his authority we say it is not more men, but greater fidelity, which we
                        need.--On the part of the soldiers there should be more fidelity and less
                        shirking,--more fighting and less deserting; and, on the part of the
                        citizens, there should be more cheerfulness and less despondency, more hope
                        and less fear, more liberality and less speculation, more patriotism and
                        less extortion, more honesty and less robbery, more christianity and less
                        Mammon-worship; and, "with a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
                        together," we would soon attain the "summum bonum" of our wishes--the
                        freedom and independence of our country. </p>

                    <p>A day or two ago a letter was received at the Treasury Department from a
                        negro man, named Henry Jones, the property of Mr. E. Cannon, of Clarksville,
                        in this State, which is worthy of the highest commendation, and justly
                        entitled to be imitated by those who have been hoarding their treasure
                        during the troubles which at present afflict the country. Henry places at
                        the disposal of the Secretary of the Treasury $465 in gold, which he hopes
                        will be of some service to the Government. In his letter he speaks of "our
                        glorious cause," and declares that the slaves of the South have a deeper
                        interest in the establishment of Southern independence than the white
                        population. He thinks if the Yankees are successful the negroes are destined
                        to the most cruel treatment at their hands.</p>

                    <p>The New York Daily News says, that "the recent
                        edict promulgated by President Lincoln in his communication to Governor
                        Seymour, has created the most intense excitement in this community, who
                        considered they were living under a democratic form of Government. The
                        dictatorial spirit in which the President refuses to concede to the justice
                        of Governor Seymour's request to have the draft suspended until its
                        constitutionality can be tested by the courts, has fallen like a bomb-shell
                        among the conservative men of the city." </p>
                    <p>The same paper states, that about 15,000 Federal troops are now in and around
                        the city, composed chiefly of regiments from the New England States, whose
                        Abolition sentiments are such as to make them perfectly reliable to carry
                        out the Radical policy of the Administration. "It is evident, that stirring
                        events are close at hand. The public mind is intensely agitated at the
                        threatening aspect of affairs, and if the draft is commenced again in
                        violation of the protest of Governor Seymour, a revolution is
                    inevitable."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From reports of superintendents of Institutions for the Deaf and Dumb and
                        Blind, we have conclusive evidence that from 10 to 15 or 20 percent of deaf
                        mutes are the children of Cousins. It is greatly to be regretted that we
                        have no law forbidding the marriage of first cousins. These marriages are a
                        violation of a law of nature, as is evidenced by the afflictions visited in
                        almost every case upon their offspring in deafness, blindness, and idiocy;
                        and ought to be violation of human laws also. The Commonwealth has the clear
                        right to protect itself against these unfortunate matches, whose offspring
                        it has to sustain too frequently for life. It may be hoped that this
                        important subject will not escape the action of our legislators at its next
                        session. I confidently believe that by preventing all the marriages of this
                        kind, and by proper attention and care of infants laboring under the disease
                        stated, the number of deaf mutes might be diminished one-half in a
                        generation.</p>
