                    <p>Lincoln, with a million of men, now calls for the assistance of 150,000
                        Ethiopians. As he cannot get them in the South, he will have to recruit them
                        in the North, and so soon as they come within reach of the Southern army

                        designed them. Zerah, with 300 chariots and 1,000,000 of Ethiopians came out
                        in war against Asa who had only five hundred and eighty thousand "mighty men
                        of valor," and yet Asa, praying for and relying upon the assistance of the
                        God of hosts, conquered and made slaves of the whole Ethiopian army. See II
