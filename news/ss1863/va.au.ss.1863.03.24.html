<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are satisfied that, as we grow older, we will improve in knowledge,
                        provided we profit by our own and the experience of others, but the old man
                        of the "Spectator" grows arrogant, when he says we will progress in
                        knowledge if we "continue to take lessons from the Spectator."</p>
                    <p>Now we cannot recall in what single particular we have taken a lesson from
                        the "Spectator," and we will say to our friend that we do not intend to
                        follow his example in several things we wot [sic] of. In one thing it might
                        be better for us, pecuniarily, to imitate him, if we would. He waits for the
                        breeze of public opinion to indicate the direction his weather-cock shall
                        point; at least, we conclude so, from his studied silence on subjects,
                        deemed, by some of our wisest Statesmen, of vital importance at present. Not
                        a line or selection, that we remember, does he commit himself in favor of,
                        or in opposition to these subjects. Pray Mr. "Spectator" let us know, what
                        are your opinions as to a re-construction of the Union? Are you in favor of
                        offering inducements to the North Western States to unite in our
                        Confederacy? We would like to gain some information from an experienced
                        friend on these points, and as you so vauntingly boast yours, we know no one
                        from whom we would be better pleased to hear--Vindicator. </p>
                    <p>The spirit manifested, in the above extract, by the "young man of promise" of
                        the "Vindicator" does not disturb our equanimity in the least degree--we can
                        easily forgive him, for he "knows not what he
                        does." When he shall become older, it is hoped that "he will improve in
                        knowledge," but his memory is so very bad that we apprehend he will not be
                        able to retain much, for he seems to forget one week what he was taught the
                        week before. He says: </p>
                    <p>"Now we cannot recall in what single particular we have taken a lesson from
                        the Spectator."</p>
                    <p>He has forgotten in one week the important knowledge we communicated to him
                        in reference to the comparative value of natural and artificial limbs,
                        though he, at the time, frankly acknowledged his former ignorance, and
                        "succumbed to our more mature judgment."</p>
                    <p>But this is not the only instance in which his memory is at fault. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Not by a line or selection, that we remember, does he commit himself in
                        favor of, or in opposition to, * * * a reconstruction of the Union."</p>
                    <p>Was such a defective memory ever known to exist before? We have published
                        editorial and selected articles upon this subject, time and again, from the
                        beginning of the war to the present, and yet he gives this as a
                        specification to establish his general charge that we "wait for the breeze
                        of public opinion to indicate the direction our weather cock shall point."</p>
                    <p>There never were but two parties which favored reconstruction at any time,
                        and we never concurred with either of them in their views upon that subject.
                        The first was the secession party which maintained that the South should
                        secede that the Union might be reconstructed upon
                        different principles; and the other, the abolition party, which is now
                        endeavoring to reconstruct the Union by force of
                        arms. We have always maintained that the Union once broken, would never be
                        made whole again. Though we expressed this opinion before the war, and a
                        hundred times since, the forgetful editor of the "Vindicator" says that we
                        have been "waiting for the breeze of public opinion." When the editor drew
                            that picture, he must have been looking in a
                        mirror. We will never need a weather-cock, to
                        point the direction of the "breeze of public opinion" as long as we can have
                        access to the views of the Editor of the "Vindicator," for they are so light as to be wafted by every "wind of doctrine,"
                        and like straws "show which way the winds blow." </p>
                    <p>The Editor of the "Vindicator" also asks this question:</p>
                    <p>"Are you in favor of offering inducements to the North Western States to
                        unite in our Confederacy?"</p>
                    <p>What does he mean by the expression "unite" in our Confederacy?" As the North
                        Western States do not constitute any part of "our Confederacy" we are unable
                        to see how they could "unite in" it. We suppose
                        he asks that question, as the other, for the purpose of showing that we have
                        been waiting for the "breeze" about which he seems to feel so much interest.
                        When the North Western States, as States independent of the U.S., shall
                        apply for admission into "our Confederacy," then will be the time to discus
                        [sic] the policy of admitting or rejecting them; but that time has not
                        arrived, and, it may be, never will. How foolish then, to be discussing that
                        question at this time! The discussion now can do no good, but may do, yes,
                        has already done, much harm. The great re-action which has recently taken
                        place in the North against the South, has been owing, in no small degree, to
                        the course pursued by the Richmond Enquirer and other papers which have
                        echoed the sentiments of that Journal. If the North West would show a
                        disposition to cut loose from the U.S. and set up for itself we should not
                        discourage and defeat such a purpose by the gratuitous declaration that we
                        are now, and will ever continue to be, their enemies. If we can proffer them
                        nothing but enmity, we should say nothing at all. </p>
                    <p>The inference the "Vindicator" draws, when an Editor does not discuss a
                        question, is: That the Editor is waiting for the "breeze of public opinion."
                        How would the "Vindicator" stand the test of its own mode of logic? Since
                        its publication has been renewed, the "Spectator" has discussed the question
                        of impressments, the property of investing in Government bonds, and several
                        other subjects about which the "Vindicator" has been as dumb as an oyster.
                        By the "Vindicator's" logic, we would be justified in charging that the
                        Editor maintained a "studied silence" upon these subjects, because he was
                        "waiting for the breeze of public opinion to indicate the direction his
                        weather cock should point." (We have always thought that the weather-cock
                        was designed to indicate the direction of the wind, and not the wind to
                        indicate the direction the weather-cock should point). The Editor of the
                        "Vindicator" digs pits, and falls into them himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor: Your excellent suggestions to the farmers, we trust, will be
                        heeded; and that large crops of grain and vegetables of every kind will be
                        planted in good time. That we will be under the necessity of giving our meat
                        and flour to the army is becoming obvious. To supply the place of these in
                        our families, we can substitute corn, buckwheat, molasses and vegetables.
                        All of these may be raised yet, this Summer. Buckwheat is a very prolific
                        crop and should be sown largely. Molasses, in the greatest abundance, can be
                        made. With plenty of buckwheat cakes and molasses, no family will suffer. In
                        advance then, let us make our calculations in sowing and planting, that we
                        will give our flour and meat to the soldiers. Now is the time to prepare
                        against coming want, if not relentless famine. "Providence helps those who
                        help themselves," let us labor to secure His blessing. The season is still
                        before us--let no hand be idle. "They who will not work, should not eat."
                        Whatever may have been indulged in and tolerated in other days, the time has
                        now come, when all must work or starve. Some useful employment must be
                        followed by rich and poor alike. Let no food be sold to those who are able
                        bodied and will not work, while any of the industrious and helpless are in
                        want. We will have no surplus food for "dead heads" and vagabonds.</p>
                    <p>The farmers are in great need of help and the time is growing short for
                        getting out the crops. Send out the idlers and loafers from the towns to the
                        country, to toil with the farmers from day light till dark and help to make
                        bread for all. This will be far better for them, than standing about the
                        streets prating about the high prices of living. Help to supply the demand
                        and prices will come down.</p>
                    <p>"Come and help to make a living," are the watch words of a</p>
                    <p>FARMER.</p>
