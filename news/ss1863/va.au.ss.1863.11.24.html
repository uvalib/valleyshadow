<b>A Stir Among The Unnaturalized</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author urges Congress to begin conscripting unnaturalized white
                    residents of the South. It is, according to this article, "intolerable that,
                    while our relatives of every degree are subjected to the dangers and privations
                    of the field, a set of men, who are amongst us for the purpose of feathering
                    their own nest, no matter at what cost to the Confederacy, should shirk service
                    on the plea that they are aliens."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We understand, says the Petersburg Express, that there is considerable
                        excitement among the unnaturalized "white folks" in the Confederacy. They
                        are very apprehensive that one of the first steps of Congress, upon its
                        re-assembling, will be to put those among them who are of proper age and fit
                        for service, in the army. This apprehension, we sincerely hope, is very well
                        founded; for Congress will be exceedingly remiss in its duty if it does not
                        promptly pass a bill, to go forthwith into effect, to bring alien residents
                        in the Confederacy, who are within the conscript age, into the service. The
                        law must be a stringent one, for there will be an infinite deal of hard
                        swearing about "a temporary residence," the "animo
                            revertendi," &amp;c. Some ought to get off on the "animo revertendi," principle, but, in our opinion,
                        very few are entitled to come within this rule. Certainly, no man of proper
                        age for service, who has been engaged in business in the Confederacy since
                        the war began, let him swear never so hard, should be exempted under this
                        principle. If he does not love us well enough to be imbued with the "animo manendi." a little genuine persuasion should
                        be applied to induce him to "pitch his tent and
                        tabernacle with us." The idea is intolerable that, while our relatives of
                        every degree are subjected to the dangers and privations of the field, a set
                        of men, who are amongst us for the purpose of feathering their own nest, no
                        matter at what cost to the Confederacy, should shirk service on the plea
                        that they are aliens. They stay here, are
                        protected by our laws in their persons and property, pay no taxes for
                        support of Government, discredit the credit of the Government that protects
                        them by hoarding the "metals" to them so "precious," and then will fly the
                        country to enjoy the wealth they will take with them rather than life an arm
                        or pay a dollar for the defense of the asylum that has given them protection
                        and wealth. Let Congress, if it has either the brains or the nerve to do so,
                        deal promptly with these gentry. The country expects this legislation, and
                        will be satisfied with nothing else. </p>

                        500,000. Suppose these two counties to make one tenth of all that is made in
                        the State, (which is probably a low estimate), and we have FIVE MILLIONS

<b>New Policy Of The Enemy</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Mississippi Extra believes that the North's recent cessation of the
                    prisoner exchange indicates that the Union has adopted a strategy of attrition.
                    In the face of this strategy, the author urges the Confederate soldiers to "take
                    as small a number of prisoners as possible, and never to surrender, while there

<b>The First Secessionist</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In examining the congressional record, it appears that Mr. Quincy of
                    Massachusetts may have been the first secessionist. This belief is based on a
                    speech made by Quincy during the debate over the creation of a state government
                    for the territory of Orleans. During his speech, Quincy declared "...if this
                    bill passes the bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved; that the States

                        doubt now as to what must be the future relations of the States that seceded
                        to what is still called the United States. These are to be thorough and
                        perfect separation, with unconditional independence, or, this failing, then
                        absolute and hopeless subjugation to the power of the Yankee race, political
                        ostracism, social degradation, and loss of everything which a white man ever
                        deemed worthy of preservation. The issue is distinct and definite. The last
                        resort of nations can alone determine it. The people of the Confederate
                        States must lose everything, or make good their independence. There is no
                        alternative, nor ought there to be any. Absolute independence from the old
                        Yankee Government is a necessity we have to embrace, and we can never think
                        of the close of the war upon any other basis.</p>

                    <p>Camp Stonewall Brigade, <br>Nov. 11, 1863, </p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--We wish to call your attention, and through the medium of your
                        well known paper, the attention of the public, to what we consider the
                        shameful and degrading conduct of two citizens of Augusta, who lately paid a
                        visit to our camp near Brandy Station, one of these individuals has a son,
                        and the other, two brothers in company D, 5th Va. Regt. of Infantry. These
                        persons, before they left home, pretended, to all concerned, that they would
                        take pleasure in attending to any boxes of provision or any thing else that
                        the relations and friends of our soldiers wished to send them, without
                        charging any price for their trouble. Under this impression, a great many
                        packages were entrusted to their care.--On their arrival at camp, these men
                        charged our soldiers the most exhorbitant [sic] prices for bringing down
                        things, which it can be proved were hauled at a low rate of charge to
                        Staunton, and on which they had to pay little or no freight on the cars; in
                        some instances they charged more than the value of the package or box
                        consigned to their care. The reason we do not mention the names of the
                        perpetrators of this Yankee trick, is because of the fact that, they are
                        already too well known in the regiment, and we also wish to give them a
                        warning which may teach them better. If the thing is repeated we intend to
                        publish them by name in both the Staunton papers. If there is one act of
                        meanness greater than another surely it is that low hypocrisy, which, under
                        the guise of kindness to our brave and suffering soldiers, takes care to
                        fill the pockets of scheming speculators and extortioners.</p>
                    <p>Hoping sir that you will give this article a speedy insertion in your paper,
                        and believing that you and your readers will take the same view of the case
                        as ourselves, we remain with high respect.</p>
                    <p>Yours Respectfully, <br>MANY SOLDIERS of 5th Va. Regt. </p>

                    <p>We were exceedingly gratified with the spirit of patriotism shown by our
                        neighbors of Augusta county on Friday and Saturday last.</p>
                    <p>The whole county seemed to be moved by a stern resolve to give the enemy, who
                        was then expected, the best reception possible. We were satisfied, from what
                        we saw, that Averill would have had "a hard road to travel" had he turned
                        his face towards Staunton. There were ten companies, making a fine regiment
                        of 800 or 900 then in the field ready to show the invader that the Augusta
                        Raid Guards were ready for such an emergency as then seemed likely to occur.
                        This formidable and effective organization is composed, of course, of the
                        very best citizens of old Augusta--gentlemen who are exempt from military
                        service, but who will claim no exemption from such obligations should the
                        common enemy dare to put his foot upon their soil.--We were pleased to see
                        several of our citizens who have left the county of Rockingham to reside
                        with our neighbors in the ranks of this fine organization for home defence.
