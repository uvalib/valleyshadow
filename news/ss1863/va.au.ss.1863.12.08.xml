                <excerpt>"It is clear that we, as well as the Yankees, need efficiency rather than
                    numbers; and unlike number, efficiency admits of indefinite increase."</excerpt>

                <summary>The author argues that, despite the "rash conclusion of some hot-headed old
                    gentlemen, beyond conscript age," a universal conscription of all men into the
                    service would be a disaster for the cause. Rather than seeking solely to
                    increase the number of men under arms, the author advocates increasing the
                    emphasis on the efficiency and competency of the armed forces.</summary>

                <excerpt>"Many of our friends and countrymen who have been forced to flee from their
                    homes before the approach of our cruel invaders, have come among us, and many of
                    our rich planters, whom God has greatly blessed, are unwilling to sell them corn
                    at all for fear it will get higher, and they lose a few dollars in the sale."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Rev. Bishop James O. Andrew, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, writes to
                        the Southern Christian Advocate:</p>
                    <p>The accursed greed for gold is ruining thousands of our people for this world
                        and the next. The past season has been unusually propitious. Our barns and
                        cribs have been full to overflowing, and yet numbers of our planters refuse
                        to sell corn at two dollars per bushel. Many of our friends and countrymen
                        who have been forced to flee from their homes before the approach of our
                        cruel invaders, have come among us, and many of our rich planters, whom God
                        has greatly blessed, are unwilling to sell them corn at all for fear it will
                        get higher, and they lose a few dollars in the sale. God has given us an
                        abundant crop this year, and thus we show our gratitude to Him. Is there no
                        danger that He will set his eyes upon us for evil, and cut off our hopes and
                        prospects in coming time? May God reform and save us.</p>

                <summary>Rev. Bishop Andrews attacks the greediness of those "rich planters" who, in
                    hopes of greater pecuniary rewards, refuse to sell their crops to those who have
                    had to flee the Northern invaders. The Reverend warns these unpatriotic and
                    unchristian souls that God may "set his eyes upon us for evil, and cut off our
                    hopes and prospects in coming times."</summary>

                    is not as dire as first feared. The recent engagement at Lookout Mountain and
                    Missionary Ridge did require the Confederate troops under the command of General
                    Bragg to yield the field of battle. However, the enemy losses in killed and
                    wounded are believed to have been three times higher than those of the Southern

                    <p>Though clouds should darken our horizon, though no ray of light should
                        penetrate the gloom, yet we should not despond, but hope confidently for the
                        rising of the sun of freedom to dissipate the gloom and gild with the
                        brightness of happiness the thousands of homes now darkened by bereavement
                        and sorrow. Though the storm should beat violently, and the "Ship of State"
                        be tossed by surges mountain high, though the ocean should yawn and threaten
                        to engulf the vessel, yet the firm determination of all should be, "<emph

                        and hopefully to enable it to withstand the fury of the tempest, that it may
                        be brought safely into port and anchored securely in the peaceful haven of
                        independence. There may be a few, who, not understanding what their
                        condition would be, sometimes think that it would be as well to submit as to
                        continue the struggle with all of its trials and sufferings increasing daily
                        in number and intensity; but there are just enough of these exceptions to
                        establish the rule that our people have no idea of submitting to Yankee
                        domination.--Those who are willing to be treated in even a worse manner than
                        the Israelites were by the Egyptians may be ready to bow the knee and kiss
                        the rod which afflicts them, but those who desire to avoid such a fate, and
                        who would rather die freemen than to live slaves will never, never submit.
                        In the language of Patrick Henry, "There is now no submission but in chains
                        and slavery." Submission to the Yankee domination means humiliation,
                        disgrace and worse than Egyptian bondage. </p>

                    opinions, and the conviction of my best judgement, which has not been controlled
                    by any considerations of selfishness, ambition, or fear."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>New York, Nov. 23.--John Minor Botts' letter to the Richmond "Examiner,"
                        under date of October 18th, has been received from the correspondent of the
                        Associated Press with the Army of the Potomac. Mr. Botts denies the charge
                        that he, in an interview with an Indiana Major, proclaimed himself a Union
                        man without any ifs or buts. He had no such interview and used no such
                        language. He denied having said that he wished the Federal Generals knew
                        half that he knew of the rebels and their resources and intentions. He is
                        not in the confidence of the Government or the Commanders of its forces, and
                        therefore of its intentions he is as profoundly ignorant as of their
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>In reply to the charge of the "Examiner" that he abhorred the Government, but
                        loved its money, he says: "Whatever I may think of the Government, yet I
                        never felt myself entirely at liberty, in this land of freedom to say half
                        as much against its Administration as I have read in your own editorial
                        columns; but if I have never made profession of devotion to the Government,
                        I have not ceased to feel a warm interest in the welfare of the people of
                        Virginia, with whose prosperity and freedom my own are entirely identified,
                        and I will take occasion to say here, what I said to General Meade, and have
                        said to all, that my earnest prayer is that this revolution may result in
                        whatever may contribute most to the permanent peace and happiness,
                        prosperity and freedom of the people of Virginia. These are the blessings of
                        a good Government; this is what I suppose is desired and armed at by al,
                        unless the selfish politician and the corrupt speculators in and out of the
                        army may constitute an exception. They care not what sort of a Government
                        they live under, provided they fill the high places and have their pockets
                        well lined.</p>
                    <p>"We may differ possibly, and perhaps honestly, as to the best means of
                        attaining these desirable ends. If it is by the success of the revolution
                        may it succeed; but if by the restoration of the Union, then I hope the
                        Union may be restored. What I want is a Government that has the will and
                        power to protect my person and my property against all abuses; and that I
                        would prefer living as I did before the war, to living as I have done since
                        the war, is beyond all question, and I would be a madman or a fool if I were
                        to pretend otherwise."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts denies having done anything of which the Confederate Government can
                        complain, unless it be that he has not become Democratized, and made no
                        concession to Democracy. On the other hand he complains, First, "that the
                        power of the legislative branch of the Government has been especially
                        directed against him." Second, that the power of the executive branch of the
                        Government has been executed against him when under this detstable [sic],
                        unwritten and unknown code called martial law.</p>
                    <p>Upon no charge preferred which they dared to present before the Court of
                        inquiry, they had him arrested in his bed and hurried to a filthy negro jai,
                        where he was kept in solitary confinement [sic] for eight weeks, when, with
                        all the vigilance and use and the search of their numerous detective they
                        could find nothing upon which to hinge a charge, and now comes a second
                        arrest without a charge, whilst the [illegible] itself has been turned loose
                        upon him, to destroy his property by design and by the orders, of officers
                        in high command, and but for a squad from the headquarters of General Lee,
                        none can tell to what condition he would have been reduced. Mr. Botts says,
                        "have I, then; Mr. Editor, had much reason for attachment or devotion to a
                        Government by which I have been thus treated!</p>
                    <p>"You complain of the treatment Mr. Vallandigham has received at the hands of
                        his Government. He made many violent speeches, in which he took active and
                        strong grounds against his Government; for this he was sent amongst his
                        friends, as they supposed. But I have done nothing, taken no part, but
                        maintained firmly and consistently, as I shall continue to do, my own
                        private opinions, and the conviction of my best judgment, which has not been
                        controlled by any considerations of selfishness, ambition or fear.</p>
                    <p>"I want no better vindication for having withheld my approval of this war
                        than is to be found in the fact that there is not one of those who aided in
                        bringing it on that would do it if, with their present experience, it had to
                        be gone over again, or if they could have foreseen what has followed, all of
                        which I did foresee and foretell." Mr. Butts denies that Gen. Meade took
                        dinner at his table, yet [illegible] known that he invited him to do so, and
                        regretted that his constant engagements prevented his acceptance, and should
                        he return to the vicinity, the offence would be repeated. The truth is, he
                        has entertained freely and hospitably the officers and gentlemen of both
                        armies whose acquaintance he has enjoyed, and shall continue to do so so
                        long as he is master of his own lands.</p>
                    <p>"Hitherto I have been silent", says Mr. Botts, "as to the wrongs, injuries
                        and indignities that have been heaped upon me, but I am not a spaniel, to
                        lie down and crouch at the bidding of any master, nor lick the hand that
                        smites me; and if I am thus to be selected as a particular object of
                        persecution, and can find no protection from the law, then will I protect
                        myself. This I cannot do against the Government or against an army, but I
                        can and will do it when the law, military and civil, both fail me, against
                        any one man that this Confederacy can boast.</p>
                    <p>"I cannot be induced to swerve one hair's breadth from the line of conduct
                        which my own judgment and conscience may dictate, which my own judgment and
                        conscience may dictate, which is to take no lot, part or share in the
                        responsibility that rests upon those who have brought this whirlpool of
                        desolation and ruin upon my unfortunate country, but if to adhere firmly and
                        consistently to the opinions and principles that I have maintained for
                        thirty years, and if to prefer living as I did before the war, to living as
                        I have done since the war makes me a traitor, then a traitor's life let me
                        live, or a traitor's death let me die."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor:--Since the organization of the home guard in Augusta, we have the
                        strongest evidence of a necessity of a stringent militia bill yet presented
                        since the beginning of the war.--In every neighborhood, whilst their
                        companies were forming, and the bid was pending in the Legislature, there
                        was an APPARENT interest taken in the movement by a large class, that abated
                        instantly, the bill was lost, and, in many instances, they did not care to
                        trouble themselves to muster, as they were not now COMPELLED to do so. They
                        even jeered at and taunted those more patriotic than themselves. You can
                        select large districts in the county where this NON-PATRIOTIC spirit seems
                        to exist. Indeed you will hear persons boldly declare that in some
                        neighborhoods you will find the feeling seems to be confined to certain
                        churches. And this view of the case gains strength, when you find that there
                        are some among us, and the number is LARGE, that do not say one word of
                        encouragement in their churches either in the pulpit, at the prayer meeting,
                        or on communion occasions, towards the prosecution of the war. An
                        intelligent gentleman said to the writer of this a few days ago, that in his
                        neighbohood [sic] where one of these sects was numerous, it had become a
                        common subject of remark, "THAT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD IN A SERMON OR A
                        PRAYER, ONE SINGLE WORD OF SYMPATHY OR ENCOURAGEMENT FROM ANY ONE, FROM THE
                        HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST OF ONE OF THE SECTS OF THE COUNTRY." If they have had
                        a chaplain in the service any where, or for a day in the South, the writer
                        does not know it, and would gladly give them credit if he did." At a
                        communion service a year or more ago, where several of their preachers were
                        present, a gentleman who had been attending the meeting prepared a
                        respectful request in writing, asking the prayers of the clergy present upon
                        our struggle for all that freemen hold dear, and laid it on the bible in the
                        pulpit, before service. NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN of it whatever, and no word
                        invoking the strength of Him, without whose aid we fight in vain, was
                        uttered during the meeting. This too in the presence of many of their
                        hearers, not members of their church, whose sons and brothers were then
                        periling their lives, and many writhing in pain, from wounds received in
                        battling for the rights and liberties of this people. Is it strange Mr.
                        Editor that such a course on their part will make them amenable to
                        criticism? Much more could be said on this subject, but enough has
                        transpired to convince all, that the Legislature must pass a stringent
                        militia bill and impose heavy penalties to make all who ought to be</p>
