                        history romantic in war as that of Joan of Arc. Last summer the Lieut. got
                        into Castle Thunder, her sex not corresponding with the dashing uniform she
                        wore. She was released, and went from Richmond to Chattanooga, where she
                        joined Gen'l Bragg's army, got upon the staff of General A. P. Stewart, and
                        for a time was emyloyed [sic] in the secret service, effecting important
                        arrests of spies, and doing some very daring things. </p>
                    <p>The other day she visited Richmond again, not as the gay Lieutenant, but in
                        the garments more becoming her sex, and bearing the name of Mrs. Jeruth
                        DeCaulp, she having, in the interval, married an officer of the Confederate

                    <p>In consideration of her services, the Confederate Government has commissioned

<b>Surrender at Cumberland Gap</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author bemoans the recent surrender of Confederate troops at Cumberland
                    Gap. He recounts how, despite a refusal on the part of General Frazier and his
                    officers to accept a proposal for surrender on the part of the Union Army,
                    General Frazier ordered his troops to surrender and told an officer to "tell
                    General Jones that I have gone up the spout." The article does commend the
                    Virginian troops (64th Va.) involved in the battle for their refusal to
                    surrender.<br>

<b>A Successful Dash Upon the Enemy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A report of a successful surprise attack launched by Confederate forces
                    under the command of Capt. John McNeill in Hardy County that resulted in the
                    capture of 147 prisoners. The article also contains an order by a Union
                    commander to surprise the Confederate force camped at Moorefield. This resulted
                    in the two armies attempting to launch surprise attacks at the same time.
                    However, since the Confederate forces had already left camp when the Union
                    forces arrived there was little left for the Union forces to do but attempt to
                    harass the enemy and recapture their prisoners, an attempt that ultimately
                    failed.<br>

<b>Remarkable Phenomenon--Interpretation Suggested</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A particularly bitter interpretation of a strange phenomenon in which a
                    number of individuals in Greenbrier County saw what appeared to be a procession

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Whig and the personal account of a "gentleman of Lewisburg."</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"We publish in this issue two account of the remarkable phenomenon which
                    was witnessed in Greenbrier county--one furnished to the Richmond Whig by an
                    intelligent officer, and the other furnished to the "Spectator" by a gentleman
                    of Lewisburg, whose intelligence, character and veracity we can endorse to the
                    fullest degree. The characters of the witnesses, who say they saw the phenomenon
                    described in these communications, are endorsed by those who have known them
                    intimately for many years. That these witnesses saw a remarkable spectacle there
                    can be but little doubt. What is the proper interpretation of this procession
                    due North of white bundles followed by figures of men robed in scanty apparel of

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The white bundles represent the cotton bales which the weak-kneed
                        secessionists of Mississippi are now sending North, and the fringe of
                        green--the emblem of that color being "forsaken"--indicates how green these planters are for having forsaken their country, and the figures of men
                        marching North at a rapid pace in the scanty garb described, represent that
                        these traitorous cotton sellers should be reduced in their dress to a cotton
                        shirt fastened on their "tight hides" by a plaster of tar, and be made to
                        march North at a "double quick."--The absence of arms and equipments
                        represent that they belong to that, numerous class of "men of war" who,
                            before the war, were so willing to spill
                        their "last drop of blood," but since the war
                        have shown an unconquerable dread of spilling the "first drop." </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the afternoon of the 1st instant, a strange phenomenon was seen in
                        Greenbrier county by Mr. Moses Dwyer, Mrs. Pearcy, two other ladies, a youth
                        nearly grown, and a servant girl. These respectable witnesses state that
                        they saw what seemed to be a countless multitude of men, dressed in white,
                        marching in column, on the ground through an open field, up the mountain
                        slope at a rapid pace, quicker than double quick time, the columns only
                        separated by a few feet. The witnesses state that they could see the men not
                        only as a whole, but the individual parts--their heads, arms, legs and feet.
                        Occasionally one would lag a little behind, and could be distinctly seen to
                        quicken his pace to regain his position in the line. They were passing for
                        an hour or more, and, it is thought, numbered thousands upon thousands.--The
                        field over which they passed is several hundred yards in length, and they
                        covered the entire area in passing.--Their general appearance was white, and
                        they were without arms or knapsacks.</p>
                    <p>An officer, of intelligence and character, in writing to the Richmond Whig concerning this story, in a private
                        note, says: </p>
                    <p>"I put myself to some trouble to ascertain the facts, and questioned the
                        witnesses separately. They are above suspicion. I have given all the
                        material facts, except that the so called men
                        were marching north or northwest, right thro' the mountains. They were of
                        all sizes, and as much like men as if they had been real flesh and blood."

                        is a good or a bad omen to the cause we are defending with all our energies,
                        and which we all love so much; whether it means peace or a longer
                        continuance of this bloody struggle, or is a mere delusion, who can say?</p>
                    <p>A remarkable phenomenon was witnessed a few miles west of this place, at the
                        house of Mrs. Pearcy, on the first day of this month at about 3 o'clock, P.
                        M., by Mr. Moses Dwyer, her neighbor, who happened to be seated in her porch
                        at the time, as well as by others at or near the house.</p>
                    <p>The weather was quite hot and dry, not a cloud could be seen, no wind even
                        ruffled the foliage on the surrounding trees. All things being propitious,
                        the grand panorama began to move.--Just over and through the tops of the
                        trees on the adjacent hills on the South, immense numbers of rolls
                        resembling cotton or smoke, apparently thousands of them, and were, perhaps,
                        an hour in getting by. After these had passed over and out of sight, the
                        scene was changed from the air above to the earth beneath, and became more
                        intensely interesting to the spectators who were witnessing the panorama
                        from different stand points. In the deep valley beneath thousands upon
                        thousands of [apparently] human beings [men] came in low traveling in the
                        same direction of the rolls marching in good order, some thirty or forty in
                        depth, moving rapidly--"double quick," and commence ascending the sides of
                        the almost insurmountable hills opposite, and had the stoop peculiar to men
                        when they ascend a steep mountain. There seemed to be great variety in the
                        size of the men, some were very large whilst others were quite small. Their
                        arms, legs and heads could be distinctly seen in motion. They seemed to
                        observe strict military discipline and there were no stragglers.</p>
                    <p>There was uniformity of dress, loose white blouses or shirts with white
                        pants, wore hats and were without guns, swords or anything they indicated
                        "men of war."--On they came through the valley and over the steep hill
                        crossing the road and finally passing out of sight, in a direction due North
                        from those who were looking on.</p>
                    <p>The gentlemen who [illegible] this is a man with whom you were once
                        acquainted, Mr. Editor, and as truthful a man as we have in the county, and
                        as little liable to be carried away by "fanciful speculations" as any man
                        living.--Four others (respectable ladies) and a servant girl witnesses this
                        strange phenomenon. W.</p>
                    <p>P. S. On the 14th that., the same scene almost identical, was soon by 8 or 10
                        of our pickets at Bunger's Mill, and by many of the citizens in that
                        neighborhood; this is about 4 miles east of Pearcy's. It was about the hour
                        passing.</p>

                    <p>September 5th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>The Mayor presented a petition signed by Robert G. Bickle and ninety-two
                        others, praying the passage of an Ordinance for the increase of taxation on
                        all taxable subjects in the Town, for the purpose of raising a fund to
                        provide supplies of Flour, Meat and Wood for the families of soldiers.</p>
                    <p>Whereupon, on motion of Col. Harman, the following resolution was adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That an ordinance by passed doubling the
                        taxes imposed by the Ordinance, passed the 9th of June last. </p>
                    <p>And thereupon, the Mayor submitted an Ordinance, which was passed in the
                        words following, to wit:</p>
                    <p>Be it ordained by the Council of the Town of Staunton, that the Ordinance
                        passed on the 9th of June last, imposing taxes for the Town of Staunton be
                        amended, by increasing the amount of taxation on all subjects therein named,
                            one hundred percent for the purposes
                        expressed in the petition aforesaid. </p>
                    <p>And it is further ordained, that to facilitate the collection of the Town
                        Taxes, the Chief of Police be and is hereby authorized to endorse the word
                        "DOUBLE" on the face and back of his tax tickets, and collect and account
                        for the same accordingly, and, that for all taxes on licenses granted,
                        issued and collected since the 24th day of April last, the Chief of Police
                        is hereby required and authorized to make out new tickets for the amounts of
                        such taxes, and collect and account for the same accordingly, and for all
                        licenses which may be granted and issued between this date and the 24th of

                        and intent of this Ordinance, and collect and account for the same
                        accordingly.</p>

                        appointed a Committee to disburse the fund to be raised under the above
