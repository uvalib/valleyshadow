<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have never been disposed, says the Richmond Dispatch, to overrate the
                        importance of the Peace party in the North or Northwest.--Our reasons for
                        this have been too often given to bear recapitulation. But we are equally
                        well satisfied that it is the policy of the South to encourage disaffection
                        to the Black Republican Government, in whatever shape it shows itself or
                        from whatever motive. Admitting it to be true that Northern Democrats oppose
                        the war from party motives, and Northwestern Democrats from considerations
                        of commercial interests, then we say let us, as far as we can, abstain from
                        throwing ridicule upon that opposition, and encourage as far as we can
                        everything that will divide the North and set the people against a fanatical
                        Government which is doing them far more injury than it can do us. Our
                        forefathers did not inquire too closely into the motives of France when she
                        came to the aid of America in the Revolution. It would have been very absurd
                        in them to throw in the teeth of France what was undoubtedly true, that, in
                        espousing the cause of the American Colonies, she was influenced more by
                        hatred of England than love of America. She was looking after her interests,
                        not ours; but it would have been ridiculous to tell her so. Nations do not
                        go counselling in these days, but follow their interests; and if the
                        interests or [sic] any section or party in the North point to peace, let us
                        by all means bid them Godspeed. Let us make their interests more palpable to
                        them by a vigorous prosecution of the war, and let us give them distinctly
                        to understand that reconstruction is a thing not to be dreamed of; but, at
                        the same time, let us not throw cold water upon their attempts to overthrow
                        the Black Republican despotism at Washington. For our own part, we believe
                        the masses at the North are heartily tired and sick of the war, put [sic]
                        the military tyranny of the United States has hitherto rendered powerless
                        their aspirations for peace. It is not for us, however, to discourage them
                        in their struggles for deliverance. We should help them with a few more
                        victories, and the balls and bayonets of our brave soldiers are the best
                        reliance for bringing about this object.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every one is asking the question, "Where is Gen. Lee's army?" and "Echo
                        answers, where?" The only news we now get from that army is through the
                        Northern papers. By an examination of the map of the Keystone State in
                        conjunction with the telegrams in the Northern papers, it would seem that
                        our forces are no where particularly, but everywhere generally--they seem to
                        be spread about loose over a large part of that wealthy State. The Yankees
                        have been concentrating their forces at Harrisburg, the Capital of
                        Pennsylvania, and have boasted that they are able to defend that city
                        successfully.--If they look North, the much dreaded "ragged rebels" are
                        there; if they look South, they are there, and if they look West, they are
                        there. From Harrisburg, they are found in every direction also, the news of
                        the next few days will probably develope [sic]. By the telegrams in the
                        Northern papers of the 28th ult., it appears that our forces occupied
                        Carlisle at ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 27th, without resistance.
                        Without pausing they moved on towards Harrisburg, and at mid-day were within
                        fifteen miles of that place. This looked like business! They seem, however, to have thence bent their course, in
                        the first instance, to Duncannon, a point fifteen miles above Harrisburg,
                        where the great Central Railroad crosses the Susquehanna, on its course
                        towards Pittsburg [sic]. It needs no one to tell what took them there, or
                        what became of that bridge. </p>
                    <p>On the same day, (Saturday) General Early's division occupied York, also,
                        without resistance. This breaks up the Northern Central railroad, which
                        leads from Baltimore through York to Harrisburg, with a branch at York
                        leading to the Philadelphia road at Lancaster.--Our troops on the same day,
                        occupied Hanover Junction. This is the point where the branch road from
                        Gettysburg joins the Northern Central. It is eleven miles South of York, and
                        forty-six miles from Baltimore.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The enemy is pressing closely upon Harrisburg. Gen. Lee's whole army is
                        undoubtedly in Pennsylvania. His own headquarters are at Hagerstown, Md.,
                        from which he is directing the movements. Gen. Longstreet's corps crossed
                        near Williamsport on Saturday. A great battle is impending at Harrisburg
                        today. Last night the rebels were within three miles of the city, and heavy
                        firing was going on all day. This was probably the outposts, skirmishing as
                        the enemy advanced.</p>
                    <p>Mechanicsburg was surrendered by our troops yesterday morning, and
                        immediately occupied by the rebels.--They also took possession of York, our
                        troops clearing out before them. They have done serious damage to the
                        Northern Central Railroad, both at York and Hanover Junction. They have
                        burnt two bridges at York Haven. The splendid bridge across the Susquehana
                        at Columbia, a mile and a quarter long, which cost a million of dollars, was
                        burned by our troops under Col. Frick, yesterday.</p>
                    <p>The utmost consternation prevails throughout the State of Pennsylvania, and
                        at last there appears to be a disposition on the part of the people to rally
                        for their defence. Fugitives, however, keep pouring into Harrisburg,
                        Lancaster and other cities, in a state of complete terror, bringing their
                        cattle, merchandise and household goods with them.</p>
                    <p>A train of one hundred wagons, loaded with supplies, and nine hundred mules
                        were captured by the rebels near Rockville, Md., yesterday. Several
                        officers, who were on their way to join their regiments, were also captured.</p>
                    <p>A rebel force, which is said to be 7,000 strong, and composed of three
                        brigades of cavalry, is reported to be moving eastward towards the
                        Washington branch of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. They are reported to
                        be commanded by Fitzhugh Lee. It has been ascertained that they passed
                        within 14 miles of Washington, on the North side, and it is presumed that
                        they are striking for the trestle work upon the railroad between the capital
                        and Annapolis Junction.</p>
                    <p>The "Herald" of the 30th ult., says that the enemy had not advanced on
                        Harrisburg at latest accounts. Skirmishing at various points on the South
                        side of the Susquehanna was going on yesterday, at Oysterville, and
                        Maysville especially. All our forces were within the defences at sunset
                        yesterday. The rebels had torn up the track at Mariettaville and Sykesville,
                        thirty-one miles from Baltimore. The damage at the latter place is but
                        slight.</p>
                    <p>General Early has levied on the authorities of York for $150,000 in
                        greenbacks, 40,000 pounds of fresh beef, 200 barrels of flour, 30,000
                        bushels corn, 1,000 pairs each of shoes, stockings, coats and hats, 50 bags
                        of coffee, and large quantities of sugar and groceries. General Early says
                        "we will occupy the place permanently."</p>
                    <p>The defenders in the entrenchments at Harrisburg are prepared for an attack
                        to-day.</p>
                    <p>The enemy is reported crossing the river at Bainbridge on pontoons, with the
                        intention of cutting the Pennsylvania Central railroad.</p>
                    <p>The greatest alarm and activity prevail in Philadelphia. The Mayor and Gen.
                        Dana have issued stirring proclamations, appealing to citizens to prepare to
                        defend their homes.</p>
                    <p>There was a great panic in stock yesterday. The coal dealers held a meeting,
                        and resolved to close their colleries until the crisis has passed, to enable
                        the miners to volunteer. The merchants resolved to raise one million dollars
                        for home defence. The Board of Brokers raised $25,000, to be divided among
                        five hundred men, who may enlist for the emergency. A line of entrenchments
                        will be commenced around the city of Philadelphia to-morrow. The splendid
                        bridge over the Susquehanna at Columbia, valued at $157,000, was burnt on
                        the 28th, to keep the rebels out of the town.</p>
                    <p>"Fighting Joe Hooker" has been superseded in the command of the Army of the
                        Potomac, by Major-General Geo. G. Meade, one of General Hooker's corps
                        commanders.</p>
                    <p>The following is General Hooker's Farewell Address to the Army of the
                        Potomac:</p>
                    <p>"H'D-Q'RS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, <br>"Frederick, Md., June 28, 1863. </p>
                    <p>
                        General orders No. 65.
                    </p>
                    <p>"In conformity with the orders of the War Department, dated June 27, 1863, I
                        relinquish the Army of the Potomac. It is transferred to Major General Geo.
                        G. Meade, a brave and accomplished officer, who has nobly earned the
                        confidence and esteem of the Army on many a well-fought field. Impressed
                        with the belief that my usefulness as the commander of the Army of the
                        Potomac is impaired, I part from it, yet not without the deepest emotion.
                        The sorrow of parting with the comrades of so many battles is relieved by
                        the conviction that the courage and devotion of this Army will never cease
                        nor fail; that it will yield to my successor, as it has to me, a willing and
                        hearty support. With the earnest prayer that the triumph of its arms may
                        bring successes worthy of it and the nation, I bid it farewell.</p>
                    <p>JOSEPH HOOKER, <br>Major General.</p>

                    <p>Among the documents of Milroy captured at Winchester, is a report, dated Feb.
                        15th, 1863, from Michael Graham, of Gen'l Bank's secret service, to Maj.
                        Gen. H. W. Halleck, Commander-in-chief, U.S.A., of the observations made by
                        his wife, Catherine Graham, whilst traveling as a spy from Mt. Jackson up
                        the Valley to Staunton, thence to Richmond, thence, by way of Culpeper,
                        Woodville, Sperryville, Little Washington to Piedmont, thence to New Berlin,
                        on the Baltimore and Ohio R. R., thence to Washington city. She says that
                        from Culpeper she rode as far as Baltimore in company with Mrs. Kelley, of
                        Staunton, and Mrs. Kenedy, of Culpeper, whom she thought, "from their
                        actions and conversation, were two rebel spies." It is quite natural for the
                        guilty to suspect others.</p>
                    <p><br>"All is infected which the infected spy, <br>As all seems yellow to the
                        jaundiced eye." </p>
                    <p>This report of this female spy was endorsed as follows:</p>

                    <p>The result shows how much benefit Milroy derived from it. It is to be hoped
                        that our community will derive more benefit from the information
                        communicated by the "rebel spy" from this place. They would be pleased to

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>More of a continuing diatribe against the Editor of the Vindicator.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It will be remembered that when, during the recent canvass, we spoke of
                        persons having "axes to grind," the Editor of the "Vindicator" manifested
                        such a degree of sensitiveness, that we warned him the public would be apt
                        to infer that "he, too, had an axe to grind."--The result has shown that he
                        had more cause to exhibit sensitiveness than we had supposed, for it seems
                        that when we were speaking of those having "axes to grind," we were all the
                        time touching him on the raw, and it is now not
                        at all surprising that he winced as much as he
                        did. With a witticism that would have put Charles Lamb to the blush, he very
                        modestly said, in substance, that his aspirations for office did not amount
                        to so much as axe grinding but only hatchet grinding. </p>
                    <p>To give him, then, the benefit of his witticism, we will say that he hurried
                        to Richmond with his hatchet, and had it ground
                        in short order--in other words, he received the appointment of Confederate
                        Tax Collector for Augusta county. How others, having axes to grind, will
                        succeed, time will develope [sic]. There is nothing like disinterested
                        patriotism. </p>
