                    <p>Waynesboro', Pa., June 21, 1863</p>
                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS:--On the 20th inst., the column marched from Hagerstown, Md.,
                        to Waynesboro', Pa., which place we now occupy. In this place large supplies
                        of commissary stores, drugs, transports, etc., have been procured. We should
                        have remarked in our last communication that a heavy stock of medicines was
                        procured by the command while in the occupation of Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>The brigade explores this country at will, with only occasional scouting
                        parties of the enemy falling in the way, of whom many are picked up by our
                        men. We have captured, in all, about 500 prisoners since the command left
                        Staunton, Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Our scouts are bringing in horses and cattle daily in large numbers. The
                        citizens express their happy disappointment in being spared in their persons
                        and houses not being destroyed, as their leaders and papers had represented
                        would be the case if invaded by us.</p>
                    <p>W. K.</p>
                    <p>Hagerstown, Md., June 21--8 P.M.</p>
                    <p>When our column marched this morning, moving eastward three miles, it was
                        ascertained that the road through the mountain spurs was barricaded and the
                        mountain spurs was barricaded and the "bushwhackers" in their positions. But
                        they may soon learn that Gen. Jenkins has much practical experience in that
                        mode of warfare. He sent out his skirmishers and waited their return; they
                        brought in ten of the "gentlemen," and reported that they found and feasted
                        around a well furnished table in the woods, long enough to accommodate one
                        hundred persons.--When Virginians "bushwhacked" Yankee invaders the Northern
                        press regard such conduct as an outrage too intolerable to be submitted to
                        by an intelligent people. But it is said that "circumstances alter cases."
                        That which is considered outrageous in Virginians may be regarded as
                        praiseworthy in Pennsylvanians.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Sweeney's battalion suffered by being led into an ambuscade by the
                        retreating army from Berryville, on the 18th inst. The Major is badly
                        wounded.</p>

                    <p>"I wish to tell you a little incident concerning a Dutch woman who lived just
                        outside of the town of Gettysburg. She fully believed, hoped and prayed that
                        the Yanks would have whipped us back; and so strongly was she convinced of
                        its certainly taking place, that she cooked splendid bread and plea for the

                        house. Well, the old "voman" was doomed to disappointment. Our boys whipped
                        the Yankees back, and I was fortunate enough to get some of the "fixins" of
                        this old lady. It was enough to make a well-fed man hungry to have gazed
                        upon that pile of beautiful white loaves, those rich golden colored sugar
                        cakes and pies. SUCH pies:--a whole army might have feasted (THEIR EYES)
                        upon them, and then have had enough left to feed several hungry dogs.
                        Pies--yes, she had little pies and big pies, thin pies and thick pies, long
                        pies and short pies, sweet pies and sour pies, round pies and half-moon
                        pies--in fact, pies of all kinds graced her table in apple pie order. Now, I
                        just ate pies until I could have done without rations for three days.</p>

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"As Gen. Lee had forbidden any telegrams to be sent during the past
                    week, there has been but little news from that army. It is now known, however,
                    that his army has re-crossed the Potomac, and is now again upon the sacred soil
                    of Virginia. Whilst Meade was expecting Lee to be upon him every day, Lee very
                    leisurely withdrew his forces to this side of the River. Meade telegraphed to
                    Halleck that he had captured about 2,000 of our rear guard, but as we have

                    <p>The Yankee commander, with the usual disregard of truth, claims to have
                        captured 2000 prisoners during the falling back of our army from Hagerstown.
                        We have the best authority for stating that our entire loss in the brilliant
                        movement did not exceed three hundred in kill, wounded and missing, while
                        the enemy suffered to an equal if not greater extent. We took two hundred
                        and fifty prisoners, and killed and wounded at least one hundred.</p>
                    <p>It seems to be believed in Winchester that Meade crossed the main body of his
                        army over at Harper's Ferry, whilst Lee was crossing his at Williamsport,
                        and that there is a prospect that a great battle will be fought not far from
                        that place.</p>
                    <p>In this connection we give the account of Imboden's fight at Williamsport, as
                        furnished by a member of his staff to the Richmond Enquirer. That staff
                        officer says:</p>
                    <p>"Our command was not in the battle of Gettysburg. We left our camp near
                        Gettysburg on the 4th, as an escort to a wagon train of 1,200 wagons,
                        (nearly twenty miles long,) and travelled night and day until we reached
                        Williamsport. We were attacked several times, and lost a few wagons--though
                        we repulsed the Yankees. Arriving at Williamsport we found the river not
                        fordable, and immediately prepared for an expected attack. We had quite a
                        number of stragglers along. Two days after we reached there the Yankees
                        advanced on us with three brigades of cavalry, under Generals Buford and
                        Kilpatrick, one brigade of which was Regular Cavalry--the 1st, 2d, 5th, and
                        6th United States Regulars--and three batteries of artillery, one a Regular
                        battery; their force a little exceeding eight thousand men.</p>
                    <p>We armed all the men we could gather together--wagoners and stragglers,
                        making, with our command, about 2,100 men and 22 pieces of artillery. The
                        General had the artillery all planted.--The enemy advanced on three roads,
                        and then commenced the most amusing fight of the war. They tried very hard
                        to flank us. Our line of battle was nearly three miles long, and the General
                        had to double-quick the infantry backwards and forwards so as to always
                        offer opposition. The battle commenced a little before 3 o'clock, in the
                        afternoon, and by 8 o'clock we drove the whole force from the field.</p>
                    <p>The firing was beautiful and very rapid. I never saw such destructive
                        cannonading; one piece on our side lost thirteen men killed and
                        wounded.--They dismounted two regiments, but our wagoners were too much for
                        them.--They carried away nearly all of their dead and wounded, though the
                        ground was strewn with dead horses. Our loss was about 125 men. Several
                        officers were killed. Capt. Pegram, Co. F, Richmond, was with his company in
                        the action--poor fellow! he was killed.--We saved the immense wagon train of
                        our army, and too much credit cannot be given to Gen. Imboden. He organized
                        a force out of a mob, and whipped the enemy, outnumbering him nearly five to
                        one. He is a splendid man, and on the field goes everywhere, no matter how
                        great the danger. One of the staff had his horse killed under him. I
                        wondered exceedingly that some of us were not wounded, as the firing
                        surpassed any I have ever seen; it was one of the hottest little fights,
                        too. Our command is separated now. Gen. Lee sent the General and our
                        infantry across the river with the prisoners--leaving our cavalry and
                        artillery with the army. Our men will take the Yankees to Richmond.</p>

                    <p>The great event of the last week, more interesting than the result of

                        that forcible and successful resistance to Lincoln's draft has been made in

                        beginning to appear on the wall, and the knees of the abolition Belshazzar

                        chattering like bone castanets in the hands of musical Sambos. The spirit of
                        resistance to the draft will not be confined to New York. It will soon show
                        itself throughout the North. The war feeling in the North has had its flow,
                        but the ebb has now commenced, and it will be commensurate with the flow of
                        the flood-tide. The draft will not be executed in New York, and, it may be,
                        no place else. The Northern papers are filled with accounts of the great
                        riot, but we only have space for the following:</p>
                    <p>Enrolling offices in eighty-eighth and eighty-ninth districts completely

                        The military were ordered out and several citizens and soldiers killed. Upon
                        the arrival of the police on the ground, another attack was made on the
                        crowd, and the police dispersed. Several were killed and others badly
                        beaten. Superintendent Kennedy was severely wounded. An Armory on Second
                        Avenue was destroyed. A raid was made on the negroes and the colored Orphan
                        Asylum laid in ashes. The destruction of buildings was fearful. The
                        Bullshead Hotel, two mansions on Lexington avenue were sacked. The Tribune
                        office was attacked and the attacked repulsed by the police. Negroes were

                        serious look.</p>
                    <p>Several buildings were destroyed, and many lives were lost. Several soldiers,
                        policemen and citizens were wounded. Private houses in not a few instances
                        were broken open. The Times gives an account of the progress of the riot
                        proceedings! It says there is no question but that a vastly larger number
                        were engaged than on the previous Monday. Several encounters between the
                        mob, police and military. A large number of the rioters were killed.</p>
                    <p>Col. Osburn, of the 11th New York, who commanded a portion of the forces, was
                        beaten to death by the crowd and then hung, the streets barricaded,
                        buildings burned, stores closed, private dwellings plundered, all large
                        manufacturing establishments closed, and every branch of business suspended.</p>
                    <p>Gov. Seymour arrived from Albany, and addressed the crowd from the steps of
                        the City Hall. He announced that he had sent to Washington to ask the
                        Government to stop the draft in the city for the present. He subsequently
                        issued a proclamation declaring the city, county and State in insurrection.</p>
                    <p>Among the incidents were the following:</p>
                    <p>A party of rioters broke open an undertaker's store and stole a coffin, on
                        which they inscribed: "Lincoln's Draft Died Monday, July 18th." They then
                        carried the coffin around the streets.--Some of the newsboys mingled with
                        the crowd around the Park, crying extras, announcing "Execution of Horace
                        Greely." The hoax was largely cheered by the rabble.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mrs. Alice Williams, the female who, several weeks since, donned herself in a
                        Confederate Lieutenant's uniform, and assumed the name of "Lieutenant
                        Buford," and committed to Castle Thunder under suspicion of being a Yankee
                        spy, was sent South last week. In speaking of her, the Richmond Sentinel
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"The history of this female Lieutenant is full of romantic interest. Report
                        says that she participated in the battles of Kentucky and Mississippi, and
                        at Shiloh received a dangerous wound. Her husband, it is said, is in the
                        Federal army, but she, with true Southern feelings, sympathises with our
                        cause, and illustrates our sympathy in a practical way. She is brave, but
                        eccentric, and certainly has an ambition to distinguish herself in the
                        sphere allotted to man. If she is allowed the opportunity, she will
                        doubtless take a hand in the fight at Jackson, Mississippi.</p>
