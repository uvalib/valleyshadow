                <excerpt>He will soon appear again at his post of duty, when such bruisers and
                    shoulder strikers as think they can suppress the freedom of speech and the
                    freedom of the press, by breaking the bones of an editor, can have an
                    opportunity of demonstrating the fallacy of their theory.</excerpt>

                <transcript>
                    <p>At the beginning of the canvass for Congress, relying confidently upon the
                        patriotism of the masses of the people without distinction of former party
                        divisions, we expressed the belief that the election in this county would
                        present the sublime spectacle of the whole voting population, with the
                        exception of axe-grinders and those under their influence, rallying, with an
                        approximation to unanimity, to the support of the re-election of Hon. John
                        B. Baldwin. The result has verified this prediction, and has shown that our
                        confidence in the disinterested patriotism of the masses of those who had
                        been formerly classed as Democrats was well founded. We are gratified to
                        know that this is as true of the Democrats of Rockingham, our native county,
                        as of those in "old Augusta." When we expressed our confidence in these
                        patriots, the "Vindicator" called it "sickly flattery." The result has
                        proven that instead of being "flattery," which is praise <emph rend="italic"
                            >undeserved,</emph> it was praise <emph rend="italic">richly
                        merited.</emph> We said at the time that the result would show who had the
                        better appreciation of the patriotism of the Democracy. The result <emph
                            rend="italic">has</emph> shown, and it is favorable to their patriotism,
                        and in accordance with our expressed confidence in them. </p>
                    <p>By virtue of the pure patriotism of the masses of the Democracy of this
                        District, Hon. John B. Baldwin is re-elected to Congress by a larger
                        majority than any other candidate for Congress in the whole State. By this
                        act, the voters of the District have secured the continued services of a
                        member of Congress who is an honor to the District and a credit to the
                        State. They will never have reason to regret the choice they have made.--The
                        friends of Baldwin, also, have the gratification to know that they did not
                        secure his re-election by slandering the character of his opponent. "All has
                        worked together for good."</p>
