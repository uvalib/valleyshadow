                    and 10,000 Yankee. There were more cases of amputation with our soldiers than
                    with the enemy, and they have been more fatal. This correspondent says that

                        where their nurses were, they said they only had one or two to each floor,
                        and they could not attend them all. In each corner was a pile of dirt, and
                        the flours were wet from the careless spilling of water when the wounds were
                        wet. We went into the yard, and there were some two hundred slightly wounded
                        and convalescent rebels, able to draw and cook their own rations, eating
                        their breakfasts. In our hospitals these would have been made to take their
                        watches with the helpless as nurses; but they would not raise a hand to help
                        their more unfortunate fellows. So true is this that many of them express

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last Tuesday was an exciting day in Staunton to all the owners of
                        horses.--The impressment officer had it made known very early in the
                        morning, by having all the ways of egress "blockaded," that "he was about,"
                        and that he was as anxious to get possession of equine flesh as was Richard
                        III when he exclaimed on Bosworth field with all the force of his lungs,
                            "A horse! A horse!! My kingdom for a
                        horse!!!" Such was the hurry, and so great the seeming emergency that
                        locks were broken and doors prized off their hinges, as there was not time
                        to wait for the owners to bring the keys. The horses of physicians and
                        undertakers were taken; but were graciously restored to their owners when
                        apprised that the sick would die and the dead go unburied if the horses of
                        physicians and undertakers were not given up. The citizens were taken by
                        surprise, and were at a loss to know what caused such a pressing emergency. They were perfectly willing to give up their
                        horses, if needed, but had some objection to the quo
                            modo--the manner in which the officer performed his duty. They
                        modestly thought that there was a right and a wrong way of doing a right
                        thing, and were under the impression that the officer did the right thing in
                        the wrong way. The persons in the best humor on Tuesday last in Staunton
                        were those who were so fortunate as not to own a horse. They gratulated
                        [sic] themselves with the reflection: Blessed is the man who owns "nary a
                        hoss." These fortunates would hallo across the street to their friends and
                        inquire, "how are you off for horse flesh?" When they would get the reply,
                        "I didn't have any horse flesh, but all my horse
                            bones have been impressed." </p>

                    <p>The great need of the South at this time is more soldiers. All of all defeats
                        and losses are attributable to a want of soldiers. As we have before noticed
                        the President has issued a proclamation calling out all men, not exempted by
                        law, between the ages of 18 and 45. This call is rendered proper, and indeed
                        indispensable, by Lincoln's call for 300,000 conscripts to swell his forces
                        to be employed for our subjugation.</p>
                    <p>In the language of the Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer, his armies, whatever force they may amount to, must be
                        met, if it should require every man and boy in the Confederacy. It is a hard
                        duty, but it is a duty which cannot be avoided
                        but with the loss of everything that as individuals and as a community the
                        people of the Confederacy hold dear. </p>
                    <p>The Yankee Congress has already passed laws to confiscate the property of the
                        people of the Confederacy, and to emancipate their slaves, and the savage
                        malignity of their conduct, wherever they have secured a foot-hold in the
                        South, shows, beyond peradventure that those laws will be enforced if they
                        ever get the power to enforce them. Their soldiers have been promised farms
                        in the South as the reward of their services in conquering us; and they must
                        be wilfully [sic] blind who imagine that the hundreds of thousands of
                        soldiers who have had a taste of blood and ample liberty to rob and outrage,
                        will ever be permitted to return to the North in case of the conquest of the
                        South. The only hope of preserving the lives and property of non-combatants
                        in the large Northern cities, would lie in the quartering of those
                        blood-thirsty villains at the South.</p>
                    <p>Under such circumstances, and our readers know that we have stated them
                        correctly, it is idle to talk of peace, until the
                        North shows a willingness to have peace, or at least to enter upon
                        negotiations. That they are not prepared for this is manifest from their
                        refusal even to listen to so distinguished a Commissioner as Vice President
                        Stephens upon a secondary point. </p>
                    <p>We repeat, it is idle to talk of peace, until the

                        talk of war and wage war until the enemy tires of war. History is full of
                        examples for our encouragement, of more unequal and even more bloody wars,
                        that finally resulted in the triumph of the people fighting for their
                        rights, their homes and their lives. It is the will of God that we suffer
                        occasional disasters. Let us not, by our own will, permit a combination of
                        all the worst disasters that can befall a people--immediate loss of
                        property, liberty, honor, and eventual loss of life also. Courage, then,
                        Southrons! Brave and true men seize the moment of adversity, not to indulge
                        despair, but to nerve themselves against disaster, and to compel victory.
                        Assured that we are beating for the right, nothing but the will of God
                        should conquer us, and that will has been, so far, more manifested in our
                        favor than against us. </p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A somewhat rambling essay that touches on a number of issues. The failure

                    made of the Union government's refusal to meet with Vice President Stephens.
                    There is also a long discussion on the injustice of the North's selecting

                    <p>We invite attention to the proclamation of President Davis appointing Friday,
                        the 21st of this month, as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer, and
                        express the hope that it will be observed in the proper christian spirit. It

                        gain, seemingly oblivious of the fact that it is impossible to serve God and
                        Mammon. It is too true, as the President says, "that the love of lucre has
                        eaten, like a gangrene, into the very heart of

                        them unmindful of their duty to their fellowmen [sic], and to their God." As
                        long as the people practice the sin of extortion upon each other, and the
                        officers of the Confederacy rob the Government, we cannot expect to be
                        vouch-safed the boon of freedom and independence. </p>

                    <p>The President has issued a strong appeal to the soldiers of the Confederacy
                        absent from their commands to return IMMEDIATELY, and promises amnesty to
                        all who are absent without leave if they return within twenty days from this
                        date, after which time all will be treated and punished as deserters.
                        General Lee and President Davis have both issued calls for soldiers to
                        return immediately--the emergency is great and every soldier should be at
                        his post of duty. The address was received too late for insertion in this
