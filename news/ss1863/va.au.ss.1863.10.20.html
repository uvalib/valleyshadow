<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--The condition of our roads is, or should be a matter of deep
                        interest to the public. The roads are becoming almost impassable, many not
                        having been worked for more than two years. Most of the bridges are in a
                        dangerous condition, and it is a matter of great surprise that the members
                        of the Grand Jury have gone to Staunton time and again over these roads, and
                        yet no presentiments. They have eased their consciences, while basely
                        violating their oaths, by the flimsy argument, that during the war there are
                        not enough hands to keep the roads in repair, and that such things should be
                        over-looked for the present. This is entirely wrong. Our roads should be
                        regularly worked, for "a stitch in time saves nine," holds as good in
                        working our roads as in repairing our domestic rents. Then, too, as our
                        business has to be done with smaller and weaker teams, the roads should be
                        kept in better order. I have never seen the road and bridges in such order.
                        I have never seen the roads and bridges in such order. Many of the bridges
                        are tottering to the fall. I need not specify, as all are in the same
                        condition. But I will mention two as a sample: the bridge in the turnpike,
                        over the branch that passes out of the Lunatic Hospital garden, has been in
                        a wretched condition for over two years, (and is now very dangerous,) and
                        the bridge over the railroad near Hugh McClure's, over which it will soon be
                        unsafe to drive a buggy, for fear of falling through. Then, too, the public
                        roads are blockaded at every wagon maker's and blacksmith's shop by old
                        wagons, plows and lumber. The public have endured the blockade on the road,
                        where it passes under the railroad to enter Staunton from the east, as long
                        as it will. This has continued for over two years, and is a great outrage.
                        The proprietors of the Virginia Livery Stable have been allowed to blockade
                        the street opposite their office door, with buggies, carriages, wagons and
                        carts for so long a time, that they feel themselves perfectly at liberty to
                        keep you sitting on your horse or in your buggy, waiting for some one ahead
                        to get out of the way just as long as they may please. Have these men a
                        grant of this entire street? Shall they be allowed to continue this nuisance
                        to the inconvenience of so many? They have a large vacant lot, and yet on
                        Court day, a string of buggies a hundred yards long may be seen obstructing
                        half of a very narrow, and yet very public street. It is a sense of their
                        duty, or that our next Grand Jury will perform the responsible duties of
                        their office with more fidelity to the public street. It is to be hoped that
                        our road masters will awake to a sense of their duty, or that our next Grand
                        Jury will perform the responsible duties of their office with more fidelity
                        to the public and credit to themselves. Is there no tribunal before which
                        Grand Jurors may be brought for dereliction of duty.</p>

                        But of those 50,000 reliable men, the World's

                        same thing, in Dutch. Just think of it! A man with Country, Liberty,
                        Property, everything at stake, and trembling in the balances, willing to
                        lose all rather than let the Government get a piece of his meat!--Why, if
                        the hogs themselves had a say-so in the matter, they would scorn such
                        littleness of soul and contemptible selfishness, if they did not cut their
                        own throats in utter shame of their meanness and want of patriotism.</p>

                    <p>Among other measures which have presented themselves to the mind of those who
                        interest themselves upon the subject, the idea of a repudiation of the
                        public debt at the conclusion of the war has not yet, that we are aware, met
                        with an advocate willing to defend publicly such a doctrine. We cannot
                        conceive anything that would derogate more from the character of the
                        Southern people, as one moved by all the sentiments of honor and justice,
                        than the adoption of such a policy. When an individual violates an express
                        contract without the most strenuous efforts beforehand to fulfil it, he is
                        guilty of voluntary falsehood, and deserves the execration of all honest
                        men. But for a nation struggling into existence in defence of the great
                        principles of Freedom and Justice, appealing to the God of Truth or aid in
                        defence of the right, and calling upon the most patriotic and
                        self-sacrificing portion of its citizens to give it confidence and support
                        in implicitly trusting to its plighted faith, to pursue such a course, would
                        be to violate every principle of justice, and to commit in its very first
                        act, one that would disgrace its annals for years to come. Those who have
                        given no confidence to the Government in investing in its bonds, but who
                        have depreciated its currency both by their expressions of opinion and their
                        example in investing everything they possessed in real estate, would be
                        those to profit by such legislation, whilst the friends, the aiders and
                        abettors of the Government in its time of need and sore distress would be
                        the losers. But it is sometimes urged, that for the soldiers in the field,
                        who have made so many sacrifices in the war, who have undergone fatigue, and
                        hunger, and exposure to all kinds of hardships, for so many years, and who
                        have nobly sacrificed ease, comfort, and all the ties of affection binding
                        them to the family altar, to be subjected to an onerous tax at the
                        conclusion of all their labors would of all things be the most unjust. Be it
                        so, then let every private in the army of the Confederacy who chooses to
                        avail himself of the privilege, be wholly exempt from taxation for any
                        specified time that may be adjudged proper. When we consider the number of
                        very young men that are in the army, the number of substitutes who own
                        little or no property, and the number of men of small means, this exemption
                        from taxation would not affect the revenue of the country to such an extent
                        as might at first be imagined, and the measures though by no means affording
                        an equivalent, would be some compensation for the sacrifices of the men in
                        the ranks of the army, and an honoroble [sic] testimonial of their country's
                        appreciation of their services. Let this be rather than repudiation, and let
                        not our heroic soldiers be made the scape goats for justifying a disgraceful
                        act inuring to the benefit of the real enemies of the Government in our own
                        midst, who, whilst they lend nothing to its aid, act in such manner as to
                        impair the confidence of others.</p>
                    <p>It is again argued that the only proper means of overcoming the financial
                        difficulties with which we are surrounded, would be found in a system of
                        taxation. Assuming as a principle that any correction of the evils attendant
                        upon the system of high prices, in the hardships which a large portion of
                        the people are made to endure and in the accumulation of an immense debt on
                        the part of the Government, must be based upon a reduction in the volume of
                        the currency, we shall be able more fully to appreciate the effects of any
                        proposed measure.</p>
                    <p>If the tax in kind should be in amount sufficient to support the armies of
                        the Confederacy and supply all the material of war--which it cannot do--it
                        is true there would be no further necessity for the issue of Treasury notes,
                        and all fluctuations in the prices of commodities would be due to other
                        causes than an increase of the circulating medium. But would this relieve us
                        from the baneful effects of the redundancy of the currency which already
                        exists?</p>
                    <p>And if we assume for an instant that in a time of war, when large portions of
                        our territory cannot e cultivated, and all of our industrial pursuits are
                        materially crippled, the current expenses of the Government could be met by
                        a tax in kind or in any form, would it not be an absurdity at the conclusion
                        of the war with our resources much enlarged, to talk about the incapacity of
                        the country to pay its war debt. But if the tax be insufficient to meet the
                        expenses of the Government does not a necessity arise for a further increase
                        of its treasury notes, tending still to inflate prices and augment the evils
                        now existing?</p>
                    <p>The same view may be taken of any kind of taxation. If the taxes paid in
                        Treasury notes should ever be entirely sufficient to meet the current
                        expenses of the Government, they would still be thrown into circulation and
                        the volume of the currency remaining the same, prices would remain unabated;
                        but if insufficient, prices would advance in proportion to the necessity for
                        new issues of these notes. In neither case will the question of the present redundancy of our currency be touched, and
                        to enable the Government to destroy any of its issues, the tax would have to
                        become extremely burdensome. </p>
                    <p>It is not to be presumed that we offer any objection to a heavy system of
                        taxation when taken in connection with other proper measures, but we only
                        design to illustrate the inefficiency of taxation alone in enabling us to
                        recover a lost position.</p>
                    <p>If a system of heavy taxation alone, could relieve the people of the high
                        prices which affect so injuriously a large portion of them it is true a
                        great benefit would accrue to the Government in putting an end to the rapid
                        accumulation of its debt, but for our people to be burdened not only with a
                        heavy tax, but also with high prices would be almost insupportable, and
                        would tend to create still greater discontent than at present exists from
                        the one cause alone. If possible, some measure should be devised therefore,
                        not only to prevent the accumulation of the Government debt, but also to
                        relieve the people from present hardships due to the inflation of prices. To
                        reduce the volume of the currency is the great
                        object to be attained, and this can be done only by laws which will make it
                        plainly to the interest of the people to invest their money in Government
                        bonds. To effect this, the means suggested by Mr. Toombs if possible ought
                        to be accomplished, of making both the interest and principal of a new issue
                        of bonds payable as they fail due in coin, to be secured by a mortgage upon
                        a specific portion of the revenue, with provision that the taxes thus
                        accruing shall be paid in specie, or the coupons of the bonds themselves,
                        and be irrepealable until the mortgages are paid, would place the bonds on
                        as good a footing perhaps as any other means that could be devised. An
                        inducement would thus be offered which would make it more to the interest of
                        the people to accept the proposed investment than any other which has
                        heretofore been proffered to them. </p>
                    <p>If superadded to this any measures could be adopted that would render the
                        Treasury notes in circulation less available for use, or which would cause
                        them to lie idle in the hands of the people if not invested in bonds,
                        without any violation of contract on the part of the Government, the two
                        influences combined might possibly accomplish the desired object. Can this
                        object be attained by any legislative enactments by which prices shall be
                        reduced to some maximum standard? On this subject we shall simply offer a
                        few suggestions for the consideration of others, fully apprehending the
                        almost ultramontape difficulties with which the scheme must be attended.</p>
                    <p>The laws of trade as developed in the fundamental principles of Economic
                        Science, which are so little understood by those who ought to be well
                        grounded in them, our most blatant politicians, and by the people who have
                        neither the time nor inclination to devote themselves to their study, are as
                        unchanging as the laws of the natural world. In the language of another,
                        "Like them they are plain and discoverable to human reason--like them,
                        proving their existence and supremacy by rewards to those who study and
                        obey, and penalties to those who violate or neglect them--like them,
                        inexorably deaf to passion or complaint--like them, mightier than
                        legislative authority, and, like the, more enduring than human theories. Now
                        the people generally do not consider these things, they are as intelligent
                        as any other on the face of the earth, they are in the aggregate as honest
                        in their intentions as the characteristic honor and probity of the Southern
                        people demands, but generally speaking they give but a coup d'etat at any of the theories proposed for the remedy of
                        any evils in either the science of Government or Political economy, and with
                        a show of plausibility sustained by the shallow sophistry of ignorant
                        demagogues they sometimes give in their adhesion to measures, whose
                        practicability is founded neither in the nature of things nor in right
                        reason. Of course it is heretical to promulgate such a doctrine, and most of
                        our politicians would not do it for the life of them, but, amici populi sed magis amica veritas, and we have
                        too much confidence in the good sense of the people not to rely upon their
                        concurrence in such sentiments.--If medicine be a science and law a science,
                        so do the established principles of Government and of political economy
                        constitute a science, far more comprehensive than either, yes in some
                        measure inclusive of both, and demanding far greater study and intellectual
                        energies to compass than either. Those who have made a life study of its
                        principles are far more diffident in expressing their first views on any of
                        the intricate problems now and then arising, than the ignorant and self
                        deluded demagogue. Yet strange to say, in this country men are born
                        politicians, and yet they are never born such good lawyers or doctors that
                        any body is willing to trust them. Even men of intelligence and good natural
                        parts will oftentimes follow bad authority rather than take the trouble to
                        examine for themselves. It must not be presumed that we mean to impugn the
                        capacity of men for self-government, in a country like the South where the
                        conservatism of slavery and a homogeneity of pursuits and interests exist,
                        but simply, to show the necessity of having able men in high political
                        stations who will not condescend to flatter the people in their errors for
                        the sake of political advancement, but who will endeavor to advance such
                        views as are founded in a just apprehension of the fundamental principles
                        existing in the constitution of things, and lying at the foundation of all
                        science. </p>
                    <p>The generic includes the particular, and legislative action should refer its
                        specific act to the fundamental principles under which they should be
                        classified. But we diverge from our immediate subject. If our Government,
                        State and Confederate, do attempt to regulate prices by any partial action
                        which does not affect all pursuits equally, it will be simply a blunder that
                        will work manifest injustice, and create more dissatisfaction amongst the
                        people than now exists. We know that the necessaries of life, food, and
                        clothing are those things which the people generally complain of being at
                        such exorbitant [sic] prices, and hence there is a strong tendency in their
                        representatives to lend their influence in fixing a maximum price upon such
                        articles of necessity alone. Now although it must be conceded that no man
                        has an absolute right, a claim "jure divino" to any species of property, not even
                        real estate, if that property be need in contravention of the public weal as
                        established by the social compact into which he has entered, and though the
                        producers of the necessaries of life have more at stake than other classes
                        of citizens, we still cannot see the justice or the policy of attempting to
                        relieve others from their troubles by plunging them into more serious
                        difficulties by measures calculated to restrain production by overburdening
                        it. It may be argued that if the necessaries of life could be brought down,
                        the prices of other things would fall correspondingly. To this we demur, the
                        effect might take place to a very limited extent in some things, but the
                        whole surplus currency in the country would be actively employed in
                        speculating in all other articles than those of fixed prices and the prices
                        justly due to the scarcity of any given article would be greatly enhanced.
                        As a principle it is bad policy to legislate for or against any class of
                        honest pursuits, but if our legislators attempt to interfere with the
                        present system of prices, it should be done by no halfway measures, but by
                        such as are at once radical, uniform and universal. No single State can
                        accomplish the desired object. The Confederate Government in combination
                        with the legislatures of the different States might possibly accomplish good
                        results. </p>
                    <p>If the State of Virginia were to establish, that which is really impossible,
                        except by approximation, a just system of relative prices for all
                        commodities produced within its limits, what would prevent those articles
                        from being carried out of the State to a higher market, either under the
                        law, or smuggled out in violation of prohibitory laws, to the depletion of
                        the State in reference to such articles, and to a consequent scarcity? If a
                        regulated and harmonious system of prices, we do not say uniform, could be
                        adopted by a concert of action between the Confederate and State
                        governments, the one with reference to contracts between its agents and the
                        people and the other with reference to contracts between its own citizens,
                        leaving each power to its legitimate sphere of action, though many
                        difficulties might surround such a course of legislation, its impropriety
                        would not be half so glaring as any partial measures adopted by an authority
                        which in its limited action is entirely incompetent to accomplish a single
                        good result.</p>
                    <p>Nor will a uniform system of prices over er [sic] the whole Confederacy
                        suffice. When did such a system ever prevail in times of profound peace? It
                        would put a stop altogether to inter-state and state trade. If it be
                        consistent with the public welfare to adopt any legislation upon the subject
                        at all, there should be a regulation of prices extending over the whole
                        Confederacy, and the laws adopted in pursuance thereof, should have
                        reference to the value of the various comodities [sic] in ordinary times,
                        not only in the various States, but even in the different localities in the
                        same State. There must be some inducement for the distribution of articles
                        of trade from one locality to another. It must be observed, too, that the
                        law of supply and demand, which in the present disorder of things cannot be measured
                        by any established criteria, are to be made to stand in abeyance to
                        legislative authority. This it is true, if possible to be accomplished,
                        would result in no hardship to any class, that in such times should be
                        considered of moment. Again, with a schedule of fixed prices, there are many
                        who would withhold, if possible, from the public market, that which was
                        before offered for sale, rather than take the lower prices fixed by law, and
                        private bargains would take place in contravention of law. If a system of
                        low prices could be fairly established by degrees, however, this evil would
                        probably correct itself, and it is plainly the desire, and certainly to the
                        interest of the whole people to return to the system of old prices, if it
                        could become general. And let it be observed that those who expect anything
                        from the voluntary action of the people, springing from motives of
                        patriotism, self denial or charity might reasonably expect the same
                        honorable motives to govern them under law, superadded to the determination
                        of all intelligent men to abide by and respect the law as the duty of every
                        free citizen. With regard to those who have no scruples about violating law,
                        they might yet stand in awe of the severest penalties, which in this matter
                        should stand forth as expressive of the determined sentiments of our
                        government and people. But would this effect the funding of the currency,
                        besides reducing the expenditure of the Government? The more men withhold
                        from market in the inauguration of the measure in its execution, the greater
                        the superfluity of treasury notes remaining idle as distributed in the hands
                        of the people. Will they hold these notes, now become useless in exchange,
                        or invest them in interest bearing bonds, payable in specie, and secured by
                        the best pledges of redemption the Government can give? We submit these
                        things for the consideration of the people. </p>

                    <p>It is urged, says the Whig, that the very men who are asking the highest

                        day of extreme depreciation of the currency, which they are striving so
                        earnestly to hasten, will find them with but a few dollars of confederate
                        money in their coffers, while the vast bulk of the circulation will be in
                        the hands of the poor and those who are in moderate circumstances.</p>
