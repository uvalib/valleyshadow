                <summary>The Spirit reprints Governor Andrew Curtain's annual address to the State
                    Legislature. In it, he gives an overview of the state finances, proposes that
                    state debts be paid in paper currency rather than in specie, and discusses
                    expenses incurred by the Confederate raid in the summer of 1863. Curtain goes on
                    to recommend several areas of action: a revision of the laws caring for orphans
                    of volunteers to make sure all are cared for equally across the state; a
                    revision of state revenue laws for the first time in twenty years; a revocation
                    of transportation monopolies granted to certain large mining companies; a survey
                    and tax on all unpatented lands; an extension of the provisions that allow
                    municipal corporations to deduct and pay into the treasury the tax on all loans
                    paid by them; and a tax on the gross receipts of all railroad and canal
                    companies. Curtain also proposes a more permanent organization of the militia,
                    and describes the establishment of the cemetery at the site of the Gettysburg
                    battle.</summary>

                <excerpt>"No we profess to be willing to abide by the Constitution, and if there is
                    anything in the Constitution obligating our Democratic Senators to vote for an
                    abolition Speaker, in case of a tie, we have no doubt they would cheerfully do
                    so, but if there is not anything of the kind; it is fair to supposes they will
                    claim to vote as they please."</excerpt>

                <summary>The editors note that Republican papers, among them the Transcript, are
                    upset that the Democrats in the State Senate will not vote for a Republican to
                    break the deadlock on the organization of the Senate. Republicans also accuse
                    the Democrats of taking advantage of the absence of Major White, a Senator
                    serving in the army who is a prisoner in Richmond. But even if White were in the
                    state, say the editors, he would not be legally elected as he holds a commission
                    as an officer in the federal army. This commission prohibits him under the State
                    Constitution from holding any state office.</summary>

                <summary>The editors give lukewarm praise to the Governor's address, but criticize
                    him severely for proposing to pay state debts with paper money. For those
                    holding the obligations of the state, particularly foreign capitalists, this
                    will devalue the worth of what is owed them by half, as this is the discount
                    they will be forced to accept to redeem the notes. It is hypocritical of the
                    governor to take this approach, particularly while it is paying specie to the
                    federal government and demanding specie for its customs payments.</summary>

                    radicals want to have it--The first is a confederate Union; the second a

                <summary>The editors argue that there are three types of Union being argued for by
                    various parties in the county. Secessionists wish to give the states all the
                    power and the federal government nothing; Abolitionists wish the reverse. Only
                    the conservatives in the middle, say the editors, have the proper balance of
                    reserving the rights to the states not expressly granted to the federal
                    government.</summary>

                        ballot by our opponents, we are still firm in the belief of the ultimate
                        triumph of Democratic principles and policy, and that their ascendency [sic]
                        is the surest means of redeeming our country from its present afflictions:
                        and to that end we earnestly invite and entreat Democrats and all
                        conservative citizens, in the several counties, wards, townships and
                        districts of the State, to unite themselves together in more perfect and
                        complete organization, as the best means to re-establish the purity of the
                        ballot, maintain personal and public liberty, and to provide for a final
                        effort, at the next election, to displace the men now in authority at
                        Washington, whose policy and measures have proved so predjudicial [sic] to
                        the cause of the Union, subversive of the rights of the citizens and

                        part, by all the means which God and nature have placed within their reach.</p>

                <summary>The 21st and 22nd Regiments of Pennsylvania Cavalry have returned to
                    Chambersburg from the Valley of Virginia to recruit members prior to going into
                    the service for three years. They are camped on the Shippensburg turnpike, about
                    a mile from town. It is understood that several companies are determined to
                    re-enlist, and the entire organization may go into the service again. Captain
                    McDowell's battery has returned from the West, where it has served under Buell,
                    Rosencrans and Grant. The editors hope that the battery will soon be full. A
                    number of officers and men from the 77th Regiment Penn. Volunteers are in the
                    area recruiting, as are members of the battery "one time commanded by the
                    lamented Captain Easton."</summary>

                <summary>John Forney, who was arrested last year for the fatal shooting of
                    Lieutenant Ford of the Provost Guard in Fulton County, was acquitted last week
                    in McConnellsburg. Forney, who had been mistakenly drafted despite his being too
                    old, had successfully appealed his draft several times, and yet Lieut. Ford was
                    dispatched to arrest him for evading the draft, whereupon Forney shot him.
                    Forney never denied shooting Ford, but argued it was in self-defense. Forney had
                    turned himself in voluntarily, and was in jail when the Confederates raided the
                    town, who then took Forney with them. He was later released, and voluntarily
                    returned to jail. Papers of both political persuasions praised Judge Nill's
                    charge to the jury.</summary>
