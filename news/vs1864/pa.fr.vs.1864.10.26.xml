                <excerpt>"The civilized world presents no similar instance of such wanton and
                    unnecessary destruction of property under similar circumstances. History
                    furnishes examples of a brave but unfortunate people, overpowered by superior
                    numbers, destroying the subsistence of the land in order to expel their
                    invaders. But we assert that history gives no instance of a victorious nation
                    devastating a country which it has subdued, except the solitary example of the
                    Czar of Russia in his treatment of the unfortunate Poles."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>About two weeks ago Gen. Grant, Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the
                        United States, issued an order to Gen. Sheridan (commanding our troops in
                        the Shenandoah Valley) that he should destroy all the subsistence of the
                        people, burn their buildings, drive off all their hands, seize their horses
                        and cattle, and make the Valley a <emph rend="italic">barren waste</emph>
                        incapable for the future of subsisting a rebel army. This order was issued
                        not as a retaliatory measure for the wicked and atrocious crime of burning
                        Chambersburg, but pretends to justify itself as a <emph rend="italic"
                            >military necessity</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Below we print Gen. Sheridan's own account of the manner in which he has
                        executed the order of his military superior:</p>
                    <p>"Woodstock, Va., Oct. 7, 1864, P.M.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Lieutenant-General U.S. Grant:</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>I have the honor to report my command at this point to-night. I commenced
                        moving back from port Republic, Mount Crawford, Bridgewater, and
                        Harrisonburg yesterday morning. The grain and forage in front of these
                        points have previously been destroyed. In moving back to this point, the
                        whole country from the Blue Ridge to the North Mountain has been made
                        untenable for a rebel army. I have destroyed over 2,000 barns filled with
                        wheat, hay, and farming implements; over 70 mills filled with flour and
                        wheat; have driven in front of the army over 400 head of stock, and have
                        killed and issued to the troops not less than 3,000 sheep. This destruction
                        embraces the Luray Valley and Little Fort Valley, as well as the main
                        valley. A large number of horses have been obtained, a proper estimate of
                        which I cannot make. Lieutenant John R. Meigs, my engineer, was murdered
                        beyond Harrisonburg, near Dayton. For this atrocity all the houses within an
                        area of five miles were burned. Since I came into the valley from Harper's
                        Ferry up to Harrisonburg, every train, every small party, and every
                        straggler has been whacked by the people, many of whom have protection
                        papers from commanders who have been hitherto in the valley. The people here
                        are getting sick of the war. Heretofore they have had no reason to complain,
                        because they have been living in great abundance. I have not been followed
                        by the enemy up to this point, with the exception of a small force of rebel
                        cavalry, that showed themselves some distance behind my rear guard to-day. A
                        party of 100 of the 8th Ohio cavalry, which I had stationed at the bridge
                        over the mouth of the Shenandoah, near Mount Jackson was attacked by McNeil
                        with 17 men while they were asleep, and the whole party dispersed or
                        captured. I think that they will turn up. I learn that 50 of them had
                        reached Winchester. McNeil was mortally wounded and fell into our hands.
                        This was fortunate, as he was the most daring and dangerous of all the bush
                        whackers in this section of the country.</p>
                    <p>P. H. Sheridan, Major-General."</p>
                    <p>If the above official report were not signed by Gen. Sheridan, and addressed
                        in proper form to Gen. Grant, we would be inclined to disbelieve the whole
                        story. That an order so desperately wicked, so contrary to the spirit of
                        Christianity, and so revolting to the civilization of this age, should have
                        been issued and executed by officers commanding the armies of a free,
                        civilized and religious nation, is, indeed, almost too incredible for human
                        belief. But all doubt upon this matter is silenced and put to rest by the
                        open avowal of the administration at Washington that this cruel order of
                        Gen. Grant has its hearty approbation and is justifiable as a <emph
                            rend="italic">military necessity</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The Christian sentiment, not only of our own people but of the whole
                        civilized world, will require the authors of this severe and unparalelled
                        measure, to make out a clear case of necessity, before they can hope to
                        escape the reprobation which such atrocity generally so richly deserves. No
                        ordinary circumstances will justify a civilized people in resorting to a
                        wholesale and indiscriminate destruction of private property. No common
                        exigency will excuse a barbarous war upon non-combatants. Nothing but the
                        most pressing necessity, will warrant a military commander in depopulating
                        whole sections of country, wasting and burning up the property of the
                        people, and making a rich, populous and fertile valley a howling wilderness,
                        incapable of supporting any living thing. But these are the very things
                        which Gen. Sheridan boasts to have done in his official report quoted above.</p>
                    <p>Is there anything in the present condition of the war to imperatively demand,
                        at this late day, a resort to such measures as will undoubtedly receive the
                        condemnation, sooner or later, of every right thinking and conscientious
                        man? If the Republican papers and speakers are to be believed, our cause was
                        never more prosperous, and our success never more certain than now. We are
                        told daily by them that the rebellion is in the throes of dissolution; that
                        the rebels have robbed the cradle and the grave to fill up their depleted
                        armies; that Sheridan has totally destroyed Early's army in the Valley of
                        the Shenandoah; and that Grant has his hand so firmly fixed upon the throat
                        of Lee and his army at Petersburg and Richmond, that his grip cannot be
                        shaken off. We are promised by them that the war will be over before this
                        year shall end. Now if these things, or even the one half of them, be true,
                        why the necessity for this spoliation and destruction of the subsistance
                        [sic] of a whole people? Why resort to arson, rapine and vandalism after the
                        crisis of our fate has been safely passed and all danger is pronounced to be
                        over?</p>
                    <p>If we have the truth from the administration at Washington about the present
                        prosperous state of our affairs, is there a single man in this community who
                        will dare to say that he justifies the atrocious order of Gen. Grant, and
                        its merciless execution by his subordinate officers? If so, we would like
                        him to step forward before the tribunal of the people, so that they may see
                        what manner of man he is.</p>
                    <p>It must be remembered that this was not justified as a retaliatory act for
                        the burning of Chambersburg, but it was placed solely upon the ground of
                        military necessity. Retaliation whould [sic] have been simply revenge, and
                        the present prospects of our cause would have had no effect in determining
                        its propriety. But when it is excused as a military necessity, and the same
                        men who make this plea also tell us that the war is just about over, we have
                        a strange inconsistency which it is difficult to explain. If the rebellion
                        is as nearly crushed as the Republicans pretend then there was no necessity
                        which would justify such a wanton destruction of property. <emph
                            rend="italic">Two thousand barns, seventy mills, filled with
                        wheat</emph>, are burned; all the dwelling houses within an area of five
                        miles are consumed; all the cattle are driven off; and the women and
                        children left to starve, just at the commencement of winter, by the
                        officials of a government which boasts that its arms have been everywhere
                        successful and its armies everywhere victorious.</p>
                    <p>The civilized world presents no similar instance of such wanton and
                        unnecessary destruction of property under similar circumstances. History
                        furnishes examples of a brave but unfortunate people, overpowered by
                        superior numbers, destroying the subsistence of the land in order to expel
                        their invaders. But we assert that history gives no instance of a victorious
                        nation devastating a country which it has subdued, except the solitary
                        example of the Czar of Russia in his treatment of the unfortunate Poles.</p>
                    <p>Who are these people that have been thus ruined by our Government? Many of
                        them are northern men who have settled in the Shenandoah Valley. Not a few
                        of them are non-residents, members of the Menonist Church, and kindred
                        religious societies, who have gone there from the German settlements of
                        Pennsylvania. But there is no distinction made among the citizens of the
                        Valley; all are doomed to the same common ruin; all are marked out as
                        victims, to gratify the savage ferocity which now characterizes the conduct
                        of this war. But this war was commenced to restore the Union. It was to be a
                        war, whose object should be to bring back the citizens of the seceded States
                        to their allegiance to the Government. Mr. Lincoln declared that he intended
                        to prosecute the war for this purpose and no other. Does any man of sane
                        mind think that the Southern people can be conciliated and brought back into
                        the Union, by such acts of cold blooded barbarity as Gen. Sheridan relates
                        in his official report? Will men who have been ruined and their property
                        wholly destroyed love the Government that inflicts the wrong? Is this what
                        experience teaches us? Do our citizens love the vandals and cut-throats who
                        burnt Chambersburg? Not a bit better than the citizens of the Shenandoah
                        Valley will love the men and the Government that made their homes a waste
                        place and a desolation.</p>
                    <p>But as citizens of Franklin County we have a deeper interest in the war
                        policy of this administration, than other portions of the country removed
                        from the scene of hostilities. To us it is a vital question, that private
                        property shall be protected by both armies. It may do very well for the men
                        of the New England states to advocate a war of extermination. They are
                        perfectly safe. But we are in constant danger. Three successive summers have
                        witnessed the invasion of our county by the rebel hordes. What assurance
                        have we that next summer they will not return again? We are told with great
                        positiveness that they will never get back again. But we have been often
                        told the same thing before, and yet they have come. Why what is to prevent
                        their coming? When the Potomac is low they can come just when they wish to
                        do so. If our experience has taught us anything, it surely has taught us
                        this. The rebel Gen. Stuwart ran around an army of one hundred and fifty
                        thousand men in the fall of 1862. Why, only a few nights ago, Moseby with
                        his band of guerrillas stopped two trains on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                        and robbed the passengers; and after he had accomplished that bold feat, he
                        crossed over into Maryland and plundered and destroyed there.</p>
                    <p>Citizens of Franklin County supposing the rebels come back again, do you
                        flatter yourselves they will not take revenge for the atrocities practiced
                        in the Shenandoah Valley? Yes, verily they will do it, and awful will be
                        their visitation. What will your barns and houses be worth then? Will you
                        ask them to spare you? They will tell you to remember the Valley of the
                        Shenandoah. The hour is ours now. But the opportunity will be theirs then.</p>
                    <p>Oh, ye men that gloat with joy over these deeds of cruelty, take care that a
                        swift retribution does not overtake you. We write this with sorrow. We urge
                        these considerations in a spirit of kindness to those who differ with us.
                        But we ask them, can we living along the border afford to support the war
                        policy of our administration, that puts in jeopardy not only our property
                        but our lives also? If no higher motive will move us, ought not selfishness
                        at least make us cry out against this dangerous precedent, which can be so
                        easily used to our utter ruin, when the changing fortunes of war shall have
                        brought the rebels back again upon us? Is there a single man in our
                        community who does not regret what has been done by Sheridan? Is there a
                        single individual who will stand up and say that this is right? If there be
                        such, we do not expect to change his views by anything we can write, because
                        he would not be convinced though one rose from the dead. But to the calm,
                        dispassionate man we appeal, and ask him to reflect over this matter. Is
                        this the way you desire to see this war conducted? If it is not, we beg of
                        you to read and study Gen. McClellan's method. Consider carefully his views
                        upon this subject. They are to be found in the following sentences of a
                        letter written by him to President Lincoln, from Harrison's Landing, on the
                        7th day of July, A.D., 1862:</p>
                    <p>"This rebellion has assumed the character of war; as such it should be
                        regarded, and it should be conducted upon the highest principles known to
                        Christian civilization. It should not be a war looking to the subjugation of
                        the people of any State in any event. It should not be at all a war upon
                        populations, but against armed forces and political organizations. Neither
                        confiscation of property, political executions of person, territorial
                        organizations of States, or forcible abolition of slavery should be
                        contemplated for a moment. In prosecuting the war, all private property
                        taken for military use should be paid or receipted for; pillage and waste
                        should be treated as high crimes; all unnecessary trespass sternly
                        prohibited, and offensive demeanor by the military towards citizens promptly
                        rebuked."</p>
                    <p>Such is the difference between the view of Gen. McClellan and the practices
                        of Mr. Lincoln in the conduct of the war. Citizens of Franklin County,
                        decide for yourselves which course of policy is best and safest for you. If
                        you prefer that private property should be destroyed, that this war should
                        be waged against women and children, that your barns and houses shall be
                        placed in peril, and that you yourselves shall be in jeopardy every hour,
                        vote for Mr. Lincoln. But if you believe that in the prosecution of this
                        war, all private property and unarmed persons should be strictly protected,
                        vote for McClellan. The question is a simple one and easily decided. The
                        issue is in your hands, and upon you will rest the awful responsibility for
                        its proper decision. We have given our warning; it is your right to
                        disregard it if you think proper.</p>
