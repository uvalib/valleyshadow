<b>Our Washington Letter</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A correspondent to the Spirit and Times writes of an anecdote regarding a
                    Treasury Department official whose responsibility it was to burn old demand
                    notes. In fact, he had been discovered hoarding the notes for his own use. The
                    writer uses this as an illustration of the general corruption of the
                    administration, claiming "that there has never been an administration in
                    Washington under which fraud was carried on as openly and boldly as now." He
                    goes on to add that the exchange of prisoners with the Confederates has broken
                    down because of the dispute over the status of black soldiers. An order was also
                    issued prohibiting the recruitment of black soldiers in Washington by agents
                    from the Northern states.<br>

<b>Mr. Niccolls on the War</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors attempt to refute, point by point, a sermon given by Rev.
                    Samuel J. Niccolls, "the zealous and eloquent pastor" of the Chambersburg
                    Presbyterian Church, which was published in the Repository on December 23.
                    First, they argue, the law has not retained its supremacy in the country, as
                    evidenced by the suspension of habeas corpus. Second, the country is not in a
                    state of prosperity, as Niccolls would like to claim. Third, Niccolls' assertion
                    that slavery is a crime contradicts both the intention of the framers of the
                    Constitution and Biblical law. The editors argue that slavery for blacks is set
                    out in the Bible. If Niccolls chooses to preach against it, he is no longer
                    preaching the Gospel.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. Samuel J. Niccolls)</blockquote>

                    at once to town, but it was difficult to get the fire engines across the
                    Conococheague. The building was almost entirely consumed by the time the engines
                    arrived. It is understood that most of the valuable machinery had been removed

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are indications that the rebel General Early comtemplates [sic] a
                        movement up the Valley of Virginia, and perhaps on this side of the Potomac.
                        He has been hovering, with a considerable force, about Strasburg: and the
                        last advices [sic] from Winchester state that our pickets have been driven
                        in. We have come to believe that speculation upon army movements amounts to
                        very little, and have concluded patiently to wait the upshot of events; we
                        advise our readers to "Keep their powder dry" and follow the same

                    The editors ask, "Is there any valid reason why Chambersburg should not be the
