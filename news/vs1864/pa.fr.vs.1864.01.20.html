<b>Governor's Message</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit reprints Governor Andrew Curtain's annual address to the State
                    Legislature. In it, he gives an overview of the state finances, proposes that
                    state debts be paid in paper currency rather than in specie, and discusses
                    expenses incurred by the Confederate raid in the summer of 1863. Curtain goes on
                    to recommend several areas of action: a revision of the laws caring for orphans
                    of volunteers to make sure all are cared for equally across the state; a
                    revision of state revenue laws for the first time in twenty years; a revocation
                    of transportation monopolies granted to certain large mining companies; a survey
                    and tax on all unpatented lands; an extension of the provisions that allow
                    municipal corporations to deduct and pay into the treasury the tax on all loans
                    paid by them; and a tax on the gross receipts of all railroad and canal
                    companies. Curtain also proposes a more permanent organization of the militia,
                    and describes the establishment of the cemetery at the site of the Gettysburg
                    battle.<br>

<b>The "Dead-Lock" in the Senate</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that Republican papers, among them the Transcript, are
                    upset that the Democrats in the State Senate will not vote for a Republican to
                    break the deadlock on the organization of the Senate. Republicans also accuse
                    the Democrats of taking advantage of the absence of Major White, a Senator
                    serving in the army who is a prisoner in Richmond. But even if White were in the
                    state, say the editors, he would not be legally elected as he holds a commission
                    as an officer in the federal army. This commission prohibits him under the State
                    Constitution from holding any state office.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Governor's Message</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors give lukewarm praise to the Governor's address, but criticize
                    him severely for proposing to pay state debts with paper money. For those
                    holding the obligations of the state, particularly foreign capitalists, this
                    will devalue the worth of what is owed them by half, as this is the discount
                    they will be forced to accept to redeem the notes. It is hypocritical of the
                    governor to take this approach, particularly while it is paying specie to the
                    federal government and demanding specie for its customs payments.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors argue that there are three types of Union being argued for by
                    various parties in the county. Secessionists wish to give the states all the
                    power and the federal government nothing; Abolitionists wish the reverse. Only
                    the conservatives in the middle, say the editors, have the proper balance of
                    reserving the rights to the states not expressly granted to the federal
                    government.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The new assemblyman for the district, Mr. Sharpe, has been appointed to
                    four of the "most important" committees in the House of Representatives--the
                    Judiciary General, the Judicial Local, Federal Relations, and Estates and
                    Escheats. This is an honor for a new member, particularly one of the opposite
                    party of the Speaker, and it speaks well of his reputation.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr.  Sharpe)</blockquote>
<b>Democratic State Convention</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Democratic State Central Committee met in Philadelphia last Wednesday
                    and set the date for the Democratic State Convention, to be held in that city on
                    March 24.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Democratic Platform</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Democratic State Central Committee passed a number of resolutions
                    concerning the recent elections, Lincoln's recent proclamations on abolition,
                    and the procedure for seceded states to return to the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting of the Democratic State Central Committee, held in the city of
                        Philadelphia, on Wednesday last, the following resolutions were unanimously
                        adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That notwithstanding the apparent result
                        of the late election in this State the consequence, as we believe, of an
                        unfair use of the military power and the practice of gross frauds on the
                        ballot by our opponents, we are still firm in the belief of the ultimate
                        triumph of Democratic principles and policy, and that their ascendency [sic]
                        is the surest means of redeeming our country from its present afflictions:
                        and to that end we earnestly invite and entreat Democrats and all
                        conservative citizens, in the several counties, wards, townships and
                        districts of the State, to unite themselves together in more perfect and
                        complete organization, as the best means to re-establish the purity of the
                        ballot, maintain personal and public liberty, and to provide for a final
                        effort, at the next election, to displace the men now in authority at
                        Washington, whose policy and measures have proved so predjudicial [sic] to
                        the cause of the Union, subversive of the rights of the citizens and
                        oppressive to the people.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we deplore the enunciation of the
                        schemes and purposes embodied in the late Proclamation of the President,
                        appended to his Message, the inevitable effect of which must be to prolong
                        and extend the bloody strife now raging among the people of the United
                        States, and to furnish an additional verification of the worst apprehensions
                        entertained as to the purpose of his administration, to wit: the intention
                        to subordinate the cause of the Union to the cause of Abolition.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That no State can withdraw from the
                        Union by its own action; and that the assumption of Mr. Lincoln, as
                        indicated in his late message and proclamation, that the revolted States,
                        and that they can be reconstructed as States and re-admitted into the Union
                        by a mere fractional vote of one tenth of their people cast within the
                        limits of each, is a proposition at once revolutionary and preposterous,
                        manifesting an astounding inclination on his part to act in utter disregard
                        of the Constitution and the elementary principles of our republican form of
                        government, and at the same time foreshadowing a scheme through which
                        stupendous frauds may be practiced upon the upon the [sic] ballot at the
                        next election, and a still more stupendous fraud upon sovereign States that
                        have furnished without limit of their blood and treasure to put down rebels
                        and rebellious States, by admitting into the Electoral College men who would
                        have no legal or constitutional right to seats in that body; the
                        consummation of which scheme would be so gross an outrage upon the rights of
                        the people and the States, as might fully warrant resistence [sic] on their
                        part, by all the means which God and nature have placed within their reach.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That it is our deliberate judgment, that
                        the enunciation of a wise and judicious political policy, at this time, on
                        the part of the Administration at Washington, to the effect that, any State
                        heretofore in revolt, within which resistance to the authority of the
                        Government shall cease should be allowed, through the vote of a majority of
                        its electors, to resume its former status and functions in the Union among
                        the States, and saving the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens now in
                        the field.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the Democratic party will continue
                        their efforts to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and to
                        re-establish its supremacy both at the North and at the South; so that
                        neither the revolutionary schemes of the Abolitionists nor the Secessionists
                        shall avail against it.</p>
                    <p>The resolutions were unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>On motion of the Hon. George Sanderson, of Lancaster Co., it was unanimously</p>
                    <p>Resolved,That the thanks of this Committee be
                        tendered to the Hon. Charles J. Biddle for the able and efficient manner in
                        which he has discharged the duties of Chairman of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>The Committe [sic] then adjourned;</p>
                    <p>Charles J. Biddle, Chairman.</p>

                    old, had successfully appealed his draft several times, and yet Lieut. Ford was
                    dispatched to arrest him for evading the draft, whereupon Forney shot him.
                    Forney never denied shooting Ford, but argued it was in self-defense. Forney had
                    turned himself in voluntarily, and was in jail when the Confederates raided the
                    town, who then took Forney with them. He was later released, and voluntarily
