    <head>The Presidential Struggle</head>
    <origin/>
    <commentary/>
    <excerpt>"They [the Republican Party] have been in power but three short years, yet, in that
     time, they have almost hopelessly ruined the country. They have drenched the land in fraternal
     blood and brought sorrow and mourning into almost every family. They have bankrupted the
     Treasury and piled up a debt mountain high which future generations yet unborn will never see
     paid."</excerpt>
    <transcript>
     <p>The last issue of the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> contained a rather lengthy
      editorial under the above caption, the pith of which was, that the Democracy ought not to
      contest the election this year with the Republicans, for the reason that it might result in
      such a division of the electoral college as to prevent a choice by the people, thus throwing
      the election into the House, where neither candidate could receive a majority of the States,
      as required by the Constitution, and hence "the Government would be brought into inextricable
      chaos!" This is certainly a <emph rend="italic">modest</emph> suggestion, to say the least of
      it, and shows a commendable solicitude on the part of the astute editor for the welfare of the
      "Government."</p>
     <p>It would, doubtless, be very agreeable to the cormorants and public plunderers, who have
      been fattening on the life-blood of the nation, to have a clear field to a new lease of four
      years of power and plunder; but we scarcely think the Democracy will be able to see it in that
      light. We are rather inclined to the opinion that they will contest every inch of ground in
      making another noble and patriotic effort to rescue the country from the hands of fanatics and
      traitors who have well nigh ruined it, and bring the Government back to the principles of our
      fathers. They may fail--they may be overpowered by the minions of an arbitrary and corrupt
      administration, which, judging from the past, will, undoubtedly, use its immense power and
      patronage to overthrow the freedom of the ballot and subvert the liberties of the people--but
      they will make the effort, nevertheless; and, if fall they must, they will go down with their
      armor on. Indeed, even admitting that all the grave consequences spoken of by the <emph
       rend="italic">Repository</emph> would follow a presidential contest making the withdrawal of
      one of the parties necessary to avert them, we can see no good reason why that party should be
      the Democracy. On the other hand, we might be able to show very good reasons why the
      Republican party should withdraw on that ground. They have been in power but three short
      years, yet, in that time, they have almost hopelessly ruined the country. They have drenched
      the land in fraternal blood and brought sorrow and mourning into almost every family. They
      have bankrupted the Treasury and piled up a debt mountain high which future generations yet
      unborn will never see paid. And it is the opinion of many, that the sooner they resign the
      Government into abler and wiser hands, the better will it be for the country. Therefore, as
      the editor of the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> seems to apprehend such serious
      consequences from a division of the electoral vote, and as the Democracy will <emph
       rend="italic">not</emph> withdraw, we suggest that the Republican party withdraw, and that
       <emph rend="italic">he</emph> use his influence, as a leader of his party, to that end. Here
      is an opportunity for the display of an unselfish patriotism which seldom offers. We trust our
      neighbor will properly improve it, thereby "showing his faith by his works."</p>

    <excerpt>"This regiment went into the service about one thousand strong, participated in some of
     the most important and warmly contested battles of the war, and returned with only two hundred
     and twenty five men."</excerpt>
    <transcript>
     <p>The One Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania regiment, Colonel McCoy commanding, arrived at
      Harrisburg on Sunday, the 3d inst. having been furloughed for the purpose of recruiting. This
      regiment went into the service about one thousand strong, participated in some of the most
      important and warmly contested battles of the war, and returned with only two hundred and
      twenty five men. No regiment has seen harder service or acquitted itself more creditably.
      Several companies of this regiment were recruited in this place by captains A.J. Brand and
      John T. Dick. The regiment was originally commanded by Col. Zeigle with R.W. McAllen as Lieut.
      Colonel. We hope the brave boys may enjoy their furloughs. All the men speak in the highest
      terms of Colonel McCoy, and with such a chivalrous and popular leader, there will be no
      difficulty in soon recruiting the regiment up to the required standard.</p>

     <p>We cannot refrain from giving expression to a feeling of gratitude to the Council of our
      goodly borough for the attention they have <emph rend="italic">latterly</emph> given to their
      duties. On behalf of the citizens, and on our own behalf, we return them sincere thanks for
      having, in some measure, rendered the streets passable in having had the accumulated mud and
      filth, of a year, removed. We cannot imagine what has awakened them from their lethargic
      slumbers unless it be the approaching Borough Election, on the first Monday of next month; and
      a desire on their part to serve another term in an office which they severally are so well
      qualified to fill. We hope they may all be candidates for re-election, pledging ourself "to
      use all honorable means" to secure their success.</p>
