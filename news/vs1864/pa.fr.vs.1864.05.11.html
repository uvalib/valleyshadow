<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the greatest battles of the war was fought on last Thursday and
                        Friday, beyond the Rapidan in Virginia, between the armies of General Grant
                        and Gen. Lee. We give the details elsewhere in to-day's paper as far as they
                        have been received up to the time of going to press. According to the
                        accounts the attack was commenced on Thursday by General Lee, with a view of
                        piercing the centre of Grant's lines, but the Army of the Potomac bravely
                        maintained its position against the furious assaults of the rebel columns
                        that were hurled against it. The fight was resumed on Friday and raged with
                        unparalleled fury all day. The enemy was repulsed at all points and forced
                        to retire from the field. The losses on both sides are supposed to be heavy.
                        This battle, though a great success for our army, is not, at this writing,
                        considered decisive. More hard fighting will doubtless yet have to be done
                        before Richmond is taken or lee's army driven out of Virginia. The latest
                        news indicates that Lee is falling back on the intrenchments at Richmond,
                        and is being rapidly pursued by Grant. Gen. Hancock is said to have passed
                        through Spottsylvania Court House, on Monday morning, and at noon had his
                        headquarters 20 miles south of the battle field.</p>
                    <p>The news from other fields of operations looks equally hopeful. Butler is
                        reported to be in the vicinity of Richmond, and may render valuable service
                        in the final assault on the doomed city. The reports from the Southwest are
                        meagre, but enough is known to indicate that Sherman is moving. Banks is
                        reported safe, and may shortly again resume the offensive. It is literally
                        thundering all around the sky, and everything once more points to the
                        downfall of the rebellion. Heaven speed the consum[m]ation.</p>
