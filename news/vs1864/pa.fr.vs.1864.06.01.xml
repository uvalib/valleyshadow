                <excerpt>"A presidential campaign is fast approaching, and in order to secure a
                    'loyal' Abolition triumph it has become necessary to intimidate Democratic
                    editors with arrest, imprisonment and the suppression of their papers, so that
                    in the coming contest they may 'speak with bated breath.' Does any sane man
                    believe that this attempted intimidation will succeed?"</excerpt>

                    under the President's name.</summary>

                <summary>Summarizes cases disposed of recently by the Court of Common Pleas. Polly
                    Piper vs. James and Catharine Dyarman: Piper won and received $300 for half of
                    the farm she owned in common with the defendants. Reilly and Sharpe found for
                    the plaintiff, Kimmell, Eyster and Orr for the defendants.; Adam Aughinbaugh vs.
                    Samuel Brandhaver and Michael Reed, executors of George Brandhaver, deceased.
                    Aughinbaugh won and received $25 in damages after the defendants failed to
                    comply on a lease of a farm to the plaintiff. Clarke and Sharpe found for the
                    plaintiff, Kennedy, Nill, and Kimmell for the defendants.; John Beaver's
                    administrators vs. the London Saving Fund Society. In this case regarding a
                    $4,500 debt, the jury was discharged and the case was "held over for
                    consideration of the court."; J. B. Madden and Rush Van Dyke Madden, by their
                    guardian, P. Kunkleman vs. Rev. K. Thomas and Thomas L. Gillespie. The
                    plaintiffs won and received 6 cents damages and 6 cents costs in this "action of
                    ejectment" for a house and lot in Loudon. Kennedy, Nill, and Kimmell found for
                    the plaintiffs, Stenger, Sharpe, and Brewer for the defendants. Quincy School
                    District vs. Antrim School District: in this action to recover the tuition of
                    students who live in the Antrim Township and attend schools in Quincy, Brewer
                    found for the plaintiff, and Rowe and Kimmell for the defendant.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The 21st Pennsylvania cavalry, Col. Wm. H. Boyd, recently encamped near this
                        place--several companies of which belong to this county--are now near
                        Washington city. We learn that an order has been received requiring the
                        regiment to turn over all their horses, arms and equipment and report to
                        General Casey for duty as <emph rend="italic">Infantry</emph>. This order
                        has caused much dissatisfaction amongst the officers and men, and to say the
                        least of it, is certainly taking a <emph rend="italic">slight</emph>
                        advantage of them. They entered the service as cavalry, bargaining to serve
                        as such, and never imagined a change to a different arm. There can be but
                        one excuse for the government coming the "false pretense" game over these
                        men; the exigencies of the service may require the change, and if so, the
                        men should cheerfully acquiesce hard as it may seem, to be thus
                        disappointed.</p>
                    <p>The regiment is over twelve hundred strong, the company of Capt. Hullinger
                        numbering one hundred men, being at present on detached duty at
                    Scranton.</p>

                        language:</p>
                    <p>He must have been aided by persons in this place, and taken off on horseback
                        or in a buggy. Can any of our copperheads guess as to how he escaped?</p>
                    <p>We are well aware that knaves and fools make up a large portion of the
                        abolition party but are at a loss to decide to which of these classes the
                        writer of the above belongs. A knave, we think, would have more discretion
                        than to write such nonsense and we therefore incline to the opinion that the
                        author is simply a fool, and a very great one at that. He must consequently
                        be acquitted of any knavish design in the matter. We advise the editor of
                        the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> to take the man to a Phrenologist
                        and have his head examined. There is something <emph rend="italic"
                        >wrong</emph> in it sure!</p>
