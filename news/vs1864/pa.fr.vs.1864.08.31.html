                    at $783,950 for a total of 537 buildings burned. Of the 537 total, 266 were
                    residences and places of business, 98 were barns and stables, and 173 were
                    out-buildings of various kinds. No calculation of personal property lost is

                    <p>Preliminary Remarks.</p>
                    <p>It is not our purpose at this late day to go into any minute details of the
                        circumstances connected with the destruction of our once beautiful and happy
                        town. So thick and fast do extraordinary events transpire in these disturbed
                        and troublesome times that the Burning of Chambersburg is already an old
                        story--save to those who passed through the ordeal of that dreadful day.
                        From their minds its horrors can never be effaced. There are, however, some
                        circumstances connected with this unparalleled act of vandalism that we deem
                        most important to notice in order to correct injurious impressions abroad in
                        regard to the position of our citizens in the affair, and also to show up
                        the military "situation" at the Headquarters of the Department of the
                        Susquehanna at the date of the occurrence.</p>
                    <p>Where The Blame Belongs.</p>
                    <p>It was well known over the country, and we presume the authorities at
                        Washington were aware of the fact, if they can be presumed to know anything,
                        that Chambersburg was the "Headquarters of the Military Department of the
                        Susquehanna," with a Major General and his staff quartered there to watch
                        over its operations. If it was worth establishing and dignifying with the
                        title of a "Military Department" it was worth defending, but that obvious
                        sequen[c]e seems never to have entered the military combinations of the
                        brainless blunderers at Washington. To the stupidity of the War Department
                        must we lay the destruction of Chambersburg. There is no use mincing terms
                        about it. Let the blame be placed fairly and squarely where it belongs. The
                        earnest appeals made time and again, by Gen. Couch, to the "powers that be"
                        at Washington, to obtain and organize troops for the protection of
                        Chambersburg against rebel raids cannot at this time be told. Gen. Couch is
                        too correct a military man to publish them himself, even in his own defence,
                        and the War Department Dare Not Do It. We know they were made and we know
                        too that they were denied. The most ill-natured caviler at Gen. Couch will
                        hardly urge that he should have crested men and armed and equip[p]ed them at
                        his own expense, nor would they expect him individually to attack and drive
                        back the whole rebel force. The War Department seems to have counted on
                        something of this sort but the people have better sense. This being a
                        Military Department, in name at least, the people
                        had no right, suppose the men and arms on hand, which they were not, to
                        undertake the control of its affairs by organizing troops even for their own
                        protection. He would have been a bold man, indeed, to have snubbed the
                        despots at Washington by establishing an independent Military organization
                        in one of their pet Departments! In that case the usurper of military
                        authority, and all citizens associated with him, would have been promptly
                        arrested if it took a whole corps from the Army of the Potomac to effect it.
                        Under such a "military necessity," like the riots in New York, they could,
                        no doubt, have been conveniently spared, but not a man for the protection of
                        Chambersburg!</p>
                    <p>The Editor of the Repository with a degree of
                        candor and fairness, unusual in Republican journals in these times, when
                        everything is made to bend to cover up the blunderings of this
                        Administration, holds the authorities at Washington responsible for the
                        Burning of Chambersburg, and clearly exonerates Gen. Couch from all the
                        blame. The following is taken from the Repository:</p>
                    <p>"Gen. Couch had no troops--not even an organized
                            battalion on the border. He had organized six or seven regiments
                        of one hundred-day men; but as fast as they were officered and armed they
                        were forwarded to Washington, in obedience to orders from the authorities.
                        He was left, there fore, with no force whatever to defend the border, and
                        thus enable them to organize for their own defence without exposing
                        themselves to certain butchery in case of capture, and the border was thus
                        entirely defenceless."</p>
                    <p>In another part of the same article in the Repository we find the charge against the Washington authorities
                        still more strongly stated, it adds:</p>
                    <p>"It seems inexplicable to persons and journals at a distance that Gen. Couch,
                        a Major General commanding a Department, with his borders repeatedly
                        invaded, should have [illegible] troops. The natural inclination is to blame
                        the commander, for it is reasonable to suppose that he would endeavor to
                        have an adequate command, and also that ample authority would be given him
                        to have sufficient force. Just where the blame belongs, we do not choose now
                        to discuss; but we do know that it was no fault of Gen Couch that he was
                        unable to defend Chambersburg. He organized a Provost Guard Regiment some
                        1200 strong, expressly for duty in his department--the men were enlisted
                        under a positive assurance, based on the order authorizing the organization,
                        that they were to be kept on duty in the Department--they were ordered to
                        Gen. Grant after the battle of the Wilderness. He organized six regiments of
                        one hundred day's men before the advent of McCausland, and they were ordered
                        to Washington as soon as they were ready to move. We are assured that Gov.
                        [illegible]urtin, fully two weeks before the burning of Chambersburg,
                        formally pledged the State to make provision for arming, organizing, and
                        paying for home defence, if the general government would simply give the
                        uniforms; and we believe that Gen. Couch pressed it upon the Washington
                        authorities [to] uniform the entire force of the southern counties--assuring
                        from that the people were willing to defend themselves if encouraged by
                        granting them uniforms, so as to save themselves from inhuman butchery, but
                        it was denied. We do not speak advisedly as to Gen. Couch's correspondence
                        with the Washington authorities--we give no statements at his instance or
                        based upon information received from him or his officers; but we do write
                        whereof we know, when we say that every effort was made to carry these
                        meausres [sic] into effect, and that they were not sanctioned at Washington.
                        We do not assume to fix the responsibility of the terrible disaster, we do
                        mean that it shall not fall upon a commander who was shorn of his strength
                        and left helpless with his people."</p>
                    <p>It will some day be made the subject of investigation, when the country is
                        placed under better auspices, why the Shenandoah and Cumberland Valleys have
                        been left as raging grounds to the rebels? Why despots and rebel supplies
                        have been established at Winchester, Martinsburg, Harper's Ferry, Hagerstown
                        and Chambersburg, to be gobbled up whenever they choose to come and take
                        them? Why immense wagon trains have been sent into these valley without
                        adequate force to protect them as if expressly intended to fall into the
                        hands of the rebels? Why our towns are left unprotected that they may be
                        ransomed to enrich the rebel commissariat? Why our citizens are suffered to
                        be carried off as prisoners--their property as plunder--and their homes
                        burnt under their heads to benefit the rebels? These things may not be done
                        designedly, but [illegible] them as we may there is a culpable intelligence
                        about them that amounts to one and the same thing. If such management,
                        rather mismanagement of our military affairs, is
                        not affording "aid and comfort to the enemy" then we know not in what
                        direction to look for treason! "The border shall be protected" has been the
                        promise since the war commenced. How it has [illegible] fulfilled burnt
                        towns and a plundered, homeless people can answer. Let us, however, suffer
                        on patiently, and though our wrongs may be greater than we can bear, it must
                        not drive us from our loyalty to our Government; it will not always be in
                        bad hands; be of good heart, redress will surely come.</p>
                    <p>Force of the Enemy.</p>
                    <p>The rebel force detailed by Gen. Early for the destruction of Chambersburg,
                        under written orders from that General to do the work effectually, numbered
                        about 3000 mounted men, accompanied by six pieces of artillery. They reached
                        the heights beyond the town, on the western turnpike, about 4 o'clock on
                        Saturday morning, July 30th. It was their intention to enter the town and
                        burn it in the night, while the people were in their beds, but they were
                        frustrated in their amiable intentions by a couple of cannon planted on the
                        hills, in the line of their approach, and which, on their own admission,
                        created some consternation in their ranks. A well aimed shot from one of
                        these guns made their numbers count one less in killed and five in wounded.
                        On carefully reconnoitering their force it was found too large to be opposed
                        by the mere handful of troops here, which did not number one hundred all
                        told. They were prudently withdrawn just in time to save their cannon and
                        themselves from capture. The rebels then immediately advanced on the town
                        and commenced shelling without any notice to the people, or without any
                        warning to the women and children to leave. Finding themselves unopposed
                        their skirmishers advanced along every road, through every alley, and across
                        fields and gardens on the western side of the town, and soon had possession
                        of the place. It has been stated by lying correspondents of city papers, and
                        grave legislators reiterated the story to our discredit, that but 200 rebels
                        comprised the whole force that attacked and destroyed the town. This story
                        in addition to being a downright falsehood is a most unjust reflection on
                        the courage of our citizens and the few military stationed here. The force
                        that entered the town on West Market street, by actual account, numbered
                        831, while 300 additional came In [sic] on the Wolffstown road. We have the
                        authority of one of our most highly respectable citizens for this statement
                        as to their numbers. This gentleman made the count himself and will make an
                        affidavit to the fact if required. It is clearly established, beyond any
                        question or doubt that the force detailed by Early for the express purpose
                        of burning Chambersburg amounted to over 3000 men, of his best troops, with
                        six cannon; and that the number sent into the town to destroy the place
                        numbered 1131, selected on account of their peculiar fitness for murder,
                        arson and robbery; while the balance were posted, with the artillery, on the
                        hills overlooking the town ready to advance should resistance be offered.
                        This statement we should deem sufficient to put to rest the slanders so
                        industriously circulated by the New York press--trumped up as an excuse for
                        withholding their mite for our relief--because, as they allege, we failed to
                        defend our town against a band of 200 guer[r]illas! This is a sharp dodge on
                        the part of the New York gold speculators, and they, no doubt, felicitate
                        themselves over it as a very clever ruse whereby they were enabled to retain
                        a little money in their pockets! Save us, now and hereafter, from New York
                        sympathy!--but above all things else save us from the New York Militia! Come
                        Jenkins! Come Moseby! Come M'Causland! but against another visitation of the
                        New York Militia, Good Lord, defend us!</p>
                    <p>Demand For Ransom.</p>
                    <p>No sooner had the rebels possession of the town than commenced the work of
                        pillage. The men went howling through the streets for "whiskey" and
                        "greenbacks," while their officers were industriously at work breaking open
                        stores and dwellings and robbing citizens, wherever they met them, of their
                        watches and pocket-books. In the meantime McCausland had an eye to business
                        and determined to drive a sharp bargain. He made a peremptory demand upon
                        the town authorities for $500,000 in greenbacks or, if more convenient and
                        agreeable, would take $100,000 in gold, or burn the town in ten minutes. It
                        was very evident from the conduct of the men, from the moment they entered
                        town, that it was a doomed place and would be destroyed under any
                        circumstances. No attention was, therefore, paid to the demand and
                        McCausland immediately fired the town as he would have done had every dollar
                        of the ransom been paid down. Our citizens have the proud satisfaction of
                        knowing, however ruinous their hopes, that they did not demean themselves by
                        any offer to compromise, or conciliate in any way the freebooters by an
                        attempt to negotiate with them. From the moment they entered the place they
                        gave out that they were hell-bent to burn the "d--d town" and they were
                        suffered to carry out their hellish inclinations without making dupes of our
                        citizens by extorting ransom from them when ransom would not have saved the
                        town. Though we lost about everything else we saved at least our
                        self-respect by having no voluntary intercourse with McCausland and his
                        "hell-hounds."</p>
                    <p>Firing the Town.</p>
                    <p>They appeared to have adopted a systematically arranged plan for burning the
                        town by firing in regular order from the center to the suburbs. The first
                        house fired was a large unfinished building, belonging to Mr. Peter Brough,
                        situated a few doors from the Diamond. It was full of combustible material,
                        over which they poured coal-oil and applied the torch. It soon had the
                        surrounding houses and the Arcade Buildings opposite in flames. The next
                        place fired was the Grocery Store of Mr. Wm. Gelwicks of the Diamond and
                        about the same time the Court House, and in ten minutes after flames were
                        seen to issue from almost every house along Main and Market streets. No
                        person can describe the scene of terror and confusion that ensued among the
                        inhabitants. No warning was given the people to leave their homes and the
                        first intimation they had that private dwellings would be burned was the
                        smashing of their doors and having their houses filled with infuriated
                        fiends, still more brutalized by whiskey, who would listen to no appeals,
                        however pitiously [sic] made, for times to save some household goods and
                        remove the sick and inform. Their homes were fired over their heads in the
                        midst, of their pleadings and they were left to get through the flames as
                        best they could or perish in them. Many had the clothes burnt off their
                        backs and their persons badly sacrificed in getting out of their burning
                        homes. On leaving their dwellings women and children could be seen in the
                        wildest terror running through the walls of fire on either side seeking an
                        open space to escape the devouring flames, in many instances to be met by
                        the merciless foe and robbed of the little they were struggling to save. In
                        but few cases was anything saved except the scanty clothing on their backs.</p>
                    <p>It would take a volume to record the tales of sufferings and outrages endured
                        by our people on that awful day. Every one you meet, be it a man, woman or
                        child, has an exciting story to tell of their fearful situation and
                        desperate escape from destruction either by the fire or the foe. We will not
                        attempt to particularize or give publicity to individual instances of
                        heroism. that is always offensive to sensible heads and brave hearts. We
                        have heard, however, adventures of that day recited which far surpass any in
                        history that have gained renown for many a hero.</p>
                    <p>Approach of Averill's Men.</p>
                    <p>The rebels were aware of the approach of Averill's men long before our
                        citizens had an intimation of their being near. The rebels signal flags were
                        flying vigorously and their messengers riding in hot haste to call in their
                        burning squads and pickets for a sudden departure while our people were in
                        ignorance of what was transpiring. So their hasty retreat, or rather to
                        their cowardice in getting out of the way of Averill's men, do we owe the
                        preservation of the small portion of the town left standing.</p>
                    <p>We clip the following from Parson Brownlow's paper which lets us into the
                        secret why we are unworthy of aid or commiseration. How it is to be
                        reconciled with the position of New York, that "Copperhead Sodom of the
                        nation," we are at a loss to know. Until both these parties get to
                        understand each other we may expect no sympathy for our distressed and
                        agonized community. Can't Greeley, Bennet, Brownlow and McCausland hold a
                        council of war and decide upon burning the balance of the town? It would be
                        in keeping with the fiendishness they have already displayed against us. The
                            Parson ventilates himself over our misfortune
                        after this fashion:</p>
                    <p>"The rebels under the command of McCausland,
                        numbering about 500 men, dashed into Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, a town of
                        6,000 inhabitants, and destroyed it, leaving 3,000 persons without shelter.
                        They demanded $500,000 from the citizens, under a threat of burning the
                        town, the requisition being signed by Gen. Jubal
                        Early. We sympathize with any people thus burned out, and ruined, but
                        Chambersburg is a Copperhead town, and its rebel
                        population have been ruined by their dear Southern
                            friends. It will enable them to appreciate the beauties of the rebellion, and to know how others
                        feel who have suffered in the same way and at the hands of the same
                        graceless thieves and incendiaries."</p>
                    <p>The Future.</p>
                    <p>Everything has changed since the burning. Business is all conducted in little
                        shops and shanties on the back streets, and in out of the way places. But a
                        small assortment of goods are kept on hand and for these the highest prices
                        are asked. Many of our citizens have removed to other places never to
                        return. Others of our business men who remain have opened up in a small way
                        in some unthought of place, or started some new branch of traffic that the
                        necessities of the people seem to demand. One would scarcely suppose that so
                        great a change could take place in a community in so short a time. Men seem
                        in a degree reckless, they have lost all they possessed in the world, in an
                        hours time, through no fault of theirs, and they appear determined to make
                        it up by hook or by crook in the shortest possible time. Money seems plenty
                        and "trust is played out" as may be noticed posted up in stores and shops.
                        It is cash down for everything you get and everything you sell. People
                        understand each others necessities and do not think of asking credit. As to
                        the prospects of re-building the town they look exceedingly dark just now.
                        But few have the means to rebuild and they are dubious about investing their
                        money in property along the border while the war lasts. Those without means
                        can do nothing but pile up their brick and let their lots take care of
                        themselves until some appropriation is made for their relief. A few are
                        already re-building--they are, perhaps, the wisest after all. The
                        Legislature granted $100,000 to keep the people from starving and freezing
                        this winter. Very charitable indeed! "Charity covereth a multitude of sins."
                        The contributions from other places will not amount to much in the way of
                        relieving the many wants of the people. The supply of provisions forwarded
                        for a few weeks was liberal and relieved immediate wants. This aid has in a
                        great measure stopped off and must soon cease altogether. The sufferers
                        would return their grateful thanks to the good people of many towns in
                        Pennsylvania for their substantial sympathy. A few things in the way of
                        clothing and bedding have been sent in, but not enough to fit out twenty
                        families when over three hundred are entirely destitute. How the people are
                        to live this winter God only knows. Without stoves, coal, wood, bedding,
                        furniture, clothing, flour, maet, in a word, all the necessities of life;
                        and most of all without a roof to shelter them from the pelting of the
                        storms. Our people will only realize what they have lost, and what hard
                        times are, when cruel winter comes.</p>

                        parties for relief in our recent great calamity. In the same article for the

                        responsibility of our sufferings upon ourselves, derided our want of
                        bravery, and paid a high tribute to the gallantry
                        and virtue of the New York troops who were here
                        for the emergency last summer. The Herald refused
                        to publish the communication but took from it some of its least important
                        statements and commented upon them with characteristic unfairness holding at
                        the same time the original position it had assumed towards us. The
                        statements set forth in the communication are incontrovertible and were perhaps a little too strong for the
                        digestive functions of so amiable and truthful a personage as the editor of
                        the Herald and consequently were not admissible
                        to his sheet.</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg, Aug. 4, 1864.</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Editor of the New York Herald:
                    </p>
                    <p>The wide circulation of your paper, and the general confidence reposed in it
                        for accuracy of statement, impels me to offer a few remarks on the tenor of
                        your editorial in yesterday's issue under the caption "A Begging appeal from
                        Chambersburg."</p>
                    <p>As to the propriety of issuing such an appeal I have nothing to say, more,
                        than that I believe, the Committee who did it, realizing the extent of the
                        devastation and destitution inflicted upon us were actuated by the purest
                        and most humane motives.</p>
                    <p>Every statement published in Eastern journals regarding our misfortune, falls
                        far short of the reality. Scarce an adequate idea can be formed of what
                        hellish wickedness has been perpetrated upon us without actual observation.
                        And let me say that without the knowledge of the facts, it is impardonable
                        cruelty for editors to comment upon our condition, throwing the odium and
                        blame upon ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Three hundred of our most valuable buildings are in ruins. At least
                        twenty-five hundred persons have been rendered homeless and houseless, and
                        three millions of dollars will not suffice to replace the property
                        destroyed. Now, briefly, this is our situation. Let us see what could have
                        been done to avert it.</p>
                    <p>This valley has sent its full quota of able-bodied men to the war. The people
                        have furnished their full proportion of money to carry it on. Their industry
                        and the fertility of their lands have contributed largely in keeping up the
                        subsistence and supplies of our armies. Their loyalty and patriotism cannot
                        be questioned for in every way have they exhibited a proper appreciation of
                        the perils of the country and the importance of the success of its cause. In
                        this view have we not a right to expect protection of our lives, property
                        and interests from the Government? We yield it faithful obedience, and exert
                        ourselves in every possible manner for its maintenance; and for its honor as well as for our safety should we be made secure from the incursions of Rebel
                        hordes. The products of this valley are worth millions to the Government,
                        and in this alone, leaving out all other interests it is the sheerest
                        blindness to leave us almost hourly exposed to the power and foul treatment
                        which follow Rebel occupation. Thus it must be acknowledged that for the
                        invasion we cannot be held accountable. The invaders came upon our soil with
                        seeming impunity. They burned and pillaged and escaped. But now as to this
                        immediate locality.</p>
                    <p>At early morn of Saturday last, nearly three thousand Rebel scoundrels, with
                        six pieces of artillery, under the command of the wretch McCausland and
                        Bradley Johnston appeared within six miles of this town. They reached that
                        point before we had any definite knowledge of their approach either from
                        military sources or individual observation. At break of day they were on the
                        outskirts of the town and the first sure signal of their presence was when
                        their shells awoke us to a sense of danger. We had no arms, no organization.
                        We were defenceless, And even if we had possessed arms and been thoroughly
                        organized is is [sic] it to be presumed that we could have resisted the
                        advance of a foe numbering over three thousand, fiends I might call them,
                        bent on arson, plunder and murder. Would it not have been madness for us to
                        have thus encountered them, especially as the women and children were in the
                        town and would have been in continual risk of their lives and the vilest
                        treatment from the invading scoundrels. Only five hundred men it is true
                        entered the town; but it was well known that the main force was within
                        convenient distance and the whole body numbering a force of which it would
                        have required an equal force of drilled troops on our side to have met and
                        whipped.</p>
                    <p>Now I think I have successfully shown that there is some excuse for the people of Chambersburg, and whatever the
                        fault, it cannot be justly placed at their door.</p>
                    <p>Now I think I have successfully shown that there is some excuse for the people of Chambersburg, and whatever the
                        fault, it cannot be justly placed at their door.</p>
                    <p>It may be very pleasant for people in the east secure from danger to scorn
                        and sneer at those in this valley and laugh at their apparent timidity. But
                        if they were made to feel the hand of the invader as we have repeatedly,
                        they might appreciate sympathy quite as well and hurl back the indignities
                        and opprobrium endeavored to be fastened upon them.</p>
                    <p>Now a few words about "the gallant young men of New York" who as you allege,
                        came to our defense, and the statements of yourself and the Tribune, have only provoked an allusion to them.
                        New York has sent many, and gallant soldiers to the field. We honor them.
                        But the very worst specimens she has sent anywhere were here last summer.
                        They came as if prepared for a pic-nic, with all the delicacies of the
                        season in their haversacks and on their supply trains. Our people hailed
                        them with the warmest welcome and furnished them with the best they had
                            without cost. Everything was done under the
                        circumstances, that a population could do to evidence appreciation of their
                        coming and to render them comfortable. Now one one [sic] of the first grand
                        achiev[e]ments of these "gallant young men of New York" was to drag the fire
                        apparatus of the of the [sic] town through its streets at full speed yelling
                        like a pack of hounds. In their presence was known more profanity, more
                        blackguardism, more theft, more drunkenness than was ever inflicted upon a
                        community by professed Union soldiers since this war commenced. On an
                        evening they disappeared from their camp more suddenly than base fabric of a
                        vision, leaving all their camp equipage, individual property, sardines
                        Scotch ale by the gross, and dainties in every variety. These "gallant young
                        men from New York" heard of the approach of the Rebs and they skedaddled
                        without inquiring their number of getting even a sight of the visage of one
                        of them. The people of our town blessed the day of their deliverance and
                        made it one of thanksgiving for they were rid of the New York troops.
                        Jenkins came in and his command pillaged and plundered. We expected this
                        from him. New York troops stole secretly. Jenkins' did not, New York troops
                        tore down property in the most ruthless manner. Jenkins' did not. New York
                        troops outraged women. Jenkins' did not. When men come here for our defence we expect to find their professions
                        truthful, not on the other hand to make us the victims of riot and
                        blackguardism. You say the New York troops had "no very pleasing stories to
                        tell" of this valley. No wonder if they told the truth about themselves,
                        their statements would be too indecent for other care than those of the
                        scoundrel and the blackguard.</p>
                    <p>I ask you to give publicity to this in your columns in justice to a suffering
                        people.</p>

<b>Why Chambersburg Was Burned</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>

                    duty" of ordering the burning of Chambersburg.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Philadelphia Age gives what purports to be an
                        accurate report of the remarks of the rebel General Early, made at
                        Williamsport, Md., on the 6th inst., in regard to the burning of
                        Chambersburg. The occasion was the examination of several prisoners arrested
                        as hostages to secure the release of persons held by Federal authority.
                        Early attempted to vindicate the acts of his ruthless raiders, and in his
                        own behalf claimed to have performed only a "disagreeable duty" so far as
                        concerns the destruction in Pen[n]sylvania. He said:</p>
                    <p>General Hunter in his recent raid to Lynchburg, caused wide-spread ruin
                        wherever he passed. I followed him about sixty miles, and language would
                        fail me to describe the terrible desolation which marked his path.
                        Dwelling-houses and other buildings were almost universally burned; fences,
                        implements of husbandry, and everything available for the sustenance of
                        human life, so far as he could do so, were everywhere destroyed. We found
                        many, very many, families of helpless women and children who had been
                        suddenly turned out of doors, and their houses and contents condemned to the
                        flames; and in some cases where they had rescued some extra clothing, the
                        soldiers had torn the garments into narrow strips, and strewn them upon the
                        ground for us to witness when we arrived in pursuit.</p>
                    <p>General Hunter has been much censured by the voice of humanity everywhere,
                        and he richly deserves it all; yet he has caused scarcely one-tenth part of
                        the devastation which has been committed immediately in sight of the
                        headquarters of General Meade and General Grant, in Eastern Virginia. For
                        example--in Culpepper County, where General Meade held his headquarters,
                        almost every house and building has been burned; very few have escaped the
                        flames; and utter desolation is seen on every hand. Even a small tannery in
                        sight of General Meade's headquarters, where a poor man tanned a few hides
                        for the neighbors on the shares, to furnish shoes for the poor women and
                        children who were necessarily left there, was burned by the army, and the
                        half tanned skins drawn from the bats and cut into narrow strips to prevent
                        the possibility of their being useful.</p>
                    <p>Recently they have burned the house of Andrew Hunter, near Charlestown, with
                        all its contents, requiring his family to stand by and witness the
                        destruction of their homes. They did the same with the house of Edmund J.
                        Lee, near Shepardstown, and repeated it on the buildings of Hon. Alex H.
                        Boteler.</p>
                    <p>Such things of course, cannot be long endured, and must provoke retaliation
                        whenever it is possible. Accordingly I lately sent General McCausland to
                        Pennsylvania. I did not wish to retaliate in Maryland, because we all hope
                        and believe that Maryland will eventually become a member of the Southern
                        Confederacy. I therefore sent him to Pennsylvania, with written instructions
                        to demand of the authorities of Chambersburg, a sum which would be
                        sufficient to indemnify those gentlemen, and also pay some other damages
                        which I specified in the order; and in default of their compliance, he was
                        instructed to burn the town, which I learn was done. I was very reluctant,
                        and it was a most disagreeable duty, to inflict such damage on these
                        citizens; but I deemed it an imperitive [sic] necessity to show the people
                        of the Federal States that was has two sides. I hope and believe it has had,
                        and will have a good effect. I saw with much pleasure, since then, an able
                        article in the National Intelligencer, which called upon the north to
                        consider gravely whether such a mode of warfare as they had inaugurated is
                        likely to yield a success commensurate to its cost.</p>
                    <p>And now gentlemen, I will repeat my sincere regret that I am obliged to
                        subject you tot his inconvenience. I have no object but to procure the
                        release of those six citizens of Virginia who are now wrongfully imprisoned,
                        and therefore will make you as comfortable as possible. It is notorious,
                        that many of our most respectable citizens, who have been imprisoned by your
                        government for similar or less serious cause, have been confined in the same
                        room with condemned malefactors. Gentlemen, you need have no fears of such
                        treatment whilst in my custody. I propose to retain four of you, and release
                        the fifth on his parole that he will use his utmost efforts to procure the
                        release of those six gentlemen. If he succeed, you will be discharged at
                        once; but if he fail to accomplish this within two weeks, he must surrender
                        himself again to my custody.</p>

                        third, and its form changed, this has been rendered necessary by the
                        increase in the cost of white paper and all other essentials to the
                        publishing of a newspaper. When better times shall again come, and our
                        country shall again be restored to peace, order and happiness, we expect to
                        resume our old shape and conform our price tot he order of things "in the
                        good time coming"; but until that "good time" does come, necessity gives us
                        no choice in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Our loss has been very heavy, fully $6000. Our types, presses, and all other
                        printing material have been melted in the crucible of rebel barbarity; our
                        subscription list being all that we saved from the wreck. This severe loss
                        compels us to ask immediate payment from those who owe us, in order to meet
                        the liabilities incurred by us in refitting the establishment. In future we
                        are compelled by necessity to enforce the Cash System. The increased prices
                        of everything, white paper, labor, and all the necessaries of life, for
                        which we must Pay Cash, demands that we must also Receive cash for our
                        labor, or become crippled in our business.</p>
                    <p>Of the causes that operated to bring destruction on our town, and ruin to its
                        inhabitants, we do not propose, at this time, to say anything; hereafter we
                        may have much to say. One thing however is certain, that there has been
                        gross direlection [sic] of duty on the part of the government in failing to
                        provide for the defense of the border, by not keeping an adequate force in
                        such positions as to be ready to meet and repel such bands of miscreants as
                        McCausland's. It seems that border states and border counties are to be the
                        principal sufferers by this infernal war; that the favored regions further
                        North are, by their geographical position exempt from its worst horrors; its
                        inhabitants can coolly laugh at our calamities and mock at our fears. We may
                        envy them their exemption from the terrible scenes of war at their doors;
                        but we cannot, those feelings of their hearts that causes no sympathetic
                        chord to vibrate at the sufferings of their fellows.</p>
                    <p>We would say in conclusion to our Democratic friends, and to the suffering
                        people of our county, be of good cheer. Indications of a brighter day are
                        apparent. The day of misrule and misgovernment is near an end. The glorious
                        spectacle of a prosperous re-united, and happy people, will soon again be
                        presented in this land, now so cursed by rebellion, tyranny and war. God
                        speed the dawn of this brighter day!</p>

                    <p>During the winter session of the legislature Mr. Sharpe introduced a bill to
                        indemnify the citizens of the border counties for losses sustained from the
                        rebels and the Pennsylvania militia. Every legitimate argument was used to
                        secure its passage. But the Republican party holding a majority in both
                        branches of the legislature fought the measure with a vindictiveness that
                        seemed more akin to personal animosity against our people than fair and
                        manly opposition. Every parliamentary trick was resorted to for the purpose
                        of embarrassing the passage of the bill. The result is too well known to
                        require further exposition.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of the 30th of July our beautiful town was laid in ashes by
                        the vandalism and barbarity of a desperate band of freebooters, commanded,
                        by the infamous McCausland. Two hundred and sixty-five dwelling houses were
                        consumed by fire. Over three thousand people were pecuniarily ruined, and
                        the greater part of them rendered houseless and homeless. The destruction of
                        the town was in obedience to the command of General Early, and was justified
                        by him as a retaliatory act for the atrocities committed by General Hunter
                        in the Valley of the Shenandoah.</p>
                    <p>The legislature was convened in extraordinary session by the proclamation of
                        the Governor; the members were invited to visit Chambersburg by a committee
                        of our citizens, and the facility of an excursion train, free of charge, was
                        tendered to them by the magnanimity of Col. Lull, the gentlemanly
                        superintendent of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The august body visited
                        the ruins and departed, carrying the hopes and fears of our distressed
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The prospect of relief seemed so bright that no one despaired of success.
                        There could not possibly be any room for doubt or quibbling about the
                        desperate condition of our people, for the legislature had been here and had
                        witnessed the sore straits we were in with their own eyes. How could they
                        stifle all the common sympathies of humanity, and steel their breasts
                        against such a calamity? The thing seemed incredible to every right thinking
                        man. No one could believe that the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania, could
                        demean herself so much as to refuse a liberal appropriation. But those who
                        indulged in such cheering anticipations, little knew how a great State may
                        be disgraced, when ruled by very small men. They had not yet learned by a
                        little experience, how utterly reckless corrupt and demoralized the
                        Republican party which now governs this grand old commonwealth, with a rod
                        of iron, has become. They could not appreciate the truth, that the people,
                        by their lethargy, and indifference to their true interests, will sometimes
                        suffer men to be sent to the legislature, so utterly bankrupt in principle
                        and character, and so notoriously debauched, as to make the only approach to
                        their understanding, by the way of their pockets. This may seem harsh talk,
                        but it is nevertheless true, and the sequel will justify us, in saving much
                        more.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe introduced a carefully prepared bill, into the House, making an
                        appropriation of half a million of dollars, for the relief of Chambersburg.
                        This was the shape in which the bill came into the House. When the bill was
                        passing through the committee of the whole House, upon the motion of a
                        Republican, (Mr. Wells, of Susquehanna county,) an effort was made to reduce
                        the sum from half a million to fifty thousand dollars. This attempt was
                        unsuccessful. Upon the motion of Mr. Smith, a Republican from the city of
                        Philadelphia, one hundred thousand dollars. This effort was successful, and
                        the bill was reported back to the House, by the committee of the whole, in
                        that shape. When the bill was on second reading in the House, Mr. Sharpe
                        moved to amend it by striking out the words, "one hundred thousand" and
                        inserting one million of dollars. He supported his amendment by a powerful
                        and unanswerable speech, which we will take pleasure in publishing in our
                        next issue. A perusal of the speech will show, that every argument was used,
                        to persuade the legislature to pass the bill. As soon as Mr. Sharpe had
                        taken his seat, a number of insignificant Republican orators took the floor,
                        and attempted to make a lame defence, for the rascally and heartless votes
                        they were about to give. It soon became apparent, from the temper of the
                        republican side of the House, that the proposition to appropriate a million
                        of dollars could not be successful. Whereupon Mr. Schofield, a democratic
                        member from the city of Philadelphia, moved to amend Mr. Sharpe's motion by
                        reducing the amount to five hundred thousand dollars. A vote was taken, and
                        twenty-six voted in the affirmative. Of this number, twenty-five were
                        Democrats, and one was a Republican. The name of this Republican ought to be
                        written in letters of gold, upon the lintels of the desolated homesteads of
                        our people. The gentleman who had manliness to break through the trammels of
                        a base party, was the accomplished and eloquent member from Delaware county,
                        (Mr. Price.) On the motion of Mr. Quigley, a Democrat member from
                        Philadelphia, an effort was made to secure an appropriation of two hundred
                        and fifty thousand dollars. This was defeated by five votes. Five republican
                        members voted in the affirmative, to wit: Mr. Bigham, (of Alleghany,) Mr.
                        Coleman, (of Lebanon,) Dr. McClellan, (of Chester,) Mr. Cochran, (of
                        Philadelphia,) and Mr. Price, (of Delaware.) The next motion was for an
                        appropriation of two hundred thousand dollars, which was carried by nine
                        majority, and the bill was sent to the Senate for concurrence.</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the session the Senate had passed a resolution not to
                        consider any private bills at the extraordinary session. As soon as Mr.
                        McSherry, our indifatigable [sic] Senator called the bill up, Lowry of Erie,
                        the Boanerges of the Republicans in the Senate raised the point of order
                        that, it being a private bill, could not be considered by the Senate on
                        account of the resolution which had been adopted. Mr. Speaker Penny promptly
                        decided that the point of order was well taken, and ruled the bill out. Mr.
                        McSherry then made an eloquent and manly appeal to Lowry to withdraw his
                        point of order. He refused to do so unless Mr. McSherry would agree to take
                        fifty thousand dollars. Mr. McSherry indignantly refused to consent to this
                        insulting proposition, and turning to the Senators around him, he besought
                        them in a speech of convincing argument and great power, to have the
                        magnanimity to rescind the rule adopted by the Senate, so as to allow the
                        bill to be considered. He succeeded in getting a two-third vote, and the
                        rule was suspended. But despite all his argument and remonstrances, the
                        Republicans in the Senate curtailed the appropriation to the miserable
                        pittance of one hundred thousand dollars, and the bill finally passed for
                        this amount. It exonerates all the real estate upon which buildings were
                        burned from State and County taxes for three years, and from School taxes
                        for this year. It also exempts all our business men who were sufferers by
                        the fire from all mercantile licenses for two years.</p>
                    <p>The legislative record will show that the Republican party was the implacable
                        foe of this great measure for the relief of our people. Several of the
                        members of that party were so utterly lost to decency as to propose to sell
                        their votes for a pecuniary consideration. They were indignantly informed
                        that the people of Chambersburg had not yet fallen so low as to buy justice
                        from a venal legislature with bribes. We have given this plain and
                        unvarnished account of the relief bill so that the citizens of the border
                        counties may know upon whom the responsibility of defeating all their
                        measures of relief ought to rest. It any one will take the trouble to
                        examine the laws passed by the last legislature, he will find the utmost
                        recklessness and extravagance by the Republicans in voting large bounties to
                        volunteers, and for other purposes connected with the war. Millions of the
                        peoples money are wickedly voted away to shoddy contractors and political
                        favorites. Millions are squandered to tax, oppress and enslave the citizen,
                        but not a dollar is voted to lighten the war burdens of the border counties.
                        When the Republicans are asked for relief to help the citizens of
                        Chambersburg to re-build their homes they answer, "no, you have no right to
                        it." When they are told "our houses were burned by a public enemy as an
                        expiation for the destruction of property in the South, and our policies of
                        insurance are worthless," they answer, "we do not recognize any distinction
                        between the destruction of your property by a public enemy, or by an
                        accidental fire," "and you have no more right to ask aid in the one case
                        than you would have in the other."</p>
                    <p>Such are the arguments of the Republicans to your appeal for aid. Ye honest
                        men of Chambersburg who can break away from the thral[l]dom of party answer
                        these Republican sophistries by your ballots at the polls, on the second
                        Tuesday of October. Let them see that you have a little of the stuff left in
                        you that honest men are made of. Do not be beguiled by the deceitful lie,
                        that it is necessary to elect a Republican in order to carry your bill. Past
                        experience has shown that there is not a Republican in Franklin County that
                        can by any legitimate personal influence control three votes of his own
                        party on this subject. Clear the augean stables by turning out the rotten
                        Republican party. Make the legislature Democratic, and you will at last get
                        justice.</p>

                        Washington, commanding his retreat to the Potomac. This is precisely similar
                        to Wright's case a month ago. He was ordered to retreat through Snicker's
                        Gap toward Washington, by the Administration, and the defeat of Hunter and
                        the burning of Chambersburg were the consequences.--Age.</p>
