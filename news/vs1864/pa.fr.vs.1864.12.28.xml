                    though they may invest the slave with the title of freedom, cannot bleach his
                    skin, endow him with any mental or physical faculty withheld by nature, nor

                <transcript>
                    <p>This is a question which has long puzzled the ablest statesmen of the
                        country, and of which no satisfactory practicable solution has ever been
                        arrived, even by those who make the loudest professions of sympathy with his
                        condition as a slave. It is a question, however, which must, ere long, be
                        looked squarely in the face. Heretofore, it has been discussed in view of
                        the contingency of emancipation of the slaves in portions of the United
                        States where they have been held in bondage; now it must be viewed in the
                        light of an existing reality. A large number of slaves have been freed as
                        our armies have advanced into the southern country. No one pretends to
                        believe that the former status of these negroes will be restored. The able
                        bodied males have been, and will doubtless continue during the course of the
                        war, to be employed to a large extent by the Government; while the remainder
                        have been mainly provided for at Government expense. No particular <emph
                            rend="italic">status</emph>, however, has been assigned to them, further
                        than the exigencies of each individual case might require. With the close of
                        the war, however, if not at an earlier period their status <emph
                            rend="italic">as a class</emph> must be determined. It must then be
                        decided whether they shall be admitted in every respect as the equal of the
                        whites, or whether, though released from the obligations which made them the
                        property of another, they shall be excluded from political and social
                        equality with the whites. So far as this portion of the blacks is concerned,
                        the question of <emph rend="italic">slavery</emph> has been decided.
                        Underneath this, however, links one still more knotty and perplexing, viz:
                        the <emph rend="italic">negro</emph> question. Presidential edicts,
                        Legislative statutes and ordinances of Conventions, though they may invest
                        the slave with the title of freedom, cannot bleach his skin, endow him with
                        any mental or physical faculty withheld by nature, nor eradicate the inborn
                        feeling in the white that the African is an inferior race. It is not so much
                        the "prejudice of color" which makes the negro repulsive when assuming
                        equality with the whites, as the low character given him by the Almighty.
                        This antagonism does not assume the form of hatred or hostility, for the
                        conviction of superiority the white man experiences is generally
                        unaccompanied with any desire to tyrannize over the negro. Inhumanity to a
                        black universally awakens as much sympathy for the victim as though
                        perpetrated upon a defenceless person of another complexion. We presume
                        those who have expended thousands in colonization schemes can hardly be
                        accused of lack of philanthropy towards the unfortunate race, and yet these
                        benevolent people have esteemed it better for the African to be separated
                        from the wearers of the fair skins--better for the African, and better for
                        all.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto there has been a great reluctance on the part of the free blacks to
                        fall in with the idea that their happiness would be promoted by emigration
                        to some country of their own. In this they have doubtless been encouraged to
                        a great extent, by the ultra Abolitionists, who oppose colonization on the
                        ground that it implies an irresistible conflict between the races, which
                        they will not concede. Of a similar character are the present efforts to
                        extend the privileges of the negroes, the effect of which must be to invite
                        them to remain and others to come.</p>
                    <p>We do not propose to argue the question whether the elective franchise should
                        be extended to the negroes. We have always supposed with the deserted
                        statesmen of the country, that our Government was made for white men. The
                        legislation of the patriot-fathers all show this. The politicians of the
                        present day, have, however, grown so much wiser than their predecessors,
                        have attained so much more thorough knowledge of the laws of government,
                        have made so much more progress in civilization, and have exhibited such
                        superior sagacity in their mastery of the principles of philosophy and
                        philanthropy, that we are conscious of laying ourselves open to the ridicule
                        which attaches to old-fogyism, in presuming to think that the teachings of a
                        past generation should be any guide in these enlightened days. And when we
                        look around us and behold the familiarity with our organic institutions, the
                        public enterprise, the virtue and the high intellectual powers which
                        distinguish the black race in our midst, he would be "conservative" indeed,
                        who could hesitate for a moment in deciding upon the subject of negro
                        suffrage.</p>

                    <p>Houses for rent, owing to the wholesale destruction of buildings by the rebel
                        vandals, are unusually scarce in this place and consequently the rents
                        demanded by landlords are exhorbitant [sic]. We were inclined to the belief
                        that the misfortunes of many of our people would protect them from the
                        vipacity [sic] of those having tenements to let, but in this we have been
                        very much disappointed. It would seem to be the desire of these men, not to
                        get as much for their houses as they are worth; <emph rend="italic">but to
                            get as much as they can possibly squeeze</emph> out of the necessities
                        of our people. There is no good reason why rents should be any higher now
                        than one year ago. The tax on real estate is the same, and though marketable
                        commodities are higher, wages have risen in the same proportion. In a year
                        or two there will be some room for expansion, created by the rebuilding of
                        the burned portion of our town and the erection of new houses on available
                        lots on the outskirts. When our town has been rebuilt, this cruel war ended,
                        and the days of peace and prosperity again return, men who have taken
                        advantage of the necessities of the people in their day of adversity will
                        not be forgotten.</p>
