                <excerpt>"If the Democratic party is defeated, the Republic is in imminent danger.
                    Democrats of Franklin county, you have done well, but you must do better.
                    Increased zeal, redoubled energy, 'one long pull, a strong pull and pull all
                    together,' will rescue the county forever from the control of the pernicious
                    doctrines of the Republican party. Gird on your armor again. Spring to action
                    again with lighter hearts. Get every man to the polls."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The election is over. The result is not yet accurately known, but sufficient
                        is known to exhibit the fact that the Democracy of the "old Keystone" has
                        won a signal triumph. The Shoddy contractors and Government dependants are
                        trembling for the future. They see the handwriting on the wall, and know
                        that their doom is sealed. The immense patronage of the Administration could
                        not save the Republican party from defeat. Money was distributed in the most
                        prodigal manner; all manner of deception was practised--the basest
                        falsehoods were circulated as the gravest truths--dismissal from employment
                        was threatened as the consequence of a refusal to support the Administration
                        ticket, and yet in the face of all this, the honest masses, unawed by
                        intimidation, uninfluenced by bribes and undeceived by lying tongues, not
                        only annihilated the large majority of last year, but rolled up a majority
                        of over five thousand for the Democratic ticket. The result is gratifying,
                        for it secures the electoral vote of our grand old Commonwealth for
                        McClellan and Pendleton.</p>
                    <p>Maryland has spoken, and asserting her ancient dignity has declared that she
                        will be free--that she will still manage her domestic institutions in her
                        own way, and that she will not submit to the dictation of the
                        Administration. By her vote on Tuesday and Wednesday last, she has insured
                        "Maryland, my Maryland" for McClellan and Pendleton.</p>
                    <p>The people of the Sixteenth Congressional ticket have endorsed the course of
                        Hon. A. H. Coffroth, by a majority of seven hundred, notwithstanding the
                        slanderous statement circulated in regard to his votes and acts in Congress.
                        Hon. J. McDowell Sharpe has been re-elected to the Legislature, as the
                        reward of his fidelity to the interests of his con[s]tituents.</p>
                    <p>Hon. Francis M. Kimmell received a majority of two hundred and twenty-five on
                        the home vote and is very probably elected.</p>
                    <p>The county ticket received a handsome majority of the home vote, but will
                        very likely be defeated by the soldier vote.</p>
                    <p>There is an important work yet to be done. Franklin county must give a
                        majority for McClellan and Pendleton on the whole vote.</p>
                    <p>Democrats must not slumber. There must be no lethargy. Every man must be up
                        and doing. The times call for action. Never before were such great issues at
                        stake. Never before was there a nobler cause presented to the people for
                        their adoption. The old party of the Constitution and the Union appeals to
                        you once more for support. You must not fail in this important struggle. The
                        rights of freemen, the liberties of the American people hang upon the result
                        of the November election. If the cause of the Democracy is triumphant, the
                        Union will be restored and the Constitution preserved. If the Democratic
                        party is defeated, the Republic is in imminent danger. Democrats of Franklin
                        county, you have done well, but you must do better. Increased zeal,
                        redoubled energy, "one long pull, a strong pull and pull all together," will
                        rescue the county forever from the control of the pernicious doctrines of
                        the Republican party. Gird on your armor again. Spring to action again with
                        lighter hearts. Get every man to the polls. Reason with your neighbor.
                        Convince him by the weighty arguments of Democratic truth that he is in the
                        wrong and that you are in the right. Leave no stone unturned to insure the
                        success of our ticket. Let your resolution be, that if we are to be cursed
                        with four more years of Republican mismanag[e]ment and misrule, it shall not
                        be owing to any want of exertion on your part. Rally freemen once again: put
                        shoulder to shoulder and move forward in solid column for McClellan and
                        Pendleton, the Union, the Constitution and the laws.</p>

                    <p>The following account of the burning of barns and mills in the Shenandoah
                        Valley Gen. Sheridan, under the order of General Grant "to make the
                        Shenandoah Valley a barren waste," the main facts of which are stated by
                        Gen. Sheridan himself in his official report, is given by a correspondent of
                        the New York <emph rend="italic">World</emph>. If this is the way the war is
                        to be carried on in the future. God save the people along the border! Here
                        is the account:</p>
                    <p>The Shenandoah Valley Made A Barren Waste.</p>
                    <p>I have received two accounts of the manner in which Gen. Grant's orders "to
                        make of the Valley a barren was[t]e," was executed. One of them is from an
                        officer in the army. Both accounts agree in all essential particulars; and I
                        think I may safely say that for real devilish malibnity [sic] and
                        cool-blooded brutality, the execution of his order surpasses all the cruelty
                        of Butler, and, in all save one particular, equals even the atrocity of
                        Turchin. What do the readers of the <emph rend="italic">World</emph> think
                        of the wanton burning of twenty-seven hundred barns, filled with wheat, and
                        more than eighty mills for grinding wheat and corn? This was done by
                        soldiers of "The Union," with the Union flag waving over them. But they did
                        more than that. The flames from the burning barns communicated, in many
                        instances, to dwelling-houses contiguous, and houses and barns alike, in a
                        few hours, with all their contents, were reduced to a mass of smouldering
                        [sic] ruins. The kind-hearted soldiers, in some cases, wished to extinguish
                        the flames of these burning houses, but there were other barns to be fired,
                        and they were hurried away.</p>
                    <p>But the worst remains to be told. The burning of these houses was accidental,
                        although the burning of the contiguous barns was intentional. But there is
                        one district where three hundred and eighty seven dwelling houses were
                        burned, with all their contents, by the express order of General Sheridan.
                        This work was done with deliberation, and without any other than the
                        briefest warning to the inmates. All appeals for mercy were vain. Tottering
                        age and feeble infancy, delicate ladies, and women in that state which would
                        find pity even in the eyes of a savage, were compelled to rush out of their
                        houses, and then to witness their homes consumed before their eyes by
                        devouring flames. Remember that the barns and granaries of these unfortunate
                        people had been destroyed, and all their provisions carried away. They were
                        now driven from their homes, their houses burned over their heads, their
                        furniture, their clothing, all that they had in the world destroyed, and
                        left to perish in these cold inclement nights. What pen can describe the
                        horrors of these scenes? With a refinement of malignity worthy of the evil
                        one himself, not only the seed for next year's crops, but even the very
                        farming implements themselves were burned up.</p>
                    <p>General Sheridan says he burned all the houses within an area of five miles,
                        because one of his officers was murdered there. I would like to see the
                        murderer hung, and all of his accomplices. But to thus visit a crime, which
                        at the worst was only one of the casualties of war, upon hundreds of
                        innocent women and children, and to render homeless many innocent families,
                        is an act that is not worthy of a general, and that will do the Union cause
                        no good.</p>
                    <p>Citizens of Franklin county, what think you of the prospect before you? If
                        the rebels should again invade our State, (which is not at all improbable)
                        in what condition do you suppose <emph rend="italic">they</emph> would leave
                            <emph rend="italic">our</emph> beautiful Valley with its fine
                        farm-houses and magnificent barns and mills? Chambersburg in ashes is the
                        fruit of Hunter's vandalism in Virginia last spring. The horrors that <emph
                            rend="italic">may</emph> accrue to our people through these unparalelled
                        [sic] deeds of vandalism are happily, for the present, hid from our view.
                        Would to God, they might forever remain hid!</p>
                    <p>It makes the blood run cold in our veins to contemplate the accumulation of
                        sorrow that our misguided rulers are bringing upon this distracted land. May
                        the hand of Omnipotence shield the people, and interpose between them and

                <transcript>
                    <p>Few, not accustomed to the desolations of war, can realize the extent of the
                        destruction made, under orders from Grant, by Sheridan in the Shenandoah
                        Valley. Newspaper correspondents have sent their accounts of it home, and we
                        are able this morning to publish some of them. Between Staunton and
                        Strasburg, all barns containing grain, all wheat and hay stacks, all farming
                        implements, granaries and mills, and all subsistence of whatever kind, were
                        burned. All the horses and cattle were driven off. The correspondent of the
                        New York <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> writes: "The Valley, from
                        mountain to mountain, was consequently the scene of a conflagration, such as
                        has not been witnessed during the Rebellion. It was not a measure of
                        retaliation, for the wanton destruction of Northern towns and property, as
                        has been falsely supposed, but was a stern necessity of war, the full
                        bearings of which will be better seen and appreciated in the light of the
                        great campaign yet before us." Sheridan intends to continue the destruction
                        all the way north to Martinsburg. The damage has been immense. Not only
                        barns but private dwellings have been destroyed. Half the village of New
                        Market is in ashes. The people, deprived of food and homes, will have to
                        wander off. We cannot tell the story better than in one sentence of this
                        correspondent's letter: "The Valley of the beautiful Shenandoah, from near
                        the Natural Bridge to the gallows tree of John Brown, is a desolation."</p>
                    <p>There have been some slight movements at Petersburg. On the Weldon Railroad,
                        Wilcox and Warren moved their corps picket lines about a mile westward, but
                        the enemy concentrated in front of them and began shelling, and the pickets
                        were withdrawn to their original position.</p>
                    <p>Moseby reports that he attacked a party of one thousand Federal soldiers who
                        were repairing the Manassas Gap Railroad, west of the Gap at Salem, in the
                        Shenandoah Valley. Fifty Federal soldiers, and a large amount of supplies,
                        were captured. It is quite dangerous for trains to pass along this road, and
                        we doubt very much if Sheridan gets a very large quantity of supplies over
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Confederate General Buford is reported to have crossed the Cumberland
                        River at Harpeth Shoals, on Tuesday night, with one thousand cavalry. This
                        is a new raid into Tennessee.--<emph rend="italic">Age</emph>, 14th inst.</p>
                    <p>Affairs at Petersburg are still without change. The two armies lie quietly in
                        camp, even picket firing having for the time ceased. It is reported that
                        General Grant has relieved Generals Meade and Warren from Command. They were
                        ordered to attack the strong confederate positions near the Weldon Railroad;
                        they protested against it, as it would have cost an immense loss of life,
                        and most probably would be unsuccessful; and Grant removed them. Hancock, it
                        is rumored, will be Meade's successor. Whether these reports are true or not
                        we cannot say, but all the old cabals against Meade, which once were so
                        strong, have been revived. Birney is still in Philadelphia, very low with
                        the fever. It will be a month before he can resume his command.</p>
                    <p>Sheridan's barbarous devastation in the Shenandoah Valley has already borne
                        its fruits. The guerrillas are so numerous, and so savage in their attacks
                        upon his rear-guards and his supply trains, that he finds himself unable to
                        hold a position so far advanced as Strasburg. His trains from Harper's Ferry
                        are intercepted, and Moseby will not allow his gangs of laborers to repair
                        the Mannassas Gap Railroad. So Sheridan has no alternative but to abandon
                        Strasburg, and retreat northward towards Winchester. It is said he will
                        bring his army all the way back to Charlestown and Harper's Ferry. As he
                        retreats his devastation is as universal as that made in the Valley south of
                        Strasburg. Desolation reigns supreme. The result of it all is, that never
                        since the war began has guerrilla war been so bloody as it now is in the
                        Shenandoah.</p>
                    <p>The New York <emph rend="italic">Independent</emph> states that General
                        Sherman will make no attempt this year to advance South of Atlanta. For over
                        three weeks we have not had a line of news from his army. The Railroad and
                        telegraph connecting Atlanta with Chattanooga are still broken, and the
                        Confederates have their own way. On Saturday last, Wheeler captured Rome, a
                        town in Georgia, east of Sherman's supply railroad, and took three thousand
                        negro troops prisoners. On the same day he dashed into Marietta, near the
                        Kenesaw mountain and on the railroad, and spiked the cannon. Hood is near
                        Marietta, where the bulk of Sherman's troops are. The two armies are resting
                        on their arms, watching each other.</p>
                    <p>All the Federal troops have been driven from Southwestern Virginia. One body
                        was followed by General Breckenridge almost to Knoxville, in East Tennessee.
                        Burbridge, whose command is now near Lexington, Kentucky, reports that he
                        lost heavily on the retreat.</p>
                    <p>The defeat of Washburne's command near East Point, Alabama, by Forrest is
                        confirmed. All Washburne's artillery--eight guns--was captured. Two of his
                        caissons were exploded, and one of his transports disabled by the
                        Confederate shells. Washburne has retreated.</p>
                    <p>General Price has made his headquarters at Boonville, Missouri, just south of
                        the Missouri River. North of the river the Federal troops have abandoned
                        nearly all the State, and are concentrated at Macon City, northwest of St.
                            Louis.--<emph rend="italic">Age</emph>, 15th inst.</p>
