<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Negroes For The Forge, The Workshop And The Social Circle! <br>The Next
                        Step--Negroes At The Ballot Box! <br>Black and Yellow the National Colors
                        of the New Abolition Republic--and the Red, White and Blue Nowhere!</p>
                    <p>A grand saturnalia of the Shoddyites of Pittsburg [sic] was held in that city
                        on Thursday last. We take the following from the report of the procession as
                        published in the Dispatch:</p>
                    <p>"A wagon drawn by nine horses and filled with colored men brought up the
                        rear. The procession passed along the route as published, and halted on the
                        West Common."</p>
                    <p>Does not this show the strongly increasing desire of the Shoddy party to make
                        voters of negroes? Why should they be honored with a place in a procession
                        of voters--in the ranks of a party making a
                        display of its strength for the ballot box? They
                        were not put there as ornaments--they certainly
                        added no grace to the display. They could only have been given a place among
                        white men as symbols of the manner in which the
                        war for the Union has been prostituted to the elevation of the black race,
                        or as indicating a design on the part of the Shoddy miscegenationists to
                        share with negroes the amenities of the social circle and all the rights at
                        the ballot box. No man who cares for the future of his country, and detests
                        the hybridizing contemplated by such elevation of an antagonistic race can
                        fail to understand the placing of negroes in a Repu[b]lican procession
                        alongside of Voters!</p>
                    <p>But more. From the same report we clip the following. Read it, white Laborers
                        and Mechanics of the North! "Oliver Adams' blacksmith shop of South
                        Pittsburg followed. A forge, worked by colored men, was kept in operation on
                        this vehicle."</p>
                    <p>Here is the destiny of Northern Labor,
                        foreshadowed! Negroes To Work The Forges! Negroes To Take The Place
                        Of White Men Who Are Killed In This "War For The African And His Race." And
                        To Fill The Work Shops Of The North!--White Men, do you
                            understand the Symbol? Negroes working a
                            forge upon a wagon in a Republican procession Means That Negroes
                        Shall Take Your Place In The Field Of Labor--Reduce The Wages Of Labor,
                            and take the bread from your children's
                        mouths!</p>
                    <p>The Shoddy party have declared that "the war is for the
                            Africans and his race"--that "the war shall not cease till slavery is
                            destroyed"--and, while our brave soldiers, the laborers and mechanics of the North, are bravely shedding
                            their blood for the Union--Shoddy supporters
                            of Lincoln are filling their places of labor at home with Negroes
                        and are preparing to offer them the right of suffrage on
                            perfect equality with and to control the votes of those same gallant
                            white soldiers should they be spared to return home.</p>
                    <p>What will be the next step, when Labor has been reduced to the negro standard
                        of cheapness, and the poor whites shall be compelled to consort with the
                        blacks as their equals? Why Miscegenation--the Shoddy hope and prayer--is what is to follow.</p>
                    <p>White men! Laborers! Mechanics! Can you vote for Abe Lincoln--knowing these
                        designs of the party whose candidate he is? No, you
                            cannot! You will prove false to yourselves--to your homes--to your children, and to your
                        posterity if you do! Vote for McClellan and all the Democratic
                        candidates, and Forever crush this hideous, damnable
                            negro mania!</p>
