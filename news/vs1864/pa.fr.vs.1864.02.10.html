<b>Our Washington Letter</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Washington correspondent to the Spirit and Times reports that "nothing
                    of very special importance" has happened in Congress since his last letter. He
                    notes that the commutation money on the conscription bill was reduced from $400
                    to $300 and that a bill equalizing the pay of white and black troops was
                    discussed. Mr. Blair of Missouri offered a bill to investigate commercial
                    intercourse with the rebellious states. His proposal is being interpreted as an
                    attack on Secretary Chase, "who has the supervision and direction of this branch
                    of the plundering business."<br>

<b>Shall Freedom Survive</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors predict that 1864 will see a "great civil contest" in the loyal
                    states between the forces supporting the Constitution and those supporting
                    "usurped power." The Lincoln administration is determined to hold on to power,
                    and the editors believe its rule is part of a larger plot to rob the American
                    people of their civil liberties and impose a new, despotic regime on the
                    country. As evidence, the editors point to Lincoln's proposed reconstruction
                    plan, which would allow the loyal ten percent of the Southern population to rule
                    over the rest of the disenfranchised former rebels. With oppressive conditions
                    such as those existing in one part of the country, say the editors, it will not
                    be long before civil liberties fade in the other parts.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The year 1864 will probably be one of the most eventful in our country's
                        history. Battles, the most severe of the war, will be fought, homes will be
                        made desolate, wives will be made widows, children will be made orphans and
                        the hills and valleys of our beloved country will will [sic] be drenched
                        anew in blood, with what result as to ending this fratricidal struggle we
                        cannot tell. But the contest with armed rebellion in the South is not the
                        only issue to be decided in the present year. A great civil contest is
                        approaching in the loyal States, which, in the opinion of many--and we share
                        that opinion--will decide the fate of republican institutions and
                        constitutional government. The issue will be made up between usurped power
                        on the one hand, and the constitutional rights of the people on the other.
                        Upon the decision of this issue will depend the future welfare of the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Our rulers have most shamefully betrayed the trust committed to their hands.
                        While professing a desire to suppress rebellion and violations of law, they
                        themselves have become violators of the law. Pretending to put down
                        revolution in the South, they have inaugurated revolution at the North.
                        Entrusted by the people with immense power, for a high and noble purpose,
                        they have used it to strike down the people's liberties. The innovations on
                        the Constitution and the outrages against individual and personal rights
                        have followed each other in such rapid succession, increasing in violence
                        and boldness every time they are repeated, that he who fails to see their
                        logical sequence must be a dull observer of passing events.</p>
                    <p>The startling usurpations of power on the part of the Executive and those
                        acting under his authority, have justly alarmed the public mind. In addition
                        to many other acts of like character, we have seen within the past year, the
                        freedom of the ballot struck down by an armed soldiery in our sister States
                        of Maryland, Delaware and Kentucky, and election farces enacted in solemn
                        mockery. It has also been intimidated, by no less a personage than Mr.
                        Seward, that Mr. Lincoln will not surrender his seat "without bloodshed,"
                        even though a majority of the people should declare in favor of another.
                        Taking these things in connection with the total disregard of Constitutions
                        and laws which has marked the course of the present Administration, we are
                        forced to the conviction that there exists a deliberate and settled purpose
                        on the part of the dominant party to subvert the liberties of the people and
                        change our constitutional form of government. The conclusion is irresistible
                        that military despotism, the worst form of tyranny, is staring the people in
                        the face and waging war upon their rights, and unless they meet the issue
                        boldly and fearlessly, with brave hearts and, if need be, with strong arms,
                        the people will be overthrown and fanatics drunk with power will sing their
                        songs of triumph over the grave of liberty.</p>
                    <p>The avowed policy of the Administration towards the States in rebellion will
                        lead directly to the result we have indicated, even if that result were not
                        deliberately intended. Unless the policy is changed the result is
                        inevitable. That policy is subjugation and the reduction of those States to
                        the conditions of Territories or conquered provinces. These Territories are
                        to be subject to the will of the President, his decrees to be enforced at
                        the point of the bayonet. As soon as one-tenth of the inhabitants of any
                        State thus reduced, swear to sustain all the proclamations of the
                        President--past, present and to come--they will be permitted to form a new
                        State Constitution--in accordance with the will of the President, of
                        course--and organize a new State government, and the army and navy is to be
                        used to aid the one-tenth in keeping the nine-tenths in subjection. Such is
                        the President's plan of "reconstruction" as foreshadowed in his late
                        message. Will any sane man pretend that this plan is in harmony with the
                        spirit and genius of the Government founded by Washington and his compeers;
                        or that it is a government "deriving its powers from the consent of the
                        governed?" We think not.</p>
                    <p>But it may be said that this plan of arbitrary government is only to apply to
                        the States in rebellion. This may be true and it may not be true. Judging
                        from elections in neighboring States to which allusion has already been
                        made, where a free expression of opinion was prevented by federal bayonets,
                        we are inclined to the opinion that it is intended to apply the same
                        absolute rule to all the States just as soon as those in power feel
                        themselves strong enough to attempt it. But whether it is so intended or not
                        this policy must end in the destruction of republican institutions. And the
                        reason for this is too obvious to need an argument. Two antagonistic systems
                        cannot be administered by the same government in the same country. You
                        cannot apply an arbitrary or despotic system of government in the same
                        country. You cannot apply an arbitrary or despotic system of government to
                        one section of the country and preserve republican liberty in the other. The
                        idea is absurd. Reduce one section to a state of vassalage and it will not
                        be long before the other is found in the same abject condition.</p>
                    <p>We, of the North, might be permitted to retain, for a brief period, the
                        shadow of our former rights, but to expect to retain even the shadow long,
                        would be indulging in delusive hopes. The people must awake to the fact,
                        that this great issue between licentious power and constitutional freedom
                        must be decided, perhaps for all time, in the coming presidential canvass.
                        Already the minions of power are marshalling their forces and laying their
                        plans with a view of controlling the result. And we say to all, who have
                        hearts to love their country, that if they would save its cherished
                        institutions, they must go to work to meet the issue. Let every true man do
                        his whole duty in this crisis, and all may yet be well. Let every patriot
                        gird on his armor and go forth, "unawed by power and unbribed by gain," and
                        battle manfully against despotism in all its forms, remembering that now,
                        more than ever, "eternal vigilance is the price of Liberty."</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors direct the reader's attention to an article in another part of

                    <p>
                        Editor of the Spirit and Times.
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR: In your criticism upon the Thanksgiving sermon of the Rev. S. J.
                        NICCOLLS, there is one point to which I wish, with your permission, to call
                        the attention of an intelligent public. I desire to do so because it is one
                        of those vulgar errors which have some to be widely believed, without the
                        slightest foundation of evidence, and indeed against all the evidence in the
                        case. I refer to the notion that the negroes as the supposed decendants of
                        Ham are resting under the curse of the Almighty as recorded in Gen. 9,
                        25-27. It is not my purpose to defend the sermon of the Rev. Mr. Niccolls,
                        or to animadvert upon the opinions and views set forth in your criticism. I
                        desire simply to discuss a question of interpretation and history, for the
                        sake, if possible of dissipating a groundless and vulgar error.--You say
                        that "it is there written,"--[illegible] in the Scriptures--"that the
                        enslavement of the black race is one of the Almighty's great purposes,
                        whereby out of evil he educes good," and you then refer the curse upon
                        Canaan to "the descendants of Ham, the African race." Now what are the facts
                        in the case?</p>
                    <p>First as to the passage itself. The terms of the passage clearly limits the
                        curse to the descendants of Canaan, the youngest
                        son of Ham. Three distinct times is the curse repeated and exclusively
                        referred to Canaan. And when Ham is first spoken of as seeing the nakedness
                        of his father, he is spoken of as Ham "the father of
                            Canaan." So that clearly Canaan is the obnoxious person in the
                        mind of the inspired writer. I need not refer to the difficulties with which
                        this passage has puzzled all interpreters. Suffice it to say that no true
                        solution can be attained without a careful consideration of the relations of
                        enmity existing between the people of Israel and the Canaanites when this
                        Scripture was writtten, and that no interpretation can be admitted by
                        reflecting men, which makes the curse upon Canaan to be the immediate consequence of the conduct of Ham. It is rather to
                        be regarded as a prophesy of a fact foreseen to be realized in the future,
                        and uttered as a humiliating rebuke to the irreverent Ham. Limiting then, as
                        the terms of the passage do, the curse to the descendents [sic] of Canaan,
                        let us inquire who were they? All the information respecting them which we
                        have, we get from the Scriptures themselves. "And Canaan begat Sidon his
                        first born and Heth, and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgasite, and
                        the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite, and the Arvadite and the Zetnatite
                        and the Hamathite, and afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread
                        abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to
                        Gerar, unto Gaza: as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and
                        Zeboim, even unto Lesha." Here the tribes and boundaries of the Canaanites
                        are clearly laid down. They occupied what is now known as the land of
                        Palestine, from which they were driven, being destroyed enslaved and
                        scattered abroad by the victorious Israelites. And in the history of the
                        wars of Israel for the possession of the promised land the above names
                        continually occur. There is not one particle of evidence that any African
                        tribe descended from Canaan; but conclusive evidence of the contrary is
                        found in the fact that the perfect type of the negro head, unchanged in a
                        single peculiarity in the lapse of centuries, is found upon the Egyptian
                        monuments of a date contemporaneous with, or prior to, the conquest of
                        Canaan by the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>If for the sake of covering the case it is insisted that the curse extends to
                        all the descendents [sic] of Ham, we are led into difficulties and
                        absurities equally great. The four sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Phut and
                        Canaan. The family of Cush appears to have divided, part of it going
                        eastward where Nimrod founded the great Babylonian empire, and into Arabia,
                        and part going southward to Ethiopia.--The part of the family of Cush which
                        remained in Asia became the great conquerors and empire builders of
                        antiquity. Mizraim is the ancestor of the Egyptians. The common Hebrew word
                        for Egypt or the Egyptians is Mizraim, i. e. the
                        Two Egypts. And no one need be told that the ancient Egyptians were not a
                        nation of slaves, but a highly cultivated, civilized and powerful nation.
                        The valley of the Nile is indeed the cradle of the world's art, science,
                        learning and law. It witnessd the most wonderful development of human
                        history and civilization considering all the circumstances, which the world
                        has even [sic] seen. To this day her achievements are a marvel and mystery.
                        Like her mysterious sphinx she stands dark and solemn in the desert twilight
                        of the mighty past.</p>
                    <p>"The burnt out torch within her mouldering hands, <br>That once lit all the
                        East."</p>
                    <p>Of the descendants of Phut we have scarcely any mention in Scripture. The
                        points of their migration are wholly conjectural. It is surmised by some
                        that they moved southward and peopled various parts of Africa. By others it
                        is supposed from certain radical elements of language that they moved to the
                        extreme north of Asia, peopling the vast steppes of Siberia, and pouring
                        forth in subsequent times those great tides of barbarian life which
                        repeatedly overrun Europe.</p>
                    <p>Can we then in this total uncertainty as to the origin of the African tribes,
                        presume to fix upon them the curse upon Canaan? And even conceding that
                        Africa was peopled by certain branches of the family of Ham, on what
                        principle do we concentrate the curse upon them and not on the conquering
                        people of the plain of Shinar, and on the wise sages of Egypt?</p>
                    <p>But as we said at the outset the curse is limited in its own terms to the
                        descendants of Canaan, and its significance was fully exhausted in the
                        history of that people. The attempt to fasten it upon the negro because of
                        the incidental circumstances of his present history is a singular instance
                        of the tendency of mankind to make the conclusions of their judgment
                        minister to their prejudices.</p>

                        presented a warlike appearance and--we are sorry to say it--been very
                        disorderly. Drunken men are as plentiful as [illegible] , and profane oaths
                        appear to be the medium through which thought is communicated.--Taverns,
                        Eating houses and Ale Shops are doing a thriving business, and if the
                        present state of affairs continues much longer some additional arrangements

                        stringent notification should be served on our keepers of Hotels and Ale

                    <p>In all seriousness, an effort should be made by the officers in command, and
                        our borough police to put an end to the outrageous violations of morality
                        and common decency exhibited openly and shamelessly on our streets in open

                        drunken men. Females can no longer venture abroad after nightfall, without
                        having their ears shocked with obscene language and foul oaths, at each
                        street corner, and in many instances, of recent occurrence, some have been
