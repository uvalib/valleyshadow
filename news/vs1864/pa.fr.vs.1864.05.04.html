                    Repository suggested.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have no desire to get into a controversy with the Repository about the Court. What we have said on the subject,
                        was dictated by an honest desire to promote the attainment of the ends of
                        justice. This was our sole purpose, and this we regarded as a solemn duty
                        which we owed to the law, to the Court, and to the people. We made no
                        assault on the Judiciary and sincerely trust it may never become necessary
                        for us to do so. If the Repository wishes to
                        become the special defender of Judge Nill, and the Judge is satisfied, we
                        certainly have no objection. We have only this to say, however, that if we
                        are reluctantly drawn into a discussion against our wishes, we may have to
                        say some things not too palatable to the editor
                        of the Repository himself, and which he might
                        wish to have remained unsaid.</p>
                    <p>To say the least of it, it comes with a bad grace for a Republican journal to
                        talk about "assaults on the Judiciary." A party that has lived by assailing
                        the Judiciary should be the last to charge it upon others as a fault.
                        Assaults on the Judiciary have been and still are its principal stock in
                        trade, of which the files of the Repository
                        afford ample proof. In the language of scripture we would say to our
                        neighbor: "Physician heal thyself."</p>

<b>The Coming Draft</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides official quotas of how many soldiers must be drafted from each
                    township in the 16th Congressional District.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Board of Enrollment of the 16th Congressional District have completed all
                        the preliminary business and are ready to make a draft, under the last call
                        for troops, at any time. The draft had been postponed temporarily by the War
                        Department but may be ordered to take place very soon.</p>
                    <p>We give below the official quota of each sub-district in the country,
                        carefully adjusted, and embracing all credits up to the 15th of April; from
                        which it would appear that the only subdistricts having their quotas filled,
                        are Greencastle and the South Ward of the borough of Chambersburg; the North
                        Ward has yet one man to furnish, but it is expected that our wide-awake
                        council will succeed in securing a "colored cuss" or some other man in time
                        to fill the deficiency.</p>
                    <p>Our readers can on this table as entirely correct, and we would advise
                        sub-districts not yet filled, to offer liberal bounties to volunteers and
                        make a vigorous effort to complete their quotas before the wheel at the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting of the ladies of Chambersburg, interested in the Christian
                        Commission (which has for its object the supply of materials for the sick
                        and wounded of our army, more especially after a battle) it was unanimously
                        agreed to hold a fair on the 13th of June, for the purpose of raising funds
                        towards the benevolent association above mentioned. It is thought advisable
                        to interest the people of Franklin county in this laudable enterprise, so
                        that a united effort on the part of the citizens of one of the richest and
                        most populous counties in the State may be successful and worthy of the
                        cause and the people. In furtherance of this object, it is suggested, that
                        the prominent ladies of the large towns of Waynesboro, Greencastle,
                        Mercersburg, London, Orrstown and Fannettsburg, with all the villages of the
                        county, should confer among themselves and act with our citizens in this
                        undertaking. Each of these places could be separately represented at the
                        fair and have their own table, superintended by a committee from amongst
                        themselves. Mrs. General Couch is President of the ladies association in
                        this place, Mrs. William McLellan Vice President and Miss. Mary McCullough
                        Secretary from whom any information desired, can be had by addressing her.
                        Weare [sic] all interested in this movement, hundreds of our young men, our
                        fathers, husbands and brothers are girding on their swords for the battle,
                        before whose significance the past withers into forgetfulness, no human
                        sagacity can tell when or where the blow may be struck, but we all know that
                        in that fatal field many a womanly form in our midst, will be widowed and
                        broken hearted, the refluent tide of war may bring the thunder of artillery
                        in our very midst, and our fields may be crimsoned with the blood of our
                        brothers. It is the part of wisdom to prepare now
                        to alleviate the pain and suffering of the wounded. In this Gospel of
                        Charity the ministry is given unto woman, for many reasons, she may not go
                        in the field, but what more cheering thought could sooth[e] the brow of
                        pain, than to know that a mother, wife or sister's hand had sent these
                        comforts to the stricken soldier. But I merely meant to suggest the plan of
                            united action, all over our county, to the
                        ladies, knowing full well, that the fair hands, that roused them into the
                        field, will also alleviate their sufferings.</p>
