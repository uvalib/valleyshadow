<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a deep sense of insecurity beginning to pervade the minds of the
                        community with regard to the protection of their persons and property.
                        Lawlessness seems to prevail everywhere, in high as well as in low places.
                        Those charged with the high and responsible duties of executing the laws and
                        administering justice with an impartial hand, have been found shamefully
                        derelict in the performance of their duties. That strict impartiality and
                        inflexible integrity in the administration of the laws to which we were
                        formerly accustomed, is now no more to be seen. Political prejudice and
                        partisan bigotry are the influences that control the actions and decisions
                        of many of our public officers; and the fact that a man belongs to this or
                        that party, has much more to do with his obtaining justice at the hands of
                        the executors of the law, than the merits of his case.</p>
                    <p>Is it any wonder that the people are growing uneasy under this sense of
                        insecurity of their property, reputation and lives? Is it any wonder that
                        they are beginning to inquire whether there is any longer any hope left for
                        protection, save in their own ability to defend themselves? This is a
                        serious question, involving the dearest interests and rights of every man,
                        woman and child in the community, and should engage the serious attention of
                        every well-wisher of society. We may, perhaps, have more to say on this
                        subject in our next.</p>

<b>Legislative</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
