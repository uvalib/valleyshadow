                    <p>Signal Station on Stone Fort, <br>Maryland Heights, <br>July 14th, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: To-day while thinking of home and friends, many kind faces
                        and familiar voices came to my recollection, and I thought I would while
                        away dull time by penning a few lines for my favorite paper the "Valley
                        Spirit." In the first place the boys with a few exceptions, are enjoying the
                        best of health. There is but one of our number in Hospital and he is there
                        because of a severe wound received in a skirmish with the Rebs on the
                        evening of the 5th.</p>
                    <p>We do not now enjoy the luxuries of life as we did when encamped near your
                        place. Our rations now consist of "salt pork," coffee and "Uncle Sam's" pies
                        (and they are mouldy) yet strange as it may seem we relish them (hunger
                        being one of the best cooks). We left our old camp under orders to report at
                        Harper's Ferry. We encamped after our first day's march near Hagerstown in a
                        clover field. It was our first night without any shelter yet I slept as
                        soundly as if I had been in the best kind of a tent. On Tuesday morning we
                        resumed our march by way of Sharpsburg (I am now speaking of those who were
                        mounted, the rest of the boys went by way of Williamsport and Martinsburg
                        where they had transportation furnished them to the Ferry.)</p>
                    <p>We passed over part of the old Antietam battle-field, and the same fields
                        that on the 17th of September, 1862, were covered with the dead and dying
                        are now covered with golden grain ready for the sickle of the husbandman,
                        and leaving but few traces of the buried dead and the devastation of civil
                        war. We arrived at the Ferry on the evening of the 28th weary and covered
                        with dust and looking but little like the gay and happy boys we were while
                        lying in camp near old Chambersburg, yet you must not think from what I have
                        written that we are mourning over the change; for the boys are all full of
                        life and jokes and repartees are the order of the day. At 6 P.M. we began to
                        climb the mountain for the Fort which is situated 1200 feet above the level
                        of the Potomac and found the rest of the boys in comfortable quarters
                        awaiting our coming, they having prepared steaming hot coffee wherewith to
                        greet us.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday our reserve camp was moved to Fort Duncan. There was a signal
                        station of nine men under Lieut. Kennedy left on the Heights. The view from
                        the top of the mountain is magnificent and will well repay any lover of the
                        grand and beautiful in nature for the exertion necessary to climb to the top
                        of it. Standing on the walls of Stone Fort to the south west and apparently
                        under the mountain is Harper's Ferry, acted as the place where John Brown
                        made the first demonstration towards the freedom of the negro. Further in
                        the distance is Charlestown where John Brown the Martyr met with his just fate, and I sincerely hope that every
                        traitor to the Constitution which our fathers gave to us will meet with the
                        same doom and his name become a by worn through all future time. Still
                        further on and almost out of the reach of our field glass is Winchester a
                        hot bed of secession. To the south you can follow the windings of the river
                        a distance of thirty miles. The Forts are manned by the 5th N.Y. heavy
                        artillery; they number 2700 men and are gentlemanly and sociable and have
                        officers to command them that they may well be proud of.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday morning July 3d our attention was arrested by the sound of brisk
                        cannonading in the direction of Martinsburg where Gen. Sigel's forces under
                        command of Col. Mulligan came in contact with Earley's division of Ewell's
                        corps. After a brief engagement of about an hour our forces retreated
                        towards Martinsburg, burnt the government stores and continued their march
                        towards Sheppardstown where they crossed the river hotly pursued by the
                        Rebs. On the evening of the 4th at 6 P.M. Sigel's forces made their
                        appearance in Pleasant Valley, Md., and during the night they entered the
                        breastworks between Forts Duncan and Stone. On Tuesday the Rebs made their
                        appearance in Sullivan's Valley about three miles from our Fort. They then
                        threw out their skirmishers and at 4 P. M. they came in contact with our
                        lines when a brisk fight ensued between the advanced skirmishers, the Rebs
                        driving our forces back under cover of the guns of the Forts. They opened on
                        our lines with two pieces of artillery but fired only six rounds when a
                        shell from one of the guns by my side silenced them and dismounted theirs. I
                        must here state that the citizens in the valley estimate the force of the
                        rebels engaged at 8000 while at the same time the force under Sigel and the
                        troops in and around the Forts with those sent from Baltimore numbered from
                        8 to 10,000. It is now apparent that the movement of the Rebs was only a
                        feint to keep our men engaged while the larger portion of their troops were
                        ravaging the country for [illegible] and cattle of which they got quite a
                        [illegible] a brisk fire was again resumed between the advanced skirmishers
                        and kept up all day our forces slowly falling back under cover of the Forts.</p>
                    <p>Thursday morning the firing was again renewed. Col. Mulligan's sixteen
                        shooters having the advance. The firing was quite lively and the Rebs were
                        compelled to fall back and in the evening the two armies occupied nearly the
                        same positions they did when they first met.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday night the Rebs disappeared from our front and took up their line
                        of march for Frederick City, Md.</p>
                    <p>The amount of damage done in Washington and Frederick counties is immense.
                            And in my opinion had it not been for the imbecility
                            or ignorance of the General commanding the whole rebel force engaged
                            with us could have been captured. It is said Col. Mulligan plead
                        with Sigel to have permission to bring on a general engagement but was
                        peremptorily refused. The confidence the army had in Sigel (if they ever had
                        any) is entirely gone. He is releived [sic] of his command and is
                        superceeded by Gen. Howe.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of the 4th a small force of rebels estimated at 300 made their
                        appearance on Bolivar Heights near where the 12th regiment of Pennsylvania
                        Cavalry a small battery and one battalion of the 5th N.Y. were encamped and
                        drove the whole force across the river. (I don't want the readers of this to
                        think it was the fault of the men that they retreated for when the shoulder
                        strapped gentry skeddaddle, privates would be foolish not to follow.) The
                        number of killed and wounded of our men is estimated at one hundred the rebs
                        losing about an equal number. We captured about 150 prisoners the rebs
                        capturing about double that number of our men. Our communication has been
                        cut off for the present so that we get no papers nor letters, and we do not
                        know what has been transpiring in the vicinity of your place. I suppose the
                        newspaper correspondents will call this a grand military movement but the
                        soldiers here call it a perfect piece of cowardice on the part of the
                        officers in command; and if this war is carried on all through the land as
                        it has been here, I am under the impression that we may bid farewell to the
                        old or new Union of States. While I am writing Sullivan's division of
                        Hunter's command is coming down through Bolivar. Hunter's whole command will
                        report at the Ferry in a few days. I this morning saw a number of the boys
                        who were sent away from our corps during the latter part of April. Among the
                        number was D.D. Fickes and J.W. Everett from our county. They have done some
                        hard marching and are pretty well colored from the effects of old Sol.</p>
                    <p>With my kindest regards to all readers of the Spirit, I am respectfully
                        yours,</p>

                        Make the most of any gentle taste or comely propensity. Encourage them to
                        love flowers, pictures and all the beautiful things which God has made. Talk
                        with them, read with them, go out with them into the fields and woods, and
                        hallow pleasant scenes with holy memories. A daily ministration to their

                        them more comely than costly garments. They will ever bear you witness in

                        will crumble to dust. Why don't mothers teach their children more, and dress

                        Intelligencer.]</p>
                    <p>The valley of the Shenandoah has more than once been the valley of our
                        national humiliation. After more than three years of gigantic war, our
                        military administration has not learned to apprehend the relation of this
                        valley to the defence of Washington, and the enemy, safely presuming on the
                        ignorance and shiftlessness of that administration, has learned to practice
                        in this quarter, a wearisome monotony of movement which only serves to show
                        that he deems it safe at any time to hope for success by counting on our
                        official stolidity as a standing substitute for his poverty of invention.</p>
                    <p>Talleyrand was wont to say that it is always better to rely on the folly of
                        your antagonist than on your own sagacity, and it is certain that the enemy,
                        in the use he periodically makes of the valley of the Shenandoah, has shown
                        his own sagacity only in presuming always on our official want of that
                        quality in the conduct of the war. Physical Geography has ordained that the
                        occlusion, or at least the vigilant observation, on this side approach to
                        the city of Washington, shall be a prime element to any campaign which
                        starting from Washington, has the city of Richmond for its objective point.
                        And yet, with a want of foresight which, in the absence of all conceivable
                        motive for the wil[l]ful betrayal of a grave public trust, confounds the
                        reason of ordinary mortals by its magnitude and by its inveteracy, our
                        military authorities have for four successive summers permitted this valley
                        to be used by the enemy at his pleasure for the purpose of bringing
                        confusion on the well-laid plans of all our generals operating against
                        Richmond. Whether it be at one time from failing to station in this valley a
                        capable commanding officer; or at another from not retaining a sufficient
                        force under his command; or at still another from not occupying the proper
                        points of observation to descry the approach of danger in time to guard
                        against positive mischief; or whether, as at some time, it be from
                        committing all these blunders at once, certain it is that the military
                        administration, in giving the country much sad experience of inefficiency,
                        has nowhere made that inefficiency more egregious and deplorable than in
                        this quarter.</p>
                    <p>The first battle of Bull Run was turned from victory into disaster by the
                        failure of General Patterson to prevent the junction of General Joseph E.
                        Johnston, through this valley, with General
                        Beauregard in the very crisis of the conflict--a failure which, whether
                        resulting from the incompetency of General Patterson, as some charge, or
                        from the inadequacy of his aggressive force, as others represent, is one of
                        which the responsibility must equally rest on the central power which
                        appoints our commanders and directs the operations of the war.</p>
                    <p>The campaign of General McClellan was arrested and frustrated by the
                        incursion of General Jackson into this valley in the latter part of May,
                        1862, compelling the abrupt retreat of General Banks, throwing our military
                        authorities here into a most abject panic, and preventing the contemplated
                        junction of General McDowell with General McClellan by the Fredericksburg
                        railroad--he being diverted from this line of march to engage in what he
                        knew to be the impossible chase of Jackson; and Jackson, in the meantime,
                        after distracting all our combinations, succeeded in hurling his whole
                        column against General McClellan's forces around Richmond at the very moment
                        when our military authorities, relying on the reports of General Fremont
                        after the battle of Cross Keys on the 8th of June, supposed him still to be
                        detained in the valley by the threatening presence of that officer.</p>
                    <p>Then came the brief campaign of General Pope, in which, after having his
                        flank repeatedly turned and his communication with Washington broken by an
                        attack in his rear, he was badly repulsed, and driven into the defenses of
                        Washington, while the enemy, with leisurely composure, turned from the
                        pursuit of his broken and mishandled forces to proceed through this same
                        valley, and make the formidable irruption into Maryland which was repelled
                        by General McClellan in the battle of Antietam on the 17th of September,
                        1862.</p>
                    <p>We need not pause to describe the disgraceful events which preceded the
                        occupation of Winchester by the enemy at this time, or which attended the
                        surrender of Harper's Ferry--results all due to the incapacity which placed
                        incompetent officers in important positions; and which, in the case of
                        Harper's Ferry was made double conspicuous on this occasion by the retention
                        of Colonel Miles at that post, under orders from General Halleck, after the
                        military availibility [sic] of the position was entirely neutralized by the
                        turn which events had taken. Official incapacity in
                            Washington, thus combined with military incompetency at the post, to
                            erect anew at the entrance of this valley, the caudine forks of an
                            unspeakable humiliation, which largely modified the exultation justly
                            produced by the victory of Antietam, and which, in all generous minds,
                            was intensified by the attempt to throw on General McClellan the
                            responsibility for the untoward events which he had the sagacity to
                            foresee, but not the power to prevent after his advice in the premises
                            had been contemned by the general-in-chief.</p>
                    <p>And next, in the summer of 1863, more than a month after the disaster of
                        Chancellorsville under General Hooker, the confederate commander proceeded
                        to project a new invasion of the north, via this same valley of the
                        Shenandoah. From a failure on the part of our military authorities to occupy
                        in this quarter the proper points of observation, and from their failure to
                        place in the positions actually occupied the requisite military talent and
                        skill, the country was again called to blush at the disgraceful stampede of
                        Milroy which preceeded the irruption of the enemy into Maryland. Winchester
                        was evacuated with John Gilpin speed; and eighteen field-pieces, five
                        thousand five hundred muskets, and a large quantity of ammunition were left
                        behind by the fugitives--a valuable gift to the invading enemy.</p>
                    <p>After such repeated experience of the military relations held by this valley
                        to the safety of Washington and to the success of the impending operations
                        against Richmond, it might have been supposed that military directors, with
                        as little perspicacity as ours have shown themselves to possess, would not
                        for the fourth time permit mismanagement in this valley to lay a stone of
                        stumbling and rock of offense in the way of the campaign. And yet the illustration we have just had of the want of
                            forecast which has been signalized by the conduct of the war in this
                            quarter surpasses in its proportions anything we have yet been called to
                            witness. Let us analyze the elements of the invasion which has
                        just ended in the raising of "siege of Washington."</p>
                    <p>It is obvious to the most unmilitary mind that in order to guard the side
                        approach to Washington via the Shenandoah valley, a post of observation
                        should be selected at such a point in or near the valley as shall enable the
                        force which occupies it to discern the approach of danger in time to guard
                        against the descent of the blow and to calculate its probable weight
                        wherever it may fall. Before starting out on the
                            campaign against Richmond, in the spring of 1862, General McClellan was
                            careful to take precaution on this score. Under date of March 16, in
                            that year, he wrote to General Banks (who had been selected to watch the
                            valley) as follows:</p>
                    <p>Your first care will be the rebuilding of the railway from Washington to
                        Manassas and to Strasburg, in order to open your communication with the
                        valley of the Shenandoah. As soon as the Manassas Gap Railway is in running
                        order, intrench a brigade of infantry, say four regiments, with two
                        batteries, at or near the point where the railway cros[s]es the Shenandoah.
                        Something like two regiments of cavalry should be left in that vicinity to
                        occupy Winchester, and thoroughly scour the country south of the railway and
                        up the Shenandoah valley, as well as through Chester gap, which might
                        perhaps be advantageously occupied by a detachment of infantry, well
                        intrenched. Block houses should be built at all the railway bridges. Occupy
                        by grand guards Warrenton junction and Warrenton itself, and also some
                        little more advanced points on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, as soon
                        as the railway bridge is repaired.</p>
                    <p>Great activity should be observed by the cavalry. Besides the two regiments
                        at Manasses, another regiment of cavalry will be at your disposal, to scout
                        toward the Occoquan, and probably a fourth toward Leesburg.</p>
                    <p>To recapitulate the most important points which should engage your attention
                        are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. A strong force, well intrenched, in the vicinity of Manassus, perhaps even
                        Centreville, and another force (a brigade), also well intrenched, near
                        Strasburg.</p>
                    <p>2. Block-houses at the railway bridges.</p>
                    <p>3. Constant employment of the cavalry well to the front.</p>
                    <p>4. Grand guards to Warrenton junction, and in advance as far as the
                        Rappahannock, if possible.</p>
                    <p>5. Great care to be exercised to obtain full and early information as to the
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>6. The general object is to cover the line of the Potomac and Washington.</p>
                    <p>We all know how these prudential arrangements of General
                            McClellan were broken up by the military powers which undertook the
                            direction of the war after he had been removed from his previous control
                            of its operations. And since that date these prudential measures as
                            respects the Shenandoah Valley, have never been re-established, for no
                            other reason, as far as we can perceive, than that to re-establish them
                            might be construed by somebody into a tribute to General McClellan's
                            military sagacity in selecting a point of observation like
                        Chester Gap, midway on the eastern border of the valley, where the approach
                        of danger would be perceived in time to meet and check it at Harper's Ferry,
                        instead of some point on the Upper Potomac, where with such officers as the
                        military administration habitually stations there, the approach of danger is
                        known to the country only by a stampede of our forces from Winchester,
                        Williamsport, or Harper's Ferry, and by a panic of the authorities at
                        Washington, who, knowing nothing with regard to the movements or magnitude
                        of the invading forces, fall an easy prey to every idle and vagrant rumor
                        which vexes the the [sic] atmosphere in a time of alarm and uncertainty. The
                        unknown is always portentious [sic]. In the absence of the definite
                        configurations revealed to the mind by assured knowledge, the startled
                        imagination, while blindly groping in the dark, peoples all space with
                        "gorgons, hydras, and chimeras dire." Even so brave a heart as that of King
                        Richard, in the play of our great dramatist, was appalled by "shadows," as
                        he exclaims:</p>
                    <p>"By the Apostle Paul, shadows to-night <br>Have struck more terror to the
                        soul of Richard <br>Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
                        <br>Armed in proof."</p>
                    <p>And so, during the last few days, we have seen the
                            administration starting at specters, uttering panic cries of alarm, and
                            with its hands palsied by imaginary terrors, simply because it had
                            neglected to take the most ordinary precautions for properly watching
                            and occluding the Shenandoah valley. Incompetent officers have
                        been stationed at points actually occupied, and points which should have
                        been occupied for purposes of observation have been left without any guard
                        whatever. Military incompetence on the Upper Potomac has been reinforced by
                        military incompetence in Baltimore, as illustrated by Major General Lew.
                        Wallace, who is retained in command just long enough to lose the battle of
                        Monocacy, and then superseded by a capable officer in the field, while he is
                        needlessly retained in command of the department, as, if only to multiply
                        the chances of confusion by the possible intrusion of his alacrity for
                        blundering, and that too when it is no secret that in his "civil capacity"
                        he has, by his illegal proceedings, brought down on his head, as we
                        understand, the gravest censure of the Attorney-General of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>What wonder that under such an administration of
                        our military affairs a paltry squadron of two or three hundred bold riders
                        can with entire impunity, cut railroads between Harrisburg and Baltimore,
                        and Baltimore and Philadelphia; or that a mere squad of ten men can approach
                        within four miles of a city containing two hundred thousand inhabitants,
                        garrisoned by twenty thousand men, and burn at their leisure the mansion of
                        the Governor of Maryland; or that five hundred men should, by simply sitting
                        down before one of the forts of Washington and establishing a weak skirmish
                        line, succeed in placing the capital of the nation under siege, cutting its
                        telegraphic communications with Baltimore, burning the house of a cabinet
                        minister within six miles of the city, and reducing the government to the
                        necessity of relying on river and sea navigations for its connections with
                        the great North? And all this, be it remembered happens in the fourth year
                        of the war, with men by hundreds of thousands under arms!</p>
                    <p>And now we ask, the whole nation will ask, who is
                            responsible for such humiliation? Is it the President, the
                        Secretary of War, the chief of staff, or can it be that our military affairs
                        are still left at such loose ends (as we know them to have been before) that
                        sometimes one and sometimes the other of these functionaries assumes to
                        exercise the direction of the war, selects the points of military
                        occupation, and assigns the officers to their several commands? In the
                        uncertainty resting on this subject we think there is no doubt about one
                        thing, and that is, that if the President cannot discover and correct the
                        source of these blunders, the people in the approaching election will not be
                        slow to discover one method by which they can put an end to this reign of
                        military incompetence in Washington, No respect for the President's "honesty
                        of purpose" and no admiration for the purity, intelligence, and
                        administrative skill which they may recognize in the other executive
                        departments of the government, will stand in the way of ridding the War
                        Department of the incubus which now visibly rests on it under its present
                        management--making it a shame and a reproach to the nation. And in so saying
                        we intend no particular personal allusion to Mr. Stanton, for we do not know
                        to-day that he is responsible for these things. It may be that he confines
                        himself strictly to the civil details of his office, and does not meddle in
                        the matters which somebody under him or above him brings to such confusion.
                        But we do know that somebody is responsible for the late
                            gross malfeasance, which must ever stand in our military annals as a
                            national disgrace, so long as posterity shall revert to the time when
                            five hundred men laid Washington siege, for two days with ten or twenty
                            thousand men behind its defenses! Such is the penalty which a
                        nation pays for being ruled in any department by its ignorance rather than
                        its intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Nor does the evil end with the disappearance of the last fright. Who, after
                        such an exhibition of military incompetence in our counsels, can repose any
                        confidence in the military administration so long as it shall remain subject
                        to its present directors? What security can any man feel when the watchmen
                        from the walls of our national capital lift up their voices only to expose
                        their own ignorance of the nature and extent of the peril from which they
                        call the people to save them? What governor of what state will be prompt
                        hereafter to respond to the tap of the drum in Washington if its alarms are
                        beaten with most vehemence when there is the least known about the necessity
                        for disturbing the country? An immense clamor has been raised without cause
                        during the last few days. Who is sure that while the conditions of our
                        ignorance remain as they are, the next clamor may not come with cause, and
                        find the War Department as little prepared to meet real danger as it has
                        proved little prepared to face an imaginary one? Let all loyal people lay
                        these things to heart, but above all and first of all, let the President of
                        the United States be assured that for these things his countrymen will hold
                        him to a strict account, and that they will exact full atonement for the
                        great indignity which the nation has just suffered in the eyes of the world.</p>
                    <p>The president, we know, is ambitious to earn not only the good opinions of
                        his fellow citizens, but also to receive their voices at the next election.
                            If he would receive them he must be careful to
                            deserve them; and if he should in this way vindicate his claim to
                        the renewed confidence of the country, we are sure that we could sincerely
                        rejoice in his success, not from any interest we take in his personal
                        fortunes any more than in those of any other men of any other party, but
                        because we desire the best welfare of the republic in this day, when she
                        requires the highest statesmanship and the most exalted capacity to conduct
                        a wise conclusion the affairs of the state. His merits and his pretensions
                        are now trembling in the balance, held by the hands of a confiding and much
                        enduring people, who have continued long to hope against hope under the
                        military misrule of which they are only too painfully conscious, but to the
                        patient endurance of which there is a limit set, equally by physical
                        necessity and political prudence. The protraction of the war, long drawn out
                        by divided military counsels, by injudicious civil policies, and by
                        incompetent officers in the field, is seen by every body to be the precursor
                        either of a disunion peace (rendered a physical necessity by the military
                        imbecility which is breaking down the giant strength of the country) or of a
                        change in the administration which shall at least afford to the people one
                        last hope of saving the country, where, if things remain as they are, there
                        is now none. If the President does not apply a corrective, at once timely
                        and radical, to the evils of which the loyal States complain with just
                        reason, they will not hesitate to apply the only corrective which lies
                        within their reach, through the ballot-box.</p>
                    <p>We do not so write under any inspirations of passion or partisanship. We have
                        used earnest words because the times called for them. We suppress even the
                        utterance of that indignation which we feel it would be righteous to cherish
                        in view of the recent abuse of the confidence reposed by the people in their
                        civil rulers. We speak simply as to wise men. Let wise men judge what we
                        say, and we abide their verdict, in the full assurance that they will
                        pronounce us to have spoken words of truth and soberness, in a day when
                        paltering and levity, whether in office or out of office, are certainly out
                        of place.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It seems to be the settled purpose of the Administration to fight out this
                        war on the Abolition line if it takes the last man and the last dollar, and
                        results in the utter exhaustion and ruin of the country. They seem to be
                        totally unconscious of the fact that there will be no country worth saving
                        after the last man and the last dollar have been sacrificed. We have now
                        reached a point in the prosecution of this horrid war when it becomes our
                        solemn duty to pause and consider whither we are drifting. We should
                        seriously inquire what is to be the end of this immense sacrifice of life
                        and treasure? Is it a restored Union with the institutions of our fathers
                        preserved intact? or an empoverished [sic], desolated, ruined country, with
                        the Constitution and Government of our fathers crushed beneath the iron heel
                        of a military despotism? Is a successful termination of the war, according
                        to its original purpose, still within the range of possibility? If not, then
                        every life lost in its further prosecution, is simply murder; and the call
                        of the President for five hundred thousand more men is simply a demand for
                        so many more victims to be offered up as sacrifices to appease the demon of
                        Abolitionism.</p>
                    <p>Judging from the light of events which have transpired during the past three
                        years, we can see no reasonable ground of hope for a successful termination
                        of the war, prosecuted on the policy and for the purpose it now is. How any
                        man, whose brain has not been completely turned by the madness of
                        fanaticism, can believe otherwise is a mystery to us. We believe there was a
                        time when the war could have been honorably closed and the Union restored to
                        its integrity, but that time has certainly gone by. Two opportunities have
                        presented themselves since the commencement of hostilities for bringing the
                        war to a successful issue; but both were lost through the incapacity and
                        intrigues of the administration. A victory at the first battle of Bull Run,
                        or the capture of Bichmond [sic], by McClellan, in the summer of 1862, in
                        our opinion would have accomplished the desired result.</p>
                    <p>The battle of Bull Run was prematurely fought, against the military judgment
                        of the Commander-in-chief, to silence the "on to Richmond" clamor of the
                        radical abolitionists; and the Peninsular campaign failed through the
                        political intrigues and jealousies of the imbeciles and fanatics at
                        Washington, and because the administration preferred failure to success
                        achieved under the leadership of a General who refused to worship at the
                        altar of abolitionism. A victory over the rebel forces in the early part of
                        the war, as at the time of the battle of Bull Run, before their government
                        was compactly organized and when everything was at loose ends yet, would
                        have demoralized their cause and broken up their confederacy at once. And a
                        blow so powerful as the capture of the rebel capital in the summer of 1862
                        would have gone very far towards winding up the rebellion. Since then
                        however the rebellion, instead of growing weaker has been growing stronger.
                        The fanatical war policy of the Washington dynasty has united the southern
                        people as one man. The Government of the Confederate States by successfully
                        waging a defensive warfare of gigantic proportions for over three years, has
                        steadily acquired organization and stability at home and prestige abroad.</p>
                    <p>If then we were unable to suppress the rebellion when it was comparatively
                        weak and unorganized, what ground of hope is there to accomplish it after it
                        has become thoroughly organized and had time to develope [sic] its resources
                        and strengthen its power? None whatever. The war is a total and complete
                        failure, and the sooner the people realize the fact the better.</p>
