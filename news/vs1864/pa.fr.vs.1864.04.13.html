<b>The Presidential Struggle</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gives reasons why the Democrats will not bow to Republican pressure to stay out of the
     next Presidential race.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The last issue of the Repository contained a rather lengthy
      editorial under the above caption, the pith of which was, that the Democracy ought not to
      contest the election this year with the Republicans, for the reason that it might result in
      such a division of the electoral college as to prevent a choice by the people, thus throwing
      the election into the House, where neither candidate could receive a majority of the States,
      as required by the Constitution, and hence "the Government would be brought into inextricable
      chaos!" This is certainly a modest suggestion, to say the least of
      it, and shows a commendable solicitude on the part of the astute editor for the welfare of the
      "Government."</p>
     <p>It would, doubtless, be very agreeable to the cormorants and public plunderers, who have
      been fattening on the life-blood of the nation, to have a clear field to a new lease of four
      years of power and plunder; but we scarcely think the Democracy will be able to see it in that
      light. We are rather inclined to the opinion that they will contest every inch of ground in
      making another noble and patriotic effort to rescue the country from the hands of fanatics and
      traitors who have well nigh ruined it, and bring the Government back to the principles of our
      fathers. They may fail--they may be overpowered by the minions of an arbitrary and corrupt
      administration, which, judging from the past, will, undoubtedly, use its immense power and
      patronage to overthrow the freedom of the ballot and subvert the liberties of the people--but
      they will make the effort, nevertheless; and, if fall they must, they will go down with their
      armor on. Indeed, even admitting that all the grave consequences spoken of by the Repository would follow a presidential contest making the withdrawal of
      one of the parties necessary to avert them, we can see no good reason why that party should be
      the Democracy. On the other hand, we might be able to show very good reasons why the
      Republican party should withdraw on that ground. They have been in power but three short
      years, yet, in that time, they have almost hopelessly ruined the country. They have drenched
      the land in fraternal blood and brought sorrow and mourning into almost every family. They
      have bankrupted the Treasury and piled up a debt mountain high which future generations yet
      unborn will never see paid. And it is the opinion of many, that the sooner they resign the
      Government into abler and wiser hands, the better will it be for the country. Therefore, as
      the editor of the Repository seems to apprehend such serious
      consequences from a division of the electoral vote, and as the Democracy will not withdraw, we suggest that the Republican party withdraw, and that
       he use his influence, as a leader of his party, to that end. Here
      is an opportunity for the display of an unselfish patriotism which seldom offers. We trust our
      neighbor will properly improve it, thereby "showing his faith by his works."</p>

     <p>The One Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania regiment, Colonel McCoy commanding, arrived at
      Harrisburg on Sunday, the 3d inst. having been furloughed for the purpose of recruiting. This
      regiment went into the service about one thousand strong, participated in some of the most
      important and warmly contested battles of the war, and returned with only two hundred and
      twenty five men. No regiment has seen harder service or acquitted itself more creditably.
      Several companies of this regiment were recruited in this place by captains A.J. Brand and
      John T. Dick. The regiment was originally commanded by Col. Zeigle with R.W. McAllen as Lieut.
      Colonel. We hope the brave boys may enjoy their furloughs. All the men speak in the highest
      terms of Colonel McCoy, and with such a chivalrous and popular leader, there will be no
      difficulty in soon recruiting the regiment up to the required standard.</p>
