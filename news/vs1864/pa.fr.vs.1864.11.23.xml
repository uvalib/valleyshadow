                    well skilled in the use of arms, drilled, disciplined and to the extent of his
                    capability, a soldier.--Flushed with the importance accorded to him, and backed
                    by a large political party, he will demand at least political equality with
                    white man, and a right to participate in the selection of our rulers."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Abolition journals are much exercised at the proposition, contained in
                        the message of Jeff Davis to the rebel Congress, to arm the slaves and
                        employ them in their armies. They are surprised too, that Democratic editors
                        do not condemn the proposition, inasmuch as they were so shocked at the same
                        conduct in the United States government. In reply to this we would say, that
                        we are not responsible for the acts of the rebels; for those of our own
                        government, to a certain extent, we are, and therefore we condemned without
                        stint the placing of these poor devils in the arm to be shot down like dogs,
                        knowing that they had neither the physical nor the moral courage requisite
                        to make good soldiers, and believing that by their cowardice and
                        inefficiency, they would bring defeat and disgrace upon our arms. There is
                        also another view in which we lamented the employment of the African in our
                        armies, and it is this: The negro at the termination of the war will return
                        home well skilled in the use of arms, drilled, disciplined and to the extent
                        of his capability, a soldler [sic]. Flushed with the importance accorded to
                        him, and backed by a large political party, he will demand at least <emph
                            rend="italic">political</emph> equality with white men, and a right to
                        participate in the selection of our rulers. It is an even question whether
                        or not, with the assistance of his Abolition brethren, he will succeed in
                        the attainment of that right; but whether he does or not, he will become an
                        element of danger to the peace of the country, and perhaps at no distant day
                        we may have the scenes of San Domingo re-enacted here. We are opposed to
                        negro suffrage. We desire to have a <emph rend="italic">white</emph>
                        republic and no pie-bald mixture of black and white.</p>
                    <p>We have said we are not responsible for what the rebels do, and therefore
                        care not to condemn anything they may do in respect to arming their slaves.
                        And besides, we believe that if they carry out the recommendation of
                        [illegible] produce an element of weakness rather than of strength into
                        their army, just as we believe that our own government have already done so
                        by enlisting negroes. The bad deeds of the rebels are not ours. They will
                        probably follow any bad example set by the other portion of this mutual
                        admiration society. The meaner the act of one, the more sure the other is to
                        initiate it, and some of the acts of both would render it difficult to
                        decide which was the meanest. But why are not the Abolitionists shocked at
                        the proposition of the South to arm and free the negroes and give them
                        bounty in land! It seems to us that they ought to stand aghast, at having
                        all their thunder stolen by this act of the rebels. Their dupes were made to
                        believe that this was a war for slavery on the part of the rebels, that the
                        negroes--poor oppressed creatures--were heartily praying for the success of
                        the Abolitionists, and now we find these same rebels voluntarily setting
                        free their slaves, placing arms in their hands and marching them against
                        their would be deliverers. What a spectacle for our abolition friends, to be
                        confronted by men in arms who they fondly hoped were ardently praying for
                        their success. Surely our Abolition brethren are stultified by this act of
                        their co-laborers in the effort to break up the Union. It expunges the hope
                        of ending the war by abolishing slavery, and shows their whole theory to be
                        a delusion; that they have been "barking up the wrong tree" themselves and
                        have misled other people. We can see no other way for it, but that they must
                        return to the policy on which the war was first conducted--a restoration of
                        the Union under the Constitution; as they may easily now perceive that, that
                        "sum of all villainies," slavery, may be virtually abol[ished] and the
                        rebellion as obstinate as ever.</p>
                    <p>We were told by the Abolitionists in the beginning of the war that slavery
                        alone was its cause; we denied stoutly that such was the fact, and
                        attributed it to other causes. Now if the rebels carry out the
                        recommendation of Jefferson I, free their slaves to place them in their
                        armies, slavery being thus virtually abolished, by all the rules of
                        reasoning, the cause being removed, the war ought to cease at once. Every
                        one will admit that the removal of the <emph rend="italic">cause</emph> of
                        physical ills soon restores the body to health and vigor; it is so also with
                        political evils, remove the cause of war and the country will resume its
                        former condition. If the rebels free their slaves without bringing about a
                        return to peace by removing the alledged [sic] cause of the war, it is clear
                        that the Abolitionists were wrong in attributing the rebellion to slavery,
                        and we were right in assigning it to other causes. We were satisfied, at the
                        outset of the rebellion, that the Southern leaders cared less about the
                            <emph rend="italic">Status</emph> of the negro than they did for some
                        other things. Other causes were at work to bring on the collision and we
                        feel assured that in order to attain their ends they will free every
                        able-bodied slave in the South and place him in the army. Slavery, it is
                        true, was a constant subject of agitation; the fugitive slave law was evaded
                        and nullified by the North; the right of the Southern people to carry their
                        slaves into the territories was denied, but the Southern leaders very well
                        knew that secession was no remedy for these grievances, that in the event of
                        a separation the territories were lost to them; the fugitive slave law wiped
                        out, and their escaped slaves lost to them forever. One of the several
                        causes which produced the rebellion was the desire of these men in the South
                        to rule as the Abolitionists are now doing, they feared that the sceptre was
                        about departing from their hands forever and they determined to set up for
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>If the rebels carry out the proposition to arm their negroes it is but
                        following an example set them by the United States government, and if they
                        derive no more advantage from the measure than we have done, we see no
                        reason for alarm on our part.</p>

                    <p>The season of frost and snow is fast approaching. The North wind sweeps over
                        hill and valley and the mountain tops are whitened by the breath of winter.
                        The green fields, beautiful flowers and incense-laden breezes of summer,
                        have given place to the less agreeable attendants of a more rugged season.
                        To many the approach of this season is ever hailed with delight. The merry
                        sleigh ride, the dance, the fireside gathering and those other in-door
                        amusements peculiar to winter, give it a charm which no other season
                        presents, evoking pleasant memories of the past, and causing the heart to
                        throb with delightful anticipations for the future. To others, particularly
                        in this place where our people have experienced the terrible effects of
                        rebel vandalism in the destruction of their homes and property; the advent
                        of winter is looked for with feelings of dread and foreboding. The enormous
                        prices of food, clothing, fuel and all the necessaries of life will place
                        many in straits for the means of subsistence who never before felt the
                        remorseless pinch of want. Many who have heretofore enjoyed all the comforts
                        and even luxuries of life have been divested of their all and rendered
                        comparatively destitute, whilst others, who even in prosperous times found
                        it difficult to provide themselves and families with food and clothing, can
                        see in the coming winter naught but suffering. Grim-visaged war has stalked
                        through the land for four years and left sad traces of its march in many
                        portions of the land. In this town the ruins of once happy homes and
                        desolated hearthstones attest some of its horrors, but the families of those
                        in our midst that war has bereft of their protectors and support, can alone
                        fully appreciate all its miseries. The charity of our citizens is
                        proverbial; they have in past seasons given out of their abundance for the
                        relief of the poor, with a lavish hand; they have contributed to the comfort
                        of our soldiers in the field without stint, and in ordinary times, no one
                        need suffer who would make his wants known. But these are not ordinary
                        times. The number of persons who will become dependent upon the charity of
                        their fellow, may this winter be increased four fold, whilst the ability to
                        relieve their wants has been seriously lessened in consequence of the
                        destruction of the wealth of our most charitable citizens. On those who have
                        escaped the torch of the incendiary and preserved the property which God has
                        given them, must devolve the duty of providing for the relief of the
                        destitute, and we feel assured they will do their whole duty by organizing
                        in advance, associations for the collection of funds, and the distribution
                        of relief to those whose necessities may require it. Without something of
                        the kind is done, God protect the poor from the pinchings of hunger and the
                        bitter blasts of winter.</p>
