                    <p>The result of the elections in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, as well as
                        the recent town vote in Connecticut, settles the question that the political
                        tide is running heavily against the administration.</p>
                    <p>All the gain is on the side of the Democratic party, and now that the current
                        has fairly set in, it will move with accelerated force up to the time the
                        November vote is taken. The present is a good time, therefore, to present
                        some estimates of the probable result in several States when the
                        presidential vote is taken.</p>
                    <p>The whole number of votes in the electoral college (not counting Tennessee or
                        Louisiana,) is two hundred and thirty-one, of which one hundred and sixteen
                        are required to give a clear majority and elect a President. Now, can
                        General McClellan secure one hundred and sixteen votes? We think--nay, we
                        are sure, he can and will; and we give the following estimates as the basis
                        of the faith that is in us:</p>

                    <p>But the administration may put a forcible stop to elections in Missouri,
                        Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware; so it becomes a question whether there are
                        not some other States which will probably vote the Democratic ticket. That
                        there are such will be seen by the following list:</p>

                    <p>It will thus be seen that if Lincoln carries the doubtful Republican, as well
                        as the certain Republican States, he will still fall far short of the needed
                        116 votes.</p>
                    <p>It is easily demonstrable that the same percentage of increase of this fall's
                        vote in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, as compared with last year,
                        will give us all the States in November save those indicated above as being
                        certain for Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>Although in all human probability General McClellan will be honestly elected
                        President on the 8th of November next, still there is so large a margin of
                        doubt, that Democrats cannot afford to consider the matter settled. All
                        hands must turn to and work with a will in the brief three weeks before us.
                        Democratic speakers must be stirring, the conservative presses must multiply
                        their issues. One earnest and determined effort will make the assurance of
                        victory doubly sure.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Mr. Jacob Sweitzer a highly respectable citizen, and a man of the most devout
                        piety, was murdered in the most brutal manner, on Wednesday night last, in
                        this place. The circumstances attending the murder, so far as we could
                        ascertain them, are about as follows: On the night of the murder a squad of
                        cavalrymen made an attack on Mr. Sweitzer's house demanding admittance and
                        alleging that he was a bounty-jumper &amp;c., being a mere pretext to
                        get into the house. Mr. Sweitzer ordered them away when they drew up in
                        front of his house and presenting their carbines threatened to fire into the
                        windows. Mr. Sweitzer then left his house and went a few doors off to the
                        house of a neighbor to get him to come to his protection. Whilst standing at
                        the door of his neighbor's house he was struck a tremendous blow on the back
                        part of the head by some heavy weapon, and felled to the earth dying almost
                        instantly. The cavalrymen who were around the body were arrested, and before
                        the Coroner's jury made such contradictory statements, together with some
                        other evidence that appeared to implicate them, that the jury seemed
                        warranted in authorizing their commitment to stand their trial for the
                        murder.</p>
