<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article calls upon William Milnes to announce his candidacy for
                    Congress. Although Milnes has publicly declined to run for the seat, suggesting
                    people do not know him well enough, the author says Milnes's reputation far
                    exceeds personal acquaintance among the citizenry. In the name of the people,
                    the article states, Milnes must "express his willingness to serve them."
                    Otherwise, a Radical will surely capture the seat.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>With the present Candidates for Congress in the field in the district, it is
                        scarcely possible to prevent the election of a Radical. Some of the
                        Candidates can and some can not take the required oath. The two most
                        prominent ones, who are likely to receive the largest number of votes, will
                        be necessitated to have their disabilities removed before they can take
                        their seat if elected. In a contested election between either one and a
                        radical, (and we learn a radical is to be voted for,) no matter how few
                        votes he may receive, there can be little doubt as to the result. Congress,
                        with its radical majority would scarcely be likely to remove disabilities
                        from any one in order that he might take a seat, when one of their own party
                        is ready to their hand who can take the oath.</p>
                    <p>This is the case, as it stands at the present, but need not exist, had Mr.
                        Wm. Milnes, of Page, who is the choice of the people of this District
                        announced himself. This he has declined to do, though repeatedly called
                        upon, on the ground, as we learn, that being a stranger to the people,
                        except in his immediate proximity, he could not be their choice.</p>
                    <p> We have but a few words to say on this subject, but we hope sufficient to
                        induce him to place himself in nomination. Mr. Milnes, though personally a
                        stranger to the people of this and the more Southern Counties of the
                        District, is generally well known to all by reputation. They know that he
                        has large interests in our midst, a guarantee that can not be passed by with
                        impunity. They have heard time and again of his conservatism, sound sense
                        and worth as a man, which has been so long practically demonstrated in his
                        immediate neighborhood, until he has become really their choice. They know
                        that he came among us to build up, not to destroy, and they want his
                        services in a more enlarged field. They are not personally acquainted with
                        him, and on this account alone feel a reluctance in demanding his services.
                        But were he willing to serve them, he would receive the almost undivided
                        vote of Botetourt, Rockbridge and Augusta to start with. We speak what we
                        have the best reasons for believing true, when we say that Mr. Milnes, is the choice of the district, and that, if he
                        supposes the desire for his announcement as a Candidate for Congress is
                        confined to his neighbors, he is greatly mistaken. </p>
                    <p>The people of the District believe he can do a great deal of good for us, and
                        knowing that he can take his seat and that his interests are largely
                        identified with our own, prefer him to any man who can be nominated.</p>
                    <p>Satisfied that he is really and truly the choice of the people of the
                        district and that it is only necessary for a gentleman of Mr. Milnes'
                        enlarged views to be satisfied of the fact to allow his name to be used, we
                        take the liberty of placing his name forward as our Candidate for Congress.
                        We call upon our contemporaries in the Valley to run up his name at once and
                        gratify the wishes of the people.</p>
                    <p>No time is to be lost and we therefore, in the name of the people, call upon
                        Mr. Milnes to publicly express his willingness to serve them.</p>

                    While the author comments that they may not be the candidates that suited the

                        following ticket for the Senate and House of Delegates was nominated:</p>
                    <p>For the Senate:  Jos. A. Waddell. </p>
                    <p>For the House of Delegates:  H.M. Bell and

                    <p>The ticket may not be in exact accordance with the wishes of each and every
                        voter, for that were impossible. It, is however, the one selected upon which
                        to concentrate the Conservative voters of the County. The gentlemen are all
                        well known and to the manor born. Their interests are identified with the
                        interests of the people of Augusta. Although some may have preferences for
                        others as representatives, yet it would be folly to vote our special
                        preferences and thereby increase the chances of, if not secure the election
                        of a Radical ticket from this county.</p>
                    <p>We therefore advise one and all to unite as one man on this ticket. The
                        Legislature we want and the Legislature we must have. Be wise then and vote
                        to secure it.</p>
