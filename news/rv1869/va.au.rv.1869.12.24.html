<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper updates readers on Virginia's possible re-admission to the Union.
                    The article asserts that Georgia's expulsion of African American law-makers from
                    the legislature and a stream of "carpet baggers" speaking out against
                    readmission have hurt the state's chances.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The subject of Virginia Reconstruction still hangs fire in Congress. Virginia
                        has taken every step required by the Reconstruction Acts, but yet among some
                        of the out and out Radicals this is not considered sufficient, and other
                        guarantees are demanded. The case of Georgia, in regard to her expulsion of
                        the negro member of her Legislature, is taken as the ground for opposition
                        to the early reconstruction of Virginia. The Reconstruction Committee have
                        been harangued by a number of Carpet-baggers, who are opposed to the early
                        admission of the State, whose positions will be vacated by such course, and
                        who exhibit "the spoils" as the great reason of their opposition. Many of
                        those who came here after the war and who held offices and now hold offices,
                        are, however, earnest advocates of Virginia's early admission, without
                        further requirements or conditions. Some of these have appeared also before
                        the Reconstruction Committee and have successfully answered all the
                        objections raised by those opposed to early reconstruction, yet, from the
                        proceedings of the Reconstruction Committee on Saturday last it is certain
                        that any definite action will not be taken in the case of Virginia until
                        after the holidays.</p>

<b>The Negro Exodus from Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that large numbers of African Americans are leaving
                    Virginia for the South in search of better wages. The article asserts that this
                    will lead to the replacement of black labor with white labor on small farms.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The fact that the negroes in droves are leaving every part of Virginia at
                        this time for the inviting cotton fields, is attracting much attention at
                        the North, and many are the speculations in regard to it. The New York Herald says:</p>
                    <p>The negroes appear to be leaving Virginia in shoals for the cotton
                        plantations of Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, where they are sure of
                        better wages and a warmer climate than they have in the "Old Dominion." In
                        Richmond, for instance, a labor agent advertises for negroes by thousands to
                        go South at from fifteen dollars to twenty-two dollars and fifty cents per
                        month. Before the war the sales of "Virginny niggers" for the cotton States
                        amounted in Richmond to about twenty millions of dollars a year. The present
                        demand from the cotton planters for these Virginia field hands is but the
                        revival of the old one in a new shape. Under the old slavery demand the
                        Virginia master sold to the trader "a few niggers?" from year to year to
                        make both ends meet. Under the new voluntary freedom and free labor system
                        whole families and colonies of these Virginia plantation blacks are moving
                        South. The end will probably be the disappearance of the black population
                        from the State and its replacement by white labor. This will involve the
                        cutting up of the large plantations into small farms for Germans, Danish,
                        Norwegian, English, Welsh, Irish, and Yankee settlers--a transformation
                        which will double the value of every acre of land in the State within the
                        next ten or fifteen years.</p>
