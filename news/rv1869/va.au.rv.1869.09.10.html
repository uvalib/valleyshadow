<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper applauds the decision of Attorney General Hoar to allow the
                    Virginia Legislature to meet without requiring all members to take the
                    test-oath.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The test-oath agony is, at last, over in this State. The opinion of Attorney
                        General Hoar, published elsewhere in this issue, gives a final quietus to
                        it. He decides that the test-oath cannot be required of the members elect to
                        the Legislature, but that they must be allowed to meet to carry out the
                        provision of the reconstruction acts--viz: the ratification of the Fifteenth
                        Amendment.</p>
                    <p>This far they can proceed under the reconstruction acts, but further they
                        cannot go, as they are only Legislators, in the event Congress approves the
                        Constitution and admits the State.</p>
                    <p>To simply meet to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment, is only carrying out the
                        reconstruction acts, and does not require the members elect to subscribe to
                        the test-oath, but to attempt any legislation, until Congress approves the
                        constitution and admits the State places them in the attitude of acting
                        under the provisional Government and would require the test-oath at their
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>This is more than we expected and for which we are thankful. For our
                        Legislature to meet is something, and in these
                        days of arbitrary rule we are exceedingly thankful for small favors. It is a
                        step to the restoration of Virginia to her rights. The manner, the forced
                        ratification of the XVth Amendment, we can never consider as just, but as
                        the majority in these days are for expediency, we can only demur and trust
                        the end, in this instance, may justify the
                    means.</p>
                <br>
