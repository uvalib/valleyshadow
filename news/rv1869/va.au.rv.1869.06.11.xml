     <p>We have endeavored to impress upon all who have failed to register heretofore to come
      forward and register when the lists are opened, which will be on Monday next--This is an
      imperative duty, and on this subject we have a little more to add previous to the re-opening
      of the registration lists. This we propose to do through means of figures collated by our
      contemporary of the <emph rend="italic">Page Valley Courier</emph>.</p>
     <p>From the Registration report of 1867 he gets the following figures:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell>Whites registered</cell>
       <cell>120,101</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Negroes registered</cell>
       <cell>105,832</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Total</cell>
       <cell>225,933</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>White majority</cell>
       <cell>14,269</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>The White votes for the Convention were 14,835. Among those were some Conservatives who were
      anxious for restoration and thought the Convention the best means of securing this. There is
      no doubt that the white Radicals all voted for the Convention. Since that time the number of
      those in the State affiliate with the Radical party has increased, as we all know. Assuming
      then that this 14,835 represents the white Radical strength at the first registration, the
      following is the strength of the Radical party:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell>White radical</cell>
       <cell>14,835</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Negro radical</cell>
       <cell>105,832</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Full radical strength</cell>
       <cell>120,667</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>Deducting the assumed white radical strength from the registered whites, and we have the
      following result:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell>Registered whites</cell>
       <cell>120,101</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>White radical strength</cell>
       <cell>14,835</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>White conservative strength</cell>
       <cell>105,266</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>Comparing the respective strength of the two parties, as above estimated, we get the
      following result:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell>Full radical strength</cell>
       <cell>120,667</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Full conservative strength</cell>
       <cell>105,266</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Radical majority</cell>
       <cell>15,401</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>Many whites failed to register and Gen. Schofield said, "judging from the tax list and other
      data the number of whites who failed to register in Virginia is 16,343."</p>
     <p>Assuming this correct and supposing they were all Conservatives, by adding this to the
      Conservative strength above, we get the total Conservative strength as follows:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell>Whites failed to register</cell>
       <cell>16,343</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Full conservative strength</cell>
       <cell>105,266</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Total conservative strength</cell>
       <cell>121,609</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>Then comparing the total Conservative and Radical strength we get the following result:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell>Total conservative strength</cell>
       <cell>121,609</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Total Radical strength</cell>
       <cell>120,667</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell>Conservative majority</cell>
       <cell>942</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>It will thus be seen that the registration of every man who has heretofore failed to
      register is essential to this calculation, the consideration of which must stimulate every man
      who values the future welfare of this State and people to see that all, who can, come forward
      and register. It plainly shows to every man who has hitherto failed to register that the onus
      of turning over the control of this state to an ignorant and irresponsible multitude will lie
      at his door, if he continues to fail to register. It virtually exhausts the argument on the
      subject of registration and deaf indeed to the appeals of duty must be the man who could fail
      longer to place himself in the position of a voter, by coming forward and registering. Callous
      indeed must be those who are registered, if they exert not themselves to secure a full
      registration. The times are threatening and every man must do his duty.</p>
     <p>The Summary given above does not include those whites who have arrived at majority and those
      conservatives who have settled among us since 1867, which, deducting the blacks, who have
      reached the age of 21 since 1867, (which must be less,) would increase, to some extent, the
      conservative majority.</p>
     <p>From this exhibit it will be seen that it is absolutely necessary for those who have
      registered to vote, and at the same time see that their neighbors are all registered and that
      they vote also. The entire conservative strength must be brought out, if we would rid the
      state of the abominations sought to be imposed upon her. Every man must do his whole duty.
      False indeed, to his people to posterity, is he who falters in this the hour of Virginia's
      direst need.</p>

    <head>Synopsis of General Canby's General Orders No. 61, Concerning Registration and Elections</head>
    <origin/>
    <commentary/>
    <transcript>
     <p>The election will be held on the 6th day of July, 1869. The polls will be opened at sunrise
      and close at sunset, and will be kept open during these hours without intermission or
      adjournment: <emph rend="italic">Provided</emph>, That if the commissioners should consider it
      necessary, and if the electors who appear cannot be polled between sunrise and sunset, the
      polls may then be kept open till 10 P.M.</p>
     <p>No man who is a candidate can act as a member of the board of registration.</p>
     <p>Persons who have heretofore registered are not required to register. But the board of
      registration have power to strike from their lists those who have heretofore improperly
      registered, upon being satisfied that the person was not entitled to register. (It would be
      well for those who have heretofore registered to be on the lookout to see that their names are
      not improperly stricken from the registration lists.)</p>
     <p>The board of registration have power to add to such lists the names of persons who between
      the 14th and 24th of June, 1869, possess the qualifications required by the acts of Congress,
      and who have not already registered At the close of the registration a list of the names that
      have been added during the revision, will be posted in at least three public places in the
      registration precincts. <emph rend="italic">Five days</emph> thereafter a second session of
      the board will be held and continued for <emph rend="italic">two days</emph>, for the purpose
      of reviewing the evidence and deciding upon questions of challenge and other doubtful cases,
      and preparing copies of the lists for the commissioners of election. <emph rend="italic">No
       new names</emph> will be added at this session of the board of Registration, <emph
       rend="italic">unless</emph> it be shown to the satisfaction of the board that by reason of
      sickness or other unavoidable cause, the applicant was prevented from attending at the proper
      time.--Any duly registered voter, who has removed or is about to remove, permanently from the
      precinct in which he was originally registered, can, on application, obtain a certificate of
      the fact, and have his name erased from the original registration list, and on presenting the
      said certificate to the board of the precinct of his new residence at any time within the
      period commencing the 14th day of June and ending the 24th of June, 1869, he will be entitled
      to have his name entered in the list of registered voters for the said precinct.</p>
     <p><emph rend="italic">Where the change of residence is only from one district to another of
       the same county:</emph> In such cases during the <emph rend="italic">revision</emph> of <emph
       rend="italic">registration</emph> a certificate should be applied for to the board of
      registration for the district. If they shall find the applicant was registered, they shall
      strike his name from the list of the precinct for the district of his new residence. [Where
      precincts have lately been re-established, it is necessary that all heretofore registered and
      who vote at re-established precincts, see that their names are placed upon the lists at these
      precincts.]</p>
     <p>Where the change of residence is from one county or city to another county or city, the name
      and full description will be certified to by the board of registration for the district in
      which the person applying for the change <emph rend="italic">first registered</emph>, to the
      board of registration for the district to which he has removed. Such certificate shall be held
      as sufficient evidence when presented to the board of registration for the district to which
      the person has removed, that he is entitled to vote in that district, and if prevented during
      the revision of registration, the name of such person shall be added to the registration lists
      of the precinct of his new residence.</p>
     <p>Any duly registered voter of the State will be allowed to vote in any district upon
      presentation of his certificate of registration, accompanied by his affidavit that he has
      resided in said district at least ten days preceding the day of election, and that he has not
      already voted at this election. In <emph rend="italic">default</emph> of the certificate of
      registration, the affidavit of the voter must set forth the fact that he was duly registered,
      and the name of the county and precinct in which he was registered. In <emph rend="italic"
       >doubtful cases</emph> the registrars or commissioners of election shall require such
      additional evidence as may be necessary to satisfy them that the applicant is entitled to vote
      under the provisions of the first section of the act of February, 1868.</p>
     <p>Except as above provided, all registered voters will vote at the polling places that have
      been or may be established within the precincts in which they were registered.</p>
     <p>All persons entitled to register, and who have not previously registered, must apply for
      registration between the 14th and 24th day of June, 1869, to the board of registration of
      their district.</p>
     <p>To prevent the registration of any person not entitled to vote, <emph rend="italic">two
       white and two colored persons</emph>, who must be registered voters of the district, shall be
      selected by the board of registration to challenge the right of any person to be registered
      who, in the opinion of the person challenging, is disqualified as a voter by reason of any of
      the causes set forth in the reconstruction acts of Congress.--Upon such challenge being made,
      the board of registration shall examine the person presenting himself for registration with
      reference to each cause of disqualification alleged, and evidence shall be taken if offered,
      to sustain or disprove the challenge.</p>
     <p>The vote will be taken by ballot. No names, numbers, or marks(by which the vote may be
      disclosed) will be placed on the outside of any ballot; when the voter offers to vote, he
      shall announce his name, and if he is registered, one of the commissioners will receive the
      ballot or ballots without opening them, or allowing them to be opened or examined, and will
      deposit them in the ballot box, the name of the voter shall then be entered by each clerk in
      the poll list under his charge. No ballots will be received from persons who have not been
      properly registered, except in cases where the name of the person applying to vote has been
      incorrectly recorded on the registration lists, in which case, if the officer conducting the
      election is satisfied, either from his personal knowledge, or from the testimony of credible
      witnesses, that the person was actually registered, then his vote shall be received and his
      name entered on the poll list, and checked on the registration list.</p>
     <p>Registration is evidence of the right to vote--challenges at the polls are allowed only so
      far as may be necessary to prevent repeating or <sic>fraudlent</sic> personations of duly
      registered voters. <emph rend="italic">Two persons</emph> may be selected from each political
      party to act as challengers at each polling place, by or through whom all challenges shall be
      made. The challengers must be registered voters,and known to the commissioners as respectable
      citizens. Whenever any person challenged for identity, whose name is found upon the
      registration lists, is known to any one of the commissioners to be the person he represents
      himself to be his vote should be admitted; but if he be not so known, one of the commissioners
      shall administer the following oath: "you, do swear that your name is (here the name announced
      shall be inserted) and that in such name you were duly registered as a voter of
      the--------election district and--------precinct, and that you are the identical person you so
      represent yourself to be" If challenged for having already voted, the commissioner shall
      administer the following oath: "You do swear that you have not voted at this election, at
      this, or any other polling place."---If any person so challenged shall refuse to take the oath
      so tendered, his vote shall be rejected, but if he take it, his vote shall be admitted; but
      the fact and cause of challenge shall be noted on the poll lists opposite his name.</p>
     <p>No person shall be required to work on the public roads, or to attend any court as suitor,
      juror, or witness on the day of election, or be subject to arrest under civil process during
      his attendance or in going to or returning from such election. No process shall be made
      returnable on the day preceding or succeeding the election day if his vote should be defeated
      thereby. If arrested on a criminal process for other crime or offence than felony, (before he
      has voted) he shall be allowed to vote before he is imprisoned.</p>

    <head>Instructions to Boards of Registration</head>
    <origin/>
    <commentary/>
    <transcript>
     <p>The following instructions to boards of registration announcing the extent to which the laws
      of the United States work disfranchisement in Virginia were issued yesterday by the commanding
      general:</p>
     <p>1. All persons who were at any time members of Congress, or officers of the United States,
      civil or military, and as such officers took an oath to support the Constitution of the United
      States, and all who were at any time members of any State Legislature, or executive or
      judicial officers of any State, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against
      the United States, or gave aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; and all who have been
      convicted of felony against the laws of any State or of the United States are disfranchised.</p>
     <p>2. The following are considered executive &amp; judicial officers of the State of
      Virginia within the meaning of the law; Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,
      auditor of the land office, State treasurer, attorney general, sheriffs, sergeant of a city or
      town, commissioners of the revenue, county surveyors, constables, overseers of the poor,
      commissioners of the board of public works, judges of the supreme court, judges of the circuit
      courts, judge of the court of Hustings, justices of the county courts, mayor, recorder and
      aldermen of a city or town, coroners, escheators, inspectors of tobacco, flour, &amp;c.,
      clerks of the supreme, district, circuit, and county courts, and of the court of Hustings and
      attorneys for the Commonwealth.</p>
     <p>3. "Executive or judicial offices of any State" are construed to be all "offices created by
      law for the administration of any general justice." This includes "county offices," but does
      not include "deputies" of county officers. The latter are not subject to disfranchisement. It
      also includes such city or town offices, as are created for the "administration of justice"
      but does not include any others.</p>
     <p>4. No one is disfranchised for participation in rebellion unless he <emph rend="italic"
       >previously</emph> held some one of the offices above-named.</p>
     <p>5. "Officers of the United States" whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the
      constitution, are appointed by the President, by the courts of law, or by the heads of
      departments. Persons who derive their authority from any source inferior to those above-named,
      such as clerks, deputies or agents, are not "officers" of the United States, and are not
      subject to "disfranchisement for participation in rebellion."</p>
     <p>6. Being in the military service of the United States does not, <emph rend="italic">per
      se</emph>, disqualify an officer of the army, either regular or volunteer, from obtaining a
      residence in and becoming a citizen of this or any other State. Residence is a matter of
      intention, as well as of actual domicile. A person in the military service stationed in a
      State may acquire a residence there as well as any other citizen, provided he has resided in
      the <sic>Sate</sic> the length of time and otherwise complied with the requirements specified
      by the laws of the State with the <emph rend="italic">bona fide</emph> intention of making it
      his permanent home. On the other hand, without such intention, no residence can be acquired by
      being stationed in a State, no matter how long the person may remain stationed there.
      Desertion from the army of the United States (volunteer or regular) works disfranchisement
      unless the person is relieved by an unconditional pardon, or by Congressional action.</p>
     <p>7. No person is "disfranchised for participation in rebellion" by the constitution or laws
      of Virginia. But a person is disfranchised for participation in rebellion by the laws of any
      State, where a "legal State government now exists," provided he has been a citizen of such
      State at any time during the existence of such disfranchising law.</p>
     <p>8. All persons who voluntarily joined the rebel army, and all persons in that army, whether
      volunteers or conscripts, who committed <emph rend="italic">voluntarily</emph> any hostile
      act, thereby engaged in insurrection or rebellion. Any person, however, who was forced into
      the rebel army, but avoided, as far as possible, doing hostile acts, and escaped from that
      army as soon as possible, cannot be said to have engaged in the rebellion.</p>
     <p>9. All who exercised the functions of any office under the Confederate Government, or the
      government of any of the Confederate States, which functions were of a nature to aid in
      prosecuting the war, or maintaining the hostile character of those governments, engaged in the
      rebellion, or gave aid and comfort to the enemy.</p>
     <p>10. Voting, in convention, for the ordinance of secession, or, at the election, for its
      ratification, like any other act of engaging in rebellion or adhering to the enemy, <emph
       rend="italic">if done voluntarily</emph>, works disfranchisement of the person who had
      previously held one of the specified offices; but if the act be committed involuntarily,
      through fear or force, it does not work disfranchisement.--Any act is assumed to have been
      voluntary unless the contrary is shown by satisfactory evidence. In reference to this and
      other questions the oath of the person applying for registration is to be given such weight
      as, in the opinion of the board, it is entitled to.</p>
     <p>11. Those who <emph rend="italic">voluntarily</emph> furnished supplies of food, clothing,
      arms, ammunition, horses or mules, or any other material of war, or labor or service of any
      kind to the Confederate military or naval forces, or money, by loan or otherwise, to the
      Confederate government, or aided in any way the raising, organization or equipment of troops,
      gave aid and comfort to the enemy, and participated in the rebellion and civil war against the
      United States.</p>
     <p>12. To give individual soldiers food or clothing enough to relieve present suffering, or to
      minister to the sick or wounded, are simple acts of charity or humanity, and do not constitute
      giving "aid or comfort to the enemy." A parent may give his son who belongs to the hostile
      army food and clothing for his own use; but if he gave him a gun, horse, or other thing, to be
      used for hostile purposes, he thereby gives aid and comfort to the enemy.</p>
     <p>13. Executive pardon or amnesty does not remove the disfranchisement under the acts of
      Congress; but removal of political disabilities by a joint resolution of Congress removes the
      disability when the oath of July, 11, 1868, has been duly subscribed. This oath is in the
      following words:</p>
     <p>"I--------, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of
      the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and
      allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or
      purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on
      which I am about to enter. So help me God."</p>

    <head>Memorial Day</head>

    <commentary/>
    <transcript>
     <p>Saturday last was Memorial Day and a very large crowd was assembled to pay their annual
      tribute to our departed heroes.</p>
     <p>There was no programme of proceedings and consequently no general procession of the people,
      though the Augusta Fire Company, Friends of Temperance, and the pupils of the Augusta Female
      Seminary and Virginia Female Institute, headed by the Stonewall Band, followed by a number of
      citizens and the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institution Band and Fire Company, under the conduct
      of Col. Bolivar Christian, Chief Marshall; assisted by Maj. J.M. Hanger, Capts. Bum-Gardner,
      Berkeley, Arnall, Ranson and Lieut. Effinger, moved in procession at 8 1/2 o'clock, A.M. to
      the Cemetery Gate, where they were joined by the large crowd assembled there and proceeded to
      the graves of our soldiers.</p>
     <p>After music by the Stonewall Band, the following ode, arranged by Dr. J.L. Brown, was
      feelingly sung by the Staunton Musical Association:</p>
     <p>Strew flowery wreaths upon the graves<lb/> Of those who shed their blood, and died<lb/> In
      Freedom's cause; though 'twas in vain,<lb/> Their deeds elate our hearts with pride.</p>
     <p>Strew o'er them flowers; mid battle's din<lb/> O think how hard their fate to die.<lb/> No
      mother dear, no sister there,<lb/> Nor friend, to close the death-dimmed eye.</p>
     <p>A while they rest within the tomb<lb/> In sweet repose, till morning come,<lb/> Ten rise, we
      trust, to meet their God,<lb/> And ever dwell in his abode.</p>
     <p>Celestial dawn! triumphant hour,<lb/> How glorious that awakening power<lb/> Which bids the
      sleeping dust arise<lb/> And join the anthems of the skies.</p>
     <p>His weary life will soon be past,<lb/> The lingering morn will come at last,<lb/> And gloomy
      mists will roll away<lb/> Before that light unfading day.</p>
     <p>The D. &amp; D. Blind Band played several appropriate pieces and the vast assemblage
      then engaged in the sacred duty of scattering their tribute of flowers over the graves of our
      loved and lost, thus silently giving practical expression to the beautiful sentiments
      contained in the following ode, written by the lamented Henry Timrod, the poet laureate of
      South Carolina and first sung on the decoration of the graves of the Confederate dead, at
      Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, S.C:</p>
     <p>Sleep sweetly in your humble graves--<lb/> Sleep, martyrs of a fallen cause!<lb/> Though yet
      no marble column craves<lb/> The pilgrim here to pause</p>
     <p>In seeds of laurel in the earth<lb/> The blossom of your fame is blown,<lb/> And somewhere,
      waiting for its birth,<lb/> The shaft is in the stone!</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, behalf the tardy years<lb/> Which keep in trust your storied tombs,<lb/> Behold!
      your sisters bring their tears,<lb/> And these memorial blooms.</p>
     <p>Small tributes! but your shades will smile<lb/> More <sic>poudly</sic> on these wreaths
      to-day<lb/> Than when some cannon-mouldered pile<lb/> Shall overlook this bay.</p>
     <p>Storm angels, hither from the skies!<lb/> There is no holier spot of ground<lb/> Than where
      defeated valor lies,<lb/> By mourning beauty crowned!</p>
