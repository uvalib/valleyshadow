                    making sure that all others register. To clarify the registration process, the

                    for the vote wherever he may live. Included are terms regarding length of

                    <p>The Boards of Registration are now in session at various points in the
                        County. They will continue in session until Thursday evening next.</p>
                    <p>Persons entitled to register must apply to the Board, in the Magisterial
                        District in which they reside. Any person previously registered in the State, who has changed his residence since,
                        can register in the district in which he now resides, by applying to the
                        board before whom he previously registered for a certificate of registration
                        and presenting this certificate to the board of the district in which he
                        resides. If he can not receive a certificate in time for registration, he
                        may vote on presentation of his certificate and making affidavit that he has
                        resided ten days in the district and has not previously voted at that
                        election. Or if he fails to receive a certificate he can vote by swearing in
                        addition that he was registered and giving the name of the county and
                        precinct in which he registered.</p>
                    <p>The Boards of Registration are supplied with blank certificates and
                        affidavits. Persons must have resided in the State one year to be entitled
                        to vote.</p>
                    <p> When the number of votes registered, in any magisterial District exceed 400,
                        separate polling places will be designated by the Board and the boundaries
                        of the precincts defined and notice thereof posted, and voters are required
                        to vote at the polling places of their separate precincts, but may vote at any place within their magisterial
                        District if it is shown to the commissioner of election that they failed to
                        get notice in time or for other good reason failed to vote in the precinct
                        and they have not previously voted at the election. </p>
                    <p>We are indebted to Lieut. Towns, Military Commissioner for the above date,
                        which we can give in a more concise form than heretofore for the information
                        of all and for easy reference Each and every person interested in the above
                        should take the proper steps to have his name properly registered. Each and
                        every one should not only see that he is himself properly registered, but
                        that his neighbors also are registered.</p>
                    <p>Those who have failed heretofore to register must fail no longer. The time is
                        short and emergency pressing. Let it be your first great duty to register
                        and to see that all, entitled to register, do so.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This report of a group of speakers recently gathered at the Staunton
                    courthouse describes Governor Wells's determination to vote against the test
                    oath and disfranchisement clauses in the constitution. Others concur with his

                        Augusta, in the Court House. The speakers were introduced by Maj. Jno. A.
                        Harman, who counseled against the clauses to be submitted separately and
                        then to vote for Gov. Wells, who he proclaimed was, excepting Gov. Billy
                        Smith, the "best abused" man that ever ran for office in Virginia.</p>
                    <p> Gov. Wells, then addressed the crowd which was made up largely of
                        Conservatives who desired to hear what, Gov. Wells had to say and who were
                        greatly surprised, that, expressing his
                        determination to vote against the Test Oath and Disfranchisement clauses, he
                        failed to advise his party followers to do so. </p>
                    <p>L.H. Chandler, followed in a very ingenious argument in favor of Wells and
                        the expurgated Constitution. We only regretted that no one was present to
                        answer him in his advocacy of the Underwood abomination.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins, of Winchester, followed, and we learn, from his manner and style,
                        disgusted the Conservatives present, who left en masse.</p>
