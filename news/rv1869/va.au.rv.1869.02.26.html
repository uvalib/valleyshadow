<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For years past the negro has been made to play a conspicuous part in the
                        politics of the country. One party has grown into enormous dimensions at the
                        expense of the poor African, until attaining the reigns of power it forced
                        him into an abnormal condition. At his expense the Union was disrupted and
                        sovereignties wrested of their rights and prerogatives and his only friends
                        placed under the yoke of oppression. When all this was accomplished and the
                        party which had arisen on his shoulders were in undisturbed possession of
                        the fruits of their political victories, it was the hope of all that for a
                        time at least the negro would have no place in the polities of the day, but,
                        that relieved of this great disturbing cause, there would be divisions of
                        parties on questions only of great national import. This was indeed a vain
                        hope. The negro as a freeman seems destined, if fanaticism continue its
                        sway, to play a still more conspicuous part. Scarcely able to care for
                        themselves and those dependent upon them, they are about to be forced into a
                        position they not only are not qualified to fill, but at which their very
                        instincts revolt. They are not only to have a controlling voice in the
                        government of this once proud and prosperous republic but are to assist in
                        the enactment and enforcement of its laws, positions which, for the right
                        conduct of all governments, requires the ablest and most experienced
                        citizens. This even is but a step in the onward progress of fanaticism. With
                        the privilege of voting and holding office this fury of the age can not
                        stop. Its ultimate sequence is equality in a social as well as in a
                        political aspect. The equalizing theory must continue to this end. There is
                        no half way house this side of that ultimate and inevitable result. Those
                        who avow or embrace the theories of Radicalism may flatter themselves that
                        the negro will, in the future as in the past, be but a stepping stone to
                        place and power, but we warn them that they labor under a baneful delusion.
                        They may stand aghast at the idea of social equality but we admonish them
                        that it is but the sequence of the theories they profess or endorse. Have
                        you, who, for expediency sake, would accept the dogmas of Radicalism,
                        counted the costs? Are you willing to acknowledge the social as well as the
                        political equality of all men? If not, pause and retrace your steps ere it
                        be too late.--Return to the stand point of your forefathers. Be true to the
                        principle of a homogeneity or prepare to sink with your country in the
                        maelstrom that has engulfed all mongrel Republics.</p>
                    <p>Caucasians alone, have converted Barbarism into Civilization and advanced
                        Civilization to Enlightenment, and Caucasians alone can maintain the high
                        standard they have raised. Beware then, ye who for place, preferment, power
                        or insidious and temporary expediency, would hazard an attempt to reverse
                        the decrees of Omnipotence.</p>

                    <p>Robert Stevens, colored, has received in Underwood's Court, at Richmond,
                        $1,600 damages(?) from the Richmond,
                        Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, for refusing his wife a seat in the
                        Ladies' car, and compelling her to ride in a second class car, she having
                        purchased a first class ticket. The company alleged that car "D," in which
                        colored persons are assigned seats, was not a second class car, but was
                        expressly fitted up to accommodate persons of color only, that a separate
                        car was fitted up for gentlemen unaccompanied by ladies &amp;c., but of
                        no avail. Underwood so charged the (mixed) jury that they brought in the
                        verdict as above stated. In this charge he went out of the way, as usual
                        with him, to heap epithets on the people of Virginia, and especially
                        denounced the citizens of Richmond, charging that "rottenness, drunkenness
                        and corruption pervaded all classes from the bar even to the pulpit."</p>
                    <p>Comment is unnecessary on the course of such a man, who, every day of his
                        judicial life, disgusts more and more every decent man in the State,
                        regardless of party, and is a lasting disgrace to the judicial ermine.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For a long time Southern Journals have attempted, in vain, to convince the
                        masses of the North that the effort of Congress to destroy every vestige of
                        State-rights in the South, on the false plea assumed, was but the initiative
                        of the same course to be pursued as to the Northern States, ultimately to
                        result in a huge centralization of power, in which States would lose their
                        distinctiveness as well as their rights.</p>
                    <p>Judging from the tone of some of the leading Radical Journals, on the
                        proposed suffrage amendment, the predicted result is now anticipated by the
                        Northern people, who are beginning to exhibit their alarm at its
                        monstrosity. As an evidence of this we copy the following comments of the
                        Providence (R. I.) Journal, (Republican) and would suggest that the plea of
                        "necessity," alluded to by the Journal, may serve to cover up the
                        unconstitutional action towards the South, but is a dangerous plea. It will
                        be used with equal effect against the North. The only remedy is to meet the
                        thing squarely and defeat every attempt of partisans to interfere with the
                        reserved rights of States, North or South, upon any plea whatever.--In this
                        only lies the hope of the preservation of the Union of our fathers.</p>
                    <p>The Journal thus discourses:</p>
                    <p>"Should this amendment be confirmed by the States, and go into effect, it
                        cannot fail to work a very important change in the government and
                        institutions of the country.--The article annuls forever all special
                        qualifications for holding office in any of the States, and will inevitably
                        require very important alterations in several of the State constitutions, as
                        well as in the relations of all the States to the general government. It
                        will prove by far the longest step that has thus far been taken toward the
                        consolidation of our political power and the virtual overthrow of State
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>"A change like this which is proposed by the Senate is fundamental and
                        far-reaching. As was earnestly contended by several leading members of that
                        body, it is essentially revolutionary in its tendencies and results. Our
                        political system will be very greatly modified by its operation, and with
                        the facility, which will thus be introduced of making still further changes,
                        it is impossible fully to estimate or even to anticipate the ulterior
                        consequences that are likely to flow from it. Out of a necessity which the
                        rebellion forced upon the States of the South, and which really pertained
                        only to them, the champions of a particular theory of social rights have
                        carried through the Senate a change in the fundamental law which strikes
                        down everything like local independence in State affairs, and abolishes all
                        power in a State to protect itself against any social or political evils to
                        which it may be especially exposed. The constitution of the United States,
                        as thus amended, will clearly no longer be the constitution which was
                        adopted by our fathers. With such a provision, even as a possible
                        anticipation, it could never have passed the convention of 1787; still less
                        could it have been accepted by the popular conventions of any of the States.
                        If it is now confirmed, it will be only an overthrow of State constitutions,
                        under the spurious guise of a constitutional amendment in favor of
                    freedom."</p>

                        unanimous no, and Henry-Davenport, colored, was nominated, which nomination
                        was not put to the meeting. After some little delay Mr. A.T. Maupin again
                        nominated Maj. Harman, stating at the same time that he was thoroughly
                        identified with the Republican party. Phil Roselle (colored) also advocated
                        the claims of Maj. Harman. The vote was then put and he was unanimously
                        elected. On taking the chair Maj. Harman said he felt very much
                        embarrassed.--His position was a novel one. But he assured the meeting that
                        he cordially endorsed the Reconstruction measures, and was heartily with
                        them in the political issues of the day. He urged them to work for the
                        success of their party.</p>
                    <p>The equalizing theory was carried out in the selection of committees also,
                        and we suppose that the colored members were satisfied that they were
                        getting sugar in thern."</p>
                    <p>Speeches were made by Messrs Tukey and Maupin. We heard a portion of the
                        first only. It abounded in a discussion of dead issues, about the only
                        capital on which Republicans operate.</p>
                    <p>As to the whites who participated in the meeting here, or who affiliate with
                        Southern Republicans elsewhere, we have nothing to say, for de gustibus non disputandum. They will have more
                        than political equality to swallow and however bitter the pill, it must be
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>When the full draught is quaffed they may well be regarded  most
                        thorough Republicans.</p>
