<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article questions whether or not General Canby will demand the
                    test-oath of the recently elected Legislators. While evidence is conflicting,
                    many suggest that the test-oath will indeed be demanded. If this be the case,
                    newly elected Legislators will have to yield their seats to their opponents.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The test oath question is that which agitates the public mind of Virginia
                        to-day.--Will General Canby exact it of the lately elected members of the
                        Legislature or not? That is the question. Some of our exchanges have
                        indulged in able arguments to show that Gen Canby would not exact it. But of
                        what avail if he determines to do so? He has required it of Commissioners of
                        Chancery and we conclude he will require it of Legislatures, unless higher
                        authority forbids it. Will this higher authority forbid it? We have
                        conflicting telegrams and correspondence from Washington, the one declaring
                        it will be required and the other denying it. As our readers are all
                        interested in this question, we publish elsewhere the opinion of President
                        Grant, as published by a heretofore unknown fellow, calling himself Tarbell,
                        who has been interviewing him. If this be a true representation of Grant's
                        views, he is as inconsistent as we supposed he would be when we read his
                        inaugural--a perfect puppet in the hands of those who hold the wires. He
                        will back up Canby on the test-oath question and thus over-ride the will of
                        the whole people of Virginia, as expressed by an immense majority in the
                        last election.</p>
                    <p> The best comment, perhaps, we have seen on the sentiments of a President, as
                        to political parties in a State, we give below from the Alexandria Gazette</p>
                    <p> "To what a lamentable condition is our country reduced, when the fiat of the President, as to his choice of political parties in the States--and his decision--as to which section of a party is to
                        be considered the "proper" one--are regarded as all important for the
                        regulations of the opinions and votes of the people? Without shame, the
                        politicians now go to Washington to elicit the Presidential edict for the
                        regulation of party movement in the States or Provinces! Can there be a
                        lower degradation in the administration of government? Principles are
                        entirely disregarded! It is coming, to be the Imperial regime, under the
                        forms of Republicanism. It is now, what does the President think? Think so,
                        too. What does the President propose? That
                        do!--Alas, for our country!" </p>
                    <p>Gen. Sherman, it is also reported, is in favor of exacting the test-oath of
                        our Legislators. The Commander in Chief of the Army is, by act of Congress,
                        given almost absolute power on this subject. If it really be true that he
                        favors this course, we should like to know what has become of his vaunted
                        Democracy, or what constitutes a Democrat in these degenerated times?</p>
                    <p>It is also reported that Attorney General Hoar has decided that the test-oath
                        must be required by general Canby. At any rate, it looks very much like our
                        Legislators elect, who can't take the test-oath, will have to give way to
                        their opponents, whom they generally defeated by large majorities.</p>
                    <p>In that case the only consolation we can offer is, that at the next election
                        the military and test-oaths will be out of the way, and the defeat the
                        Radicals will experience will convince them that Virginians can and will
                        rule Virginia.</p>
