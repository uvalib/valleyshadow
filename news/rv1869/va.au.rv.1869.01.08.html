<b>Results of a Political Conference in Richmond</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Alexander H. H. Stuart chaired a meeting in Richmond that discussed the
                    political situation in Virginia. The delegates, which included a number of
                    prominent Augusta citizens, resolved to send a committee to Washington to press
                    upon Congress the need to readmit Virginia to the Union. They will agree to drop
                    opposition to suffrage rights for black men even though they believe that "the
                    freedmen of the Southern States, in their present uneducated condition, are not
                    prepared for the intelligent exercise of the elective franchise." In return they
                    expect Congress to compromise on other issues and end reconstruction in
                    Virginia.<br>(Names in announcement:  Alex H. H. Stuart,  N. K. Trout,  H. M. Bell,  John Echols,  Thomas J. Michie)</blockquote>
