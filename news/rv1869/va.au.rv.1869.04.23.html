<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some of our exchanges are urging with all their vim the necessity of
                        unanimity on the part of the conservatives of the State in the present
                        political crisis. This we have felt and urged at all times, and, especially
                        when the election on the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution
                        seemed imminent. And we yield to none at present in warmth of desire for
                        unanimity on the part of our people in the approaching crisis. We think it
                        essential to the future welfare of the State that there should be
                        unanimity--but, not that attainable only by the sacrifice of principles and
                        long established and acknowledged rights. Not the unanimity of the man who,
                        while his storehouse is being invaded by a band of thieves, and the
                        sustenance of his family is being carried off, counsels the members thereof,
                        as they value peace and quiet and their lives, to remain quiet and let the
                        robbers do their worst. But the unanimity which assails the thief in his
                        midnight revels, recovers the purloined articles from his grasp and drives
                        him in ignominious and head-long flight from the premises. This was the
                        unanimity we had, until temporizing expedients were suggested with their
                        concomitant demoralization.</p>
                    <p>We anxiously await the action of the meeting called by the Conservative
                        Executive Committee on the 28 inst., in Richmond, but trust they will be
                        guided by superior wisdom. If they incline to a new State Ticket, although
                        the old one is good enough for us, let it be one that the people can be
                        united upon. Let it not be the Walker ticket, which under the guise of
                        conservatism, would sell us out to the Republican party. We warn them in
                        advance, as we warned those who advocated this ticket in its incipiency,
                        that persistence in the Walker movement can only result in the election of
                        the Wells Ticket.</p>
                    <p>All in the Valley long for peace and quiet, but they are not willing to
                        secure it at the price of a sacrifice of principles, honor or rights and we
                        caution those who assemble on the 28th that all the wisdom they can command
                        will be required to secure the sympathy and concurrence of the Whites of the
                        State.</p>
