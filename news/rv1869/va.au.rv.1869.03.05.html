<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Expediency has been the curse of all ages, times and peoples. It has been the
                        peculiar rock on which this country has split. Its history has been
                        interlined here and there for years with temporizing induced by the specious
                        argument of expediency, the fruits of which are the extraordinary condition
                        of affairs we now witness. Opinions have and will be diverse and the effort
                        has been to assimilate and harmonize this contrariety of political opinion
                        for the sake of peace.--Principle was sacrificed for seeming policy and the
                        result was a temporary solution of the difficulties. Opinions were not
                        changed--not even harmonized, but merely suppressed, temporarily, to break
                        forth again with renewed vigor and exhibit their results with a tenfold
                        damaging effect. Looking back through the past this will be clearly seen by
                        the unprejudiced mind and acknowledged to be the natural result of bartering
                        principle for expediency.</p>
                    <p>This seems destined also to be the curse of the future. A powerful party
                        based solely on the fanaticism of the age holds the reins of power. For four
                        years more it is firmly seated in the control of affairs. It wields an
                        immense patronage while in power and is disposed to oppress all who oppose
                        its edicts or even differ with it in opinion--Thousands, whose convictions
                        for a life-time have been in direct opposition to the fanaticism which has
                        engendered it, still maintain the old time principles of our forefathers and
                        are the chosen subjects for its malicious persecutions, as witnessed on all
                        sides. On this account, when the last lease of power was obtained by this
                        party, the cry of expediency was raised. The cry was "let us accept its
                        theories for the sake of peace."--Barter principle for expediency. With the
                        lights of the past before them it is wonderful that so many of the learned
                        and gifted in the land were carried away by this insidious plea. It is less
                        wonderful that some, tired of these persecutions, should actually sacrifice
                        principle for expediency. The fruits of the former rigidly adhered to are
                        necessarily postponed to the future--the fruits of the latter are to be
                        found in the emoluments and "spoils" of the present. It is alike expediency
                        that induces temporizing or yielding and its direful results are to be
                        reaped in the bitter future. It needs no prophetic mind to predict the
                        results in the near future of temporizing or yielding to the cry of
                        expediency in the present. Beware, then, ye, who to escape the persecutions
                        or share in the spoils of the present, barter away principles, which erected
                        out of a savage wild a Republic, the model government of the world, a strict
                        adherence to which can alone preserve it and the liberties of your children
                        and your children's children in all time to come.</p>
                    <p>Expediency nailed the Savior to the cross--principle produced a Redeemer for
                        a sin-polluted world.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The managing committee of the Inaugural ceremonies, have been very much
                        troubled at the question of admitting or refusing to admit colored persons
                        to the Inauguration Ball. They have, at last, nerved themselves to decide
                        the question and authorize the announcement "that colored persons will not
                        be present, the high-toned colored population having too much self-respect
                        to force themselves into society where they are not welcome, and those who
                        have not any self-respect will not be admitted anyhow."</p>
                    <p>One would think that those who proclaimed themselves the especial and peculiar friends of the
                        colored people, sitting with them in their meetings &amp;c., should
                        welcome them everywhere. It seems, however, that they are not welcome, even to a participation in all the
                        inauguration ceremonies of the first President they have helped to elect;
                        nay, are refused permission to participate in a portion of the pleasures of
                        the occasion. This is a singular act for boasted friends, but,
                        nevertheless--"the colored troops fought nobly."</p>
