<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Two negroes, calling themselves John Adams and Tom Henry, were arrested by
                        three colored men, James Stewart, Lewis Hunter and Madison Brown, at
                        Deerfield on Tuesday last, on the charge of rape and murder made against
                        them by an other colored man, named Jim McDowell, and brought here on
                        Tuesday night last. They had a hearing before Justice J.F. Maupin, who
                        committed them to jail to await a further examination Wednesday morning and
                        instructed the jailor to retain Jim McDowell, the witness, in custody also.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday morning, upon the Jailor and Chief of Police informing them that
                        they were suspected as the jail birds, who had escaped on Tuesday night, the
                        13th inst. from the Lexington jail, they acknowledged the fact, and that
                        their names were Lee Morrison, Wm. Alexander and Jim McDowell and were
                        confined in jail on the charges respectively, of way-laying and attempting
                        to kill young Devier; of burglary and attempted rape, and robbing a church.
                        They have been returned to the Lexington jail. The three colored men who
                        made the arrest deserve the especial praise of all, and our authorities
                        should see that they receive whatever reward may have been offered for the
                        jail breakers.</p>
