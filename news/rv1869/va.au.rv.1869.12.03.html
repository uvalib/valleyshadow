<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an account of the recent Republican state convention in

                    palmiest days of the Black Crook Convention." Republicans insisted that their
                    recent defeats were due to the separate vote on the test oath and disfranchising
                    clauses and intimidation of black voters.<br>
