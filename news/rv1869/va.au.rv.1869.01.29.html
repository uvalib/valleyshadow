<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday last, Court-day, Messrs. Stuart and Baldwin, members of the
                        committee of nine, addressed a large meeting of the people of Augusta,
                        explaining the result of the labors of the committee, in Washington. We took
                        full notes on the speeches of these gentlemen, but from their length we have
                        not the space to publish them. They report in substance, that they have a
                        prospect of having the Undewood constitution amended by striking
                        out the Test-oath and Disfranchisement, County -organization, Homestead and
                        Church property clauses and in that condition to be presented for the
                        adoption of our people. This we take occasion to repeat is only a prospect, which they account for by saying that the
                        new movement is only in process and until something is accomplished there
                        can be nothing but a prospect of success. This we readily grant the
                        gentlemen and, while we accord them the best motives in all they have done,
                        yet we are compelled to believe they are building their hopes on promises
                        never to be realized. They complain hugely that, having obtained the promise of relief from four out of five very
                        objectionable features of the Underwood constitution, their labors do not
                        meet with the assent of all our people. We submit that to accord the
                        committee of nine more than a patriotic motive at this stage of their labors
                        was not to have been expected.</p>
                    <p>It was the purpose of those opposed to the new movement to hear Messrs.
                        Stuart and Baldwin patiently and silently. This was prevented by the
                        offering of a resolution, which virtually committed our people to an
                        endorsation of the new movement. J. Marshall Hanger, Esq., objecting to the
                        question being taken on the resolution until those opposed to the new
                        movement could be heard, Cols. Christian and Skinner were loudly called for
                        and responded in able speeches, not only opposing the resolution as
                        ill-timed and ill advised, but successfully refuting the reasons given by
                        Messrs. Stuart and Baldwin why our people should endorse the new movement.
                        During the remarks of Col. Skinner the resolution was withdrawn, leaving the
                        subject just where it should be at present. At the conclusion of Col.
                        Skinner's speech Gen. Echols made a few remarks eulogizing the pure motives
                        and patriotism of Messrs. Stuart and Baldwin, in the course they pursued, a
                        subject which seemed not to be mooted by even the most ardent opposer of the
                        new movement.</p>
                    <p>This, as concisely as we can state it, was the result of the meeting on
                        Monday, and unless some positive good results, can be shown, which will far
                        out-weigh the objectionable features still retained in the Underwood
                        constitution, according to the programme of the committee of nine, the same
                        result will attend all similar efforts.</p>
                    <p>We still incline to the belief that the committee will not be able to
                        accomplish anything, but should they secure what they declare has been
                        promised, we can only say so far, so good--but in our opinion this does not
                        go far enough.</p>
                    <p>In the language of another, "the committee have not asked that any
                        qualification for holding office shall be inserted in the Constitution, thus
                        leaving all negroes eligible to office; nor have they asked that any
                        qualification for jurors shall be inserted in that instrument--thus leaving
                        the very fountains of justice exposed to corruption and defilement: nor have
                        they asked any modification of the 20th section of the Bill of Rights, which
                        reads, "That all citizens of the State are hereby declared to possess equal
                        civil and political rights and public privileges;" nor have they asked any
                        modification of article nine touching the Militia, which does not provide
                        for separate organizations of the whites and blacks; nor have they asked for
                        an additional section to article eight, requiring that there shall be
                        separate public schools for the two races in the State; nor have they asked
                        any correction of the iniquitous gerrymander of article five whereby the
                        negroes secure a majority of twenty-one in the Legislature; nor have they
                        asked any modification of the article on Taxation, which throws the entire
                        burden of taxation on the whites."</p>
                    <p>Such features retained in the Underwood Constitution, going a bow-shot beyond
                        that instrument, in binding ourselves never to change or amend the
                        constitution on the question of suffrage, makes the labors of the committee,
                        if every point asked by them were granted, so exceedingly unpalatable, that
                        we do not believe they will be accepted by those even who are most ready to
                        sacrifice right and principles on the altar of expediency.</p>
                    <p>No! the sentiments of a large majority of our people will be those expressed
                        in the following extract from the address of Mr. Stuart, before a large and
                        enthusiastic meeting in our Court-house, in June 1866:</p>
                    <p>"We have been overwhelmed, but we have not yet been degraded. That can be
                        inflicted only with our own consent, and that consent never will be given.
                        Our rights may be ravished from us by violence but we will never agree that
                        Virginia shall be placed in the position of a political prostitute by giving
                        consent to her own degradation and dishonor."</p>

                    <p>The position held by this county as a producer of grain, as shown in a former
                        article, would lead to the conclusion that the manufacturing establishments
                        for the conversion of these cereals into flour and meal would hold an
                        important place among those there in operation--and we find that 62 of the
                        197 in the county were devoted to these purposes, having an invested capital
                        of $287,000, working up raw material worth $391,000; employing 89 hands at a
                        cost of $23,280, and producing $462,255 worth of flour and meal. In the
                            number of its flouring mills, Augusta is by
                        far the first county in the State--Henrico, alone, had more money invested
                        in flouring mills, the extensive establishments in Richmond, unsurpassed in
                        the United States, swelling its total.</p>
                    <p>Next in point of numbers were the twenty-two lumbering establishments,
                        costing $39,562, using $17,505 worth of timber, employing forty-eight men
                        for $11,220, and furnishing $40,024 worth of lumber, nearly all of it for
                        home consumption. Frederick had twenty-six saw mills, but only produced about half as much lumber, and at a
                        greater proportionate cost; Halifax, with sixteen mills, had more invested,
                        and produced more at less cost; Rockbridge had forty-three, had less
                        invested, and produced more, a result easily accounted for when we remember
                        that she has the advantage of water transportation, by canal, to market;
                        Washington county had forty-five mills, but only about the same amount of
                        production.</p>
                    <p>The 18 distilleries of the county had $87,458 invested, used raw material
                        worth $58,339, employed 37 men at $9,108, and manufactured $120,777 worth of
                        liquor.--Rockbridge had 20 establishments but only $17,025 invested, using
                        not half the raw material or producing half as much for market; one
                        establishment in Henrico had more invested and produced more, and one in
                        Ohio county, now in West Virginia, produced more. Its 17 blacksmithing
                        establishments produced $21,676; its 12 tanyards, with $29,300 invested,
                        used $21,805 worth of raw material, employed 29 men at a cost of $7,668 and
                        produced $33,647 worth of leather, more than was produced in any other
                        county now in the State, although Rockingham had 2 more tanyards and had
                        more money invested in the business; the counties of Marion, Preston,
                        Harrison and Hampshire, now in West Virginia, were more extensively engaged
                        in this branch of manufacture from circumstances easily explained.</p>
                    <p>The establishments for the manufacture of boots and shoes were 7, yielding
                        $21,530: 6 for confectioneries; 5 for making carriages, paying out $19,630
                        for material and labor, and producing $30,700 worth for sale; 5 for
                        cooperage; 4 for saddlery and harness; 4 for wool-carding, consuming $5,000
                        worth of wool; 3 for making threshing machines, producing $9,300 worth; 3
                        for making cigars, producing $10,850; 3 for millinery; 3 for grinding
                        plaster, using $11,960 of raw material and making it worth $13,800; 3 for
                        making wagons and carts; 2 for dental manufacture, producing $2,900; 2 for
                        iron castings, making $3,830 of raw material worth $10,000; 2 for tin,
                        copper and sheet-iron ware; 2 for woolen goods, consuming $20,850 in value
                        of wool and turning out $33,000 worth of goods; 1 establishment for making
                        men's clothing; 1 bakery; 1 cabinet shop; 1 gas works; 1 hat making
                        establishment; 1 for making bar iron, using $2,000 worth of material and
                        making $5,000 worth of the manufactured article; 1 furnace for pig iron,
                        with $17,000 invested, and a production of $16,000; 1 manganese mine,
                        yielding $5,250; 1 marble factory; 1 paper mill that, with 11 hands, at a
                        cost of $3,000, converted $10,000 worth of raw material into $18,000 worth
                        of printing paper; 1 photograph establishment, and 1 pottery that, on $200
                        of investment, cost of raw material and labor, produced $12,000. These make
                        the 197 manufactories in the county in 1860, with $639,000 invested in them,
                        using raw material worth $615,546; employing 471 males and 31 females, at
                        $129,114 for wages and yielding products valued at $915,713.</p>
                    <p>In the number of establishments, Henrico with its 320, and Rockbridge with
                        its 220, only surpassed it--the one including the manufacturing city of
                        Richmond the other the numerous blacksmith shops and saw mills that produced
                        but little; in capital invested, the cost of material and value of
                        production it was only surpassed by the tobacco manufacturing counties of
                        Henrico, Campbell, Dinwiddie and Pittsylvania, the coal and cotton of
                        Chesterfield, in Virginia, the iron and glass of Ohio, and the salt of
                        Kanawha, in West Virginia. Rockbridge yielded more from the large value of
                        its cement.</p>
                    <p>These are the facts of 1860--instructive, in
                        showing what had been done to bring the loom and anvil to the land of the
                        plow-share, but far more instructive and useful we hope they will prove when
                        we point out the undeveloped resources, the unused raw materials, that will
                        repay the augmentation, more than a hundred-fold, of manufacturing
                        establishments. Many of those in operation in 1860 were burned during the
                        war, but they are more in number now than then, with more capital invested,
                        using more raw material and producing far more--in many things several
                        hundred per cent., for market. The county has added to its industries the
                        manufacture of "Rockingham" ware and fire-brick from its native kaolin; of
                        number from its own deposits; of improved pig iron, almost as valuable as
                        steel for many purposes, from its own ores, found in the natural state
                        fitted for the process of manufacture; of agricultural implements and
                        machinery, that are finding purchasers even beyond the borders of the State
                        on account of the quality of their material and workmanship; and the opening
                        of valuable quarries of marble, whose products are the demand of fashion in
                        the metropolitan cities; its flour, from its new and improved mills, has
                        attracted purchasers from the city of New York, and secured the patronage of
                        the government. The exhibit of the fruits of its varied mechanical
                        industries at its inaugural fair last fall, (to say nothing of the fair
                        itself, which was a marvel of production.) showed that the county is fully
                        on the course for being the first in the Commonwealth (always excepting our
                            metropotitan county) in the number, variety and value of its
                            manufactures--Enq. &amp; Ex</p>

                    <p>"A most interesting session of the reconstruction committee was held to-day,
                        the case of Virginia being the subject under discussion. Probably one
                        hundred persons were in the room, mostly from Virginia--Col. John B. Baldwin
                        acting as spokesman, addressed the committee. His address, which was
                        entirely extemporaneous, was most eloquent and impressive, and was not
                        without effect upon the members of the committee.</p>
                    <p>He said that the delegation of which he was one he truly believed represented
                        a large majority of the people of Virginia. Neither he nor any of the
                        delegation were aspirants for political honors, but in all their actions
                        were only inspired by a wish to promote the interests and prosperity of this
                        State. The people of Virginia were kindly disposed towards the general
                        government, and they welcome to their State all those who came among them
                        with fraternal feelings and with the desire to become bona fide citizens.
                        They encouraged the immigrant, and were grateful for his assistance in
                        developing the resources of the State; but they were fully alive to the
                        great distinction between the immigrant and the carpet-baggers, and while
                        they had no disposition to persecute the latter, they had for him the
                        feeling which it is the privilege of the meanest creature to entertain
                        towards the greatest--that of contempt. In reference to the disabilities
                        which are imposed by the reconstruction constitution, it was his honest
                        belief that it disfranchised 95 per cent. of the best people of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>A member of the committee inquired Mr. Baldwin's opinion as to the present
                        judges in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin replied that their character was excellent; that he had never
                        heard of any complaints of corruption or partiality on their part from
                        either black or white. He had heard of no desire for a change except from a
                        few people who wanted their places. The delegation came before the committee
                        frankly, honestly, and with a disposition to do all that was right; and they
                        appealed to the honor and justice of Congress to grant them a hearing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Boutwell said there was no disposition on the part of Congress to oppress
                        the people of Virginia or of the South, but their experience in Georgia had
                        convinced them that when the people who controlled the rebellion got into
                        power, they were not disposed to deal fairly with the loyal portion of the
                        population, either black or white. This being the case, while Congress was
                        inclined to consider anything that might be preferred in a proper spirit by
                        the class alluded to yet its primary duty was to protect its friends.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin, on his honor as a Virginian and a gentleman, assured the
                        committee that no such feeling as this existed among the white people of
                        Virginia. They fully recognized the altered condition of things, and were
                        disposed to do the negro full and complete justice in all respects.</p>
                    <p>During the course of Mr. Baldwin's address, allusion was made to the
                        questions now in dispute between the Methodist Church North and the
                        Methodist Church South, as to the church property. He spoke of a case in
                        Staunton where the church property was claimed by both parties, the party
                        representing the Northern division of the church having but two
                        communicants, while the Southern division had one hundred and twenty
                        communicants! On this point Mr. Baldwin was replied to by a Mr. Phelps in
                        behalf of the church North. The discussion on this point was renewed before
                        the committee on Monday."</p>
