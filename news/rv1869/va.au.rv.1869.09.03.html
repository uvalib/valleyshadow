<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints Robert E. Lee's note declining an invitation to join
                    officers on the battlefield of Gettysburg to mark troop positions for posterity.
                    Lee and a number of Democratic newspapers believe that the battle of Gettysburg
                    and the strife accompanying the Civil War are best left forgotten.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The widely heralded meeting of the officers, (U.S and Confederate,) who took
                        part in the battle of Gettysburg, to mark the operations of both armies on
                        the field, by enduring memorials of granite, has proven, as many expected a
                        great farce. But few of the prominent Northern officers were present and
                        only two Confederate officers of minor grades. The Hotel man did not make as
                        much as he expected, when he got up the idea.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee was invited and forwarded the following reply:</p>
                    <p>Lexington, VA., August 5, 1869.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir--Absence from Lexington has prevented my
                        receiving until to-day your letter of the 26th ult., inclosing an invitation
                        from the Gettysburg Battle-field Memorial Association, to attend a meeting
                        of the officers engaged in that battle at Gettysburg, for the purpose of
                        marking upon the ground by enduring memorials of granite the positions and
                        movements of the armies on the field. My engagements will not permit me to
                        be present. I believe if there, I could not add anything material to the
                        information existing on the subject. I think it wiser, moreover, not to keep
                        open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who
                        endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion
                        the feelings engendered. Very respectfully,<br> Your obedient servant,<br>
                        R. E. Lee.</p>
                    <p>The New York Herald and other Northern papers were
                        down on perpetuating the memory of Gettysburg. The Democratic Watchman,
                        (Pa.) expresses their sentiments in short, which for its succinctness and
                        pith, we copy below:</p>
                    <p>"Another big fuss at Gettysburg. A lot of officers are there for the purpose
                        of fixing definitely the positions occupied by the troops on the first day's
                        battle. Better take Gen. Lee's advise and let the darned thing die out of
                        remembrance."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We observe as rather remarkable that the Radical papers do not chronicle the
                        recent horrible crimes perpetrated in different parts of the Southern
                        country, upon white woman, by depraved and wicked blacks, as "rebel
                        outrages" at all. They leave out the word "rebel!"--Norfolk Journal</p>
                    <p>We suggest to our brethren of the Conservative Press, that we call all such
                        outrages "Radical outrages," as we have, clearly, the same right to call
                        them "Radical outrages," as Radicals have to style acts of white men in the
                        South "Rebel outrages." Besides, Conservative colored men are of the better
                        class of colored people, are well behaved, and disdain the commission of
                        such heinous crimes, while Radical negroes are notoriously the guilty
                        perpetrators of such crimes. Then let us give the devil his due--fight him
                        with his own fire and call these crimes by their right names--"Radical
                        outrages."</p>
