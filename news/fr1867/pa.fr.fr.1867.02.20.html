<b>Speech of Hon. Wm. H. Koontz, of Pennsylvania, on Reconstruction</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of Representative Koontz's address before Congress on the
                    subject of Reconstruction. In his remarks, Koontz makes clear his belief that
                    the best way to protect the Union is to grant suffrage to all loyal men in the
                    South, black or white.<br>

                    <p>
                        Delivered in the House of Representatives, Washington,
                            D. C., January 19, 1867.
                    </p>
                    <p>The House having under consideration House bill No. 543, to provide for
                        restoring to the States lately in insurrection their full political rights--</p>
                    <p>Mr. Koontz said:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Speaker: I do not propose to examine in detail
                        the bill under discussion, but will occupy a portion of the time allotted me
                        in discussing the general principles involved therein. When the late civil
                        war closed with the overthrow of the military power of the southern
                        confederacy, the first questions that were presented to the consideration of
                        the loyal people of the country were, what penalties shall be imposed upon
                        the nation? and what shall be done to restore civil governments to those
                        communities, and once more bring them into harmonious action with the
                        General Government. For over four years the nation had engaged in a
                        desperate struggle for its life. Ten States had by solemn legislative
                        enactment separated the ties that bound them to the Union, organized a
                        separate government, seized the forts, arsenals, navy yards, mints,
                        custom-houses and other property of the Government, raised large armies and
                        waged one of the fiercest wars known in history, to establish their
                        independence. After an immense expenditure of blood and treasure the whole
                        fabric of treason fell crumbling to the earth, and the great fact
                        established thereby was the ability of the nation to maintain itself against
                        domestic foes.</p>
                    <p>A stern sense of justice demanded that some punishment should be inflicted
                        upon the guilty criminals who had lighted the fires of civil war, desolated
                        so fair a portion of our fair land, and robed the country in mourning for
                        the precious dead whose lives had been sacrificed through their mad
                        ambition. At the same time a proper regard for the future peace and security
                        of the country required that there should be some conditions imposed upon
                        them before they could again be permitted to participate in the privileges
                        pertaining to the true and loyal people of the country. These things were
                        looked for by the friends of the Government, not through a spirit of hatred
                        and revenge toward the rebels, but because they were consistent with not
                        only the fundamental law of the land, but with that great principle of
                        self-preservation which lies at the foundation of all Governments, and
                        belongs to nations as well as to individuals. The crime of treason is
                        defined in the Constitution as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against
                        them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."--Article 3, section 3.</p>
                    <p>And the punishment provided therefor is, by act of Congress, 30th April,
                        1790, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"If any person owing allegiance to the United States of America shall levy
                        war against them, or shall adhere to their enemies, giving them aid and
                        comfort, within the United States or elsewhere, and shall be thereof
                        convicted, on confession in open court, or on the testimony of two witnesses
                        to the same overt act of treason whereof he or they shall stand indicted,
                        such person or persons shall be adjudged guilty of treason against the
                        United States and shall suffer death."</p>
                    <p>It requires no argument here to prove that they were guilty of this monstrous
                        crime. That they waged a fierce and relentless war against the United States
                        we have but to look at the numberless widows and orphans, who remind us that
                        three hundred thousand precious lives were lost to resist their attacks upon
                        the Government; and to remember that a national debt of $3,000,000,000,
                        which will tax the energies of our people for generations to come, was
                        contracted to overthrow the work of treason. Manifestly guilty, therefore,
                        of this high crime it would have only been in accordance with the dictates
                        of justice had they suffered its penalty. The principle that there must be
                        punishment for crime pervades both human and divine law, and as they were
                        guilty of the very highest crime known to the law, as well as of all the
                        crimes that follow in the train of civil war, it was but a reasonable
                        expectation on the part of the loyal people that they should expiate their
                        crimes by suffering the penalties of the law. I do not claim, nor do I
                        believe it to be the sense of the people, that these plain provisions of the
                        law should have been enforced upon the great mass who were deluded into the
                        ranks of treason, but I do most sincerely believe it to be the deliberate
                        judgement of the great body of the American people that the guilty leaders
                        ought to have suffered condign punishment. Instead, however, of carrying out
                        his previous threats that "traitors must be punished," the accidental
                        occupant of the White House showers upon them executive clemency, and
                        instead of "treason being made odious" it basks in the smiles of
                        presidential favor. Think of Alexander H. Stephens, the Vice President of
                        the rebel confederacy, with the pardon of Andrew Johnson in one hand and a
                        commission from the State of Georgia in the other, waiting for "my policy"
                        to be carried out to take his seat as a Senator in the Senate of the United
                        States, and you have a striking illustration of the way in which the highest
                        crime against the nation has been dealt with. Treason vanquished upon the
                        battle-field has succeeded through the treachery of Andrew Johnson in
                        escaping the blows of justice. It remains for the Congress of the United
                        States to see to it that the people are not robbed of the fruits of the
                        great victory won by the sword, and that before these communities can be
                        restored to their former position they must comply with such condition as
                        may be deemed necessary for the future peace of the country.</p>
                    <p>In a Government where there is the widest latitude given to the expression of
                        individual opinion, and where opinion is formed into law through the
                        instrumentality of the ballot-box, it is but natural that there should be
                        great diversity of sentiment upon a question so important as that of
                        deciding upon the true relation of those States to the Government which they
                        had attempted to destroy and whose authority they were compelled to
                        acknowledge after a bloody and destructive war. The public sentiment of the
                        country is divided upon this question. Upon the one side are the whole of
                        the people lately in rebellion, that entire class of people in the North
                        who, if they did not sympathize with rebellion, constantly opposed every
                        measure for its overthrow, together with a few renegade Unionists, among
                        whom is the President of the United States. On the other side are the truly
                        loyal men of the South, both white and black, and that great and patriotic
                        body of people in the North who were true to the Government through its long
                        and trying struggle with red-handed treason. The sentiments of the people
                        began to be developed with the events immediately following the overthrow of
                        the rebellion, and have continued to be moulded by successive events until
                        now, when they have assumed a decided furor, and are expressed either in
                        advocacy of, or bitter hostility to, what is known as the President's policy
                        of reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>When Andrew Johnson was elevated to the Presidency through the assassination
                        of Abraham Lincoln, the Thirty-Eighth Congress had expired by constitutional
                        limitation. Without summoning together the legislative branch of the
                        Government he at once began the work of reconstruction. He appointed
                        provisional governors for these States, directed the calling of conventions
                        in them for the purpose of starting the machinery of State government,
                        demanded from them compliance with certain conditions which he imposed, and
                        then pronounced them in a fit condition to be admitted into the Union,
                        provided they sent loyal representatives to Congress. Before discussing the
                        policy of the President relative to the admission of the representatives
                        from the States lately in rebellion, permit me to say, sir, that, in my
                        judgement, since the formation of this Government there never was a more
                        glaring and notorious usurpation of power than that committed by Andrew
                        Johnson in his attempt to direct the work of reconstruction. The most
                        important question that ever came before the American people for
                        consideration and action was that of the adjustment of the difficulties
                        growing out of the war. The people in ten States had for four years been in
                        rebellion against the constituted authorities of the country, a vast amount
                        of blood and treasure was expended on both sides, the passions and
                        prejudices of the people were excited to a degree common only to such great
                        conflicts; in short, the throes of one of the mightiest revolutions ever
                        enacted in the great drama of human life had developed such a condition of
                        public affairs as required the combined efforts and the collective skill and
                        wisdom of all the departments of the Government.</p>
                    <p>And yet in the midst of this condition of things Andrew Johnson--one man, and
                        a rash, obstinate, impulsive man at that, in a Government where the people
                        rule through their representatives, and under a Constitution which expressly
                        defines the powers and limits the duties of the Chief Magistrate, whose duty
                        it is to execute the laws, and who has no part in making them except to make
                        suggestions to Congress from time to time and to interpose his veto in such
                        matters as he may see proper--assumed the direction and control of the most
                        momentous questions that may ever occur in the life of this nation. His work
                        of restoration was therefore a work of usurpation, wholly unwarranted and
                        unauthorized by the Constitution. But his plan for the readmission of the
                        rebel States was as wrong as his assumption of jurisdiction over the
                        question was illegal and unconstitutional. What was it, and what is it
                        still? It is briefly this, that the act of secession on the part of those
                        States being illegal, and the rebellion having been put down, the people in
                        those States occupy the same position they did before the war, and are at
                        once entitled to immediate representation in the Congress of the United
                        States. And in vindication of this position we are triumphantly asked by the
                        President and his supporters, Did you not say that a State cannot secede;
                        that you were only fighting to preserve the Union? And now, having succeeded
                        in overthrowing the rebellion, you are not willing to have the Union, but
                        insist on its disruption. True, we did say and still believe that a State
                        cannot secede, and that we were contending solely for the preservation of
                        the Union, and thus far we shall have no difference of opinion with you; but
                        as to the question whether States that have rebelled, set up a foreign
                        government, tried to destroy the old Government, waged a wicked war, and
                        been vanquished after a long and bloody struggle, are entitled to stand
                        precisely where they did before the war, and participate in the Government
                        without any limitation or restriction imposed upon them, we do differ most
                        widely.</p>
                    <p>It is contended by the supporters of the President's policy that this is a
                        government of States, and that as no State has a right to secede that it
                        cannot after an unsuccessful war against the General Government be
                        prohibited from exercising the rights of a State in the Union. And further,
                        that as ours is a representative form of government, we are doing violence
                        to our institutions by preventing any part of the people from being
                        represented in the Government. These I believe are the main arguments relied
                        upon by them for the correctness of their position. Let us examine them and
                        see how far they have been true to these principles. In the first place, the
                        argument that this is a Government of States, and that the Union was only a
                        confederacy of States subject to be broken at the will of any State, was the
                        one used by the secessionists for twenty-five years for the purpose of
                        destroying the Union. They held that the State was sovereign, that the Union
                        was only a temporary convenience, and that the State might dissolve it at
                        pleasure, and is it not singular that now, having tried secession and
                        failed, they endeavored to avail themselves of the very opposite doctrine? I
                        hold that this doctrine is incorrect in principle and utterly pernicious and
                        destructive to the very ends of government if carried out. It is not true
                        that this is simply a Government of States. That was the basis upon which
                        the old Union was formed and held together under the Articles of
                        Confederation, but the system was found to be so defective that it was soon
                        done away with. The States, acting upon the principle of their independence,
                        disregarded the power of the General Government, and the latter was soon
                        without power or authority among the States and without respect among other
                        nations. The very weakness of the General Government was what occasioned the
                        subsequent formation of the Federal Government under which we live. And,
                        sir, while it is true that the Constitution of the United States is the
                        fundamental chart by which we are to be governed, I contend that our fathers
                        did more than to limit by express words what the Government could or could
                        not do. When they created the Government of the United States they created a
                        nation from which the very necessities of its creation and existence was
                        entitled to powers and rights as such which are not defined in the
                        Constitution. Among these is the right to do all things necessary for its
                        preservation as such.</p>
                    <p>Had we not acted upon this principle we would have been destroyed at the very
                        outset of the war, for we were then told that there was no power and
                        authority under the Constitution to coerce a State. Is it not singular that
                        this doctrine of the power of the States and the want of power in the
                        Constitution to coerce them was used both to destroy and to create? By this
                        sophistry they would have permitted the States to destroy the Union without
                        molestation, because they told us there was no power in the Constitution to
                        coerce them, and then when the States have been vanquished after a severe
                        struggle, we are told that they still maintain their status under the
                        Constitution, and charge us with being disunionists because we do not at
                        once admit them. To show not only the utter absurdity but absolute danger
                        there is in this wicked doctrine of State rights, it is necessary to inquire
                        what constitutes a State and wherein is the power for evil. A State is
                        composed of three things: first, a given area of territory; second, a
                        certain number of people; and third, local municipal law. It is manifest
                        that the territory can do no harm, except in so far as it may serve by
                        natural defenses to aid the people in their work of rebellion. The local
                        municipal law is the creature of the people, and can only be made an
                        instrument of danger to the Government provided the people so will it. It
                        follows, then, that of these three necessary elements that form a State, the
                        only danger to be apprehended by the Government is from the people that
                        constitute the State.</p>
                    <p>But we are told that no matter what the mind and heart of the people may be,
                        no matter how hostile they are, and how ready they may be to destroy the
                        General Government, and how much they may have done to destroy it, through
                        the instrumentality of these lifeless corporations called the States, they
                        are entitled to hold all the rights and privileges of the peaceable and
                        loyal citizens of the Government. The whole people of a State may rebel, the
                        people of ten States may rebel, and you have no power under the Constitution
                        of the United States to coerce them because these indestructible things
                        called the States dare not be interfered with. The people of those States
                        after a long and desolating war may be overcome, and they are immediately
                        invested with all the rights of American citizens by the aid of these
                        immutable corporations called the States. Sir, that is the doctrine of
                        national ruin, of national death. The people indignantly repudiated that
                        doctrine at the beginning of the war; they repudiated it all through the
                        war; and since the war is over they have repudiated it by one of the most
                        sublime national verdicts ever recorded. And although a plan for the
                        restoration of those States was agreed upon in the last session of this
                        Congress by the representatives of the people, and was, together with the
                        policy of the President, submitted to the people for their action in the
                        late campaign, I look upon the decision of the people rather as a
                        condemnation of the President's policy than an expression of opinion in
                        favor of the plan proposed by Congress as the only way to settle our
                        national difficulties.</p>
                    <p>We have, therefore, this all-important question before us, and are charged
                        with the responsibility of deciding it enlightened and guided, as we must
                        be, by the overwhelming voice of those who sent us here. The policy of the
                        President having been completely repudiated by the people who are compelled
                        to look for some other mode of settlement that will be consistent with the
                        wishes of the great body of the American people, and in harmony with those
                        great principles of equal and exact justice that lie at the foundation of
                        our Government. And I do not propose, sir, to embarrass myself with the
                        consideration of the nice and subtle distinctions that are now being made in
                        regard to whether those communities are still States, or whether, having
                        taken up the sword and appealed to arms and been vanquished, they are
                        reduced to the condition of Territories. For whether they are States or
                        Territories, I maintain that the jurisdiction of the loyal States is full,
                        ample, and complete over the question of their admission into the Union. If
                        the doctrine as laid down by Vattel be correct, that--</p>
                    <p>"A civil war breaks the bands of society and government, or at least suspends
                        their force and effect, it produces in the nation two independent parties,
                        who consider each other as enemies and acknowledge no common judge. Those
                        two parties, therefore, must necessarily be considered as thenceforward
                        constituting, at least for a time, two separate bodies, two distinct
                        societies. Though one of these parties may have been to blame, in breaking
                        the unity of the State and resisting the lawful authority, they are not the
                        less divided in fact. Besides, who shall judge them? Who shall pronounce on
                        which side the right or wrong lies? On earth they have no common superior.
                        They stand, therefore, precisely in the same predicament as two nations who
                        engage in a contest, and, being unable to come to an agreement, have
                        recourse to arms."--Vattell's Law of Nations, p.
                        425.</p>
                    <p>Then there can be no doubt as to our power over the question. On the other
                        hand, if that rule does not apply, then I hold that the people of these
                        States, having overthrown their institutions and placed them in an attitude
                        of hostility to the Government, we as the conquering party have the right
                        under that clause of the Constitution which requires that each State shall
                        be guaranteed a republican form of government, to examine their forms of
                        government and determine whether they are in conformity to the Constitution.
                        If we do not possess this right, then all we did during the war was wrong,
                        and the rebel States would have had the right to be represented in Congress
                        during the war, embarrassing us by their votes in council as well as their
                        guns in the field. But President Johnson (if indeed a person who has so
                        completely swung around the circle of opinion that he may be quoted upon
                        either side is entitled to be quoted at all as authority,) has distinctly
                        recognized this right when he demanded from them compliance with certain
                        conditions, before even he would recognize their right to admission, and
                        provided they sent loyal representatives. I may inquire here by what
                        authority he imposes the last condition? If they are entitled as States to
                        representation what power has he to limit their selection to loyal
                        representatives? Does not the fact that he does so limit them upset his
                        whole doctrine of restoration? Whether as States or Territories, then, as we
                        have the power to direct upon what terms they shall be admitted, it remains
                        to be determined what is the safe way out of the difficulties that now
                        surround us.</p>
                    <p>In view of the great struggle that the nation has passed through two things
                        seem to be necessary: first, to enact such legislation as will best provide
                        against like difficulties in the future; and second, to protect in every
                        possible way the people in the South who have been true to the Union,
                        without regard to their race or color. Had the people in those States
                        signified their willingness to accept the amendments to the Constitution by
                        this Congress, we would have been bound in good faith to accept them, but
                        having rejected them it now becomes our duty to enact such further
                        legislation as will thoroughly protect all classes of people. The amendments
                        are necessary as part of the work of reconstruction, declaring as they do
                        who are citizens of the United States, providing against an undue exercise
                        of political power on the part of any State by prohibiting it from including
                        in the basis of representation any class of people who may be denied the
                        right of suffrage, excluding certain rebels from the right to hold office,
                        and declaring the national debt binding upon the nation, while forever
                        prohibiting the payment of any portion of the debt contracted by the rebels.
                        These provisions are all wise and necessary; and as they have been so fully
                        discussed and sanctioned by the great body of the American people I will not
                        dwell upon them here. But in addition to them one thing more is needed, and
                        that is to confer the elective franchise upon all loyal men in those States
                        as provided for in the fourth section of the bill.</p>
                    <p>I believe that this should be done both as a matter of right and expediency.
                        In declaring it to be a matter of right I am aware that I come in conflict
                        with that class of people who believe that this Government was erected
                        expressly for the benefit of the white man. Sir, there never was a more
                        unsound, pernicious doctrine proclaimed than that this is a white man's
                        Government. When the fathers of the Revolution proclaimed the great
                        principles enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, that all men were
                        created free, that they were entitled to certain inalienable rights, among
                        which were life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that "Government
                        derive their just powers from the consent of the governed," they spoke the
                        voice of humanity, asserting its rights in bold and manly terms after
                        centuries of cruelty, oppression and misgovernment. Their platform was no
                        narrow, circumscribed one, but broad enough to cover all creeds, all classes
                        and conditions of men, and whether thoroughly understood by them and acted
                        up to by us in this generation or not, it will ever continue to inspire
                        fresh hope in the heart of mankind, and will serve as the shibboleth of the
                        party of progress in its conflicts with error, until every wrong done to
                        humanity shall be effaced, and the whole family of man be governed by the
                        same broad and generous principles of justice, equality and fraternity.</p>
                    <p>But if we are to be governed in our opinions by the action of our fathers,
                        then we should extend the ballot to the freedmen; for I believe it to be a
                        fact that after the formation of the Government, in every State except one
                        the ballot was given to all free men of color, thus showing that they
                        recognized the right of the colored man to the elective franchise. I hold,
                        however, that in a Government where the people rule, every man who has a
                        stake in the Government should have the ballot for his own protection. His
                        property is liable to taxation for the purpose of defraying the expenses of
                        the Government, his personal services are demanded by the Government in time
                        of war; he is affected by the public legislation of the country in his
                        person and property, then why should he be prohibited from having a voice in
                        the selection of his rulers? The great cry now raised by the advocates for
                        the immediate admission of the rebel representatives is, that we are
                        imposing taxation upon them without representation, but they are not willing
                        to apply this principle to the four million blacks who will now have to bear
                        their share of the burden of the Government. On the contrary, they would
                        have representation without taxation, for they seem exceedingly anxious to
                        represent these same four million blacks whose taxes they do not pay. I
                        claim it further as a right to the black man because he has been true to the
                        Government in her late struggle with treason, while his master, with all the
                        advantages of education, intellectual culture, the right of the ballot, and
                        unlimited political power in a country that had known him only to bestow
                        benefactions upon him, proved a traitor, the poor, untutored, illiterate
                        slave, proved true to the country in which he apparently had little to
                        expect, its highest judicial tribunal having declared that he had no rights
                        in the Government which a white man was bound to respect.</p>
                    <p>But the black man is entitled to the ballot as a matter of protection against
                        the very men who for four years have been in arms to destroy the Government.
                        While you may disfranchise leading traitors, the great body of them will
                        still be permitted to exercise the elective franchise, and as time rolls on
                        and the passions and feelings of this generation are tempered by lapse of
                        time they, too, may be restored to that right. We have seen enough to
                        satisfy even the most skeptical that there exists in the minds of the rebels
                        a deep-seated hatred against the colored race because they would not
                        identify themselves with the cause of their masters. They have shown it in
                        the legislation enacted since the overthrow of the rebellion, by which they
                        have introduced slavery in everything except the name. Sir, it is a solemn,
                        imperative duty that this nation owes to its colored people to protect them
                        against their and the country's foes. It would be a burning, lasting
                        disgrace to the nation were it to hand them over to their enemies. I know of
                        no way in which this protection can be better given than by extending to
                        them the elective franchise. Civil rights bills, Freedman's Bureau bills,
                        and all kindred measures will fail so long as they can be evaded by local
                        legislation; but place that ballot in the hands of the black man and you
                        give him that which insures him respect as well as protection. You send him
                        forth armed with the panoply of the American citizen, wielding that most
                        powerful of all weapons, the ballot--</p>
                    <p>"Which falls<br> Like snow-flakes fall upon the sod,<br> Yet executes a
                        freeman's will<br> As lightning does the will of God."</p>
                    <p>Sir, thus much for the right involved in the question of extending the ballot
                        to freedmen. A few suggestions as to the expediency of it and I am done. I
                        may suggest that in that vast population so lately in armed hostility to the
                        Union it could scarcely be expected that in heart and mind they could for
                        many years to come be friendly to the Government which they have just tried
                        to destroy. As a counterpoise to this hostile element introduced into the
                        Government, will be the infusion into it of the steady patriotism and blind
                        faith of the black population, balancing so much loyalty against so much
                        disloyalty. The bestowal of the elective franchise to the freedman would
                        have a tendency to elevate him and raise him above the condition that his
                        recent release from slavery has left him in. And should we not rather strive
                        to elevate than depress so large a number of people, constituting, as they
                        do, nearly one-seventh of the entire population of the country? Will not the
                        nation be more benefitted by the moral, religious, and political improvement
                        of this large class of people than by permitting them to remain in a state
                        of ignorance and helplessness? And what can be better calculated to infuse
                        hope into the mind, elevate the understanding, and enlighten the conscience
                        of the freedmen, than to invest him with all the rights, duties, and
                        responsibilities of an American citizen? I am not willing to believe, sir,
                        that the elevation of this poor, unfortunate race of people will tend to
                        degrade the white race, but am rather inclined to think that as they rise in
                        the scale of intelligence so will the white race advance to a greater degree
                        of improvement.</p>
                    <p>But it is expedient in another point of view, and that is as a final and
                        complete settlement of the negro question. Since the formation of the
                        Government the condition of the negro has been the vexed question in our
                        politics. The war worked his release from bondage, and with it came the
                        question of his right to citizenship and the ballot. It has been truly said
                        that unsettled questions leave no repose, and especially is this the case in
                        a Government where all questions must stand the test of public discussion.
                        And with the negro asserting his rights, with the mighty intellectual power
                        in the North arrayed upon his side, and with public sentiment fast drifting
                        in that direction, its settlement cannot long be deferred. Sir, confer this
                        right, and not only does the agitation of the question cease, but you
                        approximate nearer to the great fundamental principles upon which our
                        Government rests; the great disturbing element is removed from our
                        body-politic and our institutions will be in harmony with the ideas and
                        principles upon which they were founded. I have no fears in extending this
                        privilege to the black man. I would infinitely rather trust the ballot to
                        the black man who shouldered a musket to defend his Government than to the
                        white traitor who tried to destroy it. The enfranchisement of black
                        loyalists and disfranchisement of certain rebels, or rather suffrage upon a
                        loyal basis, will be the surest protection to the loyal whites of the South.
                        Unless they are re-enforced by the addition of the loyal black element it is
                        perfectly manifest that they will be subjected to rebel rules. In fact, that
                        whole section is almost as completely dominated over by rebel authority as
                        when Lee's battalions held undisputed sway over it. There to have been loyal
                        to the Government is to be subjected to the scorn and hatred of the rebels,
                        and in many sections life itself is endangered by reason of their intense
                        hatred against Unionists.</p>
                    <p>The voice of the loyal whites of the South, who have suffered every
                        conceivable wrong on account of their fidelity to the Union, comes to us
                        demanding in thunder tones that we shall so reconstruct this Government that
                        its friends, and not its enemies, shall rule. We would be untrue to them,
                        untrue to the martyred dead, untrue to ourselves and to posterity, if we
                        disregard their admonitions. Sir, the great duty rests upon us to finish the
                        work which was not completed by warfare. The shackles of four million of
                        slaves were melted by the fierce fires of civil war; but the animus in
                        slavery, its passions and prejudices, yet remain. It is our duty so to
                        legislate as to remove the last relic of a barbarism that would have suited
                        the dark ages, and to conform our institutions to the advanced condition to
                        which we have been brought by the mighty revolution just ended. And when
                        this shall have been done the great Republic, freed from the dark stain of
                        human slavery, will start upon her mission to promulgate, by precept and
                        example, the immutable and eternal truth of the equality of man, and before
                        whose resistless march kingdoms and empires, principalities and powers, and
                        all the systems built upon caste and creed for the oppression of man, will
                        be swept from the face of the earth, and be known no more forever.</p>

<b>The Rebellious States</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the wake of the South's refusal to adopt the proposed amendments to be
                    readmitted to the union, Congress has passed two new bills to deal with the
                    "existing evils" present in the region, report the editors. The first
                    "obliterates at one blow the sham government organized by traitors" in
                    Louisiana, and "provides for the creation of a loyal government, by the loyal
                    people ... without regard to color or caste--disfranchising all who have
                    actively participated in the rebellion." The second, the Military Reconstruction
                    Bill proposed by Thad Stevens, places the "rebellious states under martial law."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The action of Congress last week indicates something like a settled purpose
                        touching the rebellious States. The proposed amendments to the constitution
                        were virtually submitted to the Southern people by the last session, and had
                        they been promptly adopted, and their laws made to conform thereto in good
                        faith, their admission to representation would inevitably have followed, and
                        negro suffrage would have fallen in the adjustment. But, with terms so
                        generous presented, and an apostate Executive ready to shield the rebels
                        from any and every penalty for their crime, they contemptuously rejected the
                        amendments, and spurned the magnanimous proffer of peace and restoration.</p>
                    <p>Thus admonished by the obstinacy of treason, the present session was
                        compelled to begin the work of restoration anew. The Memphis, New Orleans
                        and other appalling butcheries, together with the concurrent testimony of
                        Union men everywhere in the South, and the Generals in command there,
                        awakened the nation to the relentless savagery of traitors against all who
                        had not shared their treason, and the chief labor of the present session has
                        been to devise proper measures to restore government, law and safety in the
                        insurgent States. At last the desired point appears to be well nigh reached,
                        and the persistent treachery of the leading rebels seems again, as often in
                        the past, to be ready to give the nation a higher measure of the fruition of
                        Freedom's triumph.</p>
                    <p>Two bills have passed the popular branch of Congress within the last few
                        days, both of which strike at the very vitals of treason's power. Mr.
                        Elliot's bill for the government of Louisiana was the result of the careful
                        investigation into the atrocious massacre of Union men, by the select
                        committee of which Mr. Eliot was chairman. It obliterates at one blow the
                        sham government organized by traitors to serve the purposes of treason in
                        that State, and provides for the creation of a loyal government, by the
                        loyal people only of Louisiana, without regard to color or
                        caste--disfranchising all who have actively participated in rebellion. This
                        measure is deemed necessary to give such a government as will afford
                        security to the persons and property of all classes, and it brings home to
                        unrepentant traitors the wholesome lesson that henceforth each new step in
                        the work of reconstruction necessitated by their hostility to the
                        government, will be marked by more stringent discriminations in favor of
                        loyalty and against the disloyal. The bill applies only to Louisiana, but,
                        if it becomes necessary, it will hereafter be made applicable to all the
                        rebellious States. It is still pending in the Senate, but its final passage,
                        either by this Congress, or by the next in early March, seems to be fully
                        assured.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens achieved another of his great parliamentary triumphs last week by
                        the passage of his Military Reconstruction bill. Practically the effect of
                        the bill is to place the rebellious States under martial law--at least the
                        civil authority is subordinated to the military whenever the civil powers
                        fail to administer justice; and it teaches to all that in the work of
                        restoration there shall be submission to the loyal judgement of the nation.
                        At the time of this writing we are not advised of the fate of the bill in
                        the Senate; but enough is known to warrant the belief that the bill will
                        ultimately become a law without material modification. Both these bills may
                        fail this Congress, which expires on the 4th of March; but the 40th Congress
                        will meet on the 5th of March, and they will doubtless be re-enacted and
                        passed finally over the veto.</p>
                    <p>Neither of the bills refused to look directly to Reconstruction. They are
                        measures framed to meet existing evils, but they fix no boundaries to the
                        subjection of the rebellious States to Congressional rule. That this is so
                        because the South has resisted every proposed measure for restoration, is
                        manifestly true; but there is a growing sentiment among the Republican
                        members that these measures should definitely proclaim the terms on which
                        rebellious States can be restored. To attain this end, Mr. Blaine, of Maine,
                        proposed an amendment to Mr. Steven's bill, a section providing that when
                        the proposed amendments to the constitution shall be ratified by the
                        necessary number of States, the rebel States may claim admission and
                        representation by adopting the amendments, making their constitutions and
                        laws, by the vote of the people, conform faithfully thereto, extend suffrage
                        to all male citizens of age, rebels and negroes, and present representatives
                        who can take the oath,--Congress to determine upon the republican character
                        of such constitutions. Mr. Stevens earnestly and successfully resisted this
                        amendment, and sent his bill to the Senate without it; but the discussion in
                        the Senate, and the close vote in the House, indicate clearly that the
                        tendency in Congress is to present some final proposition to the South, upon
                        the acceptance of which the work of reconstruction shall be complete.</p>
                    <p>We do not understand whether Mr. Stevens resisted the Blaine amendment
                        because he is opposed to its provisions, or whether he feared it might peril
                        his bill. We doubt not that he shares the earnest desire of the whole
                        country for a prompt settlement of the grave issues involved in restoration.
                        The people, with one accord, desire finality--not as in other days when
                        finality meant concession to wrong, but finality in harmony with the logical
                        results of the war, securing to all impartial rights and maintaining
                        universal justice. We do not see wherein the Blaine amendment is essentially
                        defective. True it confers almost universal suffrage upon rebels along with
                        all freedmen; but will any successful adjustment measure do less? It is
                        explicit in its demand for positive obedience and conformity to the
                        principles of the amendments, and reserves to Congress the right to judge of
                        the republican character of the organic and statute laws of the States. Upon
                        the whole we regard it with favor, and would have rejoiced at its adoption.
                        There may be reasons why it should not be accepted of which we are not
                        advised; but if it is seriously defective, we entreat Congress to propose
                        something better that will define the conditions upon which there may be
                        restoration.</p>
                    <p>Congress may dispute as it likes as to the legal status of the rebellious
                        States, but the people care little for such abstractions. They have been
                        treated as out of the Union, and as wanting in every attribute of
                        sovereignty, by every branch of the government--Executive, including both
                        Lincoln and Johnson, legislative, judicial and military, and it is too late
                        to wrangle over the legal signification of terms in restoring them. They are
                        out in fact--have been so for six years, and the people want them in as soon
                        as it can be done on the basis of perpetual peace and Union.</p>

<b>Political Compromises</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite President Johnson's recent entreaties to Republicans to reach a
                    compromise on Reconstruction, the editors question his motives, noting that the
                    "Republican party can have no faith nor approbation for the man who has so
                    wantonly and wickedly betrayed it."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are regaled almost daily with reports from Washington of a compromise
                        between prominent Republicans and the President, and at times the rumor
                        comes with a minuteness of detail that wears a most plausible aspect.</p>
                    <p>We do not doubt that Andrew Johnson would be glad to make a compromise with
                        Congress. Having no hope for the success of his own policy, being powerless
                        to accomplish anything for the faithless men with whom he cast his lot, and
                        smarting under the decisive condemnation of the people, why should he not
                        compromise? He has but one element of power, and he constantly flaunts it in
                        the faces of Congressmen who have friends they would be glad to serve.
                        Principles he has none that are not at war with every requisite of loyalty;
                        but he has offices and plunder, and with these he is ever ready to drag any
                        weak, straggling Congressman into his fatal favor. We notice that in
                        exceptional instances he has appointed tried and faithful Republicans to
                        office; but did he do so from choice?--or did he do so for a consideration
                        in the shape of promised support in his renewed effort to debauch Congress?</p>
                    <p>Congress and the people would both rejoice, we doubt not, to meet the
                        President on any ground that would not peril anew the national life and all
                        the deeply crimsoned attributes of Freedom and Justice; but it is not such a
                        compromise that Andrew Johnson desires. He aims to get all for treason that
                        it desires, and failing in that, he next aims to get all he can for it. He
                        can consent to no compromise that does not make loyalty a reproach in the
                        rebellious States, and a Congress just instructed amidst the highest surges
                        of the President's perfidy cannot, dare not, turn from the path of right to
                        make terms with traitors. It is possible Congress could proffer terms the
                        rebellious States might accept, but however magnanimous the basis of
                        reconstruction may be made, let it come as the mature judgement of Congress
                        and with the inexorable decree that it shall prevail. We insist that it is a
                        question, and solely a question for the loyal people to adjust through their
                        representatives, and he who counsels with treason, but postpones or
                        embarrasses restoration.</p>
                    <p>Politically the Republican party can have no faith nor approbation for the
                        man who has so wantonly and wickedly betrayed it. Doubtless many good men
                        would be glad to have his patronage, and we should be glad to aid them in
                        attaining them; but until they can enjoy it with honor, and without the
                        sacrifice of principle, every true Republican will spurn his power and his
                        bribe. If he shall propose such men for important positions without
                        conditions amounting to an imitation of his own treachery, no one could
                        complain of their acceptance; but so long as his admirers are the leading
                        copperheads of the North and the most defiant rebels of the South, no
                        Republican can hope to enjoy his patronage without immediate or ultimate
                        disgrace.</p>
                    <p>While, upon the surface, it would seem that reconstruction is the purpose of
                        those who are endeavoring to conciliate the President, we cannot doubt that
                        his plunder is, in most cases at least, the mainspring of action, and those
                        who are thus desiring to lead the Republican party into the outer circles of
                        Johnsonism, cannot too soon learn that their task is a hopeless one. The
                        Republican party has shown that it can survive Andrew Johnson's apostasy;
                        that it can maintain its ascendency in defiance of his patronage, and that
                        it can live in triumph when he shall have passed away; but it cannot survive
                        complicity, in any degree, with his betrayal of his great trust, at any
                        price. There are, we fear, a few hungry Congressmen who need to learn this
                        lesson!</p>

<b>The Pardoning Power</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors offer a plan to streamline the pardon-granting process and make
                    it more equitable in its application. To accomplish this, they call for the
