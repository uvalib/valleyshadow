                    <p>In his closing speech on the reconstruction question, Mr. Stevens takes
                        occasion to say that the Republican majority in Congress "has agreed that
                        the States lately in rebellion are conquered territory." Immediately upon
                        the close of the war, Mr. Stevens advanced the theory, then peculiarly his
                        own, that the Southern States, having engaged in an insurrection which
                        became in time magnified to the proportions of a rebellion, and so powerful
                        as to command the recognition by our own, as well as other governments, of
                        belligerent rights, became for all political purposes a foreign power,
                        subject in case of ultimate defeat and overthrow to all the liabilities of a
                        conquered enemy, with no other rights than those allowed by the laws of war,
                        the laws of nations and the laws of humanity. So far as we can recollect, he
                        advanced this theory and argued for its recognition with but little sympathy
                        either in or out of Congress. It was regarded generally as dangerous ground,
                        and as a theory revolutionary in its character. The Republican party
                        generally accepted the fact that rebellion had placed the Southern States
                        outside of practical relations with the Union, and insisted that on general
                        principles the work of restoration and reconstruction should be committed to
                        Congress; but Mr. Stevens stood alone at first in maintaining that the
                        rebellion had consummated the work of secession so far as the liabilities of
                        the States to the government were concerned, and that they are in
                        consequence of the failure of the rebellion conquered territory. The
                        difference between Mr. Stevens and those of his party who opposed him was
                        just this--he insisted that our arms had conquered a government, owing, by
                        its own repeated declarations, no allegiance to the United States; they
                        maintained that we had merely suppressed a rebellion, which by its magnitude
                        and long continuance had disordered and confused the political relations of
                        the States that had engaged in it. Mr. Stevens' view, if correct, would make
                        these States for all political purposes conquered territory, and entirely
                        dependent upon Congress. The other would simply warrant Congress, by virtue
                        of supreme necessity, in restoring order and government to those States
                        under constitutional restraints and restrictions. According to Mr. Stevens'
                        view, the constitution could impose no restraint to congressional action,
                        that instrument being a compact between States and not applying to
                        territories, no matter how acquired. No direct issue was ever made between
                        these opposing theories. Reconstruction was allowed to progress independent
                        of theory but governed by necessity. Congress legislated upon the subject
                        not on the basis of any particular theory, but as circumstances demanded and
                        the necessities of the country required. The result of it all is
                        unquestionably a practical recognition of the soundness of Mr. Stevens'
                        view. On no other ground can the legislation of Congress be justified. It
                        implies a total forfeiture of rights by the rebellious States and assumes a
                        sovereign power in Congress to govern, direct and control them so long as
                        they remain in their present condition. Mr. Stevens' assertion therefore is
                        warranted by the facts of the case. He is equally correct when he says that
                        we would have had but very little trouble in reconstructing the government
                        had we recognized the principle at the outset. Once concede the Southern
                        States to be <emph rend="italic">conquered territory</emph> and the whole
                        problem is solved. The supreme power becomes lodged in Congress and no other
                        department of the government can interfere with its exercise of that power.
                        That power extends not only over the political relations and conditions of
                        the territory, but by the laws of war, and subject to them, is made to
                        embrace even the lives and the property of its people. Reconstruction as
                        applied to them would mean simply admission as States, just as any other
                        territory is built up into States, and by the same power.</p>
                    <p>A twelve months experience has done more to make Congress of one mind on this
                        important subject than all of Mr. Stevens arguments, unanswerable as they
                        were. Instead of standing alone as he did at first, he is supported by
                        nearly all who then opposed him. The events of the last year has justified
                        his predictions, and the country regards his views as completely
                    vindicated.</p>

                <summary>Although Thad Stevens stood alone when he first articulated the view that
                    the southern states held the status of a "foreign power" after they rose up in
                    rebellion against the Union, this position is now widely accepted in Congress,
                    say the editors. As a result, there is a general consensus within that body that
                    the southern states are to be treated as a "conquered territory," a decision
                    that "implies a total forfeiture of rights by the rebellious States and assumes
                    a sovereign power in Congress to govern, direct and control them so long as they
                    remain in their present condition." Thus Congress will have the final word on
                    the terms for reconstructing the Union.</summary>
