<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article lists the results of the recent elections, and asserts that
                    "things were a little mixed up" in Chambersburg; The Democrats did not nominate
                    a full ticket, choosing instead to place Republicans to fill it up. As a
                    consequence, there was spirited effort among many Republicans to defeat those
                    candidates fearing they would support Democratic initiatives. In some areas
                    Democrats refused to vote for the fusion tickets, inserting the phrase "'can't
                    vote for niger,'" or in some instances writing in the name of a black person.<br>(Names in announcement:  Abram Hafer,  John Cobel,  Jacob Oyer,  Samuel Kiefer,  Frederick Mish,  Andrew Beard,  John Weaver,  Samuel West,  Daniel Homman,  William Bossert,  John C.
