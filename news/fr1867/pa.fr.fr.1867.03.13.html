                    "could not elect their just proportion of Delegates under the legislative
                    apportionment." To overcome these impediments, the editors offer a solution that
                    calls for the election of thirty men--fifteen from each party--to oversee the
                    reform efforts at a constitutional convention.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The 39th Congress did not adjourn without having accomplished a great deal of
                        good work. Notwithstanding the check upon legislation that the President's
                        opposition would naturally create, the members generally have proceeded in
                        that path of duty indicated so unmistakably by the determined and
                        over-powering sentiment of the country. The North
                            American sums up the leading measures of the session as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The bill establishing universal and impartial suffrage in the District of
                        Columbia without distinction of race or color has become a law over the
                        President's veto, and the first election has been held under it, and has
                        resulted in a Republican triumph.</p>
                    <p>2. In like manner the bill establishing universal and impartial suffrage in
                        all the territories of the republic has been enacted into a law over the
                        veto, and thus terminates the validity of all territorial laws that
                        disfranchise a man on account of race or color. By the operation of this
                        bill the colored man will have a right to vote in Colorado despite the
                        unfriendly statutes of the territorial Legislature, and all efforts to
                        disfranchise the colored citizen in territories like New Mexico, Montana,
                        Arizona and Idaho are rendered useless. This act will not enfranchise the
                        Chinamen in California and Nevada, but it will have the effect of attracting
                        them from those States to the gold mining territories, where they will be
                        voters.</p>
                    <p>3. The Military Reconstruction bill, of which we have heretofore spoken at
                        length, has become a law over the veto. It establishes military protection
                        for freedmen and Union men in the South, fixes terms of readmission for the
                        rebel States, declares the existing governments of those States provisional,
                        and secures the right of suffrage forthwith to every adult colored man in
                        all the elections therein.</p>
                    <p>4. A bill to regulate the tenure of national civil offices has become a law
                        over the veto. It puts an end to the capricious removals for political
                        reasons that have disgraced the present Administration, and renders the
                        official no longer a mere dependent on the Executive pleasure. It deprives
                        the President of much of the power he has wielded for corrupt purposes.</p>
                    <p>5. The amendatory Tax bill has become a law, with the President's signature.
                        It reduces the income tax, the manufacturers tax, and many other imposts, to
                        the extent of at least seventy millions per annum.</p>
                    <p>6. An amendatory Tariff bill has been passed relating mainly to the duties on
                        wool and woolen goods, and intended to benefit chiefly the west.</p>
                    <p>7. Nebraska has been formerly admitted as a State, despite a Presidential
                        veto.</p>
                    <p>8. A bill has been passed authorizing an issue of loan certificates at a
                        little over three per cent. interest, to the extent of fifty millions of
                        dollars, to provide for the redemption of the accruing compound interest
                        notes.</p>
                    <p>9. An act has been passed providing for the suppression of the abominable
                        institution of peonage in New Mexico and other territories.</p>
                    <p>10. Payments to slaveholders for slaves enlisted as soldiers have been
                        directed to stop.</p>
                    <p>11. A national bankrupt law has been enacted.</p>
                    <p>12. All future danger of a legislative interregnum, such as happened in 1861,
                        at the outset of the rebellion, has been obviated by the passage of an act
                        providing for the meeting of every new Congress on the first day of its
                        term, March 4.</p>
                    <p>13. An act has been passed providing for the acceptance of League Island as a
                        site for the iron-clad naval station.</p>
                    <p>14. An act has been passed establishing a department of education as a part
                        of the national government.</p>
