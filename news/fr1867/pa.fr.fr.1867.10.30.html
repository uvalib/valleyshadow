<b>Reflections on our Defeat</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Seeking an answer to explain the Republicans' poor showing in the last
                    election, the editors blame the evil lurking within man. These sentiments, they
                    avow, can be found in the Democrats' policies.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Whatever of evil exists in the world is, ordinarily, and doubtless with
                        truth, attributed to the Devil. His agency in promoting secession and his
                        purpose, the bolstering for an indefinite series of years of a favorite
                        institution, slavery, are facts firmly held by every loyal mind. The utter
                        failure of the movement in behalf of wrong is regarded, accordingly, as a
                        triumph over diabolical interference. We are taught, however, that the arch
                        enemy is pertinacious and industrious, and we may well believe that the
                        bitterness of disappointment is but an incentive to fresh attempts upon the
                        integrity of our hated race. As he plied Job with argument and vexed him
                        with sophistry, by the mouths of his own familiars, after calamity and grief
                        had but illustrated the constancy of the man, it would not be unprecedented,
                        were resort, now, discoverably, to be had to the same expedients since the
                        circumstances are so strikingly the same. For, as with Job, under the
                        pressure of the greatest calamities endured by any people wide spread
                        bereavement and universal loss--the national conscience grew the more
                        steadily in strength to the acknowledgement of national wrong and the
                        general resolve became but the firmer to do right in pursuance of belief.
                        The strain of vehement trial rooted conviction more deeply; delays quickened
                        impatience, disappointment incited to fresh efforts difficulty inspired
                        zeal; emulation prompted sacrifice and fervor opened martyrdom as the
                        gateway to success. Out of the war came a people, chastened, purified,
                        enlightened, ennobled, and cheered because triumphant.</p>
                    <p>But the embers of a triumph often light the watch fires of the foe. Evil is
                        deathless and survives defeat. Men are not made to act the hero's part
                        through life's whole round, nor people to sustain the constant stress of the
                        sublime. However it may be, and is, where great interests are at stake,
                        rousing strong passions and making the otherwise impracticable possible,
                        even certain; it is, experience shows, quite as probable as it is natural,
                        that indifference will follow with the inevitable reaction of exhaustion. In
                        such a slough are we mired today. The elections point this moral. The
                        devices of the adversary show that he knows it. Prejudice and ignobler
                        passions are never so alive as when their masters, enlightenment and the
                        virtues, are wearied and sluggishly content with their work. The six years
                        of this decade have been glorious ones for our people. A huge sin desisted
                        from; the sole cause of distraction removed from the land; a narrow,
                        jealous, false, theory of government exploded; the true and its accordant
                        policy established; it is not wonderful, though unfortunate, that they, who
                        have wrought all this should grow inert, because complacent. Hence the
                        disasters of yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Steadfastness is the price of supremacy. They who fought and won so often, so
                        long, must gird themselves for other battles. The field it's true is
                        changed, the tactics of the enemy altered. Troops of Sabeans and Chaldeans
                        no longer slay our young men with the sword, nor carry away our camels, in
                        the hope of deferring our manhood from a further persistence in uprightness
                        and of shaking our faith in truth, but Satanic industry was never busier in
                        pouring into our eats by familiar voices, the juggleries of sophistry and
                        untruth.</p>
                    <p>Whence come the suggestions, that after the bloodiest civil war of history,
                        causeless save for the deliberate resolve to uphold the most stupendous of
                        all crimes--a war the authors of which are guilty of every sin enumerated in
                        the decalogue, a thousand times committed, all unrepented of and unatoned
                        for--that these murderers, robbers, burglars, thieves should be reinvested
                        with the rights of citizenship, without punishment and without bail, that
                        enormity of offence ought to insure impunity to the offender and, that the
                        injured are the gainers by forbearance; that a people staggering under a
                        load of debt can best relieve themselves by dishonesty, by repudiation; and
                        that the ignorance which our own injustice enforced upon a captive race is
                        the best reason for perpetuating their inferiority and our own wrong? If
                        they do not spring direct from the author of all evil they belie their
                        looks.</p>
                    <p>The whisperers of these suggestions reckon on the weaknesses of humanity and
                        their recent successes testify to their shrewdness. Will we consent to an
                        unqualified restoration of criminals; will we sully our integrity by
                        breaking our plighted faith with them who fought for us and who sustained us
                        by their substance; will we sink our liberated Helots into a new serfdom;
                        will we not rather so guard our peace that malcontents, hereafter, will seek
                        other climes as a refuge for their griefs, and, supplying their places with
                        the zealous and true of any race or color, make good our claim to the name
                        of an invincible because an upright and a truthful people? These questions
                        must be answered when next we gather to the ballot box.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>VIRGINIA has decided in favor of a constitutional convention by a majority of
                        perhaps twenty thousand. She thus expresses her acceptance of the terms
                        offered her by Congress, and earnestly enters upon the work of restoration.
                        Her convention will contain a radical majority of twenty at least, and the
                        speedy consummation of the work is thus assured. The result gloriously
                        vindicates the wisdom and justice of the Congressional plan of
                        reconstruction. Virginia will be restored, not as an oligarchy, but as a
                        model Republican State, based upon pure democratic principles. Henceforth
                        her government will be directed and controlled not by any particular class
                        but by her people. She presented a spectacle at her last election that
                        should confound the enemies of popular government, and an example that other
                        States may profit by studying. Without distinction of race or color her
                        people all participated, with a regard for law and order that would have
                        been remarkable in her former history. She has rebuked those who predicted a
                        war of races no less emphatically than those who have all along asserted
                        that the negro population of the South was not qualified to exercise the
                        great franchises of American freemen. The result proves what any impartial
                        mind would have accepted without actual demonstration, that hostility
                        between the races if it comes at all, must come through the oppression of
                        one, rather than from the enjoyment of equal rights by both. It further
                        proves a stern devotion to principles by Blacks upon which we can build in
                        perfect safety.</p>
                    <p>We rejoice in the triumph because it assures us of the speedy consummation of
                        the great work of reconstruction, and indicates an early and happy
                        pacification of our country.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A recent visitor in the oil regions of Pennsylvania describes the desolation
                        which reigns in a once famous locality. Between Oil City and Meadville, not
                        one well is in operation. It is only a long line of rotting derricks, and
                        rusted boilers and engines. At Franklin, where the French creek empties into
                        the Allegheny, they show with pride the great court house that they are
                        building, the tall marble monument to the martyrs of the war, and the
                        tumbling down farm-house of the Evans family. Three years ago, $100,000 were
                        offered to this family for their house and ground. The offer was refused as
                        too moderate; and the daughter of the house, in the flush of sudden wealth,
                        scorned her rustic lover, and cancelled her engagement. Now the estate
                        house, farm and all, will not bring $1,000, the daughter in single
                        blessedness, and the family can only remember in their present misery, their
                        former hope.</p>
