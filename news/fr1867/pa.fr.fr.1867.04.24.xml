                    take several months and cover an estimated 8,000 miles.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The press of all parties in Pennsylvania, with one accord, demand a thorough,
                        radical, sweeping Reform in the character of our legislators. They do not
                        all agree upon the best method of protecting the people by organic
                        amendment, against future repetitions of the shameless debauchery of last
                        winter, but they all do agree that unless the character of our legislature
                        is entirely changed, by the destruction of the seething fountain of
                        corruption in the selection of representatives, there will be an end of all
                        safety to person, property or public reputation in Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>We need not multiply evidences of the necessity of reform. They are as so
                        overwhelming and so thicken about us on every hand, that party lines would
                        be but as chaff in an effort to explain or defend them. To no class,
                        condition or political persuasion of voters in Pennsylvania is this
                        conviction confined; but the condemnation of the last legislature and the
                        demand for a substantial improvement in their successors, is as wide spread
                        as our commonwealth, and as universal as suffrage itself. Past legislatures
                        have been remiss, doubtless measurably corrupt, and it may be had no more
                        honest legislators than the last; but never before in the history of any
                        legislature, in any State, did venality so openly and insolently crown
                        itself supreme in the very temple of power, and persistently defy every
                        earnest wish, and every vital interest of the people.</p>
                    <p>Had the legislature responded to the appeal of nine-tenths of the press that
                        had supported them and allowed the people to say for themselves whether they
                        wish reform, and to what extent they desired it, there would have been at
                        least the shade of a silver lining to the cloud of obloquy that hangs about
                        our law-making power; but, faithful to their corrupt instincts and to their
                        habitual defiance of the wishes of their constituents, they would not so
                        much as consider the proposition. Had they allowed the people to speak,
                        there would have been a Convention called in October next by over one
                        hundred thousand majority, and at the same time Delegates would have been
                        chosen thereto of unspotted integrity and inflexible purpose, whose action
                        would have ended the blistering stain of our system of legislation for all
                        time to come. We would have received a largely increased representation,
                        brought the representative into immediate relations with, and responsibility
                        to, the people of his single district; limited the powers of the legislature
                        solely to general legislation; denied it the right under any circumstances,
                        to confer special corporate authority; limited its power over appropriations
                        to public purposes; limited the time and pay of members, and transferred all
                        its special powers, now exercised to the exclusion of public interests, to
                        the judiciary of the State. With such a radical change in the organic law,
                        future legislatures could not, if they would, become the mere instruments of
                        corruptionists, and the interests of the people would be safe in their
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>But the last legislature denied the people the opportunity to attain reform
                        because to have granted it would have been a reflection upon itself. It was
                        unwilling to confess, what its constituents could not conceal if they would,
                        that the people had ceased to hope for good from its deliberations, and
                        waited patiently until they could rejoice at its adjournment. Now the people
                        have to act again. This great question will come up in review before them.
                        They cannot reach constitutional reform this year; but they can attain it by
                        another year. It will not do to attempt to redeem our legislative powers by
                        the selection of better men. Good and true men should be nominated--indeed
                        must be if any party would hope for success--but if the effort for reform
                        shall stop there, it will be futile. The people should support no man for
                        the legislature, who does not positively pledge himself to allow the people
                        to determine for themselves whether they want constitutional reform or not,
                        and even then they should not vote for any candidate, no matter by whom
                        nominated, whose reputation for integrity is not a guarantee against
                        debauchery and perfidy. This shameless, insolent defiance of the wishes of
                        the people must end, or the party through which it is done must cease to
                        legislate for the State.</p>
                    <p>We know that no party can plead exemption from this great crime against the
                        people, but the Republican party has been the party of power for years past,
                        and it therefore has a much larger measure of responsibility for the
                        integrity of its acts. Whatever the Democrats may do in the matter, the
                        Republicans must guarantee to the long shamed and betrayed people of our
                        State the reform they so earnestly demand, and the time has come when, if we
                        fail to do so, we must invite inevitable disaster.</p>

                <summary>Although they differ over the best method to accomplish the goal, the
                    editors assert, Democratic and Republican journals throughout Pennsylvania do
                    agree that reform must be undertaken to halt the "seething fountain of
                    corruption in the selection of representatives." The editors contend that the
                    "people should support no man for the legislature who does not positively pledge
                    himself to allow the people to determine for themselves whether they want
                    constitutional reform or not."</summary>

                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>No. XXV.<lb/> Wilkinsburg, Pa., April 18, 1867.</p>
                    <p>There is considerable anxiety now to know how the enfranchised Freedmen will
                        vote. Formerly negroes voted in New Jersey, and a candidate sent to an old
                        negro preacher two barrels of nice potatoes. Next meeting day he exhorted
                        his hearers on the duty of voting and difference between Whigs and
                        Democrats. He told the story of the receipt of the potatoes and added:</p>
                    <p>"My Bredren, some tell you vote for de Whigs, some tell you vote for de
                        Democrats, but I tell you, vote whar you git de taters!"</p>
                    <p>It is probable that most men "vote whar they git de taters," or in other
                        words, as their interest prompts, and if there is a class of voters in this
                        country, who can understand where their votes will most accrue to their
                        pecuniary advantage, that class is the southern negro. Centuries of
                        oppression have done for them, what they did for the Jews, viz.: made them
                        sharp if not sharpers. The negro, in this country, has been excluded from
                        all honors except very limited opportunities for getting wealth. In the
                        South especially they have learned to estimate men by their wealth; and no
                        class of our citizens set so high a value on money, or knew better where
                        pecuniary advantage is likely to grow out of any particular policy. The
                        party which makes it most the interest of the negro to vote for its men and
                        measures, is the party that will get the negro vote. Small bribery or
                        cajolery will not go so far with them, as most people think. It is doubtful
                        if many of them would refuse a bribe, but equally doubtful if they would not
                        sell the man who bought them, and vote directly opposite to contract.</p>
                    <p>The old question "can the negro take care of himself?" has, to me, long ago
                        changed into that other question "can white folks take care of themselves on
                        equal, legal footing with the negro?" I think I have never seen a
                        wire-pulling politician so shrewd that an ordinary field hand could not
                        circumvent him. They have an intuitive insight into character--a habit of
                        looking for concealed motives--a tact in concealing their opinions and
                        learning those of others, and a readiness in assuming a character to suit
                        the occasion, which I have never seen equaled in any other people. They will
                        let no sentimental ideas of gratitude, for past favors, lead them to throw
                        away their votes on ideas not likely to pay, and if their vote will not make
                        radicalism triumphant in their district, and radicalism is not most for
                        their advantage, they will vote conservatism, and <emph rend="italic">vice
                            versa</emph>.</p>
                    <p>They are what oppression has made them, and if they were models of
                        disinterested patriotism, it would be an unanswerable argument in favor of
                        slavery. Fortunately their interests are identical with freedom and
                        progress, and therefore the party of freedom and progress may count upon
                        their votes. The party which gives them land and schools, is the party which
                        most advances the prosperity of the country and gives them a chance, and
                        they will vote themselves farms, as surely as they have learned, in the
                        school of privation, the great need of them. If the Republican party expects
                        their votes because it very unwillingly gave them freedom, and the power to
                        vote, the Republican party has reckoned without its host. They want homes on
                        the soil they have watered for centuries with their blood and tears, and
                        there is not a man, woman or child over ten years old of them, who does not
                            <emph rend="italic">know</emph> that their ancestors have earned every
                        acre of land in Dixie. They will not ask it all, or the half of it, and most
                        of them would be content to buy, at low rates, but they have "land on the
                        brain." They will pray for land, and work for land, and vote for land, and
                        primers and spelling books, and school houses and meeting houses, and
                        teachers and preachers, and something good to eat and something nice to
                        wear, handsome furniture and gardens full of flowers. They are a sensuous
                        people, and want all the good things of this life, and the most beautiful
                        heaven in the next. They are a people of boundless wants and great
                        capabilities. No use trying to satisfy them with words. They are accustomed
                        to white men's promises, and deeds will be necessary to securing their
                        support to any party. If the Republican party represents Mr. Stevens' policy
                        of dividing the large estates and selling or giving them in small farms to
                        honest, industrious men and Mr. Julian's policy of giving the freedmen
                        homesteads on the public lands, the Republican party will have no trouble in
                        getting the negro vote in the Southern States, but if its policy represents
                        no material good to the negro, the negro will be very indifferent to its
                        success.</p>
                    <p>The Republicans are somewhat divided in opinion just now, as to what Democrat
                        they ought to elect as the next President; and a majority seem inclined to
                        Gen. Grant. That delightful uncertainty about his political opinions, which
                        makes him to be claimed by both parties and all parties, has a charm for
                        Republicans, which appears irresistible. As the General is most likely to
                        fight it out on this line of non-commitalism, it will scarce be worth while
                        to raise an opposition to his nomination; for a Democrat who has given some
                        reason to doubt his adherence to his party or its measures, has a
                        fascination for Republicans. There is such a mystery about General Grant's
                        opinions, on any and every question, that it keeps folk on the <emph
                            rend="italic">qui vive</emph>; like Signor Blitz's little ball and
                        thimble, now it is here, now it is there, and now where is it? The General
                        winks, and lo, some one has divined just what he thinks on the
                        Reconstruction bill. He does not wink, and we have his ideas on negro
                        suffrage; but presently he sneezes and alas, we were all wrong in our
                        surmises!</p>
                    <p>General Grant's opinion is the "little joker" which the unsophisticated in
                        vain try to follow from thimble to thimble. No one doubts that it is "all
                        right," and if there is say one in the country with whom Gen. Grant does not
                        agree in his political opinions, that one must be a rare specimen of
                        himself. Wendell Phillips and Mayor Monroe can unite on Grant, and so he is
                        the great pacificator, but the principal reason why the Republicans should
                        elect him is that he is no Republican. If he had been identified with that
                        party, and bore the scars of battle in defence of its principles, if he had
                        won the enmity of its enemies by his devotion to its men and measures, of
                        course he would be ineligible as a candidate of that party, whose policy it
                        is to conciliate its enemies at the cost of its friends. As McClellan was
                        kept in command eight months after Mr. Lincoln was convinced of his
                        incapacity to conciliate his party, nineteen-twentieths of all the general
                        officers of the army were appointed from that party, kept in office, through
                        blunder after blunder, when, if they had been Republicans, they would have
                        been dismissed; but both Southern and Northern Democrats were to be
                        conciliated; and if the former had to be whipped, it was advisable to do it
                        in the gentlest way for them, no matter what the cost to Yankees. Had Gen.
                        Grant been a Republican he would in all probability have been superseded
                        after the battle of Pittsburg Landing; but the fact of his being a Democrat,
                        and so pro-slavery that he sent the slaves who staid in Fort Donnelson back
                        to their rebel masters, made it probable that our Southern brethren would
                        not think so hard to surrender to him as to one of different political
                        faith. This supposition was quite correct for he certainly gave them very
                        easy terms, terms which have cost the country all the trouble we have had
                        since and which were quite equal in leniency to treason and much more
                        sweeping than Andrew Johnson's pardoning policy.</p>
                    <p>It would require proof, I never expect to see, to convince me that Gen.
                        Grant's victories did not cost many millions more of money, and thousands of
                        lives, than they need have done, and he felt less sympathy for rebels. I
                        never shall forget the hundreds, if not thousands, of wounded Union soldiers
                        who died for want of the necessaries of life, while their comrades guarded
                        these necessaries, belonging to rebels, and our commissaries dealt out
                        rations to the enemy, and Gen. Grant was in command, just before us.</p>
                    <p>All the time I lived in Washington, and he there, I never saw him, would go
                        out of my way to avoid the disagreeable sensation of a sight of him would
                        have brought, and I could not be hired to touch his hand. If the Republicans
                        elect him President, and do not find him a second Andrew Johnson I have
                        mistaken the man.<lb/> JANE G. SWISSHELM.</p>
