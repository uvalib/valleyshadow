                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin Repository</p>
                    <p>UNION CITY, Montana T., Nov. 12, 1867.</p>
                    <p>"Congress must recede!" is heard on every hand from those who, in times past,
                        have rejoiced at our country's disasters and heard of its triumphs with
                        sadness. "Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey have so declared," is the
                        ready argument of every faithless heart; and the failure of Manhood Suffrage
                        in several Republican States, and the diminished Republican majorities given
                        this fall, have inspired with fresh hopes those who hate their nationality
                        because it is advancing slowly but surely to the full stature of Freedom.
                        Vallandigham comes forth with the laurels of victory encircling his brow.
                        Pendleton waves the dark banner of Repudiation triumphantly, and points to
                        ruined credit and the overthrow of our solemnly plighted faith as the
                        choicest fruits of the "great reaction." The Buchanans and Reeds of
                        Pennsylvania; the Woods and Seymours and Morriseys of New York; the Walls of
                        New Jersey; the Pierces and Tonceys of New England, and the Milligans and
                        Brights of the West, with one accord pronounce the fiat that "Congress must
                        recede!" Nor are they alone in their rejoicings, or in their imperious
                        demands. The arch-rebel who leaves to his followers the desolation and woe
                        he has wrought, while he revels in ease and luxury in Canada; the refugees
                        from their country's scorn in England and France; the victors of Fort
                        Pillow; the keepers of Libby, of Belle Island, of Salisbury, of
                        Andersonville, and the murderers of Memphis and New Orleans, all swell with
                        the chorus of barren Democratic victories, and mingle their intensest
                        maledictions against the Republic they failed to overthrow in blood with the
                        shout that "Congress must recede!"</p>
                    <p>The brief, but thrilling, history of our great struggle for Human Rights is
                        again measurably repeating itself. The same clamor assailed our ears in
                        other and darker days than now. When Bull Run bowed the nation in deepest
                        humiliation, it came in defiant terms from the councils of treason and was
                        faintly echoed in the North. When the bloody battles, and McClellan's
                        retreat on the Peninsula, spread the pall of mourning and despair over the
                        land, the sluggard chieftain sat down in the midst of his discomfited army
                        and asked in abject, pitiable tones, as did the victorious leaders of crime
                        in proud command, that the nation must recede. Cedar Mountain, the second
                        Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, all gave birth to the same
                        faithless clamor; and even after the memorable field of Gettysburg, when Lee
                        receded under his bold banner of national retrogression, the "friends" of
                        Seymour and Wood, of New York, and of Buchanan and Reed in Pennsylvania,
                        convulsed their sections by lawlessness to prevent the filling up of our
                        shattered armies. They demanded, as did their leaders, that Congress must
                        recede, and they made brigades recede from the Army of the Potomac, under
                        the very thunder of the enemy's guns, to teach the receders obedience to the
                        laws in the loyal States. It was the same banner, with the same strange
                        device, that made Grant recede at Shiloh, at Cold Harbor, and Fort Steadman,
                        and forced Sheridan twice to recede at the Five Forks; the same that made
                        Buell recede from the Tennessee to the Ohio, that made Rosecranz recede at
                        Chickamauga, and more than once made Sherman recede in his march to Atlanta.
                        But the Peninsula retreat has its Malvern Hill; the second Bull Run has its
                        Antietam; Chancellorsville has its Gettysburg; Steadman has its receding
                        victors; Cold Harbor has its Petersburg and Richmond; Five Forks has its
                        Appomattox; Chickamauga has its Missionary Ridge; Atlanta was reached, and
                        the shores beyond; Perrysville has its Nashville, and in the fullness of His
                        time, the captains and armies of despotism receded as prisoners of war. It
                        was the same blotted banner that made Fort Pillow a carnival of barbarous
                        slaughter; that made Memphis stream with unoffending blood, and that made
                        New Orleans give scores of martyrs to Freedom. "The nation must recede," was
                        their battle cry. It was the same sentiment that sent thousands of shivering
                        maniacs to their God from the pest prisons of Libby and Andersonville. "The
                        nation must recede" was their inspiration as each starved or murdered
                        prisoner was sent to his rude grave unshrived and unpitied, save in distant
                        lands; and the same fiendish purpose triumphed as they murdered the freedmen
                        by hundreds because they were created of another race.</p>
                    <p>"The nation must recede" was the cry of traitors north and south when
                        Emancipation was emblazoned on the then unblotted flag of the Republic.
                        Unwilling generals wasted armies by inaction, or led them only to disaster.
                        They wanted to recede. In the gloom of despair, Pennsylvania, New York, New
                        Jersey, Ohio and Indiana declared that the nation must recede. The loyal
                        armies were reduced, dispirited and unequal to the mighty struggle for
                        advancement. They could not assail the battalions of treason; the call for
                        men was answered with the cry to recede, and to recede was to surrender a
                        continent to anarchy, and blot from the world's history the great government
                        of the People. One strong, patriotic heart was at the helm. To recede was
                        not written in his destiny. From the impenetrable clouds which enveloped the
                        loyal cause he advanced, and the freedmen came forth clad in his country's
                        blue and armed for its defence. He filled the deep gaps left vacant by the
                        faithless, and he was greeted by traitor voices north and south, and by the
                        thunders of traitor guns, with the demand to recede. But Freedom was nailed
                        to his flag, and inspired his manhood, and he answered the first bloody
                        demand to recede as he hurled his malignant foes back in confusion and shame
                        at Millikin's Bend. He guarded the only channel that treason had to victory,
                        and he receded not. Advancement bore up its banner of light, and earnest
                        chieftains took command and gave the nation victory; and the cry for the
                        freedmen to recede died out as three hundred thousand sable warriors rallied
                        to share the sacrifices and triumphs of the redeemed Republic.</p>
                    <p>Peace came by victory, and the heroes of the Republic, of every race and
                        color left the graves of their comrades and the scenes of their sanguinary
                        conflicts to enjoy the freedom they had won. The "Lost Cause" was consigned
                        to its blurred and blackened history; but the spirit of treason was not yet
                        subdued. It sat sullenly in the withered desolation it had brought upon its
                        votaries demanding that the Nation should recede. To accomplish its wicked
                        purpose it fired the brain and nerved the arm of the wretched assassin, and
                        placing within his hands its banner of shame, sent him on his unholy mission
                        into the very sanctuary of power. His work was murder, and by the atrocious
                        deed he plunged the loyal millions into profoundest bereavement as he called
                        upon them to recede over the bodies of their slain into the darkness of
                        Slavery.</p>
                    <p>Another ruler came, with fair speech upon lip and tongue, but with deceit and
                        treachery in his heart. Freedom and Impartial Justice were the favorite
                        themes on which he harangued in and out of season. Behind these enduring
                        principles the loyal people of the land had entrenched themselves and were
                        safe against any and all assaults of the enemy. None knew this better than
                        the enemy himself. He dared not approach with banners unfurled and bayonets
                        gleaming. Even the courage of despair could avail him nothing against such
                        an enemy behind such entrenchments. Instead thereof he came with devilish
                        cunning, bringing gifts to him who held command and to his mean ambition
                        softly whispered--"recede." He hesitated--faltered--fell, and under this new
                        inspiration there were united voices from old enemies in disguise clamorous
                        for the nation to recede. Repression was made the policy of a perfidious
                        Executive, and he stamped it upon every official act in awkward flaming
                        characters, and preached it in maudlin, incoherent speech from the death bed
                        of Lincoln to the tomb of Douglas. As he turned against his country's cause
                        and attempted to recede he bowed the country in silent shame and
                        disappointment and called it Peace. Traitors filled every place of honor and
                        trust and he called it Restoration. The Freedmen were practically
                        re-enslaved by local statutes, and he called it Freedom and Law. Murders,
                        wanton and shameless, for the single crime of devotion to the Republic in
                        this day of trial, stained the land without pretence of punishment, and he
                        called it Justice. Senators and Congressmen were chosen, conspicuous for the
                        services in causeless rebellion, and he bid them welcome as law makers,
                        though steeped in perjury and blood, and called it the will of the People.
                        His base nature having thus yielded to the wicked designs of the enemy, the
                        loyal millions looked no longer to him to lead them up, but to Congress.
                        Their cry went up--Advance! and Congress did so--slowly, fearfully,
                        tremblingly, and gave as the fruits of its advances the proposed
                        constitutional amendments. In wrath the President declared that Congress
                        must recede, and in harmonious chorus the traitors of the south and their
                        allies of the north joined him. He appealed to the south to reject and spurn
                        the amendments, and they obeyed. The nation must recede and they advance to
                        wield the destiny of the government they had deluged in blood in vain to
                        compass its overthrow. Congress appealed to the People, and they answered
                        again million-tongued--Advance! Strengthened and instructed by the sovereign
                        power of the Republic, they made the Slave a Man, and his oppressors bowed
                        to his new attributes. A perfidious and debauched Executive, bereft of power
                        and respect, still cries recede, but the nation could not recede if it
                        would, it would not recede if it could.</p>
                    <p>The enfranchisement of a race is an achievement that cannot be undone by any
                        temporary political revulsion. The solemn verdict of the nation could not
                        thus reverse the order of enlightened progress. When the voice of the
                        Republic shall be heard, the freedman will mingle his voice with that of his
                        friends and his accusers, and he will be the peer of oppressor at the
                        ballot. "Revolutions take no steps backwards." Manhood Suffrage was the cap
                        stone of the perfected column of Freedom in the Western World. It is the
                        full fruition of the cause so nobly won by incalculable sacrifices, and
                        having gained its place in the vindicated justice of the Republic, it must
                        endure so long as the Republic remains.</p>
                    <p>To recede is no more possible than to recall to life our martyred dead whose
                        untimely graves ridged the plains and slopes of the South in the effort to
                        advance our nationality to the full measure of Human Rights. They have done
                        their part--have bravely fought and nobly died that the nation might not
                        recede. They have left peaceful advancement as the first great duty of the
                        living. The implacable foes of our free institutions, who have life and home
                        by the generous forbearance of the people they shadowed in mourning, and the
                        less manly of the North, who "with malignant heart and deceitful speech
                        strove to hinder the great consummation," will still demand that Congress
                        must recede. The instincts which make men most hate those they have most
                        wronged, will earnestly, perhaps desperately, protest against advancement.
                        Even when the rebellious States surrender the struggle, and cease to cherish
                        the vain hope that the greatest of nations may recede from its greatest
                        duties, ignorance, prejudice and passion may protract the conflict in the
                        States where example should have kept pace with precept. They may gain their
                        triumphs, and thus postpone their own vindication from a despotism for which
                        their posterity will blush; but steadily, step by step, justice will come,
                        and intelligence and virtue will be the test of merit as the hateful lines
                        of caste are obliterated from our national history. States may falter as did
                        Ohio and Kansas, and as would Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and other
                        states to-day; but they will be the Bull Run, the Fredericksburg, the
                        Chancellorsville and the Chickamauga of the struggle, and the Gettysburg,
                        the Vicksburg, the Nashville and the Appomattox will as surely follow in the
                        fullness of time, as the patriotic judgment of the People declares--"That
                        the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of Freedom; and that the
                        government of the People, by the People, and for the People, shall not
                        perish from the earth!" A.K.M.</p>

                    its bonds: in coin or not. To their dismay, Thad Stevens is adamantly opposed to
                    the policy of issuing payment in coin, which they contend amounts to
                    "repudiation."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are pained to see the great name of Thaddeus Stevens thrown into the now
                        trembling balance against the maintenance of our national faith and credit.
                        He has, however, the merit of consistency, and meets the question now, as he
                        met it when our national loans were authorized. He declared on the floor of
                        Congress, that the nation should not, and would not, pay its bonds in coin;
                        but it was well understood, both at the time and since, and by both the
                        government and the people, that his construction of the law was not the
                        intention of Congress or the government, and that it would not prevail.
                        Certainly the administration regarded the bonds, excepting the
                        seven-thirties, as payable in coin, not merely because it preferred to have
                        them so, but because the provisions of the law were accepted as conclusive
                        on the point; and for several years the Secretary of the Treasury presented
                        these loans to the public with every possible official assurance that they
                        would be paid in coin, with the approval, or at least the practical assent
                        of Congress, for not even an inquiry was instituted by Congress to question
                        the construction of Mr Chase and his ancestors.</p>
                    <p>We do not assume to argue the question from a technically legal stated point.
                        Bulter has done that in an exhaustive manner on one side, as he would argue
                        a demurrer in court, and made the worse appear the better part, as he
                        involved our sacred national faith in the plausible but fatal sophistries of
                        repudiation. Pendleton, too, has done his part, because he would rejoice at
                        the overthrow of our credit, and Vallandigham joins the chorus with the vain
                        hope of yet overthrowing the Republic that arouses his intensest hate as it
                        advances in Freedom. With these men, the practical repudiation of our debt
                        is an after thought--the dictate of ambition or perfidy, but with Mr.
                        Stevens it is the persistent maintenance of a policy he has unsuccessfully
                        advocated in every stage of our national trials.</p>
                    <p>But is Mr. Stevens any the less excusable? We think not. True he maintained all the time that we did not assume
                        to pay our five-twenties in coin; but the government has insisted, and
                        insists now that we did assume to pay them in gold. The legal rule
                        applicable to individuals who ct by another, may not be strictly applicable
                        to governments; but can Mr. Stevens doubt that the National faith was
                        solemnly pledged, so far as even the most intelligent possessors could
                        judge, to redeem these bonds in coin? He may have protested--we believe he
                        did on the floor of Congress--but did his individual construction even
                        create a doubt in the popular mind against the positive and repeated
                        assurances of the government's highest official agents, that both the law
                        and the policy of the government, meant otherwise? It was known that he was
                        not in sympathy with the financial policy of the administration. Although
                        Chairman of Ways and Means, he never was equal to the task of moulding the
                        financial affairs of the government to harmonize with his views, and while
                        the country conceded his ability and patriotism it regarded him as in error,
                        both in conviction and in his construction of the law. We do not now discuss
                        the wisdom of the policy he then proposed. It may be true, as he says, that
                        many millions have been wasted by the policy we did adopt; but we did not
                        adopt his views, and there is no number of millions that can be measured
                        against the destruction of our national credit. We must maintain our faith
                        not merely as a Butler would distort a law with the skill of a subtle,
                        technical attorney, but we must maintain it as the nation, by its recognized
                        officials and with the acquiescence of Congress, made it universally
                        understood to the people who were called upon to invest in our loans.</p>
                    <p>While Mr. Stevens cannot be discharged with repudiation of his individual
                        acts we cannot exculpate him entirely from his great share in the attempt to
                        repudiate the faith of the nation. He is no voice from the faithless as is
                        Pendleton's and Vallandigham's, nor a reckless but for fame as is Butler's;
                        but it is more fearfully potential than all combined, and will be productive
                        of immeasurable evil. It will strengthen the timid and the dishonest, and
                        the disloyal, in their insidious, ceaseless efforts to paralyze the very
                        life of the nation by sapping its credit; and, however otherwise intended,
                        it is a most effectual appeal to the cupidity of the people to lighten their
                        burdens temporarily only to double or quadruple them in the dark hereafter.
                        For these reasons we profoundly deplore the manifesto of so great and so
                        true a man as Mr Stevens in favor of what we must call by the name of
                        Repudiation. If we can,--after authorizing our highest officials to promise
                        payment in coin, or silently assenting thereto,--repudiate thirty or forty
                        per cent of our promise, the repudiation of the whole debt would be but the
                        full fruition of the same principle, and no more reprehensible.</p>
                    <p>We do not hold or deal in government bonds. Few of those who drank the cup of
                        desolation to the dregs as did the people of Chambersburg, have any great
                        personal profit from the payment of bonds in coin. When the government was
                        begging for money to save its life, we contributed our mite to sustain it,
                        and would have done so whether it promised coin or depreciated currency in
                        return. We have therefore nothing to do with the payment of these bonds
                        beyond giving our little share to provide the means wherewith to pay them;
                        but we have a great, abiding interest in the maintenance of our national
                        faith, for the credit of the Republic is a common patrimony, in which the
                        humblest and the most opulent have their common interest. Nor is it merely a
                        question of unblotted fame for our redeemed nationality. It is the most
                        vital measure of National Economy that has been raised since the
                        commencement of the war. Partial repudiation now, as is proposed, would save
                        the government a few millions--how many hundreds of millions would it cost?
                        English consuls now command 95 cents on the dollar. They leave but three per
                        cent in gold, and the principal is not promised at any definite period. On
                        the same market our six per cent five-twenties demand but 70 cents on the
                        dollar. Why this great discrepancy? During the war, when the issue of the
                        Rebellion was regarded abroad as doubtful, it was natural that our
                        securities should be depressed in foreign markets; but since the government
                        has not only vindicated its supremacy, but also vindicated, beyond the
                        possibility of doubt, its ability to pay its debt, our securities would be
                        equal to English consuls if our national faith was regarded as equally
                        sacred. But first came the whispers of the foes of the government in favor
                        of repudiation--one by one weak and ambitious politicians joined in the
                        crusade from the loyal ranks, and finally comes the thunders of Stevens to
                        stagger the faithful and inspirit the faithless. The result is that, instead
                        of commanding a large premium in markets both home and foreign, our bonds
                        are from thirty to forty per cent under par abroad, and command but little
                        more than currency bonds at home. This loss,--the legitimate result of the
                        unwise assaults upon our national faith and credit--must fall upon the
                        people when the bonds are to be paid or renewed, and it will cost them ten,
                        twenty or perhaps fifty fold all they will gain by payment in currency. If
                        our faith should be sacredly maintained, as common honesty requires, our
                        five-twenties could be taken up at the earliest option of the government and
                        three or four per cent bonds would be promptly taken in their stead; but
                        with violated faith staring capitalists in the face, the government could
                        not replace them with ten per cent bonds. We are therefore, not only asked
                        to sacrifice credit, the very mainspring of our nationality, but with it we
                        must sacrifice untold millions which must be born by the tax payers.</p>
                    <p>We warn the people against the fearful perils of this spurious repudiation,
                        and appeal to them, and to our law-makers, to remember that "honesty is the
                        best policy," and that in this instance it is the only policy that will
                    pay!</p>
