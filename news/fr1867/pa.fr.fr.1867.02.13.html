<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A rattle snake once located himself in a field of grain. A country man in
                        reaping the crop cut off the head of the intruder, leaving a small portion
                        of the body attached. All strength seemed gone from its poisonous fangs, and
                        the man venturing too near its jaws was bitten and died almost as soon as
                        the reptile. The giant serpent rebellion appears to have received its
                        death-blow, but though we see the tail squirming in its agony in Texas,
                        where the murder of Union men seems to traitors a most holy duty, the
                        hydra-head of the monster with its fatal venom, the love of treason and
                        defiance of law, yet rampant throughout the South, still remains to be
                        crushed beneath the heel of the conqueror, before he can lie down to rest
                        safely beside it. We may fold our hands in listless idleness, and halting at
                        every objection to each plan, play "Walter the Doubter" in our dealings with
                        these rebels. But our relations with them and their relations with the
                        general government do not remain in statu quo
                        month after month. They are struggling with the frenzied strength despair
                        alone can give, and with the art and cunning years of practiced systematic
                        crime alone can bring forth. Conquered on the battle-field, condemned by the
                        arbiter they themselves had chosen, again they resort to political intrigue
                        and chicanery, to accomplish by artifice the ends force failed to attain.
                        Are any so mad as to dream that these restless evil spirits will quietly
                        await our time and sit submissive and unchanging until we have found a
                        political policy which all men shall consider perfect? Each hour we sleep at
                        our posts, even though it be on a victorious field, the beaten cohorts of
                        the enemy are strengthening themselves for renewed conflict. Already the
                        South, another Cleopatra, seems to have charmed our Antony, and lulled him
                        to worse than inaction on the soft cushions of the Presidential chair. Our
                        only hope is that we may find in Congress an Octavius too wise to be
                        enchanted by fair words of flattery, too brave to be intimidated and too
                        honest to bow to gold. We may, we will, be generous to our foes, but we must
                        be just to ourselves and to all the oppressed on earth whose hopes of
                        freedom hang upon the success of our republic. Let Congress quickly take a
                        decided step forward in the work of reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>"Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute<br> What you can do, or dream
                        you can begin it;<br> Boldness has genius, power and magic in it."</p>
                    <p>During the war, as each day brought us intelligence of the murder of loyal
                        men by traitors, we imagined that after the rebels had laid down their arms
                        a faithful citizen of the United States would be safe in remaining loyal to
                        the old flag, wherever he might choose a location for his home within the
                        national boundaries. But now that the conflict of arms has died away and
                        Southerners once more claim an untrammeled voice and vote in the government
                        they have exhausted all their resources to destroy, we turn in horror from
                        the scenes of New Orleans, of Memphis, Clarksville, Bowie co., Texas, and
                        the Carolina jail conflagration almost in dismay, at the ceaseless deeds of
                        crime throughout the length and breadth of the late rebellious districts. We
                        eagerly examine the revised statute books of the pretended States hoping to
                        see justice and humanity commanded in them, and would console ourselves that
                        the shameless cruelty we behold is in violation of their penal codes and
                        consequently will soon be prevented by "the strong arm of the law." But we
                        discover that alike in the Southern mob and the Southern legislature loyalty
                        and justice are forgotten, while treason and oppression are silently
                        approved. One all-powerful talisman, "devotion to the lost cause," gives
                        place and power to the blood-stained and yet blatant traitor, while even a
                        suspicion of fidelity to the stars and stripes rears an unpassable barrier
                        to office or influence. When we comprehend the sad reality of the condition
                        of our country, our only hope is in the earnest energy of the faithful
                        representatives of a loyal people in Congress, and we appeal to them in
                        confident assurance that they are equal to the emergency. We do not presume
                        to dictate what plan the council of the nation should adopt--but let them
                        speedily move in the necessary work. Not in careless haste, but with timely
                        though thoughtful decision. The data from which we must draw our conclusions
                        are simply these. The rebels are conquered traitors, we are a victorious
                        government. We will be humane to the South, but come what will to them, we
                        must protect ourselves. Our loyal statesmen should not hesitate to change
                        the present dangerous situation of the country to a better, because the new
                        state of affairs would not constitute perfect happiness to all men or
                        embrace a system of government without a fault. In the language of James
                        Madison, in a case requiring a course of reasoning analogous to the present,
                        "It is not necessary that the" latter "should be perfect, it is sufficient
                        that the" former "is more imperfect. No man would refuse to give brass for
                        silver or gold because the latter had some alloy in it. No man would refuse
                        to quit a shattered and tottering habitation for a firm and commodious
                        building, because the latter had not a porch to it or because some of the
                        rooms might be a little larger or smaller or the ceiling a little higher or
                        lower than his fancy would have planned them." We should not rest in
                        sluggard inactivity when the crisis demands immediate action. To-day the
                        rebels have lost a battle, but if we do not follow up our victory a swift
                        Dessaix may come to aid the beaten Napoleon in time to win another fight
                        before the sun of this national era has set. Now when the despairing cry of
                        the vanquished falls upon our ear let us press forward with increased vigor,
                        until the last man of the "old guard" of treason lies helpless. We must not
                        relax our energies until we have formed a circle of fire around the scorpion
                        rebellion, through which it cannot force a passage way, and then true to its
                        impulse of destruction it will turn its poisonous sting upon itself and
                    die.</p>
