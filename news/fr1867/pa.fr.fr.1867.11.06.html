<b>Democracy and Mr. Stevens</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors rebuke their Democratic counterparts for lowering the threshold

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Ill temper in a disputant is evidence of weakness. Whether the cause be bad
                        or the advocate poorly prepared to defend it, want of success is apt to
                        inspire malice and prompt abuse. Accordingly, the present course of
                        Democratic journals, the columns of which teem, North and South, with
                        frantic exclamations and the coarsest invective, must be regarded as the
                        natural result of the circumstances in which their editors find themselves
                        placed. For, we take it, difficulties similar to and equal to theirs have
                        seldom afflicted any class of men. Committed to a cause so inherently
                        weak--so absolutely indefensible on grounds of reason or humanity--conscious
                        to a degree men seldom attain of their want of means and ability to even
                        cover its defects from eyes sharpened by common sense, oppressed by a weight
                        of odium justly incurred for their betrayal of human rights in the interest
                        of a clique, and weighed down by a long, uniform, course of disasters, their
                        perplexities drive them to the employment of the weapons of malignity and
                        despair.</p>
                    <p>Once before, perhaps, in our brief history as a people has the indecency of
                        our opposition prints been rivaled. After the memorable contest waged and
                        won on the floor of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, by neither party,
                        and after the opening of the first administration under the Constitution,
                        when the workings of the government were plainly seen to be in the direction
                        of the party of stability and order, it speedily became the habit of the Red
                        Republicans of that day to load their columns with the bitterest
                        maledictions and the vilest calumniations of the characters, private and
                        public, of their opponents, and the most odious misrepresentations of their
                        actions. The name of Freneau has descended to our times as that of the most
                        malevolent and foul of those detractors. Though impotently, the scoundrel,
                        persistently, sought to stab the character of Washington. His spirit has
                        been revived and animates the body of more than one of his lineal party
                        descendants. For, if we scan the so-called principles of the Democratic
                        party, to day, it is easy to identify them as in soul the same as those of
                        the men who vexed the beginnings of our constitutional course, after having
                        nearly made impossible any harmonious union at all. The Democrats of to-day
                        are the Red Republicans--the transplanted sans-culottes of the eighteenth
                        century, animated by their impatience of restraint and their contempt for
                        whatever is stable and enduring. How bitterly they resisted the turnings of
                        the colonies towards a union which would make harvestable the fruits of the
                        Revolution; how zealously they strove, when settling the foundations of
                        government, to restrict it from enclosing all of privilege within its
                        limits; how successfully, operating through colonial jealousies, natural
                        dread of monarchical oppression, and vested interests, did they emasculate
                        the powers of government and providently protect class interests and
                        privileges!</p>
                    <p>We are not of the number of those who are profoundly penetrated with a sense
                        of the general or average superiority of our ancestors over ourselves, in
                        the matter even of statesmanship and sacrificing devotion to an idea. In the
                        light of the flames of our own civil war, whose illumination serves as well
                        to relume [unclear] the periods of past struggles, as to bring into relief
                        and comparison the figures of old time and present leaders, we can, and do,
                        judge intelligent, and possibly severely, of integrity, capacity, dignity
                        and purity. We assert, consequently, that our so much lauded ancestors were
                        very much as we--capable of rising, under the spur of an imminent necessity
                        to the height of the sublimest self-abnegation, as to many of their number,
                        for a brief period and in the matter of a particular and cherished interest,
                        but capable of furnishing, and actually furnishing, side by side with their
                        types of nobility and single-heartedness the representatives, zealous and
                        fierce, of the basest and meanest, or the weakest and most pusillanimous, of
                        half-hearted cowards and traitors. And of all they exhibited for the delight
                        or the reproach of humanity, we can, and do, under similar circumstances,
                        furnish counterparts. the rebel may well match the Tory and surpass him in
                        infamy, as the Copperhead rivals and outshames the cowboy. But we may also
                        proudly place the loyalist of Tennessee as a companion patriot to the
                        barefooted soldier of Trenton of Entaw [unclear] Springs. Such as men were
                        in '76, good and bad, such are they with whom we deal in this generation--no
                        better, perhaps no worse.</p>
                    <p>Accepting this judgment while it, upon the whole, will repress any undue
                        complacency with which we may be filled, who have toiled and suffered for a
                        great cud, and have now the happiness of beholding it partly accomplished
                        and with reach of consummation, it will serve to moderate our surprise that
                        party rancor should assume even its present vindictive phase. Yet, it is
                        true, that the Democratic sheets of yesterday and last week are only to be
                        approached in transcendent dirtiness by those the same Editors will issue
                        to-morrow, and from Brick Pomeroy down, by steps of varying height, to the
                        Editor of the Age and the Memphis Avalanche, it will go hard with even the man who
                        vilified the Father of his country "as a pickpocket," but that they will win
                        the palm of vituperation. Even our country sheets, uttered for the
                        information and guidance of a rural and placid people catch the evil
                        inspiration. Our neighbor of the Spirit takes to
                        calling names with the earnestness and vigor of a drab. It opens a studied
                        leader with a wanton characterizing of Pennsylvania's most cherished
                        statesman as a "villain," and ascribes to him, in the compass of an article,
                        every attribute, which, in a free country, unfits a man to be either the
                        peer of the representative of his fellows. Why does it do this? Its ill
                        temper is certainly due to either the repugnance, which, in its virtuous
                        rage at wrong doing, it feels towards Mr. Stevens' actions, or it springs
                        from its consciousness of the party's past misfortunes being attributable to
                        the badness of their cause or their own want of ability to support and
                        defend it.</p>
                    <p>Who, that knows the history of the Democratic party, will, even in charity,
                        deems its anger to arise from outraged public virtue? The party which, for
                        forty years, debased itself at the feet of an ebony god and joyfully obeyed
                        biddings of its priesthood for the sake of a share of the offerings at its
                        shrine, as those calculating priests might deign to bestow them, and who did
                        this not only without the pretence that their fathers were idolaters and
                        they knew no better, but with blatant professions of their hatred of any
                        idolatry, can have no claim to manliness or sincerity. Since 1820, when
                        Missouri opened to slavery and Whitney invented the cotton-gin, the
                        Democracy have been the willing slaves of slavery. Thrift followed their
                        fawning. For its aid they sold their manhood; in its behalf they surrendered
                        their truth; and when they vent their spleen on hostile pens and thinkers,
                        the motive must be sought for in chagrin occasioned by other reasons than
                        excited virtue. It is noticeable, in nature, that bane and antidote usually
                        grow in the same forest, that the victim of the one may find relief in the
                        other, and it happens that as ink and type give forth to the world the venom
                        of the disappointed and hence slanderous politicians, that the alembic of
                        thought distills the stimulus of truth which will counteract it. Hence the
                        timeous [unclear] publication of the calm reflections of the sage of
                        Lancaster. They set at rest the minds disturbed by the Spirit's loud outcry of "villain." Few will believe, after they
                        read and ponder over the old man's faithful portraiture of things as they
                        were, of things as they are, and as they may and must be, and who feel, as
                        they read, that the imagination, which guided the pencil in these
                        depictings, is that of genius inspired by the love of humanity, that the
                        artist is obnoxious to censure of his work to condemnation. He sees, with,
                        the breadth of vision which an election-jobbing politician's eyes cannot
                        compass, how that again, as to our founders, it is given to us and under
                        better auspices to widen and extend the foundations of constitutional
                        liberty; how it is possible, profiting by the experience of peace and the
                        blunders and dangers of war, to rectify the mistakes and make up the
                        shortcomings of our ancestors. We are rid of the great evil of our life
                        freed from the only incubus which disturbed our repose Unhampered by any
                        restrictions it haply our perverseness we do not create them we are freer to
                        build than our fathers of '87, freer to act than in the good times of
                        Monroe. And why shall we not? Why shall not the lessons of ninety years--the
                        lessons of an ideal mutilated by interest and passion; of growing greed and
                        extortion fostered by opportunity and natural depravity; of perverted policy
                        crippling or stifling the general weal in behalf of a sectional institution;
                        of rapidly rising danger to the general freedom from the debauching of a
                        partial wrong; of a horrid, baleful, war spitefully waged to turn back the
                        advancing power of truth, of a bitter, vengeful, resolve to undo the work
                        which sacrifice alone was able to achieve why shall not these lessons be
                        incorporated in sculptured stone in the temple of freedom which, as
                        architects, we are constrained to alter and improve? There seems to be no
                        reason save the opposition of them who occupying it hitherto only to defile
                        and desecrate it, clamor for the retention of the gloomy crypts in which,
                        save from observation, they practised their juggleries, rehearsed their
                        ceremonies and perpetrated their crimes. The Constitution of the past is
                        inadequate to the necessities of the present, and we must either amend it at
                        the suggestions of prudence or at the biddings of a future necessity.
                        Democrats may rave, but new articles must grow as columns to the temple. Let
                        them, indeed, be added with care and with understanding, but, where wisdom
                        points, let them be added. The result will vindicate the skill of the
                        framers. If well done, if incorporated in accordance with the law of the
                        work, with the grand conception of its original framers and the plan of our
                        Michael Angelo, the restorer, we will have, as our boast, a temple whose
                        dome will be co-extensive with the land, whose pillars will last while time
                        endures, and, blessing with a pure worship the nation which assembles in its
                        courts, will dwarf into littleness and shame into silence the bigots or
                        zealots who resisted its completion and maligned its builders.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a tendency in these of the "living present" to look back with fond
                        regret to the "good old times." The early Romans mourned the prosperous
                        reign of Anens Martius [unclear], and wished that they might see their like
                        again; a century later they panegyrized the classic age of Augustus.
                        Frenchmen love to remember the gallantry and popular sympathies which
                        characterized the age of their Fourth Henry, and Englishmen sing of the days
                        of "good Queen Bess." Old men talk of the better times in their youthful
                        days, and moral essays are written upon the growing depravity of these
                        latter days. How stands the matter? Does the age of gold belong to the dead
                        past, the present, or shall we expect it in the time to come? What period of
                        time has produced fruit more golden than that in which we live? In the arts
                        and sciences we have made rapid strides; true religion and morality are not
                        less generally practised, and political liberty has greatly progressed. Six
                        years ago many millions of human beings that are now free suffered in
                        bondage. Four millions in the United States; nine or ten millions of serfs
                        in Russia, and millions of slaves in Brazil are clothed with many in the
                        United States with all the rights belonging to citizenship. This itself
                        gives the period a golden tinge that no former age has equalled. But this is
                        not all, for this was but the result of a purer religion and a better public
                        sentiment.</p>

                    his desire to kill all the blacks he could, and had acted on this sentiment
                    several months prior, though his actions had not resulted in any type of serious
                    investigation by the authorities.<br>

<b>A Woman Marries A Woman</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece reports on the marriage of two women in Syracuse, one of whom is
                    a cross-dresser who, after arriving from England, apparently drew the interest
                    of several local young women. Three weeks after the marriage ceremony was
                    performed, the subterfuge was discovered by the bride's father and the English
                    woman arrested. Despite that the "bride still clings to her woman husband, and
                    claims that the arrest is a conspiracy against them."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One result of the elections at the South is clear. Conventions will be held
                        in most or all of the States, and an overwhelming majority of the delegates
                        thereto will be advocates of the Congressional plan of reconstruction. This
                        is the great lesson of the hour. Local politics at the North, party
                        machinations, impeachment, agrarianism, gains here and loses there--all
                        petty partisan phenomena are but the surface ripples, at best the chopwaves,
                        on the political sea, while the great ground-swell is to be found in that
                        steady and resistless flood-tide of public sentiment at the South which
                        flows on to reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>We at the North have been liable to forget, of late, that the political
                        squabbles, which are as common to the most stagnant peace times as to
                        revolutionary epochs in history like that of to-day, can have little to do
                        with the fate of the South. Northern State elections, though much in every
                        way to us, are of very little import or interest to the South. When the
                        Jackson Clarion tells us that only half a dozen
                        out of the sixty-one delegates to the Anti-Congressional Convention so
                        imposingly advertised for weeks in every county, and this after the
                        "Conservative triumphs" at the North, we may divine that the South does not
                        propose to reject the Congressional plan. Question of impeachment, of
                        repudiation, of prohibitory liquor codes, of protective tariffs, of revenue,
                        of Alabama claims--of whatever else it likes, can
                        be discussed by the North with furious fervor; but to the South, the first
                        and sole question is that of reconstruction. What, therefore, the Clarion says of Mississippi is probably true of the
                        people of South in general--that "the attempt to organize a party in
                        opposition to reconstruction meets no response whatever in their hearts, and
                        is emphatically a failure."</p>
