<b>Letters From Mrs. Jane G. Swisshelm</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In her column, Mrs. Swisshelm discusses the results of the recent elections
                    in Tennessee and Kentucky, contending that they demonstrate that blacks can be
                    trusted to vote their true interests, rather than according to what their
                    masters tell them. That this occurred, she avows, should not come as a surprise
                    since blacks "are the shrewdest people I have ever met, and have thoroughly
                    learned the art of bending before a storm." Their cunning "has, for centuries,
                    been their only defense against savage ferocity and despotic power."<br>

<b>The County Ticket</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial endorses the ticket selected at the Republican County
                    Convention, describing it as commanding "general respect," and gives a brief
                    biographical sketch of each candidate.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. Theodore McGowan,  Samuel F. Greenawalt,  W. W. Paxton,  A. H. Etter,  John E. Maclay,  Addison Imbrie,   Witherow)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The ticket which the Republican Convention offered to the voters of Franklin
                        county for their support at the election before us, will command general
                        respect. The gentlemen who compose it are widely and favorably known, are
                        entirely worthy, and deserve the honors they will receive. It is inspiring
                        to go into a campaign with such names inscribed upon our standards. They are
                        of themselves the earnest of success. Placed in nomination fairly and
                        honorably, bearing good records politically and morally, representing a
                        party known to be the only hope of the country which it saved, it is
                        scarcely borrowing too much of the future to predict that their election is
                        fore-fixed. The nominees are so well known, that we have no call to
                        introduce them to the people; but we desire to say a word or two in regard
                        to each of them.</p>
                    <p>FOR THE ASSEMBLY.</p>
                    <p>Col. Theodore McGowan, of Fayetteville, received the nomination. A more
                        fitting selection could not have been made. Col. McGowan belongs to one of
                        the oldest families in the country, his father and grandfather having lived
                        and died in the neighborhood in which he resides. The Colonel is thoroughly
                        identified with the county, and would represent her with filial pride, as
                        well as with great ability, in the Legislature. He is a gentleman of
                        excellent qualifications. To a high classical education, he adds good,
                        plain, practical, every day common sense, a grace of nature above the gift
                        of schools. He is industrious, energetic, steady in purpose, true. Of a kind
                        and friendly disposition, he is still rather modest in his demeanor, and
                        lacks the self confidence that some people call impudence in us older
                        politicians. Although yet a young man, he has had much experience in
                        business life, for from the time he bore off the honors of his college to
                        the present moment, he has not had an idle day. The outburst of the
                        Rebellion found him occupying a prominent position as a professor in an
                        institution of learning in South Carolina. He left his situation as soon as
                        he could get away, and sought admission into our army. He entered the
                        service as Asst. Adj't General, in June, 1862, was on the Peninsula with
                        Gen. Howe, in Keyes corps; subsequently served under Gen. Sedgewick, in the
                        6th corps, and was at the battles of 2d Mannassas, and at Fredericksburg. He
                        was then transferred by special order from the War Department as chief of
                        staff to Gen. Martindale, Military Governor of Washington, and afterwards
                        continued with Gen. Augur. His duties at Washington were of the most
                        laborious nature, and were fulfilled with a fidelity that won him
                        distinction.</p>
                    <p>TREASURER.</p>
                    <p>Our fellow townsman, Samuel F. Greenawalt, will be assigned charge of the
                        public funds, for the next two years. Mr. Greenawalt is one of the most
                        popular young men amongst us, and one of our most influential business men.
                        He is engaged in the mercantile line in this place. It is likely that every
                        male adult in the county is acquainted with him, and we doubt very much if
                        any of his acquaintances will be willing to vote against him. No member of
                        the party has done more hard work for it than he, and none is more deserving
                        of its compliments. He will receive a strong vote.</p>
                    <p>ASSOCIATE JUDGE.</p>
                    <p>W. W. Paxton, Esq., the present incumbent, has discharged his duties so
                        satisfactorily, that it is the purpose of his constituents to continue him
                        on the bench. The Judge is admirably adapted to his post. He is discreet and
                        just, of pure moral character, and endowed with a wise discernment of human
                        nature. Calm, patient and intellectual, Judge Paxton is fitted by
                        temperment, experience, and training for the position he fills, and to which
                        he will be undoubtedly re-elected by a handsome majority.</p>
                    <p>COMMISSIONER.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. H. Etter, of Green township, a practical farmer, is more than
                        qualified for the office he is selected to fill. The interests of the public
                        will be well subserved in his hands. He is pleasant and affable in
                        deportment, of unblemished reputation, and strict business habits. He will
                        make a very popular officer.</p>
                    <p>DIRECTOR OF THE POOR.</p>
                    <p>This, in our opinion, is one of the most important offices in the county. The
                        proper management of Alms House, is a subject which is beginning to attract
                        the earnest attention of the public, which had been too long indifferent to
                        the prominent christian duty of taking care of the poor. To provide a
                        comfortable home for our unfortunate fellow-beings upon whom poverty and
                        disease have laid their heavy burdens, is a high moral obligation imposed
                        upon communities. The institutions established for this purpose should be
                        managed with a spirit of benevolence. It is not enough to furnish food and
                        shelter for their inmates; these should be made comfortable, and, as far as
                        practicable, contented and happy. At the same time, extravagance should be
                        avoided, as prodigality is not beneficence.</p>
                    <p>John E. Maclay, of Lurgan, possesses in an eminent degree, the qualifications
                        needed for the Directorship. He is well suited both in heart and mind. A man
                        of excellent judgment, substantial business parts, and kind heart, he will
                        look well to the wants of the poor, and the interest of the public. The
                        choice of him as our candidate was most happy. He, also, is a practical
                        farmer, which is an additional recommendation of a Director.</p>
                    <p>JURY COMMISSIONER.</p>
                    <p>Addison Imbrie, of Antrim, formerly of Mercersburg, is fitted for the duty,
                        which he will be called upon to perform, by his general acquaintance with
                        the people of the county, by his discretion and good sense. He has long
                        enjoyed the reputation of being a consistent, and earnest member of our
                        party, and his name upon our ticket will add to its strength.</p>
                    <p>AUDITOR.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Witherow, of Metal, is at present a farmer; but for may years was a
                        prominent teacher. His education qualifies him in an especial manner for
                        Auditor. He is a gentleman of marked firmness and honesty; and any paper
                        that bears his signature presents a guarantee of its correctness. The favor
                        with which his name was received in the convention, betokened the reception
                        it will meet at the polls.</p>
                    <p>Such a ticket should secure the active support of the party, and commend
                        itself to the favor of those who have hitherto not been with us.</p>
                    <p>We want a full vote this fall. We owe to these gentlemen, who have sustained
                        us so often, that we now do some work for them.</p>
                <br>
