                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>HARRISBURG, Dec. 29, 1866.</p>
                    <p>Most of the members of the legislature are now here, and the active political
                        skirmishing that has been going on for some weeks past, will develop in a
                        pretty general engagement along the whole line by Monday next. It is not to
                        be concealed that the Senatorship overshadows everything and the subordinate
                        places become important as they are certain to effect, with more or less
                        directness, the grand battle for the highest trust in the gift of the State.
                        A decided majority of the members of the House prefer Col. M. S. Quay, of
                        Beaver, for Speaker; and he openly prefers Gov. Curtin for Senator, as do
                        his immediate constituents and four-fifths of the Republicans generally in
                        his section of the State. While Mr. Hall, an open friend of Mr. Cameron, is
                        cordially supported for Speaker of the Senate by the entire party, a
                        vigorous contest is made by Cameron to defeat Quay, lest his success should
                        impair Cameron's Senatorial chances. After coquetting for some time with
                        Waddell, of Chester, Glass, of Allegheny, and McCreary, of Erie, it was
                        yesterday decided that Colonel Glass would be the most available, and he is
                        now pressed with all the energy and desperation characteristic of Cameron's
                        movements. If he shall be chosen, Cameron will take fresh courage, and it is
                        confidently counted that the Speaker, notwithstanding the clearly adverse
                        wishes of his constituents, will cast his vote and official influence for
                        Cameron. In his support, by the positive request of Mr. Stevens himself, in
                        writing to his delegation, is embraced the Lancaster members, and several
                        men in the West who prefer Curtin, so that while the election of Glass, if
                        it should be accomplished, would not seriously effect the Senatorial
                        contest, the defeat of Glass would make Cameron's subsequent efforts for the
                        Senatorship but the convulsive throes of death.</p>
                    <p>The sentiment of the members on the Senatorial question is much more healthy
                        than I had reason to expect. Considering that nearly every member has been
                        visited at his home either by Cameron in person, or by some one charged with
                        plenary powers to meet every condition required, there was just reason to
                        apprehend that many would be taken in by his reckless appeals to cupidity
                        and ambition. But, fortunately, the sentiment of the Republican people of
                        the State has been aroused to very emphatic expression, and in no single
                        instance has it sent cheer or hope to Cameron. The facts that nearly every
                        expression made in the State has been for Gov. Curtin, and that nearly
                        one-half of the strong Republican counties of the west have given their
                        preference, while the Republican press of the State has declared for Gov.
                        Curtin more than two to one for all others, have made it a most perilous
                        step for members to disregard the manifest wishes of the party in disposing
                        of its richest wreath of victory.</p>
                    <p>It is now manifest that no Republican members, outside of Dauphin and
                        Philadelphia, can vote for Cameron and hope to be re-elected. It is a
                        painful commentary upon political movements in Pennsylvania that a candidate
                        so odious to the people and so fatal to his supporters, should even be
                        seriously considered in a struggle for the office demanding the highest
                        integrity and ablest statesmanship, and in no other Commonwealth could such
                        a condition of things exist. Here we have yielded him power, and allowed him
                        to compass the subordination of politicians and presses, until now he
                        demands for himself, at the cost of every future hope of the party, his
                        election to a position he has not a single attribute to adorn. Struggling as
                        he does against the positive wishes of the Republican People, and relying
                        for success solely upon influences and appliances which must stamp with
                        shame both himself and his supporters, it is reasonable to suppose that the
                        effort will be desperate; but with the overwhelming sentiment of the party
                        known to all, and jealous of its sacred right to respect and obedience, I
                        feel safe in saying that the State will be spared the humiliation of
                        Cameron's election to the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Those know me not who urge that I have personal feelings to gratify, or
                        disappointments to avenge, by thus earnestly protesting against Cameron's
                        election. Of him personally I have nothing to complain, but by his political
                        record I judge him, and no man can review it and honestly vote for him.
                        Disgraced on the records of the government in the discharge of his Indian
                        trust; stamped with corruption in every Senatorial struggle he has ever
                        made, by the records of our legislature; made a cabinet minister by a fraud
                        and dismissed to save the administration from the odium of his name;
                        denounced as unfit and unworthy for public trust by the solemn verdict of a
                        Congress two-thirds Republican, and whose blistering record still remains
                        with the sanction of all, and a suppliant for the patronage and plunder of
                        the apostate Johnson until he was compelled to desert him to make the
                        Senatorial contest, is it singular that he should be opposed in a struggle
                        for the highest honor Pennsylvania has to confer upon her statesmen? When
                        our State Convention met, in March last, he it was who championed Johnson
                        and wrung from that Convention a disgraceful compliment for Andrew Johnson,
                        the chief traitor of our history, and even during the last summer he pledged
                        the patronage of Johnson to effect his political ends. In Lancaster, when
                        the legislative nominations were made squarely against him--the man who
                        declared that he was "for Stevens first, for Cameron never" running the
                        highest vote--he conspired to defeat the ticket by a combination with the
                        Democrats by which the patronage of Johnson was to be apportioned, and it
                        failed only for want of popular support. In Philadelphia he furnished means
                        to Johnson officeholders to defeat regular Republican candidates for the
                        legislature because they would not agree to support him for Senator, and
                        boasted that he did so defeat Thomas in the 5th district. I have met several
                        members of the legislature who were by him threatened with defeat unless
                        they would pledge themselves to support him. I could name instances in which
                        the pledge was given to escape his rule or ruin policy, and Mr. Marshall, of
                        Union, who refused to violate the emphatic expression of his people, or to
                        meet fraud with fraud, was stricken down and a Copperhead elected by Cameron
                        rather than an anti-Cameron Republican.</p>
                    <p>To oppose such a man for the honored and responsible position of Senator in a
                        time of fearful peril to our common country, is a duty that no patriot can
                        disregard with integrity, and it is not a matter of surprise that the loyal
                        People of Pennsylvania are looking to the result with the most earnest
                        solicitude. But for the fearless candor of a few journals of the State, and
                        the aroused sentiment of the faithful men who have so nobly won our triumph,
                        he might have been successful; but with the thunder of the People
                        reverberating around and through the capitol, and clouds of witnesses
                        encompassing the legislature to triumph with its fidelity or proclaim its
                        shame, the election of Simon Cameron to the United States Senate is
                        impossible.<lb/> A. K. M.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>A long and successful career in crime emboldens the guilty. A recent
                        illustration of this law of human nature impels me to violate my life-long
                        rule of conduct, and for once to notice a political slanderer. I do not,
                        however, address you for the purpose of repelling his innuendos or
                        falsehoods. My life has been passed among you, and if its record, familiar
                        to you all, does not repel them, I have lived in vain. My purpose is simply
                        to pierce the mail of ill-gotten gold in which the slanderer has clothed
                        himself, and give you a glimpse at the loathsome object it protects.</p>
                    <p>The papers of Friday announce that Simon Cameron, of Dauphin county, was
                        serenaded by his friends on the preceding evening at the Girard House in
                        this city, and availed himself of the occasion to vilify my colleagues and
                        myself, "the Congressmen of Philadelphia," in a speech to the assemblage.</p>
                    <p>I was but a youth when I first heard the name of Simon Cameron, and it was as
                        the perpetrator of a great crime. He had been made the agent of the
                        Government to carry a large amount of money, due them, to the Winnebago
                        Indians, and had taken advantage of their ignorance and helplessness to
                        enrich himself. Those of you who had then attained to manhood, though you
                        may not, after the lapse of years, revive the burning indignation with which
                        you regarded the infamous swindler of the poor Indians, will doubtless
                        remember that, instead of paying the specie which the Government confided to
                        him for that purpose, he retained it and gave them the notes of the
                        Middletown Bank, of which he was an owner. At their encampment in the remote
                        wilderness these notes were utterly worthless. The Indians could not use
                        them for any purpose there, nor carry them to Middletown for redemption. But
                        what was that to Simon Cameron? Was not their loss his gain, and was he not
                        so much the richer by every note that failed to come home for redemption,
                        though they did not suffer and starve? And those of you who are not old
                        enough to remember all this now know why this bold, bad man is sometimes
                        spoken of by your seniors as the "Great Winnebago," and sometimes as "Old
                        Kickapoo."</p>
                    <p>For more than thirty years I have watched the tortuous career of this man,
                        and have never seen reason to abandon my first impression of his character.
                        Whether acting with the Democratic, the Know-Nothing or the Republican
                        party--for he has in turn disgraced them all--he has never been false to his
                        criminal instincts. He has endeavored to turn them all to profitable
                        account. His ambition is sordid and panders to his avarice, and he measures
                        honors by the perquisites they expose to his grasp. He has no confidence in
                        the people, and is aware that they distrust him. His speech of Thursday
                        evening was not characteristic of him, for he is prone to the use of
                        instruments. His habit is to point the stiletto, but employ another hand to
                        drive it home. Though an active participant in the politics of his country
                        and State for more than half a century, during which long period he has
                        pursued the profits of office, of jobs, of contracts, with eager and
                        ceaseless assiduity; he has never dared to permit his name to be presented
                        to the people of county or State as a candidate for an elective office. He
                        crawls to the feet of the appointing power. He cares not who may be King, so
                        that he may "still be Vicar of Bray," and to that end he chaffers with and
                        corrupts weak and needy members of conventions and Legislatures of both
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>I need not recite the disgraceful facts attending his several canvasses for
                        the United States Senate. Their nauseous odor lingers in your nostrils to
                        this hour. In the first he bought the votes of three Democratic members, and
                        in the last bid twenty thousand dollars for one vote which would have
                        elected him. This last transaction was so flagrant that the Legislature was
                        compelled to take cognizance of it, and if justice be not lame as well as
                        blind, the law and honor of our State will yet be vindicated.</p>
                    <p>The evil report of this deed pervades the country as a reproach to our State.
                        Yes, unhappily for Pennsylvania and her great interests, the buzzard-winged
                        fame of Simon Cameron is national. By months of abject solicitation and
                        corrupt bargaining, he procured a mass of letters, certificates and
                        recantations that imposed him upon President Lincoln as the representative
                        man of the Keystone State. That was an evil hour for Pennsylvania. You will
                        remember how he organized the navy agency in this city, and feel the
                        ineffable reproach he thus brought on our navy-yard and commercial and other
                        business men. In the course of his impudent and ill-judged harangue he said:
                        "In the olden time a member of Congress from Philadelphia would have had
                        sufficient influence to have carried his point (the establishment of a naval
                        station at League Island) without a dissenting voice." Is that the assertion
                        of a sober man? And did he who made it forget that our Congressmen in the
                        olden time in proposing to locate a Government workshop at Philadelphia had
                        not the terrible reputation of Simon Cameron, the Fagan of the Harrisburg
                        lobby and ex-Secretary of War to contend with, and, therefore, had some
                        chance for success? My colleagues and I were less happy than they in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>As I have said, he begged and bargained for the influence which induced Mr.
                        Lincoln to invite him to a seat in his Cabinet. It was now fondly hoped by
                        those who had not sounded the depths of his depravity, that, being old and
                        rich, he would take advantage of so distinguished an opportunity to prove
                        that he could be honest, and could administer a trust without turning it to
                        his own profit, or handing the fund over to his creatures, to be used on
                        joint account. How sadly these hopes were disappointed is attested by the
                        brevity of his term of office, and the circumstances under which it closed.</p>
                    <p>In less than one year from the day on which Simon Cameron was installed as
                        Secretary of War, Congress, though at that early day it had before it but
                        partial evidence of his crimes, indignantly drove him from that high office.
                        Two-thirds of the members of the lower House were friends of the
                        Administration, and would gladly have sustained each member of it as they
                        did its distinguished head.</p>
                    <p>You can imagine how painful it must have been to them to find themselves
                        constrained by duty to proclaim the fact that the first man, the head of
                        their party, had been induced to appoint as the successor of John B. Floyd
                        had exhibited greater aptitude than he for his worst tricks. But it became
                        inevitable; for this old man, notwithstanding his boasted and reputed
                        millions, believes that one of his name is never rich enough until he has a
                        little more, and, to save their party and their country, the friends of the
                        Administration in the House had to proclaim his infamy and denounce his
                        crimes. Nor was the vote by which they did it a meagre one. His friends, and
                        those who would most gladly have averted this disgrace from our State, could
                        rally but about one third of the House against the resolution of
                        condemnation. The vote was about two to one against him, though I as a
                        Pennsylvanian, not willing to bear witness against the representative of our
                        State, but too well satisfied of his guilt to vote against the resolution,
                        failed to record my vote.</p>
                    <p>In this fact, gentlemen, you have the secret of this distinguished
                        statesman's hostility to me and my friends. Mr. Walborn, the postmaster of
                        Philadelphia, and other of his creatures, have offered me his friendship and
                        support if I would endeavor to have that resolution expunged. My reply has
                        invariably been that to stir foul matter would be to produce a stench. I
                        have never in this or aught else endeavored to propitiate him or his
                        creatures. No stone may mark the spot where my poor remains may finally
                        rest, but I mean that my children shall be able to vindicate my name by
                        pointing to the fact that Simon Cameron and his confidential friends were
                        ever hostile to me.</p>
                    <p>With grateful regards, yours truly,<lb/> WM. D. KELLEY.</p>
