                <transcript>
                    <p>The Fall campaign may now be considered as fairly commenced. Each party has
                        held its convention, selected its candidates and declared anew the aims and
                        purposes of its organization. Each appeals earnestly to the people for their
                        support, insisting that in the triumph of the other would be involved more
                        or less of shame and disgrace, as well as actual detriment to the public. It
                        is not in the nature of things for both to be right. The gulf that separates
                        political truth from political error is a wide one, and it rolls its
                        ceaseless billows between these contending parties. One or other of them is
                        certainly marshaling its forces on the side of error.</p>
                    <p>Which can it be?</p>
                    <p>It becomes each man who has a proper sense of his responsibilities to his
                        government to answer this question for himself, before he enrolls with
                        either; to make answer too, not in accordance with the promptings of bigotry
                        or any mean personal considerations, but as truth itself directs. The issue
                        is a plain one. True, each party charges upon the other that it equivocates
                        and conceals somewhat of its purposes; but there is enough of the aims and
                        purposes of both disclosed and confessed to enable any fair and intelligent
                        voter to judge correctly between them. Besides each has a record, made
                        during the years of our struggle with rebellion, which goes far to explain
                        its true character, and which is a valuable help in detecting what, if any,
                        are the concealed purposes it cherishes.</p>
                    <p>The issue, as we understand it, is whether this Union of ours, shattered and
                        broken by a wicked rebellion, is in its reconstruction to be fashioned into
                        a perfect Republic wherein all men shall be free, save those who are slaves
                        by their own evil practices, and wherein all men shall be entitled to the
                        same right and privileges of citizenship, or whether it is to be a re-cast
                        of the old, in which all its flaws and imperfections, made even more
                        unsightly by the operation are to appear. The result of the issue will be to
                        fashion it one way or the other, and will commit the work either to those
                        who have proved their devotion to their government by rendering it an
                        unqualified support in the years when it was fearfully assailed by treason,
                        or to those who proved their enmity to it, either by open and flagrant
                        assault or by mean and guilty sympathy with its assailants. We state the
                        issue fairly. On the one side it is proposed to restore the old order of
                        things, notwithstanding the fact that the admitted changes of the last seven
                        years would operate so as to make the old order more oppressive than ever,
                        and to remove from us farther than ever the anticipated realization of a
                        pure Democracy. Negro slavery is no longer a recognized institution in this
                        land. By the most solemn enactment known it is forever abolished, and
                        henceforth no slave can breathe our air. Those who were slaves are now
                        freemen, and not only freemen but citizens, both by law and justice entitled
                        to all the rights and privileges of citizens. Shall the rebellious
                        communities, in many of which this class of population is numerically
                        stronger than the white, be rebuilt into States, which by fundamental laws
                        deny the common rights and privileges of citizenship to these freemen? Shall
                        this government which by its organic law is required to guarantee a
                        Republican form of government to each of the States, so far betray its
                        subjects and forget its duty as to assist in or even allow the erection of
                        States essentially opposed to this very principle? Shall the power and
                        control of these reconstructed States, and possibly of the general
                        government itself, be handed over the men who sought to destroy it? In a
                        word, shall the Republic be true to itself, its history and its present
                        life, or shall it be false to all? Democracy before the war found its allies
                        in the men whose animosity towards the government has since deluged the
                        country with blood, and brought sorrow into almost every habitation. She
                        asks now in the name of a constitution which her friends defied, that they
                        be restored to their former power, and good and true loyal men be made
                        political serfs subject to them. She asks that harmonious relations be
                        restored between the Union and "the rebellious States at the earliest
                        practical moment" but seeks to build up those "States" into oligarchies and
                        despotisms, because a majority of their people are opposed to her teachings
                        and hostile to her ambition. She would transform this government from a pure
                        democracy to a government founded on caste and prescription. In attempting
                        this she has denied the teachings of her founders and forgotten her own
                        sacred traditions. We arraign the Democratic party for a wicked ambition and
                        lust for power, that has smothered out of her organization all that was ever
                        in it of a pure and elevated patriotism. She is now a piratical craft upon
                        the high seas with a flaunting lie at her mast head, and seeks to approach
                        the object of her quest by deceit and fraud. Instead of being for democracy
                        she is against it and is fighting in the interest of caste and against the
                        interests of the whole people.</p>
                    <p>The Republican party on the other hand neither conceals its purposes nor
                        denies any of its traditions. It too demands a speedy restoration of
                        harmonious relations, but it insists that that restoration shall be on
                        democratic principles; that it shall not work oppression or injustice to any
                        of the citizens of the Republic; that it shall not be done in the interest
                        of any class against the people; that it shall not be made so as to reward
                        treason and punish loyalty, but that, on the contrary, it shall be so done
                        as to correct what abuses existed before, and establish these States in
                        conformity with the true spirit of our Republican institutions. The
                        Republican party is essentially the party of the people. It had its origin
                        in their oppression and sprang full armed to their relief. Its infancy and
                        maturer years have all been given to the struggle for the vindication of
                        their rights. Now that it is a giant and walks with the tread of a
                        conqueror, it is true to the faith in which it grew and by which it
                        strengthened. It asks nothing by way of favor, but demands what is right; it
                        would impose no burdens, but will exact equal justice for all men; it does
                        nothing for vengeance, but aims solely to promote the general good.</p>
                    <p>Such is the general character of the contending parties and such are their
                        respective purposes. The one opposed to popular government in the true and
                        liberal meaning of the phrase, and the other in heartiest sympathy with it;
                        the one contending for the supremacy of classes, the other battling for the
                        enfranchisement of all. The struggle has been a long one, the battles
                        frequent and success not unvaried for either. The parties approach each
                        other soon again for a renewal of the conflict. No man can be neutral in the
                        fight. Indifference at such a time is criminal. Let each voter act upon an
                        intelligent choice, with a full sense of his responsibilities as a freeman
                        to determine for himself--whether his sympathies are with those who seek to
                        maintain, support and defend a government of the people, by the people and
                        for the people, or with those who desire to have it perish from the earth.
                        In either case he can find his friends.</p>

                <summary>According to the editors, there is one key issue dividing the parties in
                    the upcoming election: their respective views on reconstruction. The Republicans
                    support a reconstruction policy to fashion the nation into "a perfect Republic,"
                    one in which "all men shall be entitled to the same right and privileges of
                    citizenship." By contrast, the Democrats endorse a return to the pre-war status
                    quo.</summary>

                    <p>The Franklin County Democracy again illustrated "its inexhaustible vitality"
                        by meeting in convention on Tuesday, the 3d, as much through force of habit,
                        we suspect, as anything else. It has got so used to meeting, resolving,
                        nominating and getting whipped that it goes through the performance very
                        much in the tread mill style. It travels a familiar round at a regular pace,
                        and always stops just where it started in, without having accomplished any
                        thing more than its own exhaustion. It is astonishing how some people can
                        content themselves.</p>
                    <p>"Dropping buckets into empty wells,<lb/>And growing old in drawing nothing
                        out."</p>
                    <p>but it is nevertheless true that some do that very thing, else the Democracy
                        would have followed the bucket to the bottom long ago and remained there.</p>
                    <p>We observed nothing peculiar about the convention. It was full and seemed to
                        be harmonious. There was but little contest as to who should pull the empty
                        bucket up this Fall, the matter evidently having been arranged before the
                        convention met. Col. Winger is to turn the windlass, Capt. Skinner to steady
                        the rope, Mr. Armstrong to look on and Mr. Shenafield to examine the bucket
                        when raised, to make sure that there is nothing pointed merely as company
                        for those who are expected to do the uninteresting labor. Mr. M'Lellan, as
                        chairman, conducted the Convention through the performance of its business
                        with a skill he acquired by practice in Republican assemblies, and which he
                        still retains. Mr. Brewer did his part by repeating for the convention one
                        of his early speeches, which by the way sounded as fresh as ever. Being of
                        the self-adjusting kind it suited the occasion about as well as the one it
                        was originally prepared for--a temperance celebration, we believe. The
                        programme finished, the Convention, adjourned, by the unanimous consent of
                        the members, and all quickly disappeared, each carrying with him the
                        consoling thought that if the bucket didn't come up at all this time it
                        wouldn't be his fault, and even if it was the loss wouldn't be a serious
                        one.</p>

                <summary>The piece notes that Col. Winger won the nomination to represent the
                    Democratic party in the election for Assembly because of his "excessive
                    antipathy to the negro. It was this quality of his head and heart that
                    especially commended him to the favorable consideration of his new associates."</summary>

                <summary>Declaring President Johnson's amnesty proclamation the "boldest of his many
                    mad attempts to circumvent Congress," the article condemns the Executive and
                    avows he "must yet be taught that there is a slight difference between the

                    celebrated colored lawyer," as head of the Freedmen's Bureau, the position
                    formerly held by Gen. Howard. The editors speculate as to the response of

                <summary>In the article, "Stentor" praises the ticket selected by Franklin
                    Republicans and contends the mountain people of the state support the Republican
                    party. Stentor singles out Mrs. Swisshelm for criticism; apparently, he
                    disapproves of Swisshelm's continued, but unwarranted, attacks on his character.</summary>
