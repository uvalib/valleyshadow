<b>The Spirit Travails</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors mock their rival at the Valley Spirit for the story he wrote
                    chronicling his trip through the Shenandoah Valley, and chastise him for
                    equating McCausland's raid on Chambersburg with the legitimate battles fought in
                    Virginia.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our neighbor of the Spirit, two weeks ago, with a
                        congenial company, went a gypsying down the valley. Having returned in
                        safety--there being no war now--the traveler records his impressions for the
                        benefit, doubtless, of such Democratic readers, as never saw the region or
                        its people. To them the sketches will be serviceable. They can see, perched
                        in an arm chair, what, for them who don't read the Spirit,--Republicans and War Democrats--is photographed on the
                        mind's eye, our beautiful valley, blue-walled and green-carpeted, gleaming
                        with gold and sparkling with streams, a very paradise for post-diluvians.
                        They can fancy, too, the Arcadians of this happy valley "peaceably pursuing
                        their lawful callings," "all toiling energetically for a living," and can
                        rejoice, either that other sections of our land are so highly favored
                        besides their own, or, that, if expedient, they may "change their location,"
                        and "settling on surplus lands" be welcomed as "practical farmers" by the
                        natives. With pious thankfulness at the alternative, a good Democrat can now
                        sleep peacefully. He can even resolve, should the radical air of this State
                        become too sulphurous, to act on the thought; leave his native fields;
                        forswear the upper valley; cross the dread Potomac; and fling himself into
                        the "open arms" of the kindly dwellers of the slopes of Massanutten. Our
                        neighbor has done good, therefore, as an explorer and historian, for, we
                        have often been puzzled, when thinking where or modern Democrats should go,
                        when the time comes that they discover how superfluous their so-called party
                        is, how obsolete their tenets, how old fogy their practices and working
                        beliefs! Like the Mormons, they must emigrate, and, as the newer school of
                        enlightenment presses upon and around them, must again remove, until faith
                        in man, as regard for woman with their compeers, will drive them into the
                        Gulf, as into the Pacific. But, in the lower valley, they can have a brief
                        respite; and, if, haply, they can buy the scenes of Stonewall Jackson's or
                        of Early's victories, which our neighbor specially enumerates, for fifteen
                        dollars an acre, they can be comforted with the thought that, here, at
                        least, the associations of rock and tree are inspiriting and intercourse
                        with man congenial.</p>
                    <p>Did it occur to our brother of the pencil and the quill, that the turnpike
                        along which he bowled so cheerily, the fields so golden or verdant to his
                        eye, were lately filled with thronging masses of men, whose trade was death,
                        whose hands were [illeg] muskets and sabres who met in conflict and poured
                        their mutual blood upon the slopes he so admired, and, dying, cursed the
                        victor; did he, then, re-people the scene and look well on the picture? If
                        he did, did he remember that the conflict was a causeless one, for those who
                        provoked it; that, in a land where injury and remedy pulse as responsively,
                        by the law of our constitution as attraction and repulsion among the spheres
                        by the law of God, it was murder to shed loyal blood, and treason against
                        Heaven as it was wrong to man? Did he even look closely at the plow-shares
                        which those farmers, at the bidding of interest or the compulsion of
                        necessity, were driving through the mould, to see whether the smith had
                        beaten out all likeness to a sword? It is well that the iron which so lately
                        swept in deadly circles over a patriot's head, should now vex the soil which
                        enwraps his clay, because good may come of it for the innocent who will, one
                        day, inhabit the land; but, it seems to us, it is full soon to grasp the
                        unrepentant hand which wielded it to destruction, and now, sullenly,
                        transforms it only under the compulsion of fate. The spirit of our
                        contemporary's article is suggestive of his kindness of heart rather than
                        the soundness of his judgement. We believe him loyal, at least, yet he
                        condones treason before the traitor asks for it--without a word of
                        reprobation for those who were the cause of the war and all its cruelties,
                        he condemns, unsparingly, those who fought his own battles. He links, in a
                        vain attempt at comparison, the honored name of Sheridan with the vandal
                        McCausland, and stigmatizes the man who saved his readers from the
                        incursions of thieving, marauding, rebels, as the counterpart of their most
                        lawless chief! This is certainly error in judgement. One feature redeems the
                        articles, however: they are bold ones. Had they appeared in that Wisconsin
                        sheet which out-Herods the Memphis prints in its eulogies upon the "lost
                        cause," they would be in keeping with their surroundings, but, when
                        published in the town M'Causland burned, and the county Lee harried, they
                        testify to a courage which would have set well on a commander, or to a
                        contempt for his readers and followers that would have graced even the
                        Veiled Prophet. Sheridan burned two thousand barns in a night; he stripped a
                        circle of five miles, because an Aid had been shot! He did these things and
                        is justified by orders, by circumstances, for doing them. He was ordered to
                        lay waste the valley, that an army might not again come up it and, foraging
                        in Pennsylvania, isolate the Capital from the North. As a soldier, he
                        obeyed. The burning of Chambersburg preceded his act, and, alone, justified
                        it. The death of young Meigs, shot while engaged as an Engineer in a
                        topographical survey, was, simply, the last of a long series of similar
                        murders perpetrated by the guerrillas of the valley, which, as they were
                        violations of every law of war and humanity, had to be repressed by the
                        sternest measures. Col. Tolles, the Chief Quartermaster of the Sixth Corps,
                        was shot near Winchester, in his ambulance, when sick, unresisting and
                        captured. Had Sheridan hung the inhabitants of the circle, Democrats might
                        cry out, but to burn their barns, was depriving them only of their
                        ill-gotten gains, which, filched from negroes' earnings, they were
                        perverting to base ends.</p>
                    <p>But our General remembered, moreover, that he was a commander in war time,
                        and, without orders, not for reprisal, retaliation or punishment, he was
                        justified. War means killing, burning, destruction, whenever it will best
                        gain the end. Wars, doubtless, are instigated by the Devil, but, when on
                        hand, can be met only as they are waged. To lay the valley waste meant two
                        things--it would save Pennsylvania and it would cripple Lee. Either is ample
                        justification for Sheridan's work. Let the blame rest upon them who began
                        the war. Had the Slaveholding conspirators appealed to the ballot rather
                        than to arms, Sheridan would now be a Quartermaster on the Plains, and Grant
                        a farmer in Missouri. We have no tears, accordingly, to mingle with the
                            Spirit's effusion, nor any desire to hasten
                        the day of reconstruction faster than the Congress of the nation, surveying
                        the whole land from an eminence higher than a carriage seat, consulting
                        interests other than those of a single narrow valley, and informants other
                        than men who yet bear titles which designate them as former leaders of men
                        who butchered and wantonly starved our brothers, may choose, in behalf of
                        freedom and security to grant. Their time will be early enough for us and
                        for the soldier who saved the land.</p>
