<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>PENNSYLVANIA on Tuesday last elected JUDGE SHARSWOOD to be the Supreme Bench.</p>
                    <p>To prevent this result we earnestly labored as best we knew how, and
                        confidently expected that it would be averted, though we were well aware of
                        the extraordinary efforts that were being made by our opponents to achieve
                        it, and fully appreciated the many disadvantages under and against which we
                        as a party had to contend.</p>
                    <p>We confess to a disappointment. We had hoped that the importance of the
                        election was fully understood by the people, and trusted to a correct
                        appreciation of what was involved in it to incite every man to the
                        performance of his whole duty, well knowing that all that was required to
                        give us an emphatic majority in the State was that the entire Republican
                        vote should be cast. The returns show that enough Republicans remained away
                        from the polls to make the victory of the Democracy an easy one. We have
                        been defeated by our own lethargy. Had our full vote been polled, our
                        majority would have been greater than that by which we elected our Governor
                        last year. We take it that the difference between the party vote of last
                        year and this, expresses the actual number of Republican delinquents who,
                        either from an indifference which ill becomes the good citizen at any time,
                        or an over confidence which is often as bad as none at all, stayed at home,
                        rather than exert themselves to get to the polls; while we know that many of
                        our friends alienated themselves from us, for the occasion only, on
                        questions of mere local interest and minor importance. From these facts we
                        conclude, and justly, too, we think, that the Republican party in
                        Pennsylvania is stronger to-day than it was one year ago that a full vote of
                        our people on the questions of national interest that divide the two parties
                        would show the State to be Republican in its sympathies by a majority not
                        less than thirty thousand. We cannot be mistaken in this. Therefore, while
                        we see nothing in the result of the late election to discourage us for the
                        future, to weaken our purpose or shake our faith in the ultimate triumph of
                        the principles we advocate, yet we have no desire to conceal the fact that
                        the defeat brings with it a keen regret that we would gladly have been
                        spared. It infuses a new vitality, feeble and transient though it be, into a
                        party which by reason of its ill disguised sympathy with rebellion deserved
                        a sudden and complete annihilation; it gives a new hope, fresh courage and
                        the prestige of victory to help it in future contests. We deplore it for
                        this. It will we fear serve to strengthen the wicked purpose and embolden
                        the depraved heart of the worst enemy of the Republic--Andrew Johnson--and
                        in this way may cost the nation still further disgrace and perhaps most
                        serious trouble. For this we regret it. It will encourage the rebellious
                        South to resist Congressional reconstruction, in the hope that by and
                        through the expected supremacy of the Democratic party in the North it can
                        gain what it lost in war. In this way the thorough pacification of the
                        country may be still further delayed and endangered. For this, too, we
                        deplore it, and for a dozen other reasons equally as strong and certain,
                        which will suggest themselves to every patriotic mind. But on the other hand
                        this defeat may bring with it advantages more than compensatory, that we
                        otherwise could not have had. It may serve as a stimulus in the future, and
                        make those who caused it by their indifference more active and zealous than
                        ever before. It has lessons which we can learn with profit if we will only
                        address ourselves to the task. Let us begin it at once and enter immediately
                        upon the great national contest before us with a fixed determination to do
                        our whole duty as citizens, and restore to its supremacy the party that
                        rescued the government from treason, and would still preserve it from the
                        hands of those who sought its destruction.</p>
