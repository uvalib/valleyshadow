                    Glossbrenner and Major McCue. The author suggests that Glossbrenner is trying to
                    "explain away infamous resolutions and doctrines too much tainted with negro
                    scent to smell well in this community."</summary>

                    <p>States, as well as individuals, often allow the golden opportunity to pass
                        unimproved. There is truth in the lines of the "Bard of Avon:"</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>"There is a tide in the affairs of men,</p>
                    <p>Which, taken at the flood, lead on to fortune,</p>
                    <p>Omitted all the voyage of their life</p>
                    <p>Is bound in shallows and in miseries."</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>For the people of this Valley there is now a "tide" which, if they act
                        wisely, they will "take at the flood," and it will lead them on to fortune.
                        The golden opportunity is now presented. Will they embrace it? The Baltimore
                        and Ohio Railroad Company will build a Railroad from Winchester to Salem if
                        our Legislature will but grant them the charter. Will this opportunity to
                        have this great improvement constructed, and to have millions of dollars
                        poured, almost immediately into the lap of Virginia be unwisely, ay,
                        foolishly thrown away? Shall we continue to be pinched with poverty when we
                        have the opportunity to have millions of dollars expended in our midst, and
                        for our own benefit, by capitalists from other States? Shall we sleep like
                        Rip Van Winkle, when others are wide awake, reaping the harvests we ought to
                        gather, or shall we arouse ourselves from the "ignoble supineness in which
                        we lie bound," "shake off the dew drops from our garments,' and press on
                        with energy, combined with wisdom, in the road which leads to fortune? Shall
                        our rich resources remain undeveloped, shall we continue to enact the part
                        of the surly dog in the manger, shall we refuse to grant the charter for the
                        construction of the Railroad from Winchester to Salem? We hope not -- we
                        believe not. We believe the present Legislature will grant the charter. We
                        hope that our delegates will look to this question, and rest not till at
                        least a vigorous efforts be made to effect this object -- a consummation so
                        devoutly wished. If we thought, for a moment, that either of them would
                        hesitate about favoring this project, we would urge upon our citizens the
                        propriety of holding a meeting at our next Court for the purpose of giving
                        expression to their views upon this subject, yet we are satisfied, from our
                        intimate knowledge of the men, and our confidence in their good sense, that
                        they will all vote for granting the charter. By all means, let us have the
                        road.</p>
