<b>For the County Court</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Denounces "discrimination against the poor, and in favor of the rich" and
                    calls for reform in the system of taxation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--As the county levy will be laid at the next term of the June
                        Court. I think it an appropriate occasion to call the attention of the Court
                        by a subject which calls loudly for reform. The county is heavily taxed for
                        county purposes; yet the poor, being the more numerous class, bear the heavy
                        proportion of the tax. Should not those who have large material interests in
                        the county bear a tax proportionate to that interest? In looking over the
                        assessment books of this county, I find Mr. F--'s property is valued at
                        fifty thousand dollars, and Mr. D--'s property is valued a fifty dollars.
                        Yet strange to say, while Mr. F-- paid nine dollars. Is there any justice or
                        reason in such discrimination against the poor, and in favor of the rich?
                        This unequal and unjust tax is now driven many of the industrious, honest
                        laboring men from the country, while the idle and vicious, who never pay
                        their taxes by assessing a property tax, as well as a Capitulation tax.</p>
                    <p>In these times of high taxes, to bear the oft repeated adage, "Blessed is he
                        that hath nothing." But the County Court (by their assessments) would seem
                        to say "Cursed is he that hath many children."</p>
                    <p>REFORM</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday of last week about 8000 persons turned out at Richmond with the
                        proper implements to decorate the graves of the 6,000 soldiers buried in
                        Hollywood Cemetery. On the next Thursday, about 20,000 persons turned out to
                        dress the graves and to strew them with flowers. The Examiner of Friday last says that agreeably to the
                        pre-arrangements of the Hollywood Memorial Association, the sacred touching
                        ceremonies incident to the dressing and floral adornment of the graves of
                        the Confederate dead that lie buried in Hollywood Cemetery, were carried
                        into effect. Business was suspended, the city was deserted, and the feet of
                        the people who revere the brave bore them forth to the quiet city of the
                        dead, where the hand of youth and of age, of both sexes, were busied in the
                        work of flowery decoration. The occasion was such an one as has never before
                        been witnessed in Richmond; and it is not probable that the eyes that looked
                        in admiration upon the deep, patriotic, heartfelt demonstration will ever
                        look upon a like scene again -- the Mourning Festival of Flowers.</p>
