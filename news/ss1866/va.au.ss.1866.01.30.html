<b>Petitions of "Union Men"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that J. W. Dewes, who served on the Freedmen's Court at the behest
                    of the area's freedmen, has been circulating a secret petition. The editor
                    demands that the contents of the petition be known.<br>(Names in announcement:  J. W. Dewes)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A special dispatch from Washington to the Public Ledger says that "petitions
                        from some of the States recently in rebellion have been received by the
                        President, asking on behalf of their signers, who are represented as "Union
                        men," that they be protected against the usurpations and proscriptions of
                        the dominant majority in those States."</p>
                    <p>We have been informed that Mr. W. H. Dewes, a man living in this place, who
                        was chosen by the Freedmen to act as their Judge in the Freedmen's court,
                        has been getting signers to a petition of some character, we know not
                        exactly what. Sa it has not been made known to the public, we suppose it is
                        not intended to be seen except by such as were willing to sign it. Are these
                        men petitioning for "protection"? --If so, protection against whom? Have any
                        threats been made against one? Do they desire troops to be sent here? If so,
                        for what purpose? Are not the citizens peaceable, quiet, harmless? The
                        petition was not shown to the citizens of the town, but taken some distance
                        into the country. If the citizens of any particular neighborhood desire to
                        have troops in their midst they have the right to ask for them; but we tell
                        them that they have no right to have them quartered upon us in the town.
                        When we desire or need them, we will ask for them ourselves. Petitions
                        secretly circulated should be brought to light. Upon what representations
                        were the signatures of the signers obtained? Will not one or more signers
                        apprise us, that the public may know, and that may stand justified.</p>
                    <p>Since the departure of the soldiers from this place, there has not been half
                        the disorder that there was before, and we understand that the head of the
                        Freedmen's Bureau says, that he had not had half the trouble since they left
                        that he had when they were here. The citizens do not want any soldiers here.
                        The citizens do not want any soldiers here -- the head of the Freedmen's
                        Bureau does not want them, and the Freedmen's Bureau themselves do not want
                        them, and the Freedmen themselves do not want them.--The Freedmen do not
                        relish the species of protection they granted, as it was of the kind which
                        the vulture gives to the dove, and the wolf to the lamb.</p>
                    <p>No Freedmen have been mistreated since they left -- whilst they were here,
                        maltreatment of them was almost of daily occurrence. There has not been a
                        new case for trial in the Freedmen's court for a month, as has been stated
                        by a member of the Court.</p>
                    <p>The people of the South who are sending such petitions to the President, as
                        spoken of in the above dispatch, under the name of "Union men," are not, in
                        truth, true Union men, but trifling characters who have gotten into some
                        positions which they do not deserve to fill where they can exercise a
                        "little brief authority," and desire to retain them and to do so bring
                        reproach upon better citizens by assuming to call themselves "Union men."
                        The great mass of the people in the South are now Union men in the true acceptation of the term. The only
                        disunionists now, are the Radicals of the North.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A meeting was held, by the citizens of Augusta County, at the Court House, on
                        Monday, (Court Day) January 22nd, of the purpose of expressing their desire
                        that the Legislature would grant a Charter for the construction of a
                        Railroad from Winchester to Salem, and of the completion of the Covington
                        &amp; Ohio Railroad.</p>
                    <p>On motion of H. M. Bell, Esq., Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, was called to the Chair,
                        and on motion of Bolivar Christian, Esq., Messrs. R. Mauzy, W. H. H. Lynn,
                        and A. M. Garber, Jr., were appointed Secretaries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart, on taking the Chair, explained the object of the meeting, and, in
                        a speech marked with ability, demonstrated the deep and vast interests the
                        citizens of this great Valley heave in the construction and completion of
                        the proposed Railroads.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Bolivar Christian, Esq., the Chair appointed a Committee to
                        prepare resolutions expressive of the sense of the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Chair appointed the following gentlemen to constitute that Committee.</p>
                    <p>Bolivar Christian, H. W. Sheffey, H. M. Bell, Absalom Koyner, David Fultz, H.
                        L. Gallaher and J. M . McCue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sheffey requested Mr. Fultz to address the meeting during the retirement
                        of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fultz delivered a practical speech in favor of granting the charter for
                        the construction of a Railroad up the Valley, and denounced in strong terms
                        the narrow contracted policy which governed our Legislature in the past.</p>
                    <p>Maj. John B. Watts then proceeded to address the meeting, and suspended his
                        remarks when the Committee, through their Chairman, announced the readiness
                        to report,</p>
                    <p>The Committee submitted the following preamble and resolutions:</p>
                    <p>The people of Augusta, in sympathy with the people of the whole Valley, so
                        long the highway of contending armies, and regarding it as vital to our
                        interest, in order to rebuild our ruined homes and restore our desolated
                        lands, (1st) to introduce foreign capital, of want of which we are utterly
                        crippled; (2nd) to induce immigration with the means to purchase our surplus
                        lands and the labor to develop our yet untested resources, and (3d) in order
                        to do this to construct railroads to connect us with the teeming traffic of
                        the West and North; to introduce from the plaster deposits of the Southwest
                        fertilizer so necessary to restore the waste of our limestone lands; and
                        Eastward to give our products the cheapest and speediest access to the
                        markets of our seaboard cities:</p>
                    <p>But while thus inviting capital from abroad we so appreciate the exhaustless
                        value of the resources of our Valley as to hold it but right to require of
                        this capital, as a recompense, such terms and conditions of its investment
                        here as will prevent any invidious discrimination against Virginia
                        interests, but will leave our local traffic and travel free to go wherever
                        interest or affection may invite:</p>
                    <p>And remembering that thirty years ago, when foreign capital tempted the
                        Valley with the magnificent proffer of railways throughout all her limits to
                        the Ohio and Tennessee lines, not only without any taxation, but with
                        actually a perpetual bonus to the State Treasury for the privilege, the
                        people of the Valley, in a spirit of patriotism, postponed their private
                        interest to an appeal from Eastern Virginia to await for facilities to
                        "better markets in Virginia." We have waited in vain until a generation has
                        passed away, and many of our most enterprising citizens in despair have
                        sought more favored lands -- but now that the Virginia treasury and
                        taxpayers are so helplessly unable to provide us the facilities so
                        indispensable to our resuscitation -- we ask, in simple justice, to be
                        permitted to look elsewhere for that aid so needed to drive the genius of
                        despair from the ashes of our desolated homes. Therefore.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. 1. That the construction of a railroad under a continuous charter,
                        or by the extension and connection of existing improvements, throughout the
                        Valley of Virginia from Winchester to Salem is of vital importance to the
                        people of the Valley.</p>
                    <p>2. That the development of the resources of this bounteous Valley is to that
                        extent the development of the resources of Virginia, and we repudiate the
                        policy which opposes all improvements that do not point to some particular
                        section regardless of the interests of other sections, as a policy which
                        prostrates the energies of the people, dwarfs the resources and in the end
                        retards the development of the whole Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>3. That the completion of the Covington and Ohio Railroad to the Ohio River,
                        is a work of incalculable and indispensable importance to the interests of
                        the whole Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>4. That we claim the right to demand the privilege of having these great
                        improvements promptly undertaken, and completed as they may now be, without
                        cost or charge to the public treasury, and that our Representatives in the
                        General Assembly are hereby requested to use every exertion to secure the
                        construction of these improvements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fultz offered the following substitute for the report of the Committee:</p>
                    <p>It is only by contrasting our condition after with what it was before the
                        war, that we can fully realize the extent of our losses. Then our farms were
                        well stocked and in a fine state of cultivation; and with a well organized
                        system of labor we were blessed with abundant harvests; now they are
                        dilapidated, the enclosures, and, in many instances, the buildings are
                        destroyed; and with a deranged system of labor which promises but little, if
                        any , surplus products.--Then we had a sound convertible currency; now what
                        little remains is about to be swept from us by the policy of the stay law.
                        Then lighter taxation never rested upon a free people; now its accumulated
                        weight, National and State, threatens to crush us to the dust. Then, in
                        short, we were prosperous and happy; now the ravages of a most desolating
                        war are scattered all around us.</p>
                    <p>But amidst the gloom that hangs over us we cannot afford to despair. There is
                        hidden mercy, behind every dark cloud. Let us then return to first
                        principles, and rigidly practicing industry and economy, our energies will
                        revive and we will find ourselves again on our feet in the road to
                        prosperity and happiness.</p>
                    <p>In the opinion of this meeting, there is now no scheme that wisdom can devise
                        which will more certainly and expeditiously relieve us from our embarassed
                        and crippled condition, that the construction of a railroad from Winchester
                        through the Valley to intersect the Tennessee Railroad. Therein.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, 1. That the making of said road is of vital importance to the
                        people of the Valley, and we most earnestly invite the people of other
                        counties to unite with us, in a most urgent but respectful appeal to the
                        Legislature, now in session, to grant a charter to construct the same.</p>
                    <p>2. That the right of the people of the Valley to choose their markets, is
                        just as incontestible as their right to raise surplus products; and this
                        right should not be sacrificed to the interest of any particular market or
                        locality.</p>
                    <p>3. That it is the duty of the Government to provide its citizens with every
                        facility to market, and when a people are forced to trade with any
                        particularly market against their natural interests, it is a tax upon then
                        to the extent of the difference in favor of other markets, is unjust and
                        oppressive, and should not be tolerated.</p>
                    <p>4. That as ardently and as sincerely as we desire the return of our brothers
                        from the West, and that we may be again united, and Old Virginia once more
                        as she was, yet, if a narrow, contracted policy on the part of the
                        Legislature shall again defeat our claims, it will be our duty, as an
                        oppressed people, to earnestly appeal to our fellow-citizens of the Valley
                        to unite with us in an application for annexation to West Virginia, where we
                        know our rights will be respected.</p>
                    <p>This substitute elicited a discussion, Mr. Fultz favoring the substitute, and
