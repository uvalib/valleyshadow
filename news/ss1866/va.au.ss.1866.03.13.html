<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Louisville Journal</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Though the manufacturers of the North are rapidly making money, yet they are
                        clamoring for the imposition of high tariffs to protect them. If the North
                        impose high tariff, the people of the South should avail themselves of the
                        benefits of them by going to work to establish factories of all kinds. The
                        Louisville Journal wisely suggests that the best
                        way to attack the manufacturers is to imitate them, and establish
                        manufactories of our own. If they grow rich by manufacturing, we can do the
                        same. If they have the advantage of a greater populations, they got the
                        population by establishing manufactories, and the workmen came. They would
                        come to us of the South for a similar reason. Slavery, which formerly kept
                        them away, exists no longer, and if we furnish them congenial occupation,
                        and hold out to them the prospect of competence, they will come. If New
                        England has power to keep up a tariff upon domestic manufacturers, we can
                        get the benefit of it by establishing manufactories of the articles taxed.
                        This is the surest kind of protection.</p>
