<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The result of the recent elections in the New England States, and the
                        outrageous conduct of a considerable number of the people in the Western
                        States towards President Johnson, have had the effect of causing many
                        persons in the South to take a gloomy view of the situation. The Richmond
                            Examiner says that "the country is the prey
                        of hastening ills. The profligacy of the times admonishes us to hope little
                        and fear much. the war for the Union seems to have resulted in the
                        perpetration of disunion. The Constitution has been saved only to be
                        condemned and trampled upon. Liberty has ceased to be anything but a name,
                        or realized only by Radicals and negroes. The spirit of John Brown is rife
                        in the North. It is "marching on," conquering and to conquer. It will down
                        at no one bidding, and stalks onward with an aspect presaging inconceivable
                        horrors.</p>
                    <p>It is, indeed, a stupendous outrage upon the American people that their
                        President is so silenced and insulted; but that is a comparative trifle to
                        the animus of which it is the alarming exponent.
                        A licentious party dominates the nation, and in a reckless career of
                        excesses of all kinds is hurrying us all to a catastrophe that shall whelm
                        everything that is justly held dear. We believe that we are on the verge of
                        disasters that will end in a bloody civil war between the parties of the
                        North, and a war of races here. It is worse than folly to attempt to
                        disguise matters. Never in the history of the United States have all omens
                        been so portentious. Our malignant star is in the ascendant, and horrors
                        brood over us."</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Times says that "the fear of defeat
                        at the approaching elections has changed the programme of the Revolutionists
                        in but one respect. They dare not press negro suffrage at this time, but
                        nobody questions their determination to force it upon us if the approaching
                        elections demonstrate that the Northern people sustain the flagitous conduct
                        of the last Congress. And the men who advocated the most aggressive policy
                        and the most oppressive treatment of the South have been in every instance
                        renominated, and their course meets, it would seem, the approval of their
                        constituents.--Thaddeus Stevens has just reiterated his former views with
                        reference to confiscating our property for they payment of the national
                        debt, and he declares that confiscation and disenfranchisement are the
                        measures which he shall press upon Congress with renewed energy if he is
                        re-elected to that body. The Southern people must not, therefore, cherish
                        the delusion that outside of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and
                        California among the original free States, there are any indications of the
                        demoralization of our enemies.</p>
                    <p>In those States and in Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, in spite
                        of the infamous "registry laws," we believe the Conservatives will send
                        unbroken delegations to Congress, and we may hope for gains in the four
                        States which we have named. But it is, we think, now very evident, that the
                        disintegration of the Radical party will not take place during the present
                        year. The utmost the Conservatives can now rationally hope for will be the
                        reduction of the Radical majority in Congress sufficiently to prevent the
                        passage of odious and unconstitutional laws, over the veto of the President.
                        But even this is still a matter of painful doubt and uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>While no one anticipated the defeat of the Radicals in any of the New England
                        States, we have been startled by their enormous gains in States where it was
                        anticipated that they would elect their candidates for Congress by decreased
                        majorities. Far from gaining a Congressman in Maine, the only district which
                        was reported as doubtful has returned a Radical Congressman by nearly four
                        thousand majority."</p>

                    <p>Staunton, Va., August 29th, 1866</p>
                    <p>Messrs. N. B. Meade, J. T. Wall, r. W. Hunter, P.
                            Williams, H. Kyd Douglas and W. T. Bent -- Gentlemen: I have had
                        the honor to receive your note of the 25th instant, in which you invite me
                        to attend and address a meeting of the people of Frederick, which is to be
                        held in Winchester on the 3d of September "to endorse the action of the
                        President, as opposed to the Radicals, and to ratify the proceedings of the
                        late Philadelphia Convention.</p>
                    <p>Important business engagements render it impossible for me to accept your
                        kind invitation, but although I cannot be present in person, my sympathies
                        will all be with you.</p>
                    <p>I was one of those who, from the first, approved the call of the Philadelphia
                        Convention, and though it important that the Southern States should be
                        represented in it, so as to give to it the impress of nationality. I
                        thought, too, that the South owed the President a large debt of gratitude
                        for his noble and manly defence of their power to strengthen his hands in
                        the great contest in which he was engaged.</p>
                    <p>I think that the Philadelphia Convention did its work quite as well as we had
                        any reason to expect. It is true that there are some things in the platform
                        and address which we would have preferred to have omitted, but we should
                        remember that the battle for constitutional liberty is to be fought in the
                        North, and we certainly ought not to quarrel with our Northern friends for
                        choosing the weapons best adapted to secure a victory. When we are sick, we
                        select medicines that will be most efficient to eradicate disease -- not
                        those that are most palatable.</p>
                    <p>I think we can without sacrifice of honor or principle ratify the proceedings
                        of the Philadelphia Convention. I believe the actions of that body is
                        destined to exert an important. I may say a controlling influence in the
                        permanent restoration of sound constitutional principles. I am hopeful of
                        the future. I have an abiding faith in the patriotism and sober second
                        thought of the people. I think I see the hand writing on the wall which
                        announces to the Radicals that they have been weighed in the balance and
                        found wanting. Retribution, swift and sure will overtake them at the coming
                        elections, and when the next Congress assembles the Southern States will be
                        restored to their constitutional rights and positions in the Union.</p>
                    <p>With thanks for the honor you have done me by your invitation.</p>
                    <p>I am very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your ob't serv't,</p>
