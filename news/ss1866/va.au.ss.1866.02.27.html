                    <p>Staunton, February 6, 1866</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Hon. A. H. H. Stuart:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--Enclosed please find memorial to the Congress of the U. S. asking
                        an increase of duties on foreign imports, which I have received from the
                        Secretary of the "American Home Labor League," with the request that I
                        should have them signed by the people of our county. I feel a very great
                        interest in the subject, and think a protective tariff would greatly assist
                        in the development of our section, but being unrepresented in the U. S.
                        Congress, I am not sure that a petition from us would have any effect, and I
                        have concluded to submit them to you, and to ask your opinion on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Your respectfully,</p>
                    <p>W. A. Burke</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Staunton, Va., Feb. 8th, 1866.</p>
                    <p>
                        Wm. A. Burke, Esq.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--I have received your note of the 6th inst., enclosing a petition
                        of the "American Home Labor League," and asking my opinion as to the
                        propriety of your undertaking to second the effort to procure adequate
                        protection to American industry.</p>
                    <p>As the people of Virginia are now unrepresented in Congress, as much through
                        the agency of Pennsylvania members as any other cause, I do not see any good
                        that would be likely to result from such an attempt. You had better wait,
                        until the sober second thought of the Northern people shall have produced
                        its effects on the National Councils.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the general purpose of the petition, I need hardly say, I am in
                        favor of it.--For twenty-five years, I have been the consistent advocate of
                        the protective policy. As early as 1842, I delivered an elaborate speech in
                        favor of it, in the Congress of U. S., and on several occasions
                        subsequently, I have, in public addresses, sought to enforce the same line
                        of policy. Recent events have strengthened, rather than changed, my
                        convictions on the subject.</p>
                    <p>From the foundation of the government until 1824, the leading public men of
                        Virginia were supporters of a liberal tariff. One of the best reports ever
                        made to Congress in favor of protection, was submitted by Mr. Newton, on of
                        the representatives from Virginia. I have always thought that the public men
                        of Virginia committed a great error in abandoning the ground taken by
                        Washington, and other fathers of the Republic, in favor of fostering
                        domestic industry. Virginia possesses as many, if not more, of the elements
                        of wealth, if properly developed, than any other State in the Union.--To say
                        nothing of her gold mines, which are beginning to attract so much attention,
                        she has boundless quantities of coal, iron, copper, lead, salt, gypsum,
                        manganese, kaolin, barytes, feldspar, and the purest white sand and silex
                        for manufacture of glass.</p>
                    <p>She also possesses immense forests of ship and building timber, and water
                        power without limit.</p>
                    <p>The salubrity of her climate, the fertility of her soil, and the adaptation
                        of most of her territory to the growth of tobacco, cotton, and every kind of
                        grain and grass, and fruits, including grapes in profusion and of fine
                        quality, render the old State more desirable as a residence than other part
                        of our country with which I am acquainted.</p>
                    <p>We are midway between the North and South and possess the advantages of both
                        without the drawbacks on either.</p>
                    <p>Yet with all these advantages, Virginia has never been a prosperous State.
                        And why?--Simply because she has not shown the proper energy and judgment in
                        developing her resources. She has been, almost exclusively, an agricultural
                        State, and she has expended all the proceeds of her crops in buying from the
                        North a thousand things that she should have made at home. Clinging to
                        certain delusive political theories, she has neglected her substantial
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>But all that belongs to the past. The revolution in her labour system will
                        compel a change in her policy. A new era is dawning upon us, and we must
                        accommodate ourselves to the new condition of things.</p>
                    <p>We must diversify our pursuits. We must open our mines and coal-fields, fell
                        our forests, improve our water power, introduce all kinds of machinery,
                        extended our orchards, plant vineyards, and establish manufactories and
                        work-shops of every description. We must build up a home market for the
                        products of our fields, and make within ourselves every thing necessary for
                        our comfort.</p>
                    <p>The recent war has taught us some useful lessons. It has shown us how
                        dependent we have been on the North and foreign countries, and how helpless
                        we were when cut off from the outside world. Let us profit by this painful
                        and humiliating experience, and try and put ourselves on a better footing in
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Our country needs a settled policy in regard to
                        domestic industry. Change, perpetually recurring change, has been the source
                        of untold injury. A bad policy steadily adhered to, is hardly as mischievous
                        as one that is constantly shifting. Our people have never had any assurance
                        of stability in our policy. It has generally happened, heretofore, that as
                        soon as men of enterprise were tempted, by a fair tariff, to invest capital
                        in manufactories, a cry was raised for the repeal of the law. With the
                        repeal, down went all the enterprises that had been set on foot. The
                        competition produced by home industry was withdrawn, and foreign nations
                        were able to tax us at pleasure.</p>
                    <p>It seems like a paradox to say that a well digested protection tariff tends
                        to bring down prices. Yet it is unquestionably true.</p>
                    <p>Let me illustrates this idea. Suppose England, in consequence of greater
                        capital, cheaper labor, and other causes has an advantage over the U. S.
                        equal to 40 per cent in the production of iron, and of 20 per cent in cotton
                        goods. In view of this disparity, it is obvious, we cannot enter into
                        competition with her, and she consequently has a monopoly, and can fix
                        prices to suit herself. The only competition is among her own producers, and
                        they find it to their interest to combine to keep up
                            prices.</p>
                    <p>But suppose we impose a tariff of 40 per cent on the British iron and 20 per
                        cent on British cotton goods, is it not plain, that this will bring our home
                        manufacturers up to the point of competition with the foreigner? They can
                        then stand the contest, because they fight the battle, as it were, behind a
                        rampart of protection.--Active competition begins between the domestic and
                        foreign producer. The foreign monopoly is destroyed, a struggle ensues to
                        undersell each other, and thus prices are worked down to the lowest point at
                        which the commodities can be produced.</p>
                    <p>I admit on the other hand, that duties may be too high, and thus drive out
                        the foreigner and secure a monopoly to the home producer. But this can
                        easily be avoided. The true rules is, to graduate the duty, on each article
                        so as to keep up the competition.</p>
                    <p>If we had t he protective policy firmly established, on the principle above
                        indicated, why should not Virginia in twenty years outstrip New England in
                        cotton goods, and Pennsylvania in iron? We are nearer than those States to
                        the raw-material, and to the markets in which our wares would be sold.</p>
                    <p>Our mines and coal fields are as extensive and as rich as those Pennsylvania.
                        Our water power is never obstructed by ice, while that of New England is
                        locked up for months at a time and they are compelled to substitute
                        steam.--Steam cannot successfully compete with water power.</p>
                    <p>Provisions are cheaper here than at the North. Our seasons are longer -- our
                        lands are better -- our stock requires less food and attention than theirs,
                        and our families need less fuel and clothing to protect them against the
                        rigors of the climate.</p>
                    <p>New England has to bring all her provisions and raw materials a long way
                        before they work them up, and then she has to transport the product of her
                        skill and labor a great distance to market.</p>
                    <p>We have every thing we need, as it were, at hand, to be worked up, and
                        distributed, without heavy freight or transportation. We of Virginia need
                        protection, until we can get fairly under war. When we have established our
                        manufactories, our natural advantages will assert their power.</p>
                    <p>Our people also need relief from direct taxation and stamp duties which they
                        find so burdensome. A high tariff will tend not only to give this relief but
                        also to induce foreigners to transfer capital skill and machinery to
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If a guarantee could be given of a permanent protective tariff, I am greatly
                        mistaken, if, within twenty, Richmond, Petersburg, Fredericksburg and other
                        towns near the falls in our rivers, would not be formidable rivals of
                        Pittsburg, Lowell and Lawrence and other manufacturing towns of the North.
                        Now is the crisis of our fortunes. If we will discard antiquated errors, and
                        hereditary prejudices, we can soon repair, so much as is reparable, of the
                        injuries of the past, and establish our prosperity on a solid and durable
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me very plain that no nation can ever prosper which buys more
                        than it sells.--This has been our case. All that we received from our
                        tobacco, wheat, and other agricultural products has been expended in the
                        purchase of goods from other States and Countries. We have thus been always
                        kept poor. The time has come when we must change all this. We no longer have
                        slaves to till our lands. Let us now be self-dependent. Let us make what we
                        can, within ourselves. Let us keep our money at home, and spend it among our
                        own people. Our wealth will thus be increased. Our lands will rise in value,
                        our population will be augmented, and out whole country wear a new aspect.</p>
                    <p>Why should we not beat the North with their own weapons? We have as much
                        inventive genius as they, and we have, as I have shown, greatly the
                        advantage in geographical position, and all that physical elements necessary
                        to a successful prosecution of manufacturing industry.</p>
                    <p>The great cause of discord between North and South, in former years, was a
                        supposed, (but not real) antagonism between their systems of labor. Rightly
                        understood, and controlled by wise statesmanship, these systems ought to
                        have operated in perfect harmony -- as allies, instead of adversaries --
                        each producing what the other could not produce, and each supplying the best
                        markets for the products of the other.</p>
                    <p>The North asked protection for her white labor, which was essential to its
                        existence, because it had to compete with the pauper labor of Europe. The
                        South, needing no protection for its peculiar labor and productions, because
                        they had no formidable competition in the markets of the world, refused to
                        accord it to the free labor of the North, and thus by a short-sighted and
                        mistaken policy, the two systems were brought into a relation of antagonism
                        which culminated in the war. If we had supported the protective system. I
                        really believe we would have had no war. If you will revert to the history
                        of the last forty years, you will find that whenever we had a protective
                        tariff, comparative quiet prevailed in the country; but as soon as
                        protection to free labor was withdrawn, sectional excitement and animosity
                        followed.</p>
                    <p>The levee or dyke, which has heretofore confined the negro population within
                        the Southern States, has been broken down by the war, and freedmen will
                        gradually migrate into Northern and Western States. The peculiar interests
                        of slave labor have ceased to exist. All cause of sectional animosity has
                        thus been removed, and the contest hereafter, will be, not between sections
                        and systems of labor, but between individuals, and perchance races, on the
                        broad theatre of the Union.</p>
                    <p>We must prepare ourselves for this great struggle. We must subdivide our
                        lands, and improve our agriculture. We must foster domestic manufactures,
                        and create a home market. We must, in a word, make all our natural
                        advantages tell in the effort to promote our
                        prosperity and happiness.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that other will follow your example, in abandoning old
                        party dogmas and obsolete ideas. From all I can see and hear, I am satisfied
                        that a wholesome change has taken place in the public sentiment of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If our people, with out genial climate, fertile solid and inexhaustible
                        sources of wealth, cannot compete successfully with the inhabitants of the
                        bleak hills of New England, this fact, will furnish strong presumptive
                        evidence, that we do not deserve the blessings which a benificent Providence
                        has so bountifully bestowed upon us.</p>
                    <p>I have thus, according to your request, hastily, and amid many interruptions,
                        expressed my opinions. You can make such use of them as you choose.</p>
                    <p>Very Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your obedient Servant,</p>
                    <p>ALEX. H. H. STUART</p>
