                <summary>Referring to a conflict during recent elections in Baltimore, the article
                    claims that the Radical faction "avows the determination of precipitating
                    another civil war upon the country, sooner than surrender their hold on office,
                    and their enjoyment of political power."</summary>

                    <p>Merit should be the <orig reg="standard">stanard</orig> of respectability,
                        and not wealth, as has been too much the case in this country. We think,
                        with the Lynchburg <emph rend="italics">News</emph>, that "wealth ought to
                        cease from constituting the basis of social distinction.--When we consider
                        the way in which wealth was used by some and kept by others among
                        Confederates during the late war, we have more reason to honor to those who
                        lost than those who saved or added to their propriety. That which was meanly
                        held back from suffering soldiers and the starving poor ought no now to be
                        looked upon as a title to high social rank.--Now, in fact, is a propitious
                        time for the formation of a genuine code of social distinctions, founded on
                        patriotism, intelligence, and character, wholly independent of accidents,
                        and more especially of property. Now that we are all brought so nearly to a
                        common level by the destruction of property incident to war it seems highly
                        appropriate to abandon wealth as a token of social consideration, and to
                        develop an aristocracy of morals, culture, intelligence. After the trials,
                        sufferings, and temptations of the frightful and searching ordeal through
                        which they have passed, the characters of the survivors are well known to
                        each other. They know who can be trusted, whom to follow, who to honor. They
                        are all poor together, and the most of them must so continue for a long
                        time; but that poverty need not compel them to do homage to vulgar wealth
                        dishonorably saved, or disreputably won.</p>
                    <p>Let us inaugurate the ear we have suggested above, and them, if our radical
                        enemies will but let us alone, and mind their own business, we will show
                        them that we can live and be content without the profits of their shops, or
                        the products of their looms.</p>
                    <p>Let not the good people among us once made rich by thrift and good
                        management, but since made poor by the war, feel that they have lost in
                        caste by the loss of wealth; the continuance of the esteem and respect of
                        their friends will take from their loss half its pain. Let nothing be said
                        or done to make any worthy Southern men, woman or child feel ashamed of
                        poverty. It is now more than ever incumbent upon those few who have the
                        means of procuring luxuries, to refrain from ostentation and extravagance,
                        out of deference to the feelings of their less fortunate neighbors. A new
                        social era ought now to be inaugurated where society can be enjoyed in
                        homespun and calico, free from any hankerings of imported luxuries of the
                        table, the menage or the wardrobe. Some of these privations are found not a
                        little annoying, more especially to those once used to abundance; but a
                        little patience, aided by a little just and proper pride, will enable them
                        to endure the change without murmur."</p>

                    designed "to make negro suffrage the act of the Southern people, so that
                    hereafter the Southerners may be stopped from denying negro equality" and warns
                    that "political equality soon leads to social communion."</summary>
