<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the South should not make any more "concessions" to the
                    Radicals in Congress. If the constitutional amendment is adopted, the article
                    warns, Southerners will only "be put through the gauntlet again for the savage
                    delight of their tormentors." The South should instead "throw federal politics
                    to the dogs."<br>

<b>Constitutional Amendment</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that, while Radicals threaten worse measures if the South does not
                    adopt the constitutional amendment, nothing could be worse than the proposed
                    amendment. The article also suggests that if the amendment is adopted without
                    the consent of Southerners, their position would be analogous to that of a
                    "victim of a rape"--they would be pitied. If they consent to it, however, they
                    would be prostituting themselves and would be "eternally abhorred."<br>
