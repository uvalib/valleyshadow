                    <p>In accordance with th request of the ladies of the Cemetery Committee, on
                        Thursday last the citizens of Staunton close their houses of business and
                        repaired to the Cemetery with picks, hoes, spades and shovels to dig graves
                        to receive the remains of the soldiers buried on the battlefield of Piedmont
                        and of such others as were buried at Stribling Springs and other places in
                        the county. Such of the citizens as were not able, from sickness or other
                        cause, to go to labor themselves hired persons to work in their stead. Some
                        colored persons volunteered to assist, and many were hired. All worked well,
                        and by 5 o'clock in the evening they dug, it is supposed, a sufficient
                        number of graves to receive the remains of all the soldiers buried in the
                        Cemetery. The next labor will be to disinter and have the remains of the
                        soldiers buried at Piedmont, Stribling Springs and others places, brought to
                        the Cemetery and properly buried. The Cemetery Committee will not cease
                        their labors till this be accomplished, and then they will probably succeed
                        in having suitable monument erected in the Cemetery.</p>
