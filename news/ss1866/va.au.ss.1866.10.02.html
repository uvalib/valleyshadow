<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Laments that the fragile coalition forged at the National Convention in
                    Philadelphia is now fracturing and warns Southerners against adopting the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The patriotic labors of he late "national Convention," which met in
                        Philadelphia, have, we fear, says the Richmond Times, been attended with no good results. A truce was patched up
                        between the Northern Democracy and moderate Republicans, but it was
                        temporary, hollow and insecure, and has been followed by open hostilities
                        between the late allies. The pledges to support the Presidents's policy of
                        reconstruction which were given by Raymond and Weed, as the accredited
                        representatives of the Conservative Republicans, have already been broken.</p>
                    <p>The Maine and Vermont elections utterly demoralized the author of the address
                        of the Philadelphia Convention, and, in imitation of Saturn, he is devouring
                        his own offspring. Indeed, the coalition of Northern parties, from which
                        such happy results were anticipated, has fallen to pieces, and those who
                        were six weeks ago most vociferous in advocating the policy of the President
                        are now deserting it, and advocating the adoption of the Congressional
                        amendment. The New York Herald, Times and Post have already gone over bag and baggage to the
                        enemy, and thousands of time-serving demagogues are in motion, or busily
                        packing up and preparing to go over. A defeat to the Conservatives in
                        Pennsylvania would give the finishing blow to the Conservative party. The
                            Herald and the Times now boldly affirm that the President will very soon succumb to
                        the teachings of the late Northern elections, and issue a proclamation
                        advising the Southern States to adopt the Constitutional amendment which he
                        has devoted so much time to opposing.</p>
                    <p>These demonstrations have greatly alarmed the Radicals, who fear that the
                        adoption of the "Amendment" will strip them of all pretext for further
                        sectional agitation. As they are ill-omened birds that delight only in
                        stormy weather, may of them have already boldly proclaimed that even if the
                        Southern States shall abase themselves to the earth and adopt the
                        "Amendment," they shall not profit by their humility and dirt-eating. The
                        leading organ of that party now declares that "no leading Republican in
                        Congress means to admit the ten waiting States simply on the adoption of the
                        Constitutional amendment until the rebel States consent to come back upon
                        the basis of equal political rights to all loyal citizens." If, therefore,
                        there is any Southern man who believes that the adoption of the "Amendment"
                        will bring peace and restoration, he is very much mistaken.</p>
