                <transcript>
                    <p>There is no part of the continent of America which possesses superior (if
                        equal) advantages to the Valley of Virginia. It lies in the middle region,
                        and its climate is proverbially salubrious. Its inhabitants are rigorous and
                        live to great age. A large number of our people outlive, by one or two
                        decades, the allotted span of human life, and it is not unfrequently the
                        case that they attain patriarchal age of 100 years. The achievements of the
                        "Stonewall Brigade," in the late war, composed almost exclusively of Valley
                        people, sufficiently attest to their capacity of endurance.</p>
                    <p>The soil of the Valley is remarkable for its fertility. It produces in
                        abundance, not only wheat, rye, oats, corn and barley, but it is
                        particularly adapted to grass and fruits of all kinds. The inexhaustible
                        ledges of limestone furnish the means, not only of maintaining, but of
                        increasing, almost indefinitely, its productiveness. The Piedmont country is
                        a very fine district, but in some respects it is inferior to the Valley.
                        Every traveller in crossing the Blue Ridge must be struck with the marked
                        change in the appearance of the country, and most especially of those fields
                        which are not in crop. The broomsedge, sassafras and briers which spring up
                        with such rapidity east of the mountain, are comparatively unknown in the
                        Valley. West of the Blue Ridge, the farms have a neat, clean look, the
                        fields are covered with clover, timothy, or indigenous grasses, and the
                        fence rows, in the main, are free from shrubs and briers. Herein consists
                        one of our great advantages. If you turn out and exhausted field east of the
                        ridge, it will soon wash into gullies, or clothe itself with broom sedge,
                        briers, or sassafras, or small pines. West of the mountain, an abandoned
                        field will protect itself from the sun the first season by a mantle of
                        weeds, which soon give place to a spontaneous growth of blue grass.</p>
                    <p>We remember that, some year ago, two or three intelligent citizens of the
                        Valley, tempted by the lower prices of lands east of the mountain, had a
                        thought of selling their Valley lands, and removing to the Piedmont region.
                        Before making a final decision, however, they determined to visit that
                        section, and to make a careful examination of the relative advantages and
                        disadvantages of the two portions of the State. They accordingly spent some
                        weeks east of the mountain, making minute explorations, and returned
                        satisfied to remain in the Valley. According to their report, the increased
                        labor necessary to keep the Piedmont lands in order, in consequence of the
                        tendency to put forth sassafras, sedge, briers, and other noxious products,
                        more than compensated for the difference in the price of lands.</p>
                    <p>The facility with which lime can be procured in the Valley to be used as a
                        fertilizer is an almost incalculable advantage. Under the new system of
                        labor, and the new order of agriculture economy rendered necessary by it, we
                        expect to see lime generally employed as the most important and valuable of
                        all fertilizers.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the country becomes settled in its political condition, (which in
                        our judgment the results of the fall elections in the Northern States will
                        rapidly accelerate), there will be a great rush of immigration to the
                        Valley. The inhabitants of the bleak hills of New England will crowd into
                        this fertile and salubrious region to escape the searching east-winds which
                        decimate their country by consumption and kindred diseases; and thousands of
                        the best citizens of the Southern States, disgusted with the thriftless and
                        lawless population turned loose upon them, will gladly seek a refuge in the
                        Valley where very little of that kind of population is to be found.</p>
                    <p>New England manufacturers also -- now that the bug-bear of slavery is removed
                        -- will find it to their interest to leave the inhospitable climate of the
                        North, and establish mills along our water-courses, which furnish a motive
                        power much cheaper than steam.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the results of the great conflict between the two sections
                        will be to build up the middle States at the expense of the extreme North
                        and South. Heretofore, slavery has operated like a wall to exclude Northern
                        enterprise and capital from the Southern States, and its outflow has been
                        westward. That wall has now been broken down, and the wealth and skill of
                        Northern manufacturers will find it more to their advantage to establish
                        factories nearer to the raw material and nearer to consumers. The cotton and
                        wool spinners and weavers of Massachusetts, and the stock and wood growers
                        of Vermont and New Hampshire will find it to their interest to come to
                        Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to carry on their
                        respective occupations, where ice does not obstruct their machinery; where
                        provisions are cheaper; where the lands are better; where consumption is
                        almost as stranger; and where not one half of the fuel is necessary for the
                        comfort of man, and one-third of the provender for the sustenance of stock
                        during the winter. The wool-growers of Vermont have to feed their sheep six
                        months in the year, while in Virginia there are but a few weeks during the
                        winter that they cannot manage to shift for themselves.</p>
                    <p>Other, but not less efficient causes, will induce Southern men to come to the
                        middle States. For some years society must be in a transition state in large
                        slaveholding districts. The suddenly emancipated slaves, without education,
                        mechanical skills, or capital, and with a natural indisposition to work,
                        will not be in a condition to sustain their families. Theft, robbery and all
                        sorts of disorder will prevail until the social fermentation is over, and
                        the scum sloughed off. While this process is going on, the Southern States
                        will not be desirable as places of residence, or for rearing families.</p>
                    <p>Northern and Southern men will soon begin to understand these things, and
                        then the tide of immigration will begin to flow into Virginia and the other
                        Middle States. Lands and mills in the North will decline in value in the
                        presence of active competition springing up in the middle district, and the
                        Southern States will be to the middle what the East and West Indies have
                        been to England -- places to make money in, but not to spend it or to live
                        in.</p>
                    <p>And, if the State of West Virginia, that offspring of civil war and lawless
                        usurpation, is suffered to stand, after the restoration of peace and
                        constitutional rule, (which we hope will not be the case,) we shall probably
                        have a large immigration from that quarter of its best citizens who will be
                        unwilling to bear the yoke of oppression and degradation to which they are
                        now subjected.</p>
                    <p>We shall thus have triple flow of population and wealth into our Valley, and
                        we can accommodate them all. While we should regret to see an influx of
                        narrow-minded, canting, hypocritical radicals into our country, we are
                        prepared to welcome well-behaved, honest and upright men from every quarter.</p>
                    <p>The consequences of this immigration will be the enhancement of our lands,
                        the subdivision of our farms, improvement in our system of tillage,
                        diversification of our pursuits, utilization of our water power, development
                        of our mineral resources, erection of factories of all kinds, and general
                        spread of prosperity and industry.</p>
                    <p>Our people have been somewhat depressed by the want of capital and the
                        suspension of their political rights; but, in the main, they have borne up
                        nobly against the pressure of adverse circumstances. They have displayed
                        wonderful will, energy, and recuperative power. They have obliterated,
                        already, may of the traces of the ravages of war, and, in another year, a
                        stranger, looking at the surface of the country, would never dream that we
                        had, during four dreary years, been trampled down by contending armies,
                        drained of our wealth by heavy exactions, and wasted by fire and sword.</p>
                    <p>We think we can now safely say to our people, "Be of good cheer." A better
                        day is about to dawn upon us. The Philadelphia Convention is but the outward
                        sign of an improved condition of the public sentiment of the country. It is
                        a visible manifestation of the purpose of the people to restore the Union,
                        and to re-establish the Constitution. This purpose has existed for some
                        time, but in a vague and undefined form. The Philadelphia Convention has
                        given it shape and direction, and the popular judgment will, at an early
                        day, accord to it the sanction of law.</p>
                    <p>We will soon be restored to our rights, and prosperity will speedily follow.</p>
                    <p>Let our people, then, be patient. Let them hold on, for a time at least, to
                        their lands, so that they may reap the benefits of the appreciation. Let
                        those who wish to purchase, buy now, while they can. Lands must rise. No man
                        runs any risk by buying land at fair prices now. On the contrary every thing
                        tends to give assurance of a rapid advance in value.</p>
                    <p>We take it, then, that there is a bright future in store for our beautiful
                        Valley.</p>

                <summary>Argues that "a better day is about to dawn upon us," with the Philadelphia
                    Convention indicating that a restoration of political rights and an influx of
                    immigration and capital is imminent. Before the war, the article contends,
                    slavery "operated like a wall to exclude Northern capital from the Southern
                    States," but once the "social fermentation is over" this relationship will

                    <p>The people of the South are reduced to the alternative of choosing between
                        the policy of President Johnson as embodied in the Philadelphia platform,
                        and that of Thaddeus Stevens as exhibited by the last Congress. For, in the
                        language of Baltimore <emph rend="italics">Gazette</emph>, it is manifest
                        that the South has, at present, nothing to expect but the inauguration of
                        the Congressional or the Presidential policy. The one, in defiance of the
                        Constitution and the rights of the people, looks to the disfranchisement of
                        thousands of the whites and the enfranchisement of the blacks in the South,
                        and to the establishment of the blacks in the South, and to the
                        establishment of such Government Bureaux in that section as will enable
                        Northern radicals to rule and represent it. The other contemplates the
                        restoration of the Constitution, the instant recognition of the clear rights
                        of the Southern people, and opens a way that leads clearly and quickly
                        towards order, law and civil liberty. Now, we have changed none of our
                        convictions concerning the cause or the conduct of the war, nor have we
                        altered any of the deliberate opinions we have formed in reference to many
                        individuals, of whom not a few were in the Philadelphia Convention. Nor is
                        it necessary that we, or any other Southern man, should make any retraction
                        or apology before he can consistently and honestly labor for the success of
                        the work which that Convention has inaugurated. We live in a new time and
                        are confronted with new issues, and nothing short of madness could now
                        prevent the South and the Democratic party from doing their uttermost to
                        secure a speedy and overwhelming triumph for the candidates who stand on the
                        Philadelphia platform.</p>
