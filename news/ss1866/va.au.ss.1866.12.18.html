<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In this place there are two schools for colored pupils and one free school
                        for white pupils, conducted by northern teachers -- the former by Mrs. Dunn,
                        Miss Gillespie, Miss Gilmore and Mr. Piper, and the latter by Miss Ellen
                        Levett. Mrs. Dunn and Mr. Piper are from Maine, Miss Gillespie and Miss
                        Levett from New Hampshire, and Miss Gilmore from Massachusetts. Mrs. Dunn
                        has been here ever since the establishment of colored schools in this place.
                        The colored schools contain 360 pupils, in which are embraced both sexes and
                        nearly all ages from 5 to 60 years. The average attendance last month was
                        230. The free school for white pupils contains about 45, the average
                        attendance being 35. The funds for supporting these schools are supplied by
                        a Religious Association in the Northern States, and they are under the
                        supervision of Rev. N. C. Brackett, who has general supervision of all such
                        schools in the Valley from Harper's Ferry to Lexington.--We understand that
                        some of the colored pupils are progressing in their studies remarkably well.
                        The teachers of these schools have given no cause of complaint to our
                        citizens, and have, so far as we are informed, conducted themselves with
                        propriety.</p>
