                        Americans."
                     </a><br> Republicans have been relying on the votes of German immigrants, who are
                     largely opposed to slavery.  But the Spirit argues that the Know-Nothings have taken over
                     the
                     party and have rejected the Germans.  These immigrants are now turning to the
                     Democrats.
