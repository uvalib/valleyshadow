                     will make life convenient, safer from fire, and enhance property value.

                     water works.  "A trifling additional borough tax, for a few years, will
                     meet the expense, which no good citizen will grumble at when he can enjoy
                     the invaluable blessing of an abundance of pure and wholesome water, for
                     drinking, cooking, washing, bathing, cleansing the streets and every other
                     useful and healthy purpose to which water may be applied;  and last, though
                     not least, a sufficiency to protect his property in case of fire.  What are
                     dollars and cents in comparison to the comforts and security derived from
                     an abundant supply of this pure element."
