Claims that "Republicans and Locofocos, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants, all joined in voting the same identical Ticket.... Such unanimity of political sentiment, probably, never has been exhibited in any town of the same population in Pennsylvania."

<p>
<a href="../../news/fr1859/pa.fr.fr.1859.07.27.xml#04">Franklin Repository, July 27, 1859, p. 4, c. 2: "Fiendish Malignity - Mr. McClure."</a><br> Assails the Valley Spirit's "imbecility and malice" in attacking Republican Alexander K. McClure.

<p>
<a href="../../news/fr1859/pa.fr.fr.1859.08.24.xml#05">Franklin Repository, August 24, 1859, p. 5, c. 1: "High Treason!"</a><br> Frederick Douglass "delivered a flaming address to his friends and admirers" in the Chambersburg Public Hall the previous Saturday night. The principle editor of the Valley Spirit, John M. Cooper, sat in the front row -- "evidently as the 'right supporter' of the sable speaker." This compels the Franklin Repository editor to ask, "What expedients will not that party resort to in order to rescue their sinking political ship? . . . Are they now about to don the garb of abolitionism?"
</p>

According to the Spirit, McClure and the Transcript are being hypocrites, since Douglass is a Republican and had his advertisements printed at the Transcript office, and the Transcript's editor called on Douglass.

McClure has split his ticket in the past; The Repository has Jacob Henninger, known to be an honest man, swear that he examined McClure's ticket, just before he handed it in, and the ticket was straight Republican. The Repository is confident that James Crawford will not be insulted that McClure did not vote for him (as the Spirit had claimed).

"Mr. Packer has seen proper to take the reverse of the above positions, and the consequence is that a large number of the so-called Democratic papers of the State are denouncing him for the independent utterance of his views, and the Spirit is as mum as the grave, which is equivalent to an open opposition."

Selling the money-draining canal and railroad system is allowing the state debt to be reduced at the rate of one million dollars a year, and taxes will supposedly be reduced as well. The author then shamelessly plugs Col. A. K. McClure as one of the men responsible for the passage of the bills and deserving of the People's vote.

It denies that Douglas is really the regular nominee of the party, since he never received the required two-thirds of the vote from the National Convention.

In 1856, Douglas said that no power could deprive slave-holders in the territories of their slaves after the Supreme Court stated that slavery was recognized in the territories. However, in the Lincoln-Douglas debate at Freeport he stated that the Territorial Legislature could legally exclude slavery.

The article was a list of over seventy names of Breckinridge supporters--all of them wealthy whites. The Repository wonders where Bill Boyle's name is--that he must not be grand enough.

As a result of Lincoln's victory, "Fifteen states are without a President--they took no part in his election, and refuse their consent to come under an administration founded upon a sentiment hostile to their social system."

While they believe that the South has "just ground for complaint," they don't think that secession "is the best remedy to right her wrongs." They invite the reader to peruse the extracts and "judge for themselves how portentous are the dangers which threaten the Union." The Spirit blames the Republican press for the desire to "plunge the country into civil war."

However, it appears that Virginia will stay in the Union and act as a mediator between the Union and the secessionists. The Spirit hopes that Pennsylvania will act in conjunction with Virginia to settle the key issues.

The crux of the disagreement is that the Democrats "maintain that our government was formed by white men to be controlled by white men for the prosperity and happiness of their race." The Republicans, however, argue that the black man "is entitled to equality with the white man."
