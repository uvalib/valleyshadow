                          South. This gives the impression that Virginians are not united in
                          their devotion to slavery and the South, and thus contributed to the
                          fanaticism of John Brown and to the impression among other

                     </a><br> A vessel named the 
                     Wanderer was
                     captured while landing a cargo of slaves in Georgia and South Carolina.
                     Many planters support the reopening of the slave trade because they
                     believe that there is a need for more slave labor in the South and in the
                     new western territories.  According to the Vindicator, "The most 
                     potent argument in its favor is, that we need negro labor."

                     slavery in the South but denounce the slave trade.  The Vindicator
                     believes that the Christianization of Africans is the best thing for them. 
                     According to the paper, "...the change in the sentiment of the people has
                     been so sure and speedy, that now, the world, with the exception of a few
                     fanatics, has come to look upon the institution with leniency, and the
                     people of the Southern States with affection and reverence."

                     Virginia should oppose the reopening of the trade, especially since it
                     would greatly lessen the value of the slaves already owned by
                     Virginians.

                     the North and probably anti-slavery.

                     argues that a slaveholder is the "best friend of the negro," because
                     slaveowners and slaves are bound by "ties of genuine friendship and

                          that slavery is prohibited in New York. Mrs. Lemmon sued, arguing
                          that she was entitled to her privileges and immunities as a citizen of
                          Virginia even in other states. The New York court of appeals
                          decided against Mrs. Lemmon and maintained that her slaves were

                     address.  The author understands that it is Lincoln's sworn duty to uphold
                     the laws of the country, but he regrets that Lincoln did not call for a
                     national convention in order to provide a legal outlet for the seceded
                     states to relieve the president of his duty and thus avert war.  The
                     article indicates uncertainty over whether the president intends to
                     enforce the laws up to the point of force or if he intends to precipitate
                     armed conflict.

                     </a><br> Reports that the Virginia Legislature
                     has called for the election of a convention to respond to the secession
                     crisis in South Carolina.  This state convention will debate the possible
                     secession of Virginia.  The Spectator calls for the citizens to
                     vote for pro-union representatives because "men tainted with the
                     principles of secession would not represent the sentiment of our

                     Spectator for its "very silly and indelicate article under the

                     call for troops and peace has failed, the article indicates that it has
                     become appropriate for Virginians to abandon their quest for peace and
                     fight for the Commonwealth.

                     Union men for the current state of war because they resisted immediate
                     secession.  The article says that by attempting to compromise, Union men
                     forced Lincoln to develop a policy that united all Virginians in
                     opposition.  If secession had occurred before compromise efforts were
                     exhausted, there would have been parties in Virginia discontented with
                     such an action.
