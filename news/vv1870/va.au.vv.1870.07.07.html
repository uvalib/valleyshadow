<b>The Homestead Act</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an act passed by the Virginia legislature exempting up to

<b>The Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article repeats the sentiment expressed in many previous articles
                    concerning the benefits to be had by the construction of the Valley Railroad.
                    The most important, according to this latest piece, is the elimination of rail
                    monopoly. If a new road is constructed, says the author, other lines will have
                    to lower their fares for both travel and freight, thus benefiting the commuter
                    as well as the producer. Also, in answer to those who say the road will be
                    constructed whether or not money from the county is subscribed, the author
                    suggests the irresponsibility of this line of thought. Any person who stands to
                    benefit from the improvement should likewise be a contributing factor in its
                    construction.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the urgent request of many friends and subscribers we republish the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>In our last paper we endeavored to show to our readers some of the more
                        prominent benefits that would accrue to the people of Augusta, from the
                        large expenditures of money which must necessarily be made, in the county,
                        during the progress of the work of construction of the Valley Railroad. We
                        think it fair to estimate, that the amount which will be expended, in the
                        building of the road, though our county, from the Rockingham, to the
                        Rockbridge line, will be, about one million three hundred and sixty thousand
                        dollars (1,360,000). We arrived at this result by estimating the distance at
                        34 miles, and the cost (including bridges) at $40,000 per mile. These
                        estimates, we believe, will be found to be very nearly, if not exactly,
                        correct.</p>
                    <p>We then attempted to show, the very great advantages to our people, which
                        would flow form the expenditure of so large a sum of money among them.</p>
                    <p>But, great as these benefits will unquestionably, be, they are as nothing,
                        when compared with those, which will follow the completion of the road.</p>
                    <p>The contemplation of these beneficial results would open an almost
                        illimitable field. We do not propose to attempt a full discussion of the
                        subject, in all its aspects. It is too extensive for a newspaper article.
                        All that we shall attempt is, to call attention to a few of the more
                        prominent advantages which our people will secure, by subscribing to the
                        road and thereby ensuring its completion.</p>
                    <p>It may be said of Rail-roading as of every other branch of business, that
                        "competition is the life of trade."</p>
                    <p>The people of Augusta are now the victims of an oppressive monopoly. The
                        Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad affords to them, their only outlet to
                        market. That company has the power (within certain limits) to fix its own
                        rates of charges. It is a gigantic power, and the company uses it like a
                        giant. Its charges are exceedingly onerous--and, when compared with the
                        rates on northern railroads, extravagant--upon many articles they are
                        prohibitory, and in others, they are on the verge of prohibition. People are
                        obliged to submit to these exactions, because they cannot help themselves.
                        Corporations are proverbially without souls,--and we might add, without
                        hearts! They look to their own interests, exclusively. The public advantage
                        is never thought of, except when it may be coincident with corporate
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>We have been informed that on northern Railroads, the passenger fees,
                        averages about two cents per mile--on the C &amp; O R.R., it is five
                        cents per mile, or two and a half times as much! We are not prepared to
                        speak with certainty, as to the relation which their charges on freights,
                        bear to the charges on northern Roads. But we presume they are from 25 to 50
                        per cent higher than the northern charges. We know that on such articles as
                        corn, hay and potatoes, the charges are almost prohibitory, except when
                        those articles are commanding very high prices in the Richmond markets.</p>
                    <p>The present charge for a passenger from Staunton to Richmond is $6.80, when
                        according to northern rates, it would be $2.72. The difference is a tax of
                        $1.08, which is exacted from the necessities of the passenger! Every one,
                        therefore, who makes a trip from Staunton to Richmond and back, pays, over
                        and above a fair charge, according to northern rates, $8.16! This is a
                        pretty heavy tax to be exacted from every citizen, for each and every trip
                        that he is obliged to make to the Capital of his State!</p>
                    <p>Now, what is the remedy for this oppression? Shall we remonstrate? Shall we
                        appeal to the justice--and magnanimity--and generosity of this great
                        corporation? Such an appeal would only provoke ridicule! We would get "our
                        labor for our pains!"</p>
                    <p> The only remedy of our grievances, is, to create
                            competition. If railroads look to their interests let us look to ours! Let
                        us while it is in our power, aid in building up a rival road, to compete for
                        passengers and freights. Competition--not a sense of right or justice--among
                        northern railroads has brought fares and freights down, to the low figures
                        we have mentioned, in the Northern States--and
                            competition will bring it down here! It is the only remedy.
                        Interest is the moving principle of Railroads. If we have two roads, each
                        will want to command the trade and travel. They will bid against each other
                        for patronage. As soon as the Valley road is finished, the Chesapeake road
                        will have to reduce its charges, or the trade and travel will go to
                        Baltimore. Richmond and Baltimore will thus be competitors for our trade.
                        The two roads will be competitors for transportation. The Chesapeake
                        &amp; Ohio will reduce its charges say one dollar. The Valley road will
                        put its charge a little lower. This will compel the Chesapeake road to make
                        a further reduction, and thus it will go on, until charges for passengers
                        and freights are reduced to something like the northern standard. </p>
                    <p>Let our farmers consider what would be the effect of those reductions on
                        their interests? The saving in freights, in a single year, would much more
                        than pay their taxes. But this is not all--when the freights are brought
                        down to a fair rate, many commodities which cannot be marketed at all, will
                        become important articles of export. The saving on a single car load of
                        cattle, or flour, or hay, or corn, will pay the whole additional annual tax
                        which a farmer with a farm valued at $10,000, would have to pay! The
                        railroad tax on such a tract of land, would be $6 per year. This is
                        ascertained by estimating his whole annual tax (at the present rate of 30
                        cents on $100) at $30. The railroad tax would add to the tax, one-fifth, or
                        20 per cent, which gives the result $6.00, as the railroad tax.</p>
                    <p>Is any one so blind as not to see, how immensely his interests would be
                        promoted by such a reduction of fares and freights? Can any one fail to
                        perceive that the construction of the Valley Road, would be of incalculable
                        advantage to the agricultural interests of the county?</p>
                    <p>But we must not overlook other great interests, which would be developed by
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Every one knows, that our mountains on the Eastern and Western borders of the
                        county, are filled with our ore, of the best quality, and in inexhaustible
                        quantity. The only obstacle to the development of these mineral deposits,
                        is, the want of convenient access to market. Give us the Valley R.R. and
                        this difficulty will be removed. Forges and Furnaces, will, at an early day,
                        be called in to existence, and the sterile mountain-spurs, that are now
                        valueless, will become sources of great wealth. A large portion of the
                        agricultural productions, will be consumed by the hands, employed in these
                        mines, and at these iron-works.</p>
                    <p> We have heard some narrow-minded persons say "why should we subscribe to
                        this road, when we feel satisfied the road will be made without our aid?"
                        This is certainly a very liberal suggestion. It proceeds on the idea that we
                        shall profit by the outlay of others, without bearing our just share of the
                            burthen--that we shall reap where other people have
                            sown!</p>
                    <p>We can hardly reconcile this idea with our notions of common honesty. We
                        would almost as soon think of waiting until our neighbor had ploughed his
                        land, and sown his seed, without our help, and then at harvest, expect to
                        come in, and reap a share of the crop!</p>
                    <p>This idea does not exactly comport with the old fashioned notions of justice
                        and fair dealing, that have always prevailed among the people of Augusta.</p>
                    <p> But is it true, that the road will be made without our help? We think we are
                        by no means warranted in assuming such to be the fact. Baltimore city, the
                        Balt. &amp; O.R.R. Co., and all the counties along the line, have come
                        forward with liberality, and subscribed their shares.--They have done all
                        they are able to do.--Two millions nine hundred dollars,
                            now hang on the subscription of Augusta. If we subscribe
                        $300,000, we are certain to have $2,900,000 expended among us. If we refuse
                        to subscribe, it may be, that the whole enterprise will fail. Our neighbors
                        will be disgusted with the illiberality of Augusta, and let the matter fall
                        to the ground. Let us then be on the sure side. Let us not hesitate to make
                        the subscription, which is necessary to render the conditional appropriation
                        of nearly three millions, absolute. </p>
                    <p>Some persons will say, "the R.R. will not come nearer to us, than it now
                        does; how will it benefit us? Even if the R.R. is made, we will have to haul
                        our produce to Staunton, to market. How then will it help us?"</p>
                    <p>Conceding the facts to be as stated, we emphatically deny the conclusion
                        drawn from them.</p>
                    <p>Suppose the R.R. is no nearer to you than it is now; suppose you will still
                        have to haul your produce to market at Staunton--do you not perceive that by
                        building up Staunton and increasing the number of buyers, and by reducing
                        the cost of transportation from Staunton to Richmond or Baltimore, that the
                        Staunton merchants can afford to pay your farms?--The reduction in freights
                        will result more beneficially to the farmer, than to the merchant.</p>
                    <p>If you now take your flour to Staunton to sell, the merchant looks at
                        Richmond and Baltimore prices, and deducts from them, 1st cost of freight,
                        say 60 cents, 2, cost of marketing--3rd his profit.</p>
                    <p>Suppose you reduce the freight one half, is it not plain that the merchant
                        can afford to pay you a higher price than he now does, by at least the
                        amount of the reduction in freight?</p>
                    <p>But suppose again, you build the road and cause manufactories, &amp;., to
                        spring up at Staunton and the town to grow so large as to consume all you
                        can produce--is it not plain that you can require prices, very nearly equal
                        to Richmond prices, to be paid to you for all you raise?</p>
                    <p>Add 5000 to the population of Staunton--(which would very probably be the
                        case if the Valley Railroad is made), and, who can fail to see what a market
                        it would afford for the products of our farmers?</p>
                    <p>Old Augusta now has a proud name,--a name won by her wisdom in council--her
                        valor on the battlefield--her patriotism in every emergency--her enlarged
                        and liberal policy on every matter affecting the public welfare. Let us not,
                        now, by a miserable, sordid, contracted--illiberal--unjust course to her
                        sister counties tarnish her fair escutcheon! Let us do as we have hitherto
                        done. Let us act with wisdom, and fairness, having a just regard to our own
                        interests, but never losing sight of our obligations to others. Let us scorn
                        the meanness of shirking our duty. Let us bear our share of the burthen if
                        we propose to enjoy our share of the benefits of this great work.</p>

<b>Freedom of Opinion</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article applauds the nature of American institutions

                        romance, in obedience to the various whims that govern our moral nature, may
                        be maintained with perfect impunity. These are some of the grand
                        characteristics that distinguish us from every other civilized power, and as
                        long as our personal liberty endures, the utmost of our abilities will be
                        exerted to maintain the principle upon which they are based.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the sanctuary of the conscience and the right of private judgment
                        cannot be invaded, yet there are certain limits to their exercise which
                        every one ought scrupulously to observe. In casting the mind's eye for a
                        moment over the condition of society in this country at the present time, it
                        will readily be observed that a large portion of our people are perfectly at
                        sea as to what they shall or shall not believe in regard to the many new
                        creeds and systems which, like mushrooms, are springing up all around them,
                        and each of which has its adherents and devoted advocates. The existence of
                        an admitted right does not always justify its unlimited exercise, and hence
                        to all reflecting minds, in this enlightened age, the licentious indulgence
                        of this boasted liberty is becoming truly appalling. We have no objection to
                        the advocate of monarchy, agrarianism, socialism, or negroism propagating
                        their pernicious and mischievous principles and dogmas, but at the same time
                        we do earnestly and persistently object to the devotees of these dangerous
                        isms basking in the sunshine of popular favor.</p>
