<b>The 'Good Time Coming' Near at Hand</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article both rejoices in the many victories across the country in the
                    last election, as well as predicts even more success in the future.
                    Conservatives have gained a great deal of ground since Radicals held the
                    majority in most states two years prior. The author suggests many former
                    Radicals abandoned the party and predicts that this trend will continue. Within
                    two years, he says, the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania will be securely in the
                    conservative column, and within time, a conservative will be elected president.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> On last Tuesday week, the sovereign people of eighteen States of the
                        American Union evinced by their votes that they are the rulers of America,
                        and not the Congress of the United States--not the individual members of
                        that body, as was and is impudently asserted by strutting members of
                        Congress on the floors of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The
                            people on that memorial day sounded the
                        death-knell of Radicalism--of thieving and corruption in high places. All
                        the lies of Forney and false hopes held out by Greely to the "sick men" to
                        live, will not save him from his inevitable doom, or breathe a spark of
                        vitality into his flagging pulse. His end approaches, and all the
                        prescriptions of Radical doctors to save him from an ignominious death is
                        but a useless waste of bad medicine. </p>
                    <p>We do not claim to be gifted with prescience, but the writer of this
                        predicted two years ago that the Radical party were on, the straight shoot
                        to the devil, as a party, and it does look as if--in fulfillment of the
                        prophecy--the Radicals had reached the half way house on the road to "Davy
                        Jones' locker."--By the next two years they will have reached their journeys
                        end, according to the double rule of three in political arithmetic. In the
                        present Congress there are fifty-two democratic or conservatives and 170
                        Radicals. By the 4th of March next there will be--as decreed by the recent
                        election--108 democrats and conservatives, and 123 Radical corruptionists.
                        Now, if the democrats gained one hundred percent in two years, is it not
                        fair and reasonable to suppose that they will gain the ascendancy by the end
                        of the next two years and thus seat a democrat in the presidential chair in
                        Washington, which is disgraced by a nincompoop and political knave.</p>
                    <p>The political earthquake out in gallant, grand Missouri, give every
                        indication that "the skies are bright and brightening!" --Things were "done
                        up brown" in that State by Gratz Brown rolling up 40,000 for the democrats!
                        There was an overwhelming majority in favor of the Rads two years ago; but
                        the sensible ones left the sinking ship, got converted, came out form the
                        thieving party and were born anew. We only cite Missouri as an instance of
                        what has been done in other States and what is possible to be done in the
                        next two years. We feel assured that everything will work right the next two
                        years. It only remains for the invincible democracy to carry the States of
                        Ohio and Pennsylvania--with those they have already carried out and will
                        carry again--to insure a majority in the next electoral college! A long
                        stroke and a bold stroke for right and liberty, is bound to win Ohio and
                        Pennsylvania. Let not the democrats and conservatives idly fold their hands
                        as if the field was won, but let them, work with might and main, until the
                        sun goes down on the 4th of March, 1872, and then we will see the morning of
                        the "Day of Jubilee," throughout the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Between the hours of six and seven o'clock, last Saturday evening, one of the
                        most brutal and cold blooded murders that has ever come within our knowledge
                        was committed in this city. It appears that Joseph M. Black, of Keezletown,
                        Rockingham county, and George W. Smiley of Mt. Crawford, Augusta county,
                        were in the employ of Wm. Jordan as bricklayers. They not only worked
                        together but boarded at the same house (Mr. John W. Bush's) in this place,
                        and appear to have been very good friends. On the evening of the homicide
                        they ate supper together, and if there were previously any ill feeling
                        between them it was only known to themselves.</p>
                    <p>After supper Black went into the front room and remarked to one of the
                        females of the house that he believed Smiley was mad with him (B) about
                        something. Subsequently Smiley left the house, and in a few minutes returned
                        again, entering at the front door. He then went to a bureau in the front
                        room, took a carving knife there from, and proceeded at once to the dining
                        room, where Black was engaged in conversation with Mrs. Bash, and ordered
                        him out of the house, and at the same time commenced an attack upon him with
                        the knife. When Smiley told Black to get out of the house, Black said "let
                        me out, then." And, at the same time commenced retreating backwards through
                        an intervening room into the front room, where Black picked up a chair and
                        threw it at Smiley. Smiley retreated from the house by the front door, and
                        Black ran out of the back door, fell a few steps from the house, and died in
                        a few minutes. In the rencountre Black received a severe cut extending from
                        the corner of his eye through the temple artery: another deep stab just
                        above the left hip bone, another a few inches above and to the left of the
                        last, a slight cut just below the navel, and a severe cut on the right hand,
                        in all, seven stabs with the huge carving knife.</p>
                    <p>His Honor, Mayor Trout held an inquest over the body of Black at 8 P.M., the
                        jury consisting of the following well known gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>Messrs. John B. Scherer, S.H. Lushbaugh, F.M. Young, Joseph F. Tannehill,
                        M.P. Funkhauser, G.G. Bunch, Geo. A. Smith, Y.M. Bickle, H. Ker, Wm. L.
                        Balthis, Jno. B. Hoge and M. Doom. Upon an examination of the wounds by Dr.
                        Hanger, and the hearing of the evidence in the case, the jury rendered a
                        verdict in accordance with the facts stated.</p>
                    <p>After committing the atrocious murder Smiley took out for parts unknown, and
                        is still at large. Mayor Trout has offered a reward of $100 for his arrest,
                        and upon the return of Gov. Walker from New York, he will also, no doubt,
                        offer a State reward for the capture of Smiley.</p>
