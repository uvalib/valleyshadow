<b>Negro Emigration in the South</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article chronicles the movement of black labor from Virginia and other
                    "border" states to the Deep South and Southwest. The author reminds his readers
                    that in the past Virginia has supplied regions farther south with labor
                    "suitable" for their climate. He hopes, for the sake of white labor, that blacks
                    will continue to migrate.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The demand for negro labor in the far South is said to be increasing in
                        Virginia. High wages and great inducements are offered both upon the
                        plantations and railroads. Virginia used to supply the Southern planting
                        States with a good deal of labor, and the same process bids fair to be
                        carried on hereafter on a more extended scale. It is not impossible that the
                        mass of the colored race in all the border States will ultimately tend to
                        the extreme South and Southwest, where their peculiar labor suits the
                        cultivation, and the climate and surroundings are more agreeable to them
                        than more vigorous latitudes. It is the destiny of Virginia to fall into the
                        hands of white labor. - Statesman.</p>
