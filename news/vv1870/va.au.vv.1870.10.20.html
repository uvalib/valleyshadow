<b>Virginia's Troubles</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article reassures his readers who are currently
                    overwhelmed by the difficulties facing Virginia. He points to other historical
                    events to prove that Virginians have always overcome troubles--periods of war or
                    oppression have always been followed by periods of prosperity.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>When Virginia was first settled her people were subjected to the severest
                        trials of war, pestilence and famine. When those earlier troubles were over
                        past, a period of prosperity and happiness followed. Immigrants poured into
                        her borders, and she became the leading colony in these Western settlements
                        in the wealth, intelligence and heroism of her people. Then came other
                        sorrows of floods, political and religious repression and wasting wars. This
                        was followed by a development of prosperity--civil, religious and
                        material--far eclipsing all her former glory. Her sons were the framers of
                        bills for civil and religious liberty--Constitutions and wise and just
                        laws--leaders of armies, Governors of States and Presidents of the Republic.
                        From that beginning of the late war ever and anon some great calamity has
                        befallen her. The war came, and for four years her soil was drenched with
                        blood; her fields and towns were desolated and sacked, and finally, torn and
                        bleeding at every pore, she fell, crushed beneath the weight of overwhelming
                        odds, her means destroyed, her labor gone, her social system overturned and
                        the iron heel grinding her in the earth. Bravely, earnestly, quietly she
                        adapted herself to the new order of things and manfully she struggled to
                        meet the crisis. Then followed the memorable disaster to her Capitol, by
                        which so many lives were lost, which was succeeded by withering droughts,
                        destructive floods, and, last of all, the fall of her noblest, bravest,
                        purest and most beloved son. Oh! what a catalogue of sorrows--what a volume
                        of calamities!</p>
                    <p> Great calamities call out all the higher and nobler feelings of our nature;
                        crush self in sympathy with the general misfortunes, bind in a great
                        brotherhood a whole people; develop kindness, love, generosity, hospitality
                        and a loftiness of mind and magnanimity of soul which result in the
                        production of noble women and great men--prepared for every crisis and all
                        emergencies. They have made Virginians a peculiar people in other
                        days--peculiar people they will preserve them in times to come--Richmond Whig</p>

                    <p>The citizens of Staunton having learned that the family of the late Gen. R.E.
                        Lee have expressed a desire that his mortal remains shall, for the present,

                        funeral obsequies will take place on Saturday, 15th inst., at 12 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>And the citizens of Staunton feeling a strong desire to testify in some
                        public manner, their profound love and veneration for the memory and
                        character of this illustrious man, who has shed so much honor, not only in
                        his native State but upon human nature.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore resolved that a delegation, on behalf of the citizens of
                        Staunton, be appointed to visit Lexington and unite in the ceremonies
                        intended to mark the deep sense of the great calamity that has befallen
                        Virginia, in the death of him, who next to Washington, enjoyed in the
                        largest measure the affection and gratitude of his fellow citizens.</p>
                    <p>Col. B. Christian seconded the resolutions and briefly explained to the
                        meeting the resolutions of the General Assembly of Virginia which had been
