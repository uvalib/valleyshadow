<b>Things That Ought Not To Be</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article suggests that Augusta farmers have concentrated their efforts
                    on too few crops and focused their energies on the highest prices. This, the
                    author says, is a mistake. First, farmers should diversify. They should
                    concentrate on crops such as beans and hops in case staple crops such as corn
                    should fail. Further, products should be sold locally, even if this means the
                    lowering of market value. Otherwise, products sold in Richmond and elsewhere
                    will only wind up being imported at a higher price.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We live in one of the finest agricultural regions in the U.S. We have fertile
                        soil, varying in quality in different sections, and adapted to every kind of
                        grain, grass, fruit and vegetable. We have a delightful climate, and culture
                        is seldom interrupted by excessive cold in winter, or drought and heat in
                        summer. We have also an active, industrious population. One would suppose
                        that with such a soil and climate, and people, every thing would be produced
                        that is necessary for the comfort of man.</p>
                    <p>But such is not the fact. There is bad management somehow. Our people do not
                        make the most of their God-given advantages.</p>
                    <p>In passing along our streets, it is mortifying to find, at almost every
                        grocery store, large numbers of barrels of potatoes, apples, butter and even
                        CABBAGES, bought in the North, and brought here to supply our home market.
                        Some of these vegetables are brought from New Jersey and New York, and the
                        potatoes from the bleak regions of Maine.</p>
                    <p>We maintain that this is a reproach to our people. It shows that they lack
                        either industry, or good judgment. Where is there a country better adapted
                        to raising potatoes then Augusta? Where is there a country that ought to
                        produce more butter or of better quality? As for apples, we have heard that
                        skillful fruit raiser, Mr. Franklin Davis, say, that he had tried every part
                        of the country from New Jersey to South Carolina, and that there was no
                        portion of it so well adapted to the best varieties of apples, as the Valley
                        and Piedmont regions of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>And cabbages! Think of bringing cabbages from New York to a "kraut" county
                        like Augusta!</p>
                    <p>Why should not our people raise their potatoes, apples, butter, and cabbages?
                        We have hill sides for favorable weather, and rich alluvial bottoms for dry
                        seasons. Why should our country be drained of money to pay for articles that
                        ought to be produced at home? No people can ever prosper who buy more than
                        they sell. The true policy is, to produce every thing we need, and to make a
                        little more than we need, so as to have some to sell. Then the balance of
                        trade will be in our favor, money will begin to accumulate in the hands of
                        the people--and we will not hear so much of hard times.</p>
                    <p>The enquiry presents itself--why does this condition of things exist? We
                        answer unhesitatingly, it is because our country people do not sufficiently
                        diversify their productions. They are content to follow along in the old
                        ruts made by the vehicles of their fathers. Because their fathers raised
                        wheat and corn exclusively they think they must do the same. Hence it is
                        wheat and corn all the time.--And if the wheat or the corn crop fails, they
                        are reduced to great distress. Our people overlook small crops too much. It
                        would seem as if they thought it beneath their dignity to raise beans, peas,
                        potatoes, cabbage, strawberries, raspberries, and many other small
                        commodities for market. This is a great mistake. There is more profit in
                        these small articles than in large ones. The last Report of the Commissioner
                        of Agriculture, tells us of a man near Petersburg Va., who raised $1700
                        worth of hops from a single acre. Which of our farmers last year made $1700
                        from 100 acres of corn or wheat?--We have heard of thousands of dollars per
                        acre, being made by cultivating straw-berries and dwarf pears. In the palmy
                        days of Rome, three acres was regarded as an ample farm for one man.</p>
                    <p>Our people must change their system of cultivation. They must work less land
                        and work it better. They must vary their crops. They must get down off their
                        stilts. They must not despise small things. "Many a mickle makes a muckle"
                        is a good old Scotch proverb. We must cultivate those things that pay, and
                        we must diversify our productions so that if one misses another may hit.</p>
                    <p>We fear our country people fall into another error. They are sometimes too
                        grasping. They often ask too much for their commodities. The true policy is
                        always to sell when you can get a fair paying price. Those who will hold out
                        for the "top" of the market, are very apt to be disappointed. They may hit
                        occasionally, but they will oftener miss.--During this year $50,000 to
                        $75,000 have been lost to our county by too greedy a spirit in the people.
                        They could have sold their flour last fall at $7 to $7.50, but they held on
                        for higher prices and now have to take $5.--Thus they have lost $2 to $2.50
                        per barrel for say 50,000 barrels of flour, besides the interest on the
                        proceeds, making as aggregate of probably $100,000 on one single article.
                        This amount would, by passing from hand to hand, have paid off nearly the
                        whole indebtedness of the county. So it is with butter, apples, &amp;c.
                        Farmers bring these articles to town--refuse to take a fair price here--send
                        them to Richmond, and after months delay, get less than they were offered.
                        We have actually heard of butter being sent to Richmond and sold--which was
                        afterwards brought back to Staunton and sold here.</p>
                    <p>The truth is the farmers will find the Staunton market generally as good as
                        the Richmond after they deduct freight and costs.</p>
                    <p>In old times when Staunton was a village of 1400 inhabitants it furnished a
                        small market. Our fathers found it so, and sent their produce to Richmond.
                        Now we thoughtlessly do the same thing although the condition of things has
                        entirely changed. Instead of 1400 people, it now has over 5000--(at least
                        the Legislature says it has!) and it now furnishes a market which, take the
                        year through, is as good as that of Richmond. It is to the interest of our
                        people to keep up and stimulate this home market. Even if they lost a few
                        cents a barrel on flour &amp;c, by selling here, they would be
                        compensated by having a good market kept up always for other things that
                        will not bear transportation. "Live and let live" is a good maxim. Let every
                        body be satisfied with a good price without seeking to extort the uttermost
                        farthing. It is best in the long run. Liberality begets liberality. If we
                        show a desire to trade, on fair terms, with others they will be willing to
                        meet us in the same spirit.</p>
                    <p>Now is the time for setting out all kinds of crops. We earnestly entreat our
                        farmers to make simple preparations for crops of potatoes, beans, cabbages,
                        &amp;c., and let us in the future, make these articles of export,
                        instead of import.</p>
