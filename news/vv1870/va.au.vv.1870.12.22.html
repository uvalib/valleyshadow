<b>Amnesty</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article discusses the many shortcomings of General Butler's proposed
                    "general" amnesty bill. According to the author, Butler's attempt to bind
                    sectional wounds can only be viewed as an empty gesture when considered against
                    the many exceptions in the bill. He says that real sectional healing can only
                    come about when more Republicans act in accordance with Governor Walker. Walker,
                    who supported the Union cause, nevertheless has shown a great deal of wisdom as
                    Virginia's executive. Any policy that does not provide for universal amnesty is
                    only "giving occasion for recrimination."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 6th inst., the subject of amnesty was under consideration in the House
                        of Representatives. Gen. Butler's bill for a full and general grace and
                        amnesty, and abolition of all wrongful acts, doings, or omissions of persons
                        engaged in the war of the late rebellion provides the full wing exceptions:
                        Persons educated at West Point or Annapolis, members of either House of the
                        Federal or Confederate Congress, heads of Federal executive departments,
                        judges of Federal or Confederate Courts, members of the Conventions who
                        voted for or signed ordinances of secession, Governors of States that were
                        in rebellion, Confederates who were arrested cruelly or otherwise than
                        according to the usages of war Federal prisoners, persons entrusted with
                        funds which they have not accounted for, all deserters and bounty-jumpers.</p>
                    <p>The property exceptions are:--All property wherein the United States or third
                        parties have become vested by sale, forfeiture, or confiscation, and lands
                        used now or heretofore for federal cemeteries. Every right of action and
                        liability arising under any law, ordinance, or contest in aid of rebellion,
                        shall be deemed invalid.</p>
                    <p>This is the "olive branch" which Gen Butler holds out to the people of the
                        South!--If devilish malice could have devised a more glaring outrage, we
                        suppose Butler would have gotten it up. His bill not only excepts some of
                        the best men in the South--men of representative character, who, were any of
                        them in the councils of the nation, could impart true information as to the
                        feelings and sentiments of their constituents, but would be instructive
                        legislatures on all questions of public interest. They are no more guilty of
                        "rebellion" than many of the humblest privates who followed the lead of Lee
                        and Jackson; and many of them not near so capable of leading the popular
                        will, for some of the most intellectual and influential men in the South
                        were among the privates and subordinate officers.</p>
                    <p>Were General Butler really desirous of healing up the wounds of the war--of
                        uniting the people of two sections in a common national brotherhood--let him
                        cease his virulent, his malicious hate towards all classes of the South, and
                        devote his splendid intellectual and party influence to assisting the people
                        of the South in their efforts to develop their material resources. Let him,
                        as a test of his sincerity for harmony and good will, of fraternal regard,
                        and his wish to see the country moving forward, as one people to the
                        fulfillment of its grand destiny, commence with Virginia, and aid in
                        securing an appropriation for the completion of our great waterline--the
                        James River and Ohio Canal--and the improvement of the James River. Let him
                        put his foot down upon the land-grabbing system which is squandering
                        millions of acres of our most prolific public lands, to enrich corporations,
                        and place it in their power to tyrannize over the rightful owners of the
                        public domain--the people. Let him and his party, cease their mistrust of
                        the people of the South--leave them free and send their best men to the
                        national legislature--to choose such men as the people want, whether they
                        agree with his party associations or not--allow them to be self governing
                        communities--to regulate their own domestic concerns as they may list, as do
                        the people of Massachusetts--recognize them, in short, as men of honor, who
                        respect their wards and their allegiance oaths, as constituents of a common
                        government--the guardians of a common national faith--the bulwark of a
                        common liberty--the resource of a common defense--and the contributors to a
                        common national treasury, for the support and operation of the ramified
                        interests of our common country--and he will then see the acerbities growing
                        out of the war--which should have ceased to exist on either side long
                        ago--give way before the melting influence of gentle peace--the occasion for
                        his invidious exceptions buried--and all the great resources of the country
                        utilized and her interests observed!--If Democrats or Conservatives triumph
                        over Republicans--if the people will the supremacy of the former over the
                        latter, in any community, let it be so. Bayonets and persecution cannot
                        control the "chainless mind." They cannot reverse the honest convictions of
                        any man, and where they control them, that individual is fit for "treason,
                        stratagem and spoils"--a desirable associate for no one, and no honest man
                        would seek a coalition with him.</p>
                    <p>As an offset to the suspicions and mistrust contained in Gen. Butler's bill,
                        we quote the patriotic, truthful and manly utterances of a Northern man--a
                        supporter of and sympathizer with the "Union cause," during the late
                        war--and that man now the Governor of as proud, and brave, and true people
                        as ever the sun shone upon--the people of this grand old Commonwealth of
                        Virginia--elevated to the present exalted position by the unpurchased and
                        unpurchasable suffrages of the intelligence the wealth and the worth of the
                        State--Gilbert C. Walker--who, in his annual message to the legislature, now
                        in session, uses the following language:</p>
                    <p> "Our people everywhere are adapting themselves to the changed condition of
                        affairs with all promptitude, a wisdom and moderation worthy of all praise.
                        In obedience to law, in the maintenance of order, and the performance of all
                        the duties appertaining to good citizenship, the people of Virginia
                        challenge comparison with any State in the Union. Everywhere within the
                        broad limits of the commonwealth every citizen is safe and secure in his
                        "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Emerging from the terrible
                        ordeal of a four year's baptism of blood, stript of everything
                        save incorruptibility, the people of this commonwealth have again resumed
                        their place in the Union of their fathers with an earnest purpose and 
                        determination to fulfill all the obligations of American citizens. More
                        cannot be required of them--less they will not perform." </p>
                    <p>We will not dwell upon the property exceptions of Gen. Butler's bill. It is,
                        however, an outrageous proposition to invade the Courts of justice--to
                        decide questions legitimately belonging to the tribunals of justice, and
                        totally and entirely foreign to the purview of any amnesty bill that could
                        be devised. Let Gen. Butler silence his "bill of abominations," and give a
                        cordial and active support to Mr. Farnsworth's proposition, for general
                        amnesty, clear and entire. Mr. F. is a Republican, but a man of
                        comprehensive views, who can rise above the behests of mere party, and
                        address himself to the great interests of the country. Let such a bill be
                        passed, and the happy result of a returning feeling of national fraternity
                        will immediately develop itself. Any other policy is merely adding fuel to
                        the flame,--kindling up embers almost smothered out--and giving occasion for
                        continued crimination and recrimination.</p>

<b>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article briefly analyzes the position of Native Americans in regard to
                    the 14th amendment. Since they are not designated citizens, but rather
                    independent nations, the amendment does not apply. The author says this is a
                    "nice dodge" for the government--a policy that provides for both killing as well
                    as land grabbing "upon the merest pretense."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee have made a report, explaining the
                        meaning of the 14th amendment, as regards Indians. The report assumes that
                        they are not "citizens"--but on the contrary, have always been treated as
                        separate and distinct "nations," and not subject to the municipal
                        jurisdiction of the United States. This is a nice dodge. We should like to
                        know what international law has been observed in our intercourse with them?
                        They are butchered upon the merest pretense, their lands and hunting grounds
                        grabbed up, and if they manifest any spirit in defense of their homes--what
                        to them is home at least--it is regarded as a declaration of hostilities on
                        their part, and the "dogs of war are let loose" upon them. Very convenient
                        "nations," to do precisely what the United States tells them to do, else it
                        is a caucus bill.</p>
