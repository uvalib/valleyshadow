<b>Worthy of Attention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article attacks those who waste time. In this new age, the author
                    suggests, time is money. Southerners should behave more like their northern
                    counterparts and not let time slip away through idleness. "We must neither waste
                    our own," he say, "nor rob other people of theirs." Idleness is merely an old
                    habit that must be broken, especially now that slavery is dead and there is no
                    one to do the work.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are some important lessons which the Southern people have yet to
                        learn--Among these, one of the most necessary, is, a proper appreciation of
                        the value of time. While every body is ready to admit the truth of the
                        abstract proportion that "time" is the most valuable of all God's gift's to
                        man, very few act as if they thought so. Most people seem to regard time as
                        a thing to be gotten rid of, rather than a "talent" to be improved.</p>
                    <p>In this respect there is the important difference between the people of the
                        north and those of the south. In the north people seem to realize the fact
                        that "time is money," while in the south it is a burden that is laid on
                        men's shoulders. We presume the difference results mainly from the different
                        labor systems which have prevailed in the two sections.</p>
                    <p>In the north, people had to work for themselves, while in the south, they had
                        others to work for them. Northern people therefore studied how they could
                        accomplish most in the least possible time, and with the least possible
                        expenditure of effort; while the people of the south employed their efforts
                        as to how they could amuse themselves while other people were doing their
                        work.</p>
                    <p>The labor system of the south has now been changed. Slavery is dead. People
                        no longer have others to work for them. They must now work for themselves,
                        and it is time they were beginning to accommodate their habits to the new
                        condition of things. Idleness is no longer respectable. The stay law has
                        expired and execution now goes forth in primeval judgment against man that
                        he shall earn his bread in the sweat of his brow!</p>
                    <p>It is hard to get rid of old habits. But we must do it. We must "realize the
                        situation" and conform to the new condition of affairs. We must learn to
                        work. We must set a proper estimate on the value of time.--We must neither
                        waste our own, nor rob other people of theirs. When we have business to
                        attend to with others we must do it promptly, and leave them to pursue their
                        occupations.</p>
                    <p> Our people are generally too slow and "poking" in
                        their ways of transacting business. They talk too much and sit too long.
                        They must learn that if they have business with a merchant, or a lawyer, or
                        a doctor, or a mechanic or a preacher, they should attend to it promptly,
                        and give place to others who may have occasion to see them. </p>
                    <p>In this fast age "time is money" and we may with as much reason steal from a
                        man of business his money as his time--for one is, to him as valuable as the
                        other. Every hour of a business man's time, between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. is
                        worth from two to five dollars according to the nature of his occupation.
                        The man, therefore, who forcibly robs him of his time robs him of time's
                        worth--money.</p>
                    <p>In business matters there is nothing like coming to the point at once.
                        Talking round and round the matter in issue leads to no good end. It is
                        always best to strike right into the joint, at once, instead of haggling all
                        along the bone. There is philosophy even in cutting a chicken leg. We always
                        strike for the joint in that operation. Why may we not do the same in all
                        our business transactions!</p>
                    <p>A word to the wise is sufficient.</p>

<b>Public Meeting</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    <p>Editor of Virginian:</p>
                    <p>Sir--At the suggestion of many fellow-townsmen, who recognize the necessity
                        for immediate action in view of the near approach of our municipal election,
                        the importance of the functions to be exercised by the successful
                        candidates, and the danger to be apprehended from any division of the
                        Conservative vote, I take the liberty of asking that you will announce
                        through the columns of your paper that a public meeting of the voters of the
                        town of Staunton will be held at the Court-house, on Saturday, 21st inst, at
                        8 o'clock P.M., for the purpose of making nominations for the offices to be
                        filled by election on the 4th Thursday of this month.</p>
                    <p>The officers to be chosen are as follows.</p>
                    <p>A Mayor, whose term is yet to be fixed by law, and who is invested with full
                        power to suspend or remove the other city officers, being himself the chief
                        Executive; eleven Councilmen, to hold for one year, who have the authority
                        to impose taxes, order levies, grant licenses and legislate almost at
                        discretion within the Corporation jurisdiction. A Clerk of the Corporation
                        Court, with the term of six years. An attorney for the Commonwealth, elected
                        for two years. A city Sergeant, same term. A city Treasurer, elected for
                        term of three years, and a Commissioner of Revenue for the Corporation.</p>
                    <p>This is peculiarly a time when the interests of our town require the best
                        abilities we can command to be exercised to the public service, and it is to
                        be hoped that there will be a full attendance of our people at the time
                        mentioned, and a general disposition to yield any private preference to the
                        general good.</p>

<b>Siberton Steel, Iron Company</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article describes the Siberton iron firm that is soon to begin
                    operation. It discusses the new furnace, roads, and houses constructed. The

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is the expectation of this company to commence blasting this week. Several
                        days ago we were taken through the furnace, and shown the large amount of
                        machinery which is operated in smelting the ore; and we must confess our
                        astonishment at the vast amount of work that has been done. Their fire
                        department, with five hundred feet of gum hose is far superior to that of
                        the City, and everything about the establishment has been arranged with
                        strict regard to convenience. A tram road, one mile and a half in length,
                        has been constructed from the various ore banks on the mountain, to the
                        furnace; and a large number of houses built for the accommodation of
                        operators. We have no hesitation in giving it as our opinion that they will
                        turn out more metal than any other iron company in the State. There is every
                        reason to believe that the enterprise will be perfectly successful.</p>

                    and participants of an upcoming procession in honor of the Confederate dead.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> We have been requested by the ladies of our Memorial Association, to make
                        known their selection of Thursday, the 9th of July, as the day for the next
                        annual observance of appropriate ceremonies at the graves of our Confederate
                        dead. At 9 o'clock, A.M., the procession will form, in column by twos, on
                        Main Street, the head resting at the Town hall and facing towards the
                            Cemetry, whither it will proceed with as little delay as
                        possible. Music will be in attendance. The schools are invited to be
                        present, and to join the procession.</p>
                    <p> We trust all will unite in doing honor to our departed comrades. Let it
                        never be said that their gallant deeds are fading from our memory. The
                        survivors owe this simple tribute to our bravest and our best. The world
                        should see that their epitaphs are written on our
                            hearts, if not on costly monumental stone. It is fitting, too,
                        that with each returning spring the hands of lovely maidens from every
                        quarter of our Southern land should strew fresh flowers on the sod that
                        covers them. Soldiers from every State where floated the Southern cross, are
                        gathered there in the silent brotherhood of death. But keep up such gentle
                        homage, and the spirit of true chivalry will
                        never perish from the land. </p>
