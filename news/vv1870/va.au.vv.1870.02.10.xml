                    <p> We take the liberty of publishing some extracts from a private letter, which
                        we received a day or two ago, from a gentleman of Rochester, Minnesota. Our
                        object in laying this letter before our readers is, in the first place, to
                        let them know that the attention of persons in distant States has been
                        turned to this part of Virginia, as possessing attractions to settlers, and
                        secondly, to invite all persons in the country near us, who possess
                        undeveloped mineral lands, to inform us of the kind of minerals found on
                        their lands, the size of the tracts, and the location of each, with relation
                        to the Railroad and to Staunton. We shall be glad, at all times, to be the
                        medium of communication between those who desire to sell such property and
                        those who wish to buy. We are friends of improvement and like to keep things
                        moving.<lb/> Rochester, Minnesota,<lb/> January 17th, 1870. </p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Editor Valley Virginian,</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p> Dear Sir: --Having noticed an article in the <emph rend="italic">Iron
                        Age</emph> of New York, in the Jan. 6th No. which was taken from your paper,
                        in reference to the present and prospective advantage of your locality as an
                        iron producing region, and being desirous of gaining additional information
                        on the subject, I herewith enclose $1.60 with the request that you make a
                        memorandum of any name and address, and that you, from time to time send me
                        a copy of your paper, of such issues as may contain any information which
                        will bear upon its iron interests, or with regard to the size, growth,
                        business, and surroundings of your town. Should you have any extra copies of
                        any back numbers which contain any description of your town, or of any of
                        its manufacturing interests, aside from the article referred to, they will
                        be thankfully received, and pursued with interest. Begging pardon for this
                        intrusion,<lb/>I am,<lb/>Yours Truly,<lb/> J.F.V. </p>
                    <p> P.S. I should be glad to get information with regard to the prices of
                        business property in the more desirable locations. Also of the undeveloped
                        mineral lands favorably located; and in regard to the popular feeling
                        existing toward persons from the North who go to your portion of the State
                        with a view of making for themselves a business and a home.<lb/> J.F.V. </p>
                    <p>In answer, generally, to the enquiries of our correspondent, we will say,
                        that our town of Staunton is situated in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley,
                        near the centre of Augusta county. The town contains a population of five or
                        six thousand, and is rapidly improving. The country around us is fertile,
                        and as salubrious as any part of the Continent.</p>
                    <p>We have good schools--and a steady, industrious, frugal, religious, and
                        enterprising population.</p>
                    <p>The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R.R. already completed from Richmond to the
                        White Sulphur Springs, (a distance of 227 miles) and about to be finished
                        within two years, from the White Sulphur to the Ohio river, where it will
                        connect with the system of Northwestern, Western, and Southwestern Railroad,
                        passes through our town, and affords a convenient outlet Eastward and
                        Westward.</p>
                    <p>The railroad from Harper's Ferry to Harrisonburg (25 miles North of us) is
                        also nearly completed, and we presume it will not be long before it will be
                        extended to Staunton, and thence, Southwardly to Salem, on to the Virginia
                        and Tennessee Railroad.</p>
                    <p>The country Southeast, South, West, and Northwest of us, abounds in iron ore
                        of the best quality, and in inexhaustible quantities. A number of iron works
                        are springing up along the railway west of us, and there are still many
                        desirable iron properties unimproved, and in market. The losses which our
                        people generally suffered by the war, have so cramped them, that they cannot
                        raise the money necessary to develop them, and hence they are willing to
                        sell what they are unable to utilize themselves.</p>
                    <p>But iron is not the only valuable mineral that is found in this portion of
                        Virginia--Manganese, Barytes, Umber, Orchre and Kaolin or porcelain clay are
                        found in large quantities. The impression also prevails that there are
                        deposits of lead and silver ores, in the Blue Ridge, Southeast of
                        Greenville.</p>
                    <p>It has often been a matter of surprise to us, that some persons of capital
                        and enterprise have not taken hold of the Porcelain works, on the South
                        River, about 11 miles South of Staunton, and six miles Southwest of
                        Waynesborough.</p>
                    <p>Many years ago, a gentleman who lived on the South-side of the South Branch
                        of the Shenandoah River, had occasion to dig a well on a portion of his
                        land. After digging through a stratum of surface earth, to the depth of four
                        or five feet he encountered an earth or clay, which was as white as the
                        purest lime and entirely free from grit and all extraneous substances. Being
                        unable to determine the qualities of this new substance, he caused a
                        specimen of it to be submitted to Prof. Wm. B. Rogers of the University of
                        Virginia, who, after applying the proper tests, pronounced it kaolin, or
                        porcelain clay, of very pure quality. No use was made of it for a number of
                        years, except that persons in the neighborhood, from time to time, used it
                        for white-washing, instead of lime.</p>
                    <p>During the war, when there was a great demand for crockery ware of all kinds,
                        and also for fire-brick, a company of gentlemen bought 120 acres of land on
                        which the deposit was situated, with a view to erect works for the
                        manufacture of ware and fire-brick.</p>
                    <p>Before purchasing, they made careful exploration, to ascertain the
                        superficial extent, and thickness of the deposit. This exploration was made
                        by boring a number of points, in the basin, in which it was originally
                        formed. The result proved, that the deposit lay from three to five feet
                        below the surface--that it extended throughout the basin of about 40 acres,
                        and that it was about 42 feet or 43 feet thick.</p>
                    <p>Having ascertained these facts, the gentlemen purchased the whole Basin, and
                        about 80 acres of timber land, adjacent, and proceeded to erect a large
                        pottery, kilns, boarding house, store-room, engine house, stabling
                        &amp;c., and they also purchased steam engines, clay mills, patterns,
                        moulds, turn tables, &amp;c. They commenced the manufacture of various
                        kinds of ware and of fire brick, and had every reason to expect that their
                        enterprise would prove successful. But very soon after they commenced
                        operations, the rigid conscription of able bodied men, to recruit the
                        depleted ranks of the Confederate army, deprived them of the force necessary
                        to carry on their operations, and the works were suspended.</p>
                    <p>A sufficient experiment was made, however, to prove that the clay was well
                        adapted to the manufacture of Rockingham ware and yellow ware, of the very
                        best quality, and also of fire brick of great durability. No effort was made
                        to manufacture the finer qualities of white ware at these works, but a
                        specimen of the clay was sent to one of the potteries in Trenton, where it
                        was manufactured into C.C. ware of beautiful appearance and quality.</p>
                    <p>After the war a feeble attempt was made to renew operations, but from want of
                        capital and acquaintance with the business, it was abandoned, and the works
                        are now idle.</p>
                    <p>All the necessary buildings and apparatus to turn out $1,000 of ware per week
                        are now on the land, and there is a body of 80 acres of fine pine and oak
                        timber in the tract, and thousands of acres of similar timber adjoining,
                        which could be had for a minimal price. The condition of the works is such
                        that they could be put into operation in a few weeks, and thus the
                        proprietors could render the capital invested, immediately productive.</p>
                    <p>We are persuaded that there is no property in Virginia, which presents
                        stronger inducements to men of capital and enterprise to make an investment,
                        than these works.</p>
                    <p>The local demand for the wares would be large, and the rapid development of
                        the iron interest in this section, will cause a large and permanent demand
                        from fire brick, for the furnaces, which are now in process of construction.</p>
                    <p>The works are situated within a few hundred yards of the South Branch of the
                        Shenandoah, about six miles from Fishersville and Waynesborough depots, on
                        the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R.R. Should the Pennsylvania Central R.R.
                        construct the Page Valley R.R. which is now in contemplation, it would
                        probably pass through this property, as it is generally supposed that the
                        Road will follow the Valley of the River.</p>
                    <p>We understand the gentlemen who own this property, and have a charter of
                        incorporation, are willing to sell it and their franchises, for what land
                        and the improvements cost them.</p>
                    <p>We should be very much gratified if we can be the means of attracting the
                        attention of capitalists and experienced potters to this valuable property.
                        We regret to see such a mine of wealth left dormant. Unless we are greatly
                        mistaken, many years will not elapse before there is a considerable village
                        at this point and a large number of operatives at work.</p>
                    <p>In regard to enquiry of our correspondent as to how Northern men coming to
                        settle among us will be received, we answer, unhesitatingly, that any man
                        who comes to reside among us and who conducts himself with propriety, will
                        be received with kindness and cordiality. "Carpet baggers" who intrude
                        themselves here, with the purpose of getting office, by seeking to array
                        class against class and race against race, are certainly not welcome. But
                        the man who comes here for legitimate business purposes, especially if it be
                        his purpose to cast his lot with us, will be welcomed. Our people judge of
                        strangers by their conduct and not by the place of their nativity. If a man
                        acts like a gentleman he is sure to be treated as a gentleman. As an
                        evidence of the truth of this statement we will say that a gentleman from
                        Minnesota, has since the war taken up his abode among us, and by his
                        gentlemanly conduct has secured the respect and good will of the whole
                        community and is now one of our most flourishing merchants.</p>
                    <p>Other northern men have also become citizens of Staunton, and have succeeded
                        in establishing themselves, not only in profitable business, but in the
                        confidence and favorable regard of our people. We invite our correspondent
                        to come on. We will ensure him kind treatment.</p>

                <summary>In response to a letter from a Minnesota man requesting information on
                    business interests in the area, the author of this article describes the various

                    Specifically, mineral deposits for the manufacture of pottery and brick are
                    discussed at length. Further, in response to the disposition of southerners

                    <p>Mr. Editor,</p>
                    <p>Nothing venture, nothing have, is an old saw and as true in regard to the
                        securing a public improvement, as an individual enterprise. With a
                        short-sighted policy as events have proved, our people have refused to tax
                        themselves to secure the extension of the Valley Railroad. Had they acted
                        otherwise, I have no hesitation in saying we might now have had this road
                        under contract. The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio is now a fixed fact, and it is
                        only the more important we should bestir ourselves to get the Valley
                        Railroad under way. Rockbridge is assuming a restless air, and must have a
                        road. If we do anything that will make her believe we are in earnest in
                        trying to secure this road, it will <emph rend="italic">re assure</emph>
                        her, and induce her to await our action.--What do we propose to do? To call
                        a meeting of all those interested in the extension of the road, on the North
                        side, by way of Dayton, Bridgewater, &amp;c., to assemble at Moscow as a
                        central and convenient point on Saturday, the 19th inst., at 11 a.m. <emph
                            rend="italic">What for?</emph> To petition the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
                        Railroad to put a competent corps of Engineers <emph rend="italic"
                            >immediately</emph> at work, from Harrisonburg, along this Northside
                        route, so we may at least stand on an equal footing with the South side.
                        Again, that will let Baltimore, as also the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                        Company know we are willing to put your own shoulders to the wheel, in
                        binding ourselves to relinquish damages, and in subscribing as liberally as
                        we can to the stock of the road. </p>

                        Florida Emigration Society," which we learn has been successful in its
                        efforts to obtain transportation for its members over the several roads at
                        reduced rates. The "Society" proposes to "pull up stakes" on the 16th of the
                        present month, and quietly embark to Jacksonville, where it is supposed the
                        "woodbine twineth."</p>
                    <p> Before leaving, however, the Society will treat the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spectator</emph> office with a serenade, beginning and ending with its
                        favorite song, "Shoo fly!"</p>
