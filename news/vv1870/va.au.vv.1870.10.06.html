<b>The Wealth of the South</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article shows the great wealth that has poured into the South as a
                    result of the 1869-70 cotton crop. The author illustrates how cotton drives
                    foreign commerce, and how the money generated falls back into "lap of the
                    South." Although radicalism seeks to hold the South back, cotton not only
                    creates wealth for the South, but also for the rest of the country.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From the statement of the Southern cotton crop for 1869-70, something like a
                        just idea of the rich resources of that great section of the country may be
                        formed. Three hundred and twenty-five millions of dollars brought into an
                        agricultural community by a single crop is an outstanding exhibit; yet it is
                        by that very amount that the South is the richer for its past year's product
                        of a single staple. Three-fourths of it goes abroad, to turn the great
                        wheels of foreign commerce, and in turn to set in motion the national
                        currents of our internal trade and industry. The country mainly effects its
                        exchanges with foreign countries by means of cotton bills, and these the
                        South supplies. The export of two and a quarter millions of bales gives
                        employment to a large fleet of ocean vessels, which favorable legislation
                        would make in the main our own. All this wealth flows back into the lap of
                        the South, but it enriches factors, merchants, steam lines, railroads, and a
                        large number of other beneficiaries on its way, and afterwards forms the
                        basis of an active and immense trade with the other sections of the
                        country--the importers and manufacturers of the East, and the
                        agriculturalists of the West. All are interlocked with the good fortune of
                        that favored section, so that when it makes a good cotton crop the rest reap
                        the advantage equally.</p>
                    <p> All this is the very section of the country, so peaceful in its pursuits as
                        to be able to raise such crops of ready money as these, which Radicalism
                        insanely seeks to hold under the tyranny of secret and irresponsible
                        governments, inspired and sustained from Washington, and bent on
                        disfranchising, punishing, and degrading its population in hopes of
                        advancing the basest party ends. -- Boston

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The following report of the terrible freshet in Staunton and vicinity is
                        extracted from the Spectator:</p>
                    <p>Staunton. -- We will not attempt to give in detail the damages done -- we
                        will mention only the chief, which, as before said, consisted of the
                        destruction of bridges. The bridge on main street, at Bickle's shop, was
                        destroyed. At this place, also, the water and gas pipes were broken, which
                        had the effect of depriving, for a short time, those living East of that
                        place, of water, and those living West, of gas. The West-enders groped in
                        the darkness, but quaffed delicious water -- the East-enders would have
                        "preferred darkness to light," not "because the deeds were evil," but
                        because, like Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner," with "water, water,
                        everywhere," they had "not a drop to drink."</p>
                    <p>A portion of the masonry on each side, supporting the bridge on Augusta
                        street, near the American Hotel, yielded to the sapping of the stream, and a
                        part of the flooring of the bridge fell at the same time into the stream. A
                        number were standing upon the bridge at the time, though, fortunately, but
                        one, Mr. James Teabo, was precipitated into the racing torrent beneath. It
                        was like being thrown into the very jaws of death, for it was barely
                        possible that his life might have been saved. But, to the relief of all, who
                        were terrified and helpless spectators of his imminent peril, his life was
                        saved, and he was rescued from the stream after being borne upon its swift
                        and resistless current for half a mile. He fortunately caught hold of a
                        plank and held to it till he was floated into the meadow where he could
                        reach the ground with his feet. That plank saved his life. Whilst he was in
                        the stream going like an arrow sped from the bow, Charley Stafford and John
                        Kennedy, with a generous spirit which is commendable, but with a rashness
                        bordering upon madness, plunged into the stream below the Virginia Hotel,
                        with the view of trying to rescue him. There efforts at that part of the
                        stream were, of course futile, and the wonder is, that they were not
                        drowned. He was rescued by Jno. B. Scherer, Jr., and others in the lower
                        part of Kayser's meadow. He was nearly exhausted when rescued. He was much
                        hurt and is still confined to his bed.</p>
                    <p>The bridge near Burke's Livery Stable, as well as the bridges near the
                        Railroad bridge, were swept away. The new bridge leading to the Fair Ground
                        and the new bridge on Lewis street, were not destroyed. Great damage was
                        done to the lots on the Creek below town.</p>
                    <p>The houses in Irish Alley were partially submerged. An old man, in Mrs.
                        Bolen's stable, a part of which was washed away, remained there till the
                        next day. Efforts were made to rescue him, but he was too much afraid of the
                        water to accept any of the modes of relief proffered him. He preferred to
                        take his chances in the stable, and as that portion of the stable was not
                        washed away, he was saved and came out the next day.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Thurbert was rescued by knocking a plank off the gable of his house,
                        by which means he got upon a tree, and by having a rope attached to the
                        tree, he was saved.</p>
                    <p>The Fair Grounds were submerged and suffered considerable damage. They will
                        be repaired before the time fixed for the exhibition.</p>
                    <p>Lewis Creek did great damage to the farms, fencing, &amp;c., along its
                        course, as did Mill Creek, Christian's Creek, and, in fact, every other
                        Creek in the county.</p>
                    <p>Such has been the destruction of Mills, and the more or less serious damage
                        to those not wholly destroyed, but that little, if any, grinding can be
                        done, at this time, in this county. This freshet has been as destructive to
                        Mills as the torches of Sheridan's army of incendiaries.</p>
                    <p> Christian's Creek -- This stream swept off bridges, mills, fencing and
                        crops. The dwelling house at Bushong's Mill, occupied by Mr. George Myers,
                        with all its contents, was destroyed. Sniteman's Saw Mill was swept away, as
                        was, also, Wm. Hamilton's Grist mill, with all its contents. In this Grist
                        mill, James Hamilton had stored his wheat, all of which was lost. M. Preston
                        T. Burkholder lost his whole crop of corn, and
                        others on this stream suffered in a similar manner, though not to an equal
                        extent. </p>
                    <p>Middle River -- The destruction on this river was very great. We have but
                        partial accounts, but they serve to form some idea of the damage suffered.
                        The property of Mr. Phillip O. Polmer at Valley Mills suffered greatly,
                        though the new merchant mill was not destroyed. Both bridges at that point
                        were swept away -- the bridge on the Parkersburg Turnpike, and the bridge
                        leading from that road to Mr. Polmer's Foundry. The pillar of masonry in the
                        middle of the stream, supporting the former, was washed away. The saw mill
                        was destroyed, with forebay and foundry trunk, and a large rent made in the
                        dam.</p>
                    <p>The West end of the Old Valley Mill was destroyed, and also the West end of
                        the Foundry moulding room was burst out to give vent to the water. The
                        damage in the loss of patterns cannot yet be ascertained. His watergaps were
                        completely destroyed and his orchards nearly so.</p>
                    <p>Henry Polmer's Mil., at Spring Hill, with 8,000 bushels of wheat, and near a
                        hundred barrels of flour, was destroyed; also his saw mill. Trimble
                        &amp; Hogsett's Mill was injured in dam and forebay, and about 10,000
                        feet of lumber carried away.</p>
                    <p>Samuel Landes's Mill was injured, and from 30 to 50 barrels of flour lost.
                        His Saw Mill was much injured, and his dam broken.</p>
                    <p>John H. Argent lost his dwelling and furniture.</p>
                    <p>John A. Patterson lost all his fencing along the river, and a large quantity
                        of wheat in his granary. His farm, like that of many others on that stream,
                        was seriously damaged by washing.</p>
                    <p>Bailey Dunlap lost 86 acres of corn, and soil washed off to depth of plow.</p>
                    <p>G.A. Hundley's Mill was seriously damaged having forebay, wheel, part of the
                        dam, and part of the foundation washed away. Contents uninjured.</p>
                    <p>John Shutterley's Saw Mill was destroyed and his merchant mill flooded in
                        lower story. His forebay and part of the dam destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The dam at Trinity Point Mills, which was so strong that it was thought that
                        no freshet should affect it, was broken.</p>
                    <p>Keller's iron turning and fitting shop was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The bridge at Samuel Cline's Mill was not swept away, though greatly damaged.</p>
                    <p>The corn crops of Col. Wm. A. Anderson, Wm. Moerman, and S.H. McCue were
                        washed away.</p>
                    <p>Christian Cline's mill, supposed to have contained 4,000 bushels of wheat,
                        was destroyed; also his saw mill. It is reported that his dwelling was also
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Thos. F. Hoy's Saw mill above Mt. Meridian was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Robert S. Harnsberger's Saw mill, and also the dwelling occupied by his
                        miller, were swept away. His large merchant mill was partially submerged,
                        the stream swept from his fields about 600 bushels of corn.</p>
                    <p>Jas. D. Craig, at Mt. Meridian, suffered great loss. We are sorry to learn
                        that he lost nearly everything except his dwelling occupied by himself and
                        family. The dwelling on his place occupied by Mr. Humphrey, with its
                        contents of furniture, &amp;c., his stable, spring house, straw ricks,
                        wheel drill, harness, &amp;c., were swept away, besides about 500
                        bushels of corn.</p>
                    <p>South River -- The loss on this river was immense -- houses, bridges, fences,
                        corn crops, &amp;c., being swept away by the swollen volume and
                        impetuous torrent.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Kerr, a widow with nine children, lost her dwelling, granary, and
                        orchard.</p>
                    <p>Henry A. Harner lost his chopping mill and saw mill.</p>
                    <p>Wonderlick's saw mill, and the dwelling of his tenant with its contents, in
                        which were included the furniture and clothing of the family, were
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Rippetoe's mill was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>James A Patterson's saw mill was swept away.</p>
                    <p>The bridge at the Forge, and several buildings belonging to the Mt. Vernon
                        Iron Works Company, were destroyed.</p>
                    <p>At Weyer's Cave, the dwelling of Mrs. McCauley, with an aged woman, Mrs. Ham,
                        in it was swept away. Her cries were heard as the house passed points lower
                        down the river. The other occupants of the house, nine in number, Mrs.
                        McCauley, two daughters with two babies, two sons and two negro men, were
                        saved by getting on trees, on which they remained till the next day. During
                        this time, whilst they were clinging for life to the trees which were swayed
                        and shaken by the impetuous torrent beneath, they -- the innocent babies
                        included -- were subjected through the darkness of the night to the
                        "peltings of the pitiless storm" of rain which chilled them to the bone.
                        "Ponder it, think of it."</p>
                    <p>An adventurous negro man took off his clothes and essayed to swim across the
                        river to Abraham Mohler's, near Weyer's Cave; but finding that the current
                        was too strong for him, and that he would probably be drowned, if he
                        persisted in the attempt, he seized hold of and succeeded in climbing a
                        tree, upon which, in his state of nudity, he remained until the next
                        morning, when he succeeded in swimming safely to shore.</p>
                    <p>Some buildings we learn in Port Republic were destroyed, and others were
                        partially submerged.</p>
                    <p>Miscellaneous -- On Mossy Creek, the Forrer dam, lately rebuilt, was broken,
                        washing away the smith shop. On Moffett's branch, Captain Hogshead's saw
                        mill washed away, an immense amount of fencing, corn in shuck, and land,
                        seeded, the soil carried off to the depth of the plow. Long Glade was
                        similarly visited, the bridge near Fulton's and one over Tanksley Draft
                        creek, just put up, carried off.</p>
                    <p>North River in Rockbridge -- This river, like those in this county, was
                        higher than ever before known. It swept off bridges and mills. At
                        Bridgewater, the bridge across the river, and the mills of Geo. W. Berlin
                        and Wm. Dinkle were destroyed, and a considerable part of that beautiful
                        village was destroyed, there being a dozen or more houses either totally
                        destroyed or greatly damaged.</p>
                    <p>Shenandoah River -- This river was much higher than ever before known, in
                        some places 15 feet higher, and we understand that the destruction along its
                        course was inconceivably great. Bridges, mills, houses, accompanied with
                        loss of human lives, horses, cattle, corn, wheat, flour, &amp;c., were
                        swept away.</p>
                    <p>Hon. John F. Lewis's mill was not destroyed.</p>
