                    <p>An old war phrase, engrafted on our Southern idiom, may not inaptly usher a
                        few remarks upon some of the war's more important results among our Southern
                        people; and one of the effects of that war being somewhat to circumscribe
                        that catholic interest which old Virginians once took in National affairs,
                        we make no reconnaissance to day beyond the latest boundary of our
                        Commonwealth, nor trench at all upon debatable ground.</p>
                    <p>In fact we begin to think, with Rasselas of old, when he had gained
                        experience, that our own little Valley is long enough and broad enough to
                        give full scope to our affections, and to feel like him some diminution of
                        our interest in what lies beyond the blue hills around us.</p>
                    <p>Well, then, mentally reviewing the events of the past few years, and
                        contemplating the condition in which we find ourselves to day, what reason
                        have we Virginians of the Valley to bewail the past? Just come to quiet
                        anchorage after tossing about so long, a helpless waif, upon the shifting
                        currents of national politics; just escaped from a worse than Egyptian
                        bondage, and left comparatively free to shape for ourselves civil
                        government, we yet hear on every hand complaint of the evils, real and
                        imaginary, past, present, and to come, from certain gentlemen among us,
                        whose discontented murmurings remind us always of that character of Horace:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic"> Difficilis, quarulus laudator temporis acti.</emph> Now
                        old memories will sometimes sadden the cheeriest of us all, when the thought
                        of our bravest and our best, sacrificed in the struggle, comes over us at
                        times like that music described by Ossian. But we have no patience with
                        these perpetual Jeremiads. We think it best to sake hands with the past and
                        look before us. And to those differently inclined, we would say, that we see
                        no reason why our achievements in the future, though on different fields,
                        should not eclipse our former glories. We see no reason why young men,
                        especially should exchange for homes in the Southern or Western States, a
                        regimen which for combined fertility of soil, salubrity of climate,
                        convenience to markets, and societal and educational advantages, is
                        unsurpassed upon this continent. The necessity which drove so many of them
                        from our midst, to seek their livelihood in sections less impoverished, was
                        one of the results of the war which we have most regretted. Now is the time
                        for them to return, and build up homes and names for themselves in the land
                        of their forefathers.</p>
                    <p>We have every reason to believe that Virginia is just entering upon a career
                        of prosperity, unprecedented in her history. Those Cassandras in breeches of
                        whom we spoke are principally, if not exclusively, found among the class
                        called "Loafers" Their gloomy views are unnoticed beyond their street-corner
                        gatherings. The fact is that the condition of things here is more hopeful
                        just now, than at any time since the war.--As to the tendency of the
                        "National" government, we do not propose to speak. But the temper of the
                        Congressional majority towards us has manifestly improved, as witness the
                        recent debates and votes upon the subject of disabilities. The reaction has
                        set in.--A Conservative policy is gradually gaining ascendancy in the
                        Northern mind, and no sooner will it begin to find expression at the polls,
                        than these same curs who have been barking at our heels, will be fawning
                        upon us.</p>
                    <p>The Supreme Court has given evidence of its disposition to return to, and
                        enforce the principles of the Constitution. The recent confirmation of Judge
                        Strong as Associate Justice, adds strength to that inclination--Returning
                        confidence in the currency of the country will infuse new life into the
                        veins of commerce, and give a stimulus to business enterprise, of every
                        sort. A steady tide of immigration has set in, and, properly managed, it may
                        be diverted from its usual destinations in the far west, and we may reap the
                        benefits of their energy and industry. As the more worthless of our negro
                        population is drifting off we well afford to encourage their coming.</p>
                    <p>There is no section of the country, North, South, East or West, which offers
                        more inducements to such settlers; which is itself more favored by kind
                        Providence, than our own Valley of Virginia. We are no longer subject to the
                        double tyranny of a Radical oligarchy and the military understrappers. We
                        have a Government of our own. And that Government being an inexhaustible
                        theme for our grumblers, let us see whether it is really so bad as
                        represented.</p>
                    <p>Certainly no other State among the "reconstructed" has been equally
                        fortunate.--As to our Executive head, it seems to us that he is the right
                        man in the right place. His administrative capacity is undoubted, and his
                        interests are thoroughly identified with our own. He is untrammeled by old
                        party prejudices, and awake to the real issues of the day. Our Legislators
                        are men of our own selection, and we see, as yet, no ground of complaint in
                        that quarter. A work so important as our civil reorganization should be
                        deliberately done. And we doubt not that our Judiciary will be selected with
                        a due regard as well to the wishes of the people as their fitness for the
                        Ermine.</p>
                    <p>Our new Constitution, which is so berated as in the main, a literal copy of
                        the old Constitution of 1850, under which we have lived from twenty years.
                        It leaves our code of Statute Law in force, together with the legislation of
                        the years, 1855, 6 and 7, the operation of which has so amply proven its
                        wisdom. Some of the changes are merely transcripts from the Constitution of
                        the United States, already the supreme law of the land. Some others we
                        regard as absolute improvements; for instance, the veto power given to the
                        Executive; the establishment of Bureaus of Agriculture, Chemistry and
                        Geology and of Immigration, the substitution of Judges "learned in the law"
                        for the old County Court Magistracy, and the appointment of all the Judges
                        by the General Assembly, instead of their election as heretofore. We
                        believe, too, that the extensions of the rate of interest will prove a
                        positive advantage. The old law has, of late, been practically inoperative,
                        save to increase the per centum by the risk. The object, in our opinion, is
                        best regulated by the law of trade.</p>
                    <p>The "Common School" fixture is a great bug-bear. True it is objectionable,
                        but under the Constitution it is susceptible of improvement. And in the
                        recent election of Wm. U. Ruffner, as Superintendent, we have assurance that
                        it will be judiciously systematized, and managed to the best advantage for
                        four years to come. The great majority of our population are unable to
                        educate their children. We must either establish schools at the public
                        expense, or leave them in ignorance--all to exercise the elective franchise,
                        and no means of appealing to their judgments. Our neighbor State of West
                        Virginia assesses, for this purpose, a special tax of ten cents on the
                        hundred dollars. The proprietors taxed for educational support may expect,
                        in time to realize their investment in the enhancing value of their
                        property. Our contempt for the "Yankees" should not cause us to reject what
                        is useful because they have invented it. And Common Schools are not their
                        invention. We believe they originated with the Scotch.</p>
                    <p>The Homestead Exemption is not high in favor with the creditor class. But the
                        principles of justice are immutable, and they need apprehend no deprivation
                        of their rights under contracts in the past. The future will take care of
                        itself. And they should remember, too, that the same instrument has relieved
                        them from the incubus of the Stay Law.</p>
                    <p> This is peculiarly a time for the <sic>exorcise</sic> of moderation and
                        forbearance between fellow citizens of a state just recovering from a common
                        disaster. We are not among those who believe that a cruel, grasping spirit
                        is one of the universal effects of the war upon our people, or that the
                        restoration of legal remedies will result in such universal distress. The
                        statistics of judgments and executions in our Courts is no fair exponent of
                        the temper of our people; nor does it exhibit a debit and credit account
                        between them. Many creditors have sought, in that way, to secure their
                        proper priorities, who, instead of pushing their legal advantages, are now
                        compromising on generous terms. One debt paid will meet another, until the
                        aggregates of indebtedness, which have been so paraded before our eyes, will
                        be reduced surprisingly.--Notwithstanding the reverse of the past season in
                        an agricultural community, we are very far yet from that condition of
                        hopeless insolvency which a stranger might infer from our public prints. We
                        of the Valley are less involved than any other portion of the State: We are
                        less paralyzed by Emancipation, having been for years comparatively
                        independent of the negro laborer. <unclear>Intersecting</unclear> lines of
                        railway, projected and begun with proper encouragement from us, will soon
                        give us reduced freights and competing markets for our produce. We have
                        genial skies, a generous soil, and a thrifty, industrious people. The future
                        of such a people, under such circumstances is not a subject for despondency
                        or doubt. </p>

                <summary>This article advises citizens of the Valley to look to the future with
                    optimism. There are several points of interest discussed. First, the author
                    suggests that Virginia is entering into a period of unprecedented prosperity,
                    and the conservative policy now gaining throughout the country only adds to
                    these upcoming prosperous times. Also, while money will have to be spent on free
                    education for black citizens, the governor has assured white Virginians that
                    schools will remain segregated. Finally, arrangements to alleviate mounting debt
                    problems that have caused a great deal of anxiety since the war are discussed,
                    suggesting that the situation is far from "hopelessly insolvent."</summary>
