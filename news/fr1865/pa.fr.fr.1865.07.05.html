<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>A correspondent of the New York Citizen, writing
						from Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, graphically describes the scenery,
						improvements and celebrities of that section. He thus speaks of the
						ex-General John A. McCausland of the ex-rebel army:</p>
					<p>"On the lower side of the Kanawah, and just opposite Point Pleasant, is a
						modest, unassuming brick dwelling, surrounded by trees and shrubbery. In
						this lives John A. McCausland, late Brigadier-General in the late Rebel
						army, who bears in the North the unenviable reputation of being responsible
						for the burning of Chambersburg, Pa. Gen. McCausland has recently returned.
						He denies his responsibility for the burning, and says that it was ordered
						by Gen. Early, and that he (McCausland) protested against any such barbarous
						proceeding; and that afterward, when he returned to the Shenandoah Valley,
						he demanded of Early a statement exonerating him from all blame in the
						affair. This statement McCausland received from Early, and it is now in the
						hands of our authorities."</p>
					<p>We are not surprised that so unscrupulous a brute as McCausland should resort
						to the most shameless falsehood to escape the just consequences of his
						barbarities practiced in this place on the 30th of July, 1864. It is true
						doubtless that Gen. Early ordered him to burn Chambersburg. He exhibited
						such an order here when he was importuning citizens to raise him money to
						ransom the town; but his statement that he protested against the burning
						must be wholly false. There were officers and men of his command who did
						protest against McCausland's atrocities; but he was the master spirit of
						every fiendish act perpetrated here on that eventful day. At the house of
						Mr. Greenawalt near town, where he breakfasted that morning, he resented
						with fury the remonstrances of Gen. Bradley Johnston against burning
						anything but public buildings, and he there blasphemed most violently
						because he was not able to reach Chambersburg until after day-light. His
						greatest ambition seemed to be to fire a defenseless town of six thousand
						inhabitants in the dead hour of night, which must have resulted in the loss
						of many lives of women and children. Of the leading officers who discussed
						the destruction of our town at Mr. Greenawalt's, McCausland stood alone in
						favor of applying the torch indiscriminately, and he manifested his
						unmingled brutality by boasting to the lady of the house of the terror he
						would visit upon the women and children of Chambersburg. He was the
						commander of the invading force, and he had the power to execute the order
						of Early, with some regard to humanity or with the ferocity of the savage,
						and he chose the latter, because he seemed incapable of anything else. He
						was present in the town when it was fired, saw and approved the conduct of
						his subordinate officers in giving their men free access to liquor, until
						some of his officers begged the citizens to get the women out of the way of
						the soldiers, as they were intoxicated and their commander was brutal enough
						to tolerate any course of conduct they might choose to adopt. He witnessed
						their almost indiscriminate robbery of private houses of every species of
						valuables they could carry off with them, and in no instance that we have
						heard of did he attempt to restrain any of his men from the high carnival of
						savagery they indulged in on every hand. Some of his own officers defied his
						orders and refused to apply the torch, and thus saved a considerable portion
						of the town, and even privates stood by and wept at the shocking scenes the
						ruling fiend flung out to stain with indelible infamy himself and his cause
						on that day. McCausland and McCausland alone is the hero of the
						free-booter's triumph in Chambersburg, and the responsibility cannot be
						shifted upon others to enable him to enjoy the luxury of his home in West
						Virginia.</p>
					<p>It is possible that he has procured from Early--who is reported as insane--a
						statement that the responsibility for the sacking and burning of
						Chambersburg belongs to Early; but if we mistake not the authorities, to
						whom Early's statement has been sent, are fully advised of the facts in the
						case, and were not surprised therefore to see the announcement recently that
						his arrest had been ordered. If we mistake not, the government is in full
						possession of conclusive evidence of his deliberate murder of prisoners as
						late as April last, and the certificates of a crazy superior will not avail
						him much. Such, we are assured is the voluntary testimony of some of his own
						subordinate officers who witnessed his cold-blooded murder of wounded
						prisoners, and when he gets to Washington he will probably find much more to
						answer than he now dreams of in his quiet home on the green banks of the
						Kanawha. It would be a crime against humanity for the government to allow
						such a monster to live in the land he sought to desolate with fire and sword
						regardless of all the amenities of war, and it is some gratification to know
						that he is not likely to escape the avenging arm of justice.</p>

<b>Political Bummers</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors accuse politicians in the Union and Democratic camps of
					political opportunism. The evidence for this claim lies in the fact that both
					state parties postponed the state conventions to get a better sense of President
					Johnson's agenda.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Political "bummers" seem to rule the movements of both parties in this State
						just now. The Democracy started out for the campaign at an early day with
						banners streaming ready for any new device that might be deemed expedient,
						and they called their convention to meet in June to nominate a State ticket
						and adopt such principles as might promise them a show of success. In due
						time the Union Convention was called to meet on the 19th inst. and a full
						attendance earnestly urged, as business of great importance was to be
						presented. So far all was progressing elegantly on both sides; but soon
						after the death of President Lincoln the bummers about the skirts of the
						dilapidated Democratic camp began to snuff the fleshpots afar off, and they
						have made the shattered remnants of the coppery arm suspend hostilities
						while the bummers attempt to crawl into Johnson's camp and bear off an
						assortment of plunder. The bummers prevail, and Mr. Ward postpones his
						convention until August to give his flanking columns a fair chance to bring
						in a supply of mules, geese, asses, negroes, old clothes, and any other
						plunder to appease the cravings of his famished followers. It was meet for
						Mr. Ward so to do, for his political larder is entirely empty, and his lean,
						lank, cadaverous adherents are ready for any port in a storm. If they can
						crawl into the Presidential kitchen through the back door, or down the
						chimney, or under ground, it matters not how black, or dirty, or ragged they
						may be when they get there, only so that there may be a few crumbs of
						plunder for them to feed upon; and he does wisely, because he cannot do
						anything else if he would, to allow his whole discordant, belligerent and
						starving army to turn bummers en masse and feed
						on any husks which may be found in any of the by-paths of politics. That
						Ward should turn bummer himself and lead his whole motley crew in the
						bumming trade politically, we therefore conclude to be the most rational use
						that can be made of his odd remnants of political power. True, it may not
						pay; but as nothing else will pay for that organization, it may as well go
						bumming with one chance in a million as to stay within its own metes and
						bounds and starve.</p>
					<p>But bummers seem to beset the organization of the Union party also, and Gen.
						Cameron has capitulated to the bummers of his camp. The Union Convention had
						been called for the 19th inst. and so far as we know Union men generally
						were prepared for it. But it seems that the bummers were buzzing around
						prospective United States Senators, embryo Governors, and hungry
						contractors, and they have frightened the commander out of his senses,
						compelled him to recede from his chosen position, and retreat without day
						into indefinite chaos politically. Were the Union bummers afraid that they
						might get ahead or behind President Johnson?--that they might be guilty of
						an act of impolicy by telling the truth and standing squarely up in behalf
						of our National and State administrations and the principles on which they
						were chosen? There can be no other solution of this triumph of the political
						bummers in the Union party; and now that the wrong has been done, the method
						of redress is to fix the earliest day for the Union Convention that is
						practicable after the meeting of the Committee on the 19th. It won't hurt
						any body's claims for Senator, who has a ghost of a chance now; it won't
						make or unmake any body who wants to be Governor, and if it does distress
						the retinue of camp-followers who are trembling lest President Johnson is as
						corrupt as themselves and may depart from the principles which triumphed by
						his election, it will do no material harm. Let the bummers ply their
						vocation to their hearts content; but the Union organization has rescued the
						Republic from traitors North and South by its matchless fidelity, and it
						cannot afford to go mousing now into the dirty sluices of the bummers to
						perpetuate its triumphs. While it is successful it must have bummers; but
						while they prey on its plunder in imitation of the Democracy, let the Union
						organization maintain its integrity, and never hesitate to unfurl its banner
						to the breeze and declare its doctrines to the people whose great cause it
						has brought, through fearful tribulation, to the crowning victory of the
						nineteenth century!</p>

					<p>Senator Wade, as chairman of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, is now
						revising the sheets of the report of that committee, comprising recent
						testimony as to the treatment of our prisoners received at the hands of the
						rebels. The committee say the evidence clearly shows that tens of thousands
						of our brave soldiers have fallen victims to that savage and infernal spirit
						which actuated those who spared not the prisoners at their mercy, who sought
						by midnight arson to destroy hundreds of defenceless women and children, and
						who hesitated not to resort to means to commit acts so horrible that the
						nations of the earth stand aghast as they are told what has been done. The
						prison surgeons' report of the Richmond prisons for one quarter shows that a
						fraction over one-half of all the cases entered resulted in death, and most
						of these deaths were more the result of inhuman treatment and neglect than
						disease. But a little more than half the necessary number of beds were
						provided, and the nurses often occupied them to the exclusion of the sick.
						After our men died, their bodies were treated as the carcasses of so many
						dead animals. They were piled in the dead house, and their eyes and cheeks
						eaten out by rats before they were put in coffins. The keepers generally
						manifested almost total indifference to the lives and condition of the
						prisoners. And as one of the many illustrations of this, a witness testified
						to the following: "I was standing one day by the hospital. One of our negro
						soldiers, captured at the explosion of the mine near Petersburg, was
						standing near by, engaged in skirmishing--as we prisoners call it--examining
						his clothes for vermin. A rebel sentinel, at whom I happened to be looking
						at the time, drew up his musket, took deliberate aim and fired, killing the
						negro on the spot. On being asked what he did it for, he answered, 'To see
						the d--d black son of a b-- drop.'" The rebels said they got thirty days'
						furlough for shooting a Yankee. The committee say it is a matter of
						congratulation that, notwithstanding the great provocations to pursue a
						different course, our authorities have ever treated their prisoners humanely
						and generously, and have, in all respects, conducted this contest according
						to the rules of the most civilized warfare.<br> --Washington Correspondence of the New York Times.</p>

<b>Local Items--Gossip With Our Friends</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gossip remarks upon the differences between this Fourth of July and the
					four previous ones.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>GOSSIP WITH OUR FRIENDS.--Eighty-nine years ago there was grave trouble among
						the UNITED COLONIES of North America. On the 7th of June, 1776, Richard
						Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that "these UNITED COLONIES are and of right
						ought to be free and independent States." Thus,
						Jefferson, of Va.; John Adams, of Mass.; Benj. Franklin, of Penna.; Roger
						Sherman, of Conn., and Robert R. Livingston, of New York, were appointed a
						committee to draft a Declaration of Independence. Jefferson, as chairman,
						prepared the document. This Declaration, after being discussed several days
						and slightly amended was adopted at 2 o'clock on the 4TH OF JULY, 1776. The
						aforesaid document contained the following: "We hold these truths to be
						self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their
						Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these, are life,
						liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."--How the Confederated States, having become a government under the title
						of UNITED STATES, lived up to these bold words, let history show. If Mr.
						Jefferson's writings do not exhibit that he, at least, thought slavery an
						evil, to be gotten rid of as soon as possible, depending upon the very
						spirit that actuated the "Declaration," and upon the abhorrence that the
						signers of the same had for injustice--if such was not the case, then there
						is no use in writing one's thoughts at all. This same Mr. Jefferson, the
						great exponent of Democracy, "trembled when he reflected that God was just,"
						and well might he tremble. But thank God, the day for trembling has passed
						by. We have received our punishment. The whole country has been scourged. We
						had not, like King David, the choice of war, famine, or pestilence; but war,
						civil war, a fearful fratricidal war was forced upon us, with the unexpected
						and wonderful result--the freedom of the negro. The Republican party can lay
						little more claim to this than the Democratic. God did it. Let us submit.</p>
					<p>Alas, your Gossip has been led outside of his track, and now returns with due
						humility to that with which he is familiar. The war has lasted four years.
						How well do we all remember the celebrated Patterson campaign of '61, when
						the three-months' men rendered our town so gay, when we used to have parades
						in the Diamond, when we looked with awe upon a
						Colonel, and when we wilted at the sight of the first Brigadier, when we
						looked confidently for the early destruction of Stonewall Jackson and his
						men. These were the primitive days of innocence, and then followed '62, when
						McClellan was "our young Napoleon," when the nine-months' men went forth to
						battle at Antietam and Fredericksburg, and when Stuart came upon us, like a
						thief in the night, setting fire to the Railroad buildings, and frightening
						us out of our wits. And after that, in due chronological order, came '63,
						with Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania. What an exodus was there, my
						countrymen! What a carrying business the Cumberland Valley Railroad did;
						what a scarcity there was of colored population and horses, and how, in the
						instant, every retail store enlarged its business and became wholesale! How
						our hearts sank within us as we watched the long line of the invading army
						march through our streets and past our doors, for eight long, weary days.
						Three mortal weeks were we then in the enemy's lines, (and they were not
						pleasant places either,) during which time our news came from Richmond, and
						we knew no more what was going on outside than if we had been dead and
						buried, until we heard of GETTYSBURG, the glorious. '64 succeeded, and with
						it the destruction of our homes, the wanton, wicked burning of a whole town
						of unarmed citizens. The flames rise high before us now, and again we see
						the crowds of homeless fugitives clustering around the ruins of their
						homesteads like bees about an upturned hive, and once again we hear Horace
						Greely, the merciful, laugh, "Served them right." '65 is here, and "our flag
						is there." Go look at it waving and flapping in the breeze. The stripes no
						longer typical of the bloody backs of the negro slave, but the stars,
						everyone, meaning E Pluribus Unum. How
						differently this 4th of July from the four
						preceding. Now we can gather under our own vines, even though scorched and
						blackened, and can shout for the old flag till we are hoarse.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Times</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The New York Times figures up the pecuniary loss
						of the South in good money as follows:<br> In slave
						property...............$2,500,000,000<br> By the ravages of war...........
						900,000,000<br> Four crops of cotton............ 900,000,000<br> Four
						crops of tobacco........... 150,000,000<br> Rice and
						sugar.................. 160,000,000<br> Confederate debt (worth in gold</p>
					<p>$500,000,000).................. 4,000,000,000<br> The proper proportion of
						the Na-</p>
					<p>tional War Dept...............</p>
					<p>On the subject generally it is said, the South of 1860 had about one-third of
						the property in the Union, and had the South the same proportion now, their
						contribution to meet the national debt would be one thousand millions of
						dollars. We quote:</p>
					<p>"At the present time they have not one-sixth, probably not one-eight, so much
						property as the North; and the taxation upon them, if levied now, to pay the
						debt, would be correspondingly limited. But not for many years to come will
						this debt be paid. The taxes levied upon the South to meet its proportion of
						the current interest of the debt will, in the aggregate, we may safely
						assume, make up the difference; so that in the long run the debt will cost
						the South one thousand millions at least, little or no part of which will go
						to its own people.</p>
					<p>"We have enumerated Southern losses, in consequence of the war, to the amount
						of five thousand and eight hundred millions of dollars, namely: twenty-five
						hundred millions by loss of what was called slave property, nine hundred
						millions by ravages of war, nine hundred millions by loss of staple crops,
						five hundred millions of property sunk in Confederate debt, and one thousand
						millions by what must hereafter be paid by the South to liquidate principal
						and interest of the national debt. This, of course, is a very rough
						estimate. We might have included many other items, involving indirect,
						though not less certain, losses.</p>
					<p>"Seldom have any people paid such a penalty for folly and wickedness. It
						ought to be enough to propitiate the worst enmity. Though perhaps certain of
						the authors of all this calamity have not yet suffered to the extent of
						their deserts, this certainly cannot be said of the great body of the
						Southern people--especially when regard is had to their sacrifice not only
						of property, but of life. So far as they are concerned, none but hearts
						callous to every feeling of humanity could demand the infliction upon them
						of any further punishment."</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has delivered an opinion which is of much
						importance to the holders of loans and bonds issued by various cities,
						boroughs, towns, and counties in the State, and which settles beyond cavil
						the rights of such classes of creditors. The Legislature, by act of April
						25, 1864, authorized such communities to issue bonds and negotiable loans
						for the purpose of paying bounties to encourage volunteering, and to relieve
						their citizens from the burdens of the draft, giving power also to levy
						taxes to pay the principal and interest of such loans. The borough of
						Blairsville having proposed to borrow $5000 for such a purpose, some
						citizens of that place made application to the Common Pleas of Indiana
						county to restrain the borough from proceeding in that negotiation. The
						ground taken in opposition was, that the act was unconstitutional, and that
						the Legislature had no power to pass it. The Court of Indiana county did not
						accept this view, and the injunction was refused. The case was then taken to
						the Supreme Court, where it was twice argued--once in Pittsburg and once at
						Harrisburg.</p>
					<p>The question seems to have been carefully considered by the five judges, and
						at length we have their decision. The Court, by Justice Agnew (Justice Read
						and Strong concurring) decide that the act was constitutional, and that all
						loans negotiated by virtue of its provisions are valid. Chief Justice
						Woodward and Justice Thompson dissented. The matter is of considerable
						interest as some millions of dollars worth of these loans, issued for
						military purposes, are held. The doubt which existed with the Blairsville
						case was yet undetermined exercised a depressing influence upon those
						securities. Now that all objections are removed, they will advance to the
						rate held by other loans.</p>
					<p>The expense of the Government during the past year amount to $1,200,000,000.</p>
					<p>The bogus oil companies which are numerous in the cities, and particularly in
						New York, are at length being unmasked. Warrants were issued on Wednesday
						last for the parties engaged in a swindling concern in New York, called the
						First National Petroleum Company, an institution which had stolen the name
						of a genuine company, recently organized with that title, which, it is
						alleged, received some forty thousand dollars in remittances belonging to
						its namesake. The police found but a single person in the office who claimed
						to be a clerk. The officers of the States Service Petroleum and Mining
						Company, another bogus concern, were before the Police Court on Monday,
						charged with defrauding different persons of large amounts of money. Two of
						the officers were committed to prison. When these swindling institutions are
						all weeded out, the stock of the really good companies will command fair
						prices, and the oil business will become legitimate.</p>
