<b>The 7:30s And The End Of The War</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article heralds the end of the war as the commencement of a period of
                    great prosperity for the nation.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The greatest war of modern history has ended in triumph. The country has
                        demonstrated the vastness of its power. We knew
                        it was great: now all the world knows it. Our
                        neighbors across the water, who said our very greatness was our
                        weakness--that we should never hold together--that we must fall to pieces, and very small pieces at that--none take off their hats and beg to assure us of
                        their "most distinguished consideration." Verily! a young nation that can
                        raise two millions of fighting men and two thousand millions of money, just
                        for the asking, is worthy of being "considered." They told us we could not
                        carry on the war six months without begging for loans in European markets.
                        We did carry on such a war as they never dreamed
                        of; for four years, and never asked for a dollar;
                        and they now wish to buy our bonds at an advance of fifty per cent over last
                        year's prices. Government stocks are quoted as brisk and in demand, and well
                        they may be, for the time will soon come when no more will be offered. The
                        national expenses will soon be down to a peace footing; and, instead of a
                        Treasury budget of nine hundred millions, Secretary McCulloch will ask us
                        for about a third of that sum. And how much easier it will be to raise this
                        in peace than in war! The millions of soldiers who have so long made it a
                        business to destroy life and property will return to pursuits of industry,
                        and the now ravaged fields will whiten with new harvests. Instead of reading
                        every morning that so many miles of railroad have been destroyed, it will be that "so many new avenues of material
                        wealth have been opened." The South itself will be compelled to bear its
                        share of the burden it imposed on the country, and its cotton--so much
                        greater than gold, and still so much less than king--will have no attribute
                        of royalty but what it pays into the revenue. A tax on Southern cotton will
                        be quite as easily collected as on Northern petroleum or manufactures, and
                        besides the article must be had--the world wants it.</p>
                    <p>It would take but a fraction of our property to pay our national debt now;
                        but if we do not pay a dollar of the principle in ten years, that fraction
                        will be reduced one half--by the development of the national resources. We
                        shall doubtless wind up the war and square all accounts with a national debt
                        of less than three thousand millions on about 18 per cent. of the present
                        national wealth; but, according to its rate of increase (127 per cent.) from
                        1850 to 1860--in 1875 this debt will be less than nine per cent. But our
                        ability to pay the national debt needs no demonstration; but as some of us
                        have looked upon the dark side, we may as well have a glance at the
                        sunshine.</p>
                    <p>The national loans will soon be out of the market,--but for a short time the
                        Government will need money to pay off the army and settle up the expenses of
                        the war. Only about two hundred millions more of the second series of the
                        7-30 Loan remain to be taken, and when it is finally withdrawn, there is no
                        doubt that it will rise to a handsome premium, and at the rate it is now
                        going, some time within the next sixty days will see the last of this
                        series. Mr. Jay Cooke, the subscription agent, announced in February "that
                        the first two hundred millions of 7-30s will probably be taken in at par in
                        the U. S. Loan, bearing seven and three-tenths annual interest, and in three
                        years convertible into a 5-20 six per cent gold interest bond should make
                        their preparations accordingly. Many of the financial authorities believe
                        that the Government will be able to fund such portions of its debt, and it
                        may not be ready to pay as it falls due at 1 1/2 per cent.</p>

<b>Historic Facts About The Rights of Suffrage</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article points out that, in contrast to public perceptions, suffrage
                    was not restricted to whites in the early years of the Republic. The
                    constitutions of nine of the original thirteen states, in fact, made "no
                    distinction on account of color" in respect "to 'the qualifications of electors
                    for the numerous branch of the State Legislatures.'"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>By reference to the Constitution of New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
                        New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, formed before the date of
                        the Constitution of the United States, and in force at the period of its
                        adoption, and also to the Constitution of Georgia and Pennsylvania, formed
                        soon after its adoption, it will be found that in respect to "the
                        qualifications of electors for the most numerous branch of the State
                        Legislatures," there was no distinction on account of
                            color in those nine states. Connecticut and Rhode Island, being
                        under the old Royal charters, could have had none. Even South Carolina, by
                        its Constitution of 1776, allowed negroes to vote; but in '78 it restricted
                        the privilege to "every white man," &amp;c. In Delaware, by act of
                        February 3, 1786, emancipated slaves and their issue were debarred "the
                        privilege of voting at elections or being elected." And even this seems,
                        like most of the laws of slavery, a violation of the letter of the
                        Constitution of that state.</p>
                    <p>It is well known among informed men, that the practice of admitting free
                        persons of color to vote, obtained universally at
                        first, under the general qualifications prescribed for electors, among all
                        the original "Old Thirteen." In Virginia, negroes voted, side by side with
                        white men, until 1850! In Louisiana, a few blacks exercised the franchise
                        even later.</p>

<b>James Buchanan</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors call on ex-President Buchanan to explain his actions during the
                    prelude to secession.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are glad to hear from James Buchanan. We have once in a while heard that
                        he was writing a book in vindication of his life; but as yet the prospectus
                        has not appeared before the public. Knowing how sadly his administration
                        needs to be commended to the popular judgement, we have looked with interest
                        for the fruition of the promise; but it comes not. Again we heard of him in
                        a controversy with Gen. Scott, in which he neither did himself uncommon
                        credit. Scott's fidelity was clouded by his inordinate egotism, and
                        Buchanan's special pleading but illy concealed his perfidy to his country in
                        a period of great peril. At another time we heard that he was honored with a
                        notice not to attend the funeral of a once devoted friend--Maj. General
                        Reynolds, who fell a martyr to the Republic Mr. Buchanan endeavored vainly
                        to destroy; but at last we hear from him by a letter to the Tribune.</p>
                    <p>The New York Evening Post in a recent article on
                        the origin of the rebellion, charged that the National Convention of 1856,
                        of which Mr. Buchanan was the nominee for the Presidency, selected the sage
                        of Wheatland as its candidate with the distinct pledge given by his Northern
                        friends, through Judge Black of this State, that the right of secession
                        should be recognized by his administration in the event of a Republican
                        being chosen as his successor. To this Mr. Buchanan replies that Judge Black
                        was not a member of the convention; was not in attendance, and did not make
                        any such "infamous pledge," nor did any other man. Mr. Buchanan is right for
                        once in his life in stating that Judge Jeremiah S. Black made no such
                        speech; but Col. Samuel W. Black, of Pittsburg, did make a speech that would
                        read most oddly just now. We do not think that he meant to give any such
                        pledge. He imagined that the danger of disunion was in the North, and he
                        sealed his conversion with his life's blood when the treason he was warming
                        into life in Cincinnatti confronted him and his country's flag in the field.
                        The error of the Post in attributing the formal pledge to Judge Black, gives
                        Mr. Buchanan an opportunity to rush into the public journals to get a feeble
                        word in defence of his administration; but in his haste to seize a straw in
                        the current of public opinion that is sweeping him to infamy, he evades the
                        material point, the essence of the charge made against him.</p>
                    <p>We wish that Mr. Buchanan had been as candid as he is ardent in defining his
                        relations with the leading traitors while he administered the government. We
                        should be glad to know whether, in his correspondence with Mason, Slidell
                        and others who were then conspiring to overthrow the government whenever
                        they should fail to have an Executive as Mr. Buchanan, he did not before his
                        election assure them that the election of a Republican President, or a
                        sectional President as he would term it, would entirely justify secession.
                        He knew the sentiments of the Cincinnati Convention, and we entreat Mr.
                        Buchanan to say whether his friends in that convention did not there, and
                        hereafter in the contest declare that the election of Mr. Fremont would not
                        only result in secession, but would warrant secession and make it
                        justifiable in history? Did not Mr. Buchanan himself so say to the South in
                        his confidential correspondence? We affirm that he did; that he taught them
                        then the remedy of secession, and was compelled by the cruel task-masters
                        who gave him the Presidency, to violate his own faith to Col. Forney and
                        stain himself with the blackest ingratitude, solely because the traitors who
                        were supporting him demanded it? They feared Col. Forney as an able and
                        independent journalist, and because he would not serve the interests of
                        treason, and he was stricken down at their behest, when Mr. Buchanan was yet
                        green with the garlands of his victory.</p>
                    <p>But the record of his administration is blotted with the complete vindication
                        of the charge. That he was the great parent of treason--the man of all
                        others who nourished it into life and colossal power, is a truth that
                        impartial history must affirm. We will not do him the injustice to assume
                        that he was perfidious only because he loved to betray a Nation that had
                        showered its richest honors upon him; and it is charitable to believe that
                        it was so denominated in the bond, and he tremblingly, hesitatingly
                        fulfilled it. True, he at least, when he was powerless for good, seemed to
                        feel that he owed some fidelity to our common nationality, and the closing
                        days of his administration gave it a shade of loyalty. But for his redeeming
                        record--this oasis on the desert of his treachery, he is indebted to
                        others--not to himself. Will he tell the public why Gen. Cass left his
                        cabinet? We affirm that he resigned because Mr. Buchanan declined to
                        strengthen and defend the forts when the old soldier and patriot of Michigan
                        demanded it. Gen. Cass gave Mr. Buchanan the alternative to discharge his
                        duty as the sworn Executive, or allow him to retire, and he chose the
                        latter. Will he tell the public what he desired to do when Maj. Anderson
                        evacuated Fort Moultre and occupied Sumter? Will he state whether he did not
                        insist upon ordering him back, in obedience, to the demands of traitors,
                        until overruled by his cabinet and more loyal counselors from the North? And
                        last but not least will he give to the world his
                        answer to the rebels who were in Washington as commissioners, to demand the
                        fulfilment of his plighted faith by acknowledging the right of secession? It
                        has never yet been published. It will be the best vindication of the truth
                        of history; and we call upon the ex-President, since he has appealed to the
                        public, to let the people who once delighted to honor him, know just to what
                        extent he is charged with complicity in the treachery of 1860-1 by giving
                        them the text of his answer to the rebel commissioners. We affirm that it
                        conceded the right of secession and denied the power of the Nation to defend
                        its own life. That it does not now stain the record of his administration is
                        due to others more faithful than himself. He would have surrendered
                        everything to treason--the country and its holy cause would have perished by
                        his hand but for the bolder and better hearts which made him totter from his
                        crowning perfidy to the semblance of patriotism. Only when he saw that he
                        would be deserted by every loyal friend and left to the pitiless scorn of a
                        betrayed people, did he take heed to the warning voice of the faithful
                        members of his cabinet. The answer that was finally made to the rebel
                        commissioners owes nothing to Mr. Buchanan but his forced, reluctant
                        sanction, and yet it is to that document he points in his controversy with
                        General Scott as a triumphant vindication of his fidelity. Who wrote it? We
                        beg Mr. Buchanan to inform us, and at the same time to give the world his
                        original answer as prepared by himself. He cannot save his reputation--that
                        is gone beyond redemption. A loyal people who have sacrificed their blood
                        and treasure unsparingly to rescue the Nation from the treason that he made

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A follow-up to a letter that appeared in last week's edition of the
                    Franklin Repository in which the author of the piece, M., expounded on the
                    legitimacy of the death penalty as a form of punishment. In this second
                    installment, M. explains that his words were not motivated by a concern over the
                    proper punishment for the rebels, but were written solely in response to the
                    continued agitation on the part of death penalty opponents who seek to abolish
                    the practice.<br>
