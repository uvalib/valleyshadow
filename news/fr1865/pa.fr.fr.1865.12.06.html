<b>From One Learn All</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Southerners, say the editors, have been "emboldened" by the "kindness"
                    showered upon them since the end of the war. As a result, they have assumed a
                    more arrogant air when dealing with the government. They have made a mockery of
                    the lenient terms offered by the President for re-admission and have undertaken
                    a course of action that "is insulting to the moral sense of the country."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Congress having failed to provide a way whereby the seceded States could
                        return to their places in the Union, President Johnson said to them--nullify
                        your ordinances of secession, repudiate the rebel debt and ratify the
                        amendment to the Constitution; by so doing you will place yourselves in a
                        most favorable attitude to the nation.</p>
                    <p>A decent regard for the honor and safety of the government would not have
                        permitted him to require anything less of them, while simple justice would
                        have warranted him in exacting a great deal more. The fact is, these terms
                        must have been suggested solely by a prudent and patriotic consideration for
                        the future peace and unity of the Republic. They require no indemnity for
                        injuries sustained, nor do they exact any penalty for offences committed.
                        The past is lost sight of and security for the future only is contemplated.</p>
                    <p>Ordinances of secession deny the binding force of the federal compact. This
                        was an open question once, but an unsuccessful rebellion of four years'
                        duration settled it. This decision must be accepted or the history of the
                        last four years might repeat itself; hence these ordinances must be declared
                        null and void. The assumption of any portion of the rebel debt by any of the
                        States would interfere with their contributing to the payment of the
                        national debt, and might seriously impair the national credit; hence this
                        debt must be repudiated. Painful experience has taught us that Slavery is an
                        element of discord, that our government cannot exist half slave and half
                        free; consequently the amendment to the constitution must be adopted. Thus
                        it is evident that in prescribing this action for the seceded States
                        President Johnson had but one object in view, and that was to secure the
                        government against future trouble and difficulty. It would have been well
                        for the South if she had honestly and promptly acceded to these terms. The
                        results of the war were so obvious that she could have done so without
                        sacrificing any of her material interests, or doing violence to her
                        convictions, for Slavery had long since expired, and the amendment simply
                        seals the mouth of the sepulcher, and the doctrine of States' rights, as
                        defined by her, had exploded with the last feeble charge of powder used in
                        the service of her Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>But rather than look at things in this light she perversely groped about in
                        the dark, and stumbled and blundered when she could have walked erect. By
                        her own obstinacy and false pride, which are yet to be repented of, she
                        defeated the generous scheme of the President, and has carried the matter to
                        Congress, where she must expect more justice and less forbearance.</p>
                    <p>We judge of the temper and disposition of the South from the action taken by
                        her different Conventions and Legislatures on [illeg] President's terms of
                        reconstruction. It is to be presumed that they were representative bodies.
                        The work of reconstruction was especially confided to them, and the people
                        seem to be satisfied with the manner in which they performed their duties.</p>
                    <p>The President's terms were submitted to them in good faith, and they were
                        asked to accede to them in order that the work of reorganization might be
                        perfected without delay, and their representation in Congress be secured.
                        Their action has not been uniform, except so far as it is characterized by
                        an arrogant and disloyal spirit. Some have declined to nullify their
                        ordinances of secession, some to repudiate the rebel debt, others to ratify
                        the amendment to the Constitution, just as though their compliance was not a
                        matter of necessity, but of grace. They are evidently very anxious to have
                        their State governments reorganized, but it is equally clear that they are
                        planning and scheming to have it done at the smallest possible cost.</p>
                    <p>There has been a time since the close of the war when they would have gladly
                        accepted any terms the government might have offered. They were supplicants
                        then, and were trembling in anticipation of the vengeance of an outraged
                        government. But things have changed since, and emboldened by our kindness,
                        they now demand as a right what they would then have sued for as a favor.
                        They have become crafty as well as bold. They practice chicanery and fraud,
                        and imagine us too stupid to detect it. We doubt if a single State has
                        accepted in good faith a single one of the President's terms, that is,
                        accepted it with an honest purpose to abide by it in the future, both in
                        spirit and in letter. There is not one of them but professes to have
                        accepted at least one of these terms, and yet when their action is looked
                        into, it appears that what they call acceptance amounts to a virtual
                        repudiation. Take South Carolina for instance, and consider her course in
                        regard to the amendment to the Constitution. She is neither better nor worse
                        than any of the others, and can fairly be used as an example. From this one,
                        learn all; It was long before she would believe that the adoption of the
                        amendment was necessary to her reorganization. She knew she was in a bad
                        way, but seemed to think that she could recover without taking this pill
                        that the President had prepared for her. She learned better in the course of
                        time and at length professed herself willing to swallow it. Instead however
                        of taking it as it was prepared she coated it over with sugar. Thus coated,
                        it went down and South Carolina fondly imagined that her ruse had been
                        successful, and that her recovery was certain. But it turned out that the
                        coating destroyed the virtue of the pill, and that she was injured rather
                        than benefitted by it. South Carolina professed not to object to the
                        amendment, because it would drive Slavery [illeg] system, but because it
                        would give to Congress the right to legislate for the freedmen. The
                        President assured her, on what grounds we can't say, that this provision
                        instead of enlarging the powers of Congress in this respect, restricted
                        them. So having fixed by her own legislation the status of the freedmen, she
                        adopts the amendment and asks to be rewarded for it. Now the amendment to
                        the Constitution provides for the extinction of Slavery. South Carolina
                        ratified it, but turns right around and adopts a Slave Code which
                        establishes a system of servitude as infamous and cruel as that which she
                        has abolished. Her course is insulting to the moral sense of the country.
                        Her adoption of the amendment is a sham; it is a trick upon the government
                        and a fraud upon the freedmen.</p>
                    <p>No wonder the pill has no virtue. It will be a long time before the American
                        people will assent to such a reconstruction as this. They demand a fair and
                        honest reconstruction and reject all such rotten material as this that South
                        Carolina offers. They want a fabric large enough to accommodate all men
                        without reference to color, and strong enough to hold them securely. They
                        have committed the supervision of the work to Congress and we doubt not it
                        will be finished acceptably.</p>

<b>Mock Sympathy</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors question the legitimacy of the comments that recently appeared
                    in the pages of the Patriot and Union, which expressed concern over the welfare
                    of the former slaves. According to the Democratic journal's claims, northern and
                    foreign capitalists are scheming to exploit blacks in the South. Life for the
                    freedmen and women, it asserts, was far superior under slavery than it will be
                    in the new order, a suggestion ridiculed by the Repository editors, who assure
                    readers that blacks will quickly adapt to the new conditions.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>That model paper, the Patriot and Union, regularly
                        reproduced through the columns of the Spirit, is
                        much exercised about the designs of Northern and foreign capitalists against
                        the peace and well being of the negro. It charges these capitalists with
                        desiring to share with Southern slaveholders, the solid advantages of negro
                        labor, and terms it a dishonorable project. Its bowels of compassion yearn
                        largely with sympathy for the poor negro himself. He is now to have not one,
                        but many masters. The humane attentions he formerly received of good food,
                        first class medical attendance, not too much work, and a careful scrutiny of
                        his mental condition, are now to be lost to him forever--as a freeman he is
                        to serve those who have no sympathy for him nor interest in his welfare or
                        longevity. In short he is still to be a hewer of wood and a drawer of water,
                        and may well ask what has he gained by the war for the African and his race.</p>
                    <p>The stupidity which could suggest such a question as this is only equalled by
                        the unparalleled impudence which at this late day, would insult the
                        intelligence of our people by claiming for the condition of slavery a
                        character for beneficence and humanity, superior to that of freedom. A base
                        assumption which the southern people are themselves repudiating as State
                        after State adopts the Constitutional amendment, and which is now only
                        advocated and defended by the toadies and dirt-eaters of the North.</p>
                    <p>We are however heartily glad that the Negro can give in one word an answer to
                        this question, which will be satisfactory to himself, to civilization, and
                        to christianity, and which will effectually reply to and silence the mock
                        sympathy manufactured by the Patriot and Union
                        and kindred papers in his behalf. That word is [illeg] for the Union, or as
                        copperheads love to call it, the "war for the African and his race," has
                        given the African freedom, and in giving him that has given him everything.
                        It is true he has not immediately realized all the fruits of freedom, but he
                        has now the same opportunity as the white man to work out his destiny
                        untrammeled and unshackled. If he is still to be a hewer of wood and a
                        drawer of water, he has the glorious privilege of every white man, of
                        choosing for whom he will work, when he will work, and how hard he will
                        work, and of receiving for his own comfort the wages he has earned by the
                        sweat of his brow. If those for whom he works have no sympathy for him or
                        regard for his comfort, he is not compelled to stay a privilege it will
                        hardly be contended he possessed under the old regime. Being thus to all
                        intents and purposes his own master, it is hardly possible he will fail in
                        those humane attentions to himself, which were so generously bestowed by his
                        former master, and the loss of which are so feelingly deplored by our
                        Copperhead friends. In all things it is highly probable, having the money in
                        his pocket for his labor, he would act very much like a white man and not
                        deny himself anything it was within his means to provide, except perhaps
                        that careful moral scrutiny which in the good old
                        days it was the pleasure as well as the duty of every master to furnish to
                        his slave. He will probably neglect the moral tone of those laws, now alas
                        no longer binding, which made it a penal offence to teach a slave to read or
                        write, and made him ignorant and degraded as a brute, with but little more
                        knowledge of the here or hereafter. It would be hardly safe for the master
                        now to exercise the beautiful morality which prostituted his female slaves
                        at will to his lusts, and which beside was of profitable morality to his
                        pocket. The loss of this careful moral scrutiny the negro may regret, but we
                        hardly think he will. On the contrary, we think, he looks back and regrets
                        nothing in the bondage which oppressed him, however humane and beneficent it
                        may have been in the estimation of our Copperhead brethren. Nor does he look
                        to them now for sympathy or encouragement in his new condition. All he asks
                        now that they stand by, and let him, a free man, work out his own salvation,
                        without let or hindrance.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Northern and foreign capitalists engaging in great enterprises
                        in the South and employing largely both capital and labor, even if it is
                        negro, we confess we cannot see anything discreditable or dishonorable in
                        the matter. Judging from the condition of the South and the tone of southern
                        papers it is just what is needed. We say God speed to all the energy and
                        enterprise that capital can pour into the South. It is that which will give
                        employment to both white and black, and so restore prosperity to a part of
                        our land which in progress is now 100 years behind us, and but for the curse
                        of slavery would have been equal with us. It is that which will build school
                        houses and churches, spread learning and piety, and finally give to the
                        South that prosperity which we of the North enjoy.</p>
