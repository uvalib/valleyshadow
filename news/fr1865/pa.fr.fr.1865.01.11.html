                    in which he discusses the good finances of the state; recruiting for the Union
                    army; revision of the act providing the vote to soldiers; abuse and fraud of the
                    bounty system; and the damage by rebels in Bedford, Fulton, Cumberland, York,

<b>The Bedford Legislative Contest</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses B. F. Meyers, the editor of the Bedford Gazette, who participated
                    in the recent Bedford legislative contest. The author argues that Meyers
                    fraudulently attempted to take office with false certifications of election
                    returns. The Gazette accuses the Repository of personally attacking Meyers. The
                    editor responds that he only criticized Meyers's illegal actions.<br>

<b>Gen. Hancock's New Corps</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Supports the call for volunteers for the new corps raised by Gen. Hancock.
                    The author raises the fear that the state will not provide monetary support for
                    widows, dependent children, and orphans since Hancock's corps will not be a
                    Pennsylvania regiment. Gov. Curtin refers the matter to the legislature because
                    state law must be modified to extend benefits to Pennsylvanians mustered into
                    Gen. Hancock's corps.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Defends the practice of offering an additional $200 bounty to encourage
                    volunteers and avoid a draft. The author favors increased taxation to pay for
                    this higher bounty.<br>

                    legislature will consider a change of venue plea for the trial. Gowalt, the
                    defendant, is the brother of Rev. Luther Gotwalt, formerly of Greencastle,
                    Franklin County.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. Luther A. Gotwalt)</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Richmond Examiner favors an alliance with France or England to secure
                    the independence of the Confederacy on the condition of abolishing slavery. The
                    Examiner believes that France or England would "favorably" receive the

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Examiner</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The Richmond Examiner, the official organ of Jeff. Davis, recently
                    published a lengthy editorial reviewing the position of affairs in rebeldom. It
                    states the exhausted conditions of the traitors with a degree of frankness
                    unusual in rebel journals, and concludes by proposing to form an alliance with
                    France and England to secure their independence by abolishing Slavery. The
                    article is attributed by the Richmond Sentinel to Jeff. Davis himself. The

                    respected young lady" of Gettysburg named Walters accused Rev. Washington V.
                    Gotwalt of fornication and bastardy. As a Republican with Democratic accusers in
                    a county dominated by Democrats, Gotwalt requests the legislature to order a
                    change of venue. "Horace" agrees that Gotwalt can not receive a fair trial in
