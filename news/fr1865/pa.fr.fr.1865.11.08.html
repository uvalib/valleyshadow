<b>An Hour With Andrew Johnson</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A synopsis of A. K. McClure's interview with President Johnson. McClure,
                    the chief editor of the Repository, initially supported Johnson's candidacy for
                    Vice-President but admits to having grave reservations about his choice since
                    the nominating convention in Baltimore in 1864. The two men discussed a number
                    of topics, including Johnson's view on reconstruction, the proposed trial of
                    Jeff Davis, and the merits of confiscation.<br>

                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin
                        Repository.<br> Washington, October 31, 1865.</p>
                    <p>I was of those, in a humble way, who fashioned Andrew Johnson into a Vice
                        President at Baltimore--having publicly supported his nomination before the
                        meeting of the Convention and voted for him in that body. I have since then
                        had occasion to complain of my own work, and have never after the
                        inauguration, been free from grave apprehensions as to the wisdom of that
                        choice. Differing with most men who besiege the Executive department in this
                        very important particular, that the administration has no [illeg] I aspire
                        to, I may differ with most of them also alike in the frankness with which I
                        counsel, when invited to do so, and in the convictions which result from
                        contact with rulers.</p>
                    <p>I found myself here on Friday for the first time since February last, and
                        during the afternoon of the same day, called at the White House to see
                        President Johnson. I found the halls, the ante-chamber and all other
                        available spaces around the Executive room, crowded with a motley mass of
                        men, with an anxious female face here and there giving variety to the
                        scene--all waiting, and some from day to day, to gain an interview with the
                        President and plead for restoration of citizenship and property. Soon the
                        door opened and a genteel lady emerged from the President's room with a
                        large official envelope clutched nervously in her hand, and a benignity of
                        countenance that told more plainly than words that another citizen had been
                        born again to the Republic. Soon after another and then another came with
                        like trophies of success, and as each one passed out the mass would sway
                        toward the door to catch the name of the next one called. In a little time I
                        gained admission and had my first interview with Andrew Johnson as
                        President.</p>
                    <p>There are few men who could make a more favorable impression upon a stranger
                        on first acquaintance than the President. He differs from Mr. Lincoln in
                        most external characteristics, and in many contrasts favorably. He lacks Mr.
                        Lincoln's jolly humor; improves upon his ungainly ways; is vastly more
                        diplomatic, and wears a uniform and quiet dignity that would have been
                        shockingly out of place in his lamented predecessor, but which well becomes
                        the Chief Executive of a great Nation. He is about five feet ten in height,
                        rather stoutly and symmetrically built, has long hair well silvered by the
                        frosts of time, rather a cold grey eye that looks as if in its calmest
                        glances there slumbers behind it quite enough to quicken it; a finely
                        chiseled Roman face, usually sad in expression, at times relieved by a
                        genial smile, and in manner and dress serenely plain and unaffected. Such
                        is, in brief, a portrait of Andrew Johnson, but two years ago the despised,
                        the reviled of traitors: the man upon whose head fell their fiercest
                        denunciations and against whom were hurled their keenest and deadliest
                        shafts, and now the President of the United States with his foes at his feet
                        supplicating his pardon, and charged with the highest duties and
                        responsibilities ever imposed on mortal man.</p>
                    <p>He meets the visitor cordially, and speaks in the softest tone and in well
                        measured sentences. There was little formality--the usual greetings and
                        thence we passed to questions of graver moment. However reticent he may be
                        on some issues, he seems to have no reserve as to the policy he conceives to
                        be the true one to bring back the insurgent States. He discussed the
                        position of those States and their people with great interest and occasional
                        warmth, and with a frankness that left no doubt as to his purpose. He holds
                        that they were never out of the Union; that secession, however accomplished
                        as a fact, cannot be accomplished in law, that the supreme authority of the
                        government in those States was not overthrown by rebellion, but simply in
                        abeyance, and of course it logically follows his premises that, since
                        rebellion has ceased, the States resume their proper place in the Union and
                        restoration is accomplished. This, in brief, was the stand point from which
                        the President discussed the question of reconstruction for more than an
                        hour, and answered suggestive objections at times with an earnestness that
                        demonstrated how ardently he is working to give success to his policy. I
                        could not but remind him that his theory stripped all traitors of the
                        protection they might claim as public enemies; that it would stamp as guilty
                        of treason within the law every man who aided the rebellion, and of
                        necessity demand at his hands commensurate punishment for what he must hold
                        as unmitigated crime--as appalling murder and desolation for which there is
                        no extenuation to be plead. "You have," I added, "given us on every hand the
                        Nation's monuments of mercy--where will be its monuments of Justice? Davis
                        is a proclaimed assassin, as well as traitor--his agents have died, another
                        (Werze) will follow--how are the principals to atone to a people doubly
                        bereaved in their homes and in their chief sanctuary of power?" To this the
                        President answered with much animation that the measure of, and the time
                        for, atonement were yet for the future to determine. I shall not soon forget
                        the emphasis with which he declared that the South must come back and be a
                        part of us, and "it must come," he added, "with all its manhood--I don't
                        want it to come eviscerated of its manhood!" To this proposition abstractly
                        there could be no objection made. We want the South with all its manhood,
                        which I would conceive to be the Southern people with their treason
                        abandoned and their crimes punished--not punished revengefully; not in
                        imitation of the Guillotine of France or the Inquisition of Spain; but by
                        making the leaders who conspired to overthrow the government, strangers to
                        its honors and its citizenship and thus through life the monuments of the
                        power, the justice and the magnanimity of the mightiest nation of the earth.
                        The President said that such may be the measure
                        of punishment; that he had pardoned but few who would come under such a
                        rule; that there are exceptions to all rules, and there were both civil
                        functionaries and army officers who might be pardoned with propriety. He
                        said that he had not yet gone as far in his amnesty, either general or
                        special, as Mr. Lincoln proposed. He explained what is not generally known,
                        that his pardons are mainly of business men, many of whom were Union men,
                        who must have pardons to enable them to sell or mortgage their lands, or to
                        get credit in their business operations; and added that he had not yet
                        reached the consideration of such cases as Lee, Stephens, Longstreet,
                        Beauregard and others of that class.</p>
                    <p>He spoke freely of the proposed trial of Davis, and said that as yet the
                        government had not taken any steps in the matter. If he is to be tried in
                        Richmond, the trial must necessarily be postponed until the civil authority
                        is fully restored, and then it will be a question for consideration under
                        the condition of affairs which may at that time exist. As Virginia is still
                        practically under martial law, certainly wholly under military rule, I judge
                        that many moons may wax and wane before we can have a great State trial. I
                        do not question the wisdom of this delay, for it is certainly better for the
                        government to avoid the danger of defeat in attempting to convict of
                        constructive treason in Washington, than to force a trial which might afford
                        a technical escape for Davis and leave the great questions undetermined. If
                        I were going guess on the subject, I would say that Davis is more likely to
                        be paroled during the next year than to be tried, and if he is ever hanged,
                        he must do it himself.</p>
                    <p>The President is clearly adverse to confiscation and that question is
                        practically settled. Whatever might be the views of Congress, confiscation
                        is not possible with an Executive determinedly hostile to it and with the
                        pardoning power in his hands. I infer however, that on this point Congress
                        will harmonize with the Executive, as a number of even the radical leaders,
                        such as Greeley and Sumner, openly oppose it. If our credit can be sustained
                        otherwise I am content. Five years hence we shall be wiser on that point
                        than now.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the President will wield all his power to effect the admission
                        of the representatives of the rebellious States into Congress during the
                        next session. The Senate being organized the question cannot come up there
                        until it is brought up in order; but there will be a strong pressure to
                        force the admission of the Southern members by placing their names on the
                        roll when the House meets. This Mr. McPherson will not do, and on all votes
                        of instructions he will call only those who are returned from States clearly
                        entitled to representation. The law forbids him to do otherwise, and he will
                        be faithful to it. The question of their admission will then agitate the
                        House, and I fear make a sad breach between the President and Congress. The
                        South is encouraged by the position of the administration to be importunate
                        in its demand for admission, and it is not improbable that it will in the
                        end be admitted. I have seldom seen Congress struggle against power and hold
                        out to the end. The history of such conflicts is always dotted with frail
                        ones who fall by the way. I have ever felt that the revolted States should
                        take no part in the government they vainly sought to destroy until all
                        issues arising from the war, and all its logical results, should be settled
                        by faithful men. To the victors, not to the vanquished--to the friends, not
                        to the foes of the government does this duty belong, and if it shall be
                        otherwise, there are many who will tremble for the safety of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>On the future of the freedmen the President talks well. He displays more
                        sense than sentiment on the question and means to solve the problem fairly
                        as demanded by civilization and humanity. Of their ability to win a position
                        that will enable them to be incorporated into our system of government as
                        citizens, he is not eminently hopeful, but feels that it must be fairly
                        tried with an open field for the negro. That failing, he looks upon
                        colonization as the only alternative.</p>
                    <p>It would be foolish to disguise the fact that the President, both by word and
                        deed, disclaims the position of a partizan Executive, and that he is not
                        insensible to the flattering approval of his administration by the
                        Democratic party. I do not mean by this that he is not wholly in sympathy
                        and fellowship with them; but I do mean that he is not wholly in sympathy
                        against them; and he will, I feel warranted in saying, adhere to the
                        political fortunes of the Southern States without regard to political
                        consequences. This may or may not sever him from the party that sustained
                        and cherished him in the darkest days through which he passed, and that won
                        him the highest honors of the Nation through a flood of obloquy; but if it
                        does, I infer that he will accept the situation. He evidently means above
                        all other things, to compass the admission of the Southern members and the
                        complete restoration to power of those States, and if Massachusetts and
                        South Carolina can strike hands over the same administration, then will we
                        have a faithful President and a harmonious country. If not--I leave the
                        future to tell the story. Where in all this record soon to be made up the
                        Nation shall see that "treason is the greatest of crimes and must be
                        punished," is not to my mind apparent.<br> A. K. V.</p>

                        members voted, and we look for a return in a very few days that will reverse

                        the returns. He started North by Cairo, while the Battery returned by water,

                        see no reason to doubt it--Mr. McConaughy is fairly elected as the full
                        return will demonstrate, and on a contest he will be promptly given Mr.
                        Duncan's place. If, however, the army vote should disappoint us, we are
                        assured that not less than 80 deserters voted for Mr. Duncan in the district
                        in violation of the act of Congress, and on that ground the Senate would
                        certainly eject Mr. Duncan in a contest.</p>
                    <p>Looking over the whole case as it now presents itself, we feel safe in saying
                        that Mr. McConaughy will be our next Senator.</p>
