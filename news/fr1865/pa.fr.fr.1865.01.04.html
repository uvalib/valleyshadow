<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The inevitable tendency of war is to lessen sanctity for human life, and
                        especially is it so in civil war waged with wanton ferocity on the part of
                        the insurgents. Not alone in the terrible sacrifices of the sanguinary field
                        is the sad cost of war to be estimated. Its tendency is ever to
                        demoralization; to lawlessness; to disregard of treasure; to waste of life,
                        and to weaken the great moral sentiments on which the whole fabric of social
                        order is reared. Against this appalling evil this journal has consistently
                        and earnestly raised its voice. It has braved the heated prejudices of its
                        party in denouncing violence because of real or imaginary disloyalty in our
                        midst, and it has, with steadfast, unfaltering faith in the supremacy of
                        law, appealed to every citizen to look above the passions of the day to the
                        common welfare of a free people.</p>
                    <p>Five years ago a murder in our midst excited the liveliest concern on the
                        part of our entire population. However humble the victim or the criminal,
                        the public mind was startled, and followed the often tedious course of
                        justice with unabated interest until the majesty of the law was fully
                        vindicated. Our court room would be crowded to overflowing when a citizen
                        was charged with the grave crime of taking the life of one of his fellows,
                        and had justice failed to vindicate its high prerogatives, there would have
                        been a sad unrest deeply seated among the people, and the homicide would
                        have escaped the penalty of the law only to suffer a popular condemnation
                        scarcely less terrible than death. Every citizen felt that he had his full
                        share of responsibility in maintaining the majesty of the laws, and these
                        sacred obligations were taught on every hand as the first civil duty of the
                        citizen.</p>
                    <p>Let us now glance for a moment at the fearful change a few years of war has
                        wrought in our midst, and there are few dispassionate men who will not be
                        startled at the wide-spread disregard of law that has insensibly grown up
                        amongst us. On the second Tuesday of October, 1863, three men met death by
                        violence in this county. An altercation in Waynesboro' resulted in the
                        instant death of Mr. Unger at the hands of a soldier; Mr. Coble, one of the
                        judges of election of Hamilton was shot dead the same evening when passing
                        his home in a peaceable manner by a soldier who fired upon one of his
                        companions; and a soldier of the same squad was shot by accident the same
                        night and mortally wounded. Thus the election day of 1863 gave us three
                        violent deaths in Franklin county--two of whom were respected citizens and
                        the other an unoffending soldier. During the last summer a soldier was found
                        on the premises of Mr. Gabby brutally murdered, and it is not doubted that
                        it was a most deliberate and atrocious murder to facilitate a robbery. But a
                        short time ago Mr. Sweitzer, one of our most worthy citizens, was cruelly
                        murdered near his own door; and it is only a few weeks since Lieut.
                        Underhill, in command of this post, deliberately shot down and killed one of
                        his own men and fired at others because they tried to get off to their
                        quarters without arrest. In all these cases there was no punishment. Six
                        murders, or what in times of peace and order would be so held, have been
                        committed in our county within fifteen months, and the law has in no
                        instance vindicated its power by the punishment of the criminals. The man
                        who killed Mr. Unger, of Waynesboro, was acquitted on technical grounds; the
                        killing of Mr. Coble, of Hamilton, and the soldier the same night, were held
                        to be accidental, and the author or authors were unknown; the supposed
                        murderer of the unknown soldier found on Mr. Gabby's farm was discharged
                        because the witnesses on the part of the prosecution could not be procured;
                        the person who killed Mr. Sweitzer could not be identified, although we
                        believe that an earnest effort was made to do so, and a military court of
                        inquiry acquitted Lieut. Underhill of the murder of Mr. Redmon, and he has
                        since been promoted by Gov. Seymour to a Captaincy and discharged from
                        arrest.</p>
                    <p>We submit that the time has come for every citizen, and also every soldier,
                        to set his face like flint against unpunished crime. Unless this current of
                        murder is arrested by the people arousing to the necessity of a rigid
                        enforcement of the laws, there will be no safety to person or property in
                        our midst. If it be lawful for a soldier to shoot when, where and at whom a
                        real or imaginary offence seems in his judgment to warrant, then must the
                        innocent fall and the perpetrators go unwhipped of justice, until officers
                        and soldiers weary of such bloody amusement. As thing now stand, there is
                        every invitation that passive submission can give to officers and soldiers
                        to resent every wrong by the employment of their deadly weapons, and if they
                        kill, either the innocent or those they regard as guilty, there is no
                        redress. Military tribunals take possession of the criminals in such cases,
                        and it would seem that if any sort of a plausible pretext can be found for
                        acquittal, there is no punishment.</p>
                    <p>The case of Lieut. Underhill we regarded as one most clearly demanding the
                        severest punishment; and being himself an officer of education, of
                        respectable rank and holding an important trust as post commander, his
                        conviction and just sentence would have been most salutary in its influence
                        upon the great public interests whose peril we so seriously deplore. He
                        entered a house where some of his men were without proper leave. They,
                        desiring to get to their quarters and avoid arrest, fled when he entered,
                        and because they refused to stop when he ordered them to do so, he fired
                        four times after them, two balls entering Mr. Redmon, who staggered back
                        into his house and died with a sad message to his wife upon his lips, in
                        presence of the author of the fatal deed. Can it be pretended that such
                        reckless destruction of life is justifiable or even excusable by the laws of
                        war? If so, then had any citizen received Lieut. Underhill's balls, fired at
                        random in the dark and in a densely populated part of the town, there could
                        have been no punishment. If the act was lawful, its consequences could not
                        impose a penalty. But with due deference to the members of the court of
                        inquiry--not one of whose names have we ever heard--we insist that the act
                        was a gross infraction of the regulations, an irreparable wrong to society
                        and a flagrant violation of moral and civil right. He went in search of the
                        absented men of his command without a patrol, as was his duty, and he did
                        not seek, nor was he prepared, to arrest them and return them under guard.
                        On the contrary he broke in upon them without his side-arms--the usual mark
                        of office to command their obedience, and when they attempted to return to
                        their camp and escape the penalty of arrest, he had no more right to fire
                        upon them than he had to shoot at any citizen on the streets. They were not
                        seeking to desert, nor to get away from duty; but on the contrary were, as
                        was clearly proven on the inquiry, seeking to get to their quarters, where
                        he could have arrested and punished them for absence without leave at his
                        leisure; and his firing upon them and the killing of Mr. Redmon was simply a
                        wanton, deliberate murder. There was no provocation other than that they
                        took an irregular way to return to their quarters, just as he took an
                        irregular way to make them do so, and he soothed the wounded pride of a
                        little unbalanced authority in the blood of a soldier--a husband and a
                        father. General Scott, when Commander-in-chief of the army, did not admit
                        that even in a case of mutiny, or conduct tending to this great crime, it
                        was justifiable for an officer to shoot down the leader or leaders, until
                        the order for arrest has been made and failed; but a Lieutenant assumes to
                        shoot his men down as if they were oxen because they attempt to return to
                        their duty in an irregular way regardless of an irregular order, and Gov.
                        Seymour signalizes his appreciation of his gallantry by promoting him to a
                        captaincy.</p>
                    <p>We believe that Capt. Underhill has merits as a soldier, but we cannot
                        concede that human life shall be made the mere toy of the passions and pride
                        of petty officials; and that lawlessness shall become rife in our midst by
                        reason of the presence of those whose especial duty it is to enforce the
                        laws. The time has come for thorough reform in this matter, and we appeal to
                        those holding military authority to make common cause with every good
                        citizen to stay the appalling tide of murder that has recently stained the
                        annals of justice in our county.</p>

                    <p>The year 1864 has closed, most auspiciously for the Union cause. In every
                        quarter our armies are triumphant. General Sherman has fitly concluded his
                        grand march of three hundred miles through the enemy's country, by the
                        capture of Savannah. The fruits of this great expedition are immense. A
                        chief city captured and with it 33,000 bales of cotton, valued at 20 odd
                        millions of dollars, 150 guns, 13 locomotives and 190 cars. A rebel iron
                        clad fleet with numerous other vessels destroyed in order to prevent their
                        falling into our hands. An important point gained for future operations,
                        either against Charleston or the interior of Georgia and the network of
                        railroads that bind the Confederacy together. 200 miles of those railroads
                        already damaged and destroyed to an extent that will require such an
                        expenditure of labor and material as the rebels will scarce be able to
                        supply. Lastly, but not least, Gen. Sherman has demonstrated what has often
                        been asserted and stoutly denied that the Confederacy is a shell. That
                        within all is weakness, and the only opposition to be met with, if
                        opposition it can be called, is that offered by old men and boys, gleanings
                        from the "cradle and the grave." Nor since his arrival at Savannah has
                        Sherman been idle. It is said he has already moved against Augusta, an
                        important town on the Savannah river, at the head of navigation, some 70
                        miles above the city of Savannah. At this place he threatens Charleston in
                        the rear, and holds the railroad connecting it with Georgia and the
                        Confederacy West. It is also said he has organized an expedition for the
                        release of such of our men held as prisoners in Georgia as can be reached.
                        With Sherman the good work goes bravely on, and to him we may safely leave
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In Tennessee the gallant Thomas is driving the enemy to the wall. Three weeks
                        ago Hood was investing Nashville with an army of 40,000 men, with which he
                        proudly boasted he would drive Thomas and his gallant men beyond the Ohio
                        river, and would invade the North and spread desolation there. But man
                        proposes and God disposes. On the 15th of last month Thomas attacked Hood in
                        his intrenchments, and after a desperate struggle of two days, defeated and
                        drove him in disastrous rout with the loss of sixty-eight pieces of
                        artillery, nearly all his wagon trains, and one-third of his army killed,
                        wounded and captured, including eighteen generals. Nor has Hood yet escaped.
                        At the last accounts he was seeking to cross the Tennssee [sic] river, but
                        was prevented by the depth of the water, and Thomas was rapidly closing in
                        on him with every prospect of capturing and destroying the balance of his
                        army. Success to which enterprise is our hearty prayer.</p>
                    <p>Within the last two weeks Breckinridge, who came to deliver East Tennessee
                        and invade Kentucky, has been soundly whipped and driven into North Carolina
                        with loss of artillery and many of his men. Our forces, under the command of
                        Stoneman and Burbridge, then proceeded leisurely to destroy the salt and
                        lead works in south-western Virginia, also all the bridges and culverts for
                        many miles on the railroad leading to Lynchburg. Altogether, property of
                        great value to the enemy, to the amount of $20,000,000 was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>In Alabama the greatest consternation now prevails among the rebels. The
                        Governor of the State has called out the militia to resist the march of Gen.
                        Davidson, who he alleges is marching on Mobile. We know that Gen. Davidson
                        has gone on an expedition, but where we know not. We hope, however, that the
                        Governor of Alabama is correct, and that Gen. Davidson may be enabled to
                        emulate the munificence of Gen. Sherman and give to the Nation for a New
                        Year's gift the city of Mobile.</p>
                    <p>The only place where success seems doubtful is at Wilmington, North Carolina.
                        But the brave Admiral Porter still keeps pounding away, and even if his
                        fleet should not be able to reduce the place now, Sherman will settle the
                        question as he marches up the coast in the next few months, to join Grant.
                        In the meantime Grant sits calmly before Petersburg holding Lee to his place
                        with a strong hand, and waiting only until he shall be joined by the new
                        levies and the veterans of Sherman, to complete his great work and end the
                        rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Our political sky is brightening fast. Wherever our flag is advanced its
                        brave defenders take no step backwards. During the last year the rebels have
                        continually lost ground. They have been driven from the banks of the
                        Rappahannock, from the Valley of Virginia, from the States of West Virginia,
                        Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri. Sherman has marched through their
                        Confederacy from one end to the other. With the exception of Lee's, they
                        have no army left worthy of the name. Their chief cities are in our hands
                        and three-fourths of their territory. Their iron-clad fleet has ceased to
                        exist, and of all the fleet pirates that infested the seas one year ago,
                        destroying our commerce, but one is heard of now--the Tallahassee. Their
                        people in many parts of the Confederacy are actually suffering for the
                        commonest necessaries of life. They despair of their cause, and faint
                        whispers of peace begin to be heard. Disaffection begins to raise its head,
                        and soon a rebellion within a rebellion will be beheld. On the other hand,
                        the late verdict of the people that the war must go on until the supremacy
                        of the Government is established has made the Government stronger than ever
                        before, and has encouraged us and discouraged our enemies. All that we
                        require is to persevere a little longer, to support the government
                        cheerfully and liberally, to allow no political feeling to divide us as a
                        people but to unite in all things for a firm prosecution of the war. If we
                        shall do this the next New Year may find us as we were but lately, a
                        prosperous and powerful people.</p>
