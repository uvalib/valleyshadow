<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>During Lincoln's first term in office, he made numerous changes to his
                    cabinet. Yet, the editors maintain, little attention was focused on the motives
                    behind his decisions. Since Lincoln's death, however, the "secrets of the inner
                    workings of the administration" have begun to leak out "in various shapes."<br>

                    all men who seek to protect their families from potential disaster. Still, the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Insurance is a thoroughly mastered science. It is reduced to a mathematical
                        certainty how many buildings will be burned in a given number of years; at
                        what age sound men and women will die; what number of travelers will be
                        killed and maimed out of every thousand, and how many days, weeks and months
                        hearty people must devote to sickness or curing broken limbs or bruises from
                        accidents. True, they cannot calculate just when any particular individual
                        will die, or take sick, or suffer a fracture of the leg, or when any
                        particular house or barn will take fire; but it is ascertained to a
                        reasonable certainty the average life of healthy men and women; the average
                        number of accidents inflicted upon a thousand travelers, and the average per
                        centage of property destroyed by fire. Years of patient toil have been
                        devoted to research on these points, and the result is that any soundly
                        established and judiciously managed Insurance company cannot but make money
                        unless it fails in securing adequate patronage, or meets with some most
                        uncommon misfortune before it has attained a good footing.</p>
                    <p>While the great science of Insurance has been thoroughly mastered by men who
                        have devoted their energies to the establishment of profitable Insurance
                        companies, the wisdom, indeed the necessity of insurance is very far from
                        being properly appreciated by the people generally. Most persons have
                        learned that when they have erected good houses, barns and places of
                        business, it is but the part of wisdom to protect themselves from total loss
                        by insuring them in one or more companies; but beyond that the question of
                        insurance is as yet in its infancy. The time is past when men are entitled
                        to sympathy who suffer serious loss by fire because they have, from
                        parsimony or neglect, failed to effect insurances; and the principle is a
                        correct one. There is no excuse whatever for the neglect to insure property
                        when it can be done without fear of swindling almost at their doors. Any one
                        who can afford to build can well afford to insure, and those who can barely
                        afford to build, cannot afford not to insure, for
                        the reason that in case of loss by fire, they cannot replace that which they
                        have lost, while if insured, they can rebuild and none feel the loss
                        materially.</p>
                    <p>But insurance is steadily ramifying into every channel that opens the way to
                        afford protection against accident or the loss of the source of living by
                        death. Each year life insurance is widening its sphere of usefulness until
                        it is now very generally adopted by judicious business men. One-half of the
                        active men in Chambersburg who have families have their lives insured. We
                        know of two of our citizens who have each an insurance of thirty thousand
                        dollars on his life, and there are very many who have ten, five, and as low
                        as one thousand to protect their families from want in case of their death.
                        It is regarded by well informed business men as the best investment that can
                        be made. We have well-established companies--such as the American, the Penn,
                        and the Girard, each of which have agents here,--which have stood all the
                        financial convulsions of the last twenty years without impairing their
                        credit, and it is a well ascertained fact, that unless their assets are
                        stolen, they must not only remain solvent but increase in wealth for an
                        indefinite period. Insurances can be taken in every conceivable way. You can
                        insure your own or any other's life--can insure in favor of your own estate
                        or in favor of your wife, child, creditor or any one else; and you can pay
                        the whole in ten years; pay semi-annually, or take a non-forfeiture policy,
                        which will remain good for any proportion of the policy that is paid for
                        even if the payments are discontinued. By life insurance every family can be
                        made secure against want. Two-thirds of the families in every community
                        depend wholly or measurably upon the efforts of the head of the family for
                        support, and suffer either absolute want or grievous curtailment of the
                        comforts of life when the avenging angel strikes at the father and husband.
                        We know of hundreds of widows and orphans who have experienced sad changes
                        in life because of the failure of their natural protector to resort to life
                        insurance; and we know of a few whose sole dependence now is upon the income
                        derived from the money received on a life insurance policy. There are few
                        industrious and thrifty men who cannot afford to set apart a portion of
                        their income to provide a certain revenue for their families in case of
                        death; and we commend the subject to every careful and affectionate parent
                        and husband.</p>
                    <p>Accidental policies are also issued now by responsible companies, and they
                        are worthy of the attention of business men, particularly those whose
                        families depend upon their daily labor for support. Travelers can, for an
                        additional ten cents paid when purchasing a rail-road ticket, get an
                        insurance for three thousand dollars, which will be valid for twelve hours.
                        If death ensues within that time by accident, the sum is paid in full, or if
                        by any casualty the person insured is prevented from attending to his usual
                        business, he is paid fifteen dollars per week for a period not exceeding
                        twenty-six weeks. Similar policies can be taken for a year, at the rate of
                        five dollars for every thousand insured, and if any accident prevents active
                        employment during that time, five dollars per week is paid for every
                        thousand insured, and in case of death from any accident, the whole sum is
                        paid. This feature of insurance is especially adapted to mechanics who work
                        upon buildings or about dangerous machinery, and to persons who travel
                        frequently upon railroads. It is very cheap as the number of accidents in
                        proportion to the amount of travel and the use of machinery is being reduced
                        each year because of the vast increase and perfection of both. It is not
                        uncommon for families dependent upon daily labor to suffer serious want
                        because of accident, preventing their father from pursuing his calling, and
                        the pittance of less than two cents per day will secure five dollars per
                        week for the support of the family, while the disability continues. The same
                        principle applies to health insurance; but it is fast fading away before the
                        progress of life insurance, though some companies still incorporate it with
                        the insurance upon life.</p>
                    <p>The whole subject is worthy of the careful consideration of all classes, for
                        there are none so opulent and none so poor that they cannot find a system of
                        insurance adapted to their wants and circumstances. There are three agents
                        of Life Insurance in Chambersburg--W. G. Reed, of the American; S. S.
                        Shryock, of the Penn, and John Mull of the Girard; and Mr. Reed is also
                        general agent for a number of Fire Insurance companies, and the only agent,
                        we believe, for Accidental insurance.</p>

<b>Mexico--The Monroe Doctrine</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite the fact that the rebel forces in the Trans-Mississippi surrendered
                    prior to the arrival of the Gen. Sheridan and his troops, reinforcements
                    continue to arrive in Texas, increasing the size of his army to 100,000 men. The
                    editors interpret this escalation as a sign that President Johnson will soon
                    order Napoleon to remove his soldiers from Mexico so that the country can "adopt
                    and maintain her own form of government," a decision they laud as absolutely
                    necessary to protect the U. S.'s "dignity."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The emphatic declaration of Hon. Montgomery Blair, in his Hagerstown speech
                        last week, that our government must promptly demand the surrender of the
                        Mexican throne by Maxamillian and enforce the demand at every hazard, has a
                        peculiar significance. Upon the face of the address it seems to be a mere
                        ebullition of petty spite against Messrs. Seward and Stanton, two fellow
                        cabinet officers who retained their portfolios while Mr. Blair reluctantly
                        retired; but as a political manifesto, considering the relations of the
                        author to the powers that be, and the military movements in Texas, we regard
                        it as foreshadowing important events. That it assaults Mr. Seward is no
                        indication that Mr. Seward will surrender the Premiership, nor that he is in
                        the way of the new policy apparently to be inaugurated. Mr. Blair would
                        doubtless prefer that Mr. Seward should resist the enforcement of the Monroe
                        doctrine, and fall in the effort; and the labored argument that he has
                        antagonized it and means to persist in it, proves simply that Mr. Blair
                        wants Mr. Seward out of the cabinet or intends to strip him of all credit
                        for the inauguration of the new policy.</p>
                    <p>It is true, as charged by Mr. Blair, that Mr. Seward has not insisted upon
                        the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine. Mr. Lincoln wisely adopted the
                        motto--"One war at a time," and Mr. Seward faithfully carried it out. Both
                        would doubtless have preferred to restrain Napoleon from interference in
                        Mexico and to declare the usurpation of the Mexican throne by Maxamillian as
                        an act of hostility against the United States; but inasmuch as they found
                        quite enough to do to enforce the laws within the territory of the United
                        States, they allowed the question to remain in abeyance. According to the
                        settled policy of the government, the declaration of Congress and the
                        platform of the Baltimore Convention, they were bound to protect Mexico from
                        French and Austrian domination, just as they were bound to maintain the
                        sovereignty of the general government in all the States; but it required
                        over four years to discharge the last duty, and it was but the part of
                        prudence and the certain road to success in both, to overlook the lesser
                        evil until the greater was overcome. Now the authority of the government is
                        confessedly re-established, and the question of French interference in
                        Mexico becomes a legitimate issue, and we must prepare to meet it as becomes
                        a great nation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blair has not spoken at random in the important enunciation of our true
                        foreign policy. He is known to sustain the most intimate relations with
                        President Johnson, who was the guest of F.B. Blair Sr. from the time of his
                        inauguration as Vice President, until his shattered health was entirely
                        restored; and when he appeared before Chief Justice Chase to qualify as the
                        chief ruler of the nation, the two Blairs, father and son, with Preston
                        King, were by his side as friends and counselors. Since they have been
                        tireless in their attendance upon the new President, and he could have few
                        more sagacious advisers on all public questions in which their personal
                        prejudices and disappointments do not enter. Besides Mr. Montgomery Blair is
                        a politician, sagacious and tireless, and not wanting in ambition. He has
                        already been a cabinet officer, and looks confidently to a seat in the
                        Senate. Cordially as he hates Seward and Stanton, he would not proclaim a
                        policy not likely to be accepted by the administration and the people,
                        merely for the sake of making mouths at two cabinet ministers who have been
                        more fortunate than himself. He proclaims the Monroe doctrine and demands
                        its immediate and earnest enforcement because he believes in it; because it
                        is right; because it will be the policy of the administration, and because
                        it will meet the approval of the people generally and Maryland in
                        particular. So much we learn from Mr. Blair's Hagerstown speech.</p>
                    <p>This view of the great issue is fully sustained by the military movements in
                        Texas. When Gen. Sheridan was ordered to Texas, Kirby Smith still defied the
                        government, and declared his purpose by proclamation to his soldiers to
                        maintain rebellion indefinitely; but before Gen. Sheridan had reached his
                        new field, the entire rebel forces in the Trans-Mississippi department were
                        surrendered, and no armed forces remained any where to resist the proper
                        authorities. It was generally supposed that Gen. Sheridan's mission was
                        ended before he reached his head-quarters; but instead of returning or
                        disbanding his troops, his army has been steadily strengthened until he has
                        fully 100,000 men in his department, and an army of 80,000 men ready to take
                        the field for active operations. The President has not sent a fighting
                        soldier like Sheridan to amuse himself by putting 80,000 men through the
                        evolutions on dress parade every few days, nor would so strict an economist
                        as President Johnson incur such a vast expense for naught. He keeps an
                        immense army there and there are no rebels to fight; no internal
                        disturbances to quell; no point of our southern frontier or coast is
                        threatened by any foe, and yet Sheridan is daily strengthened instead of
                        mustering his men out and sending them home, as has been done every where
                        else. He evidently has a most important mission to fulfill, and the
                        government manifestly expects the bloody arbitrament of the sand to be
                        necessary to its solution. The first step taken is the formal demand made by
                        Gen. Steele, one of Sheridan's lieutenants, upon the Imperial General for
                        the surrender of the rebel ordnance and arms sold the French by the rebels,
                        and we regard that as but the beginning of the end. Unless the signs of the
                        times, both political and military, prove singularly deceptive, it cannot be
                        long until Napoleon and Maximillian will be notified that Mexico must be
                        allowed to adopt and maintain her own form of government, and Sheridan
                        stands in waiting for enforce it. It may result in war with France; but we
                        think it will not. If it should, it would be best to accept it now than
                        hereafter when France and the Empire in Mexico shall have become much better
                        prepared to meet us in the field. It is evident that this government cannot
                        be secure while the Monroe doctrine is insolently defied by the governments
                        of the old world; and it will be the part of wisdom to grapple with the foe
                        before he has attained the full measure of his power. Maximillian must leave
                        Mexico, or this government must confess its inability to maintain its own
                        dignity by enforcing its long settled policy of non-interference with the
                        sister governments of the continent; and if the administration shall
                        determine that now is the time to act, the nation will cordially sanction it
                        and cheerfully bear every necessary sacrifice to sustain it.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>
                    <p>I have observed that several of the leading citizens of our State have been
                        publicly recommended by their friends as suitable persons to be presented to
                        the Union Convention, as candidate for its nomination for Governor.</p>
                    <p>Among the claims urged in behalf of those gentlemen, that of locality is
                        prominently set forth. I accept it as having much force, and assert it as
                        peculiarly our own.</p>
                    <p>This section of the State is strangely overlooked in making selections for
                        the bestowment of State or National honors. That it is important enough in
                        the Commonwealth need not be argued.</p>
                    <p>But something else is wanted than locality to commend a candidate to the
                        people of Pennsylvania at this momentous period. Never before was it so
                        important to hunt out carefully a man fitted to the high position of
                        administering the affairs of this great Commonwealth, burdened now with debt
                        and groaning with unavoidable taxation. Locality has its claims, public
                        service in the cabinet or the field has its claims, but these alone are
                        insufficient. Locality may lack every other qualification; public service
                        may not be accompanied with integrity, industry or capacity. But honesty,
                        energy, ability are requisites demanded imperatively by the financial
                        conditions of the State, and by the influence which she is to exert over the
                        councils and policy of the nation. A mere politician won't answer, lest his
                        orthodoxy be never so pure and his intellect never so brilliant. Wisdom and
                        good management in our Executives are more needed now than the more shining
                        but less substantial qualities, which often mislead us in the choice of our
                        rulers, but seldom do so in our private concerns.</p>
                    <p>I believe, while we have special claims as to locality, that we have also
                        most fortunately the man. One who has had ample experience in public
                        affairs, who is well known throughout the State, who had ample experience in
                        business affairs; whose ability is conceded by political friend and foe,
                        whose honesty is without spot or question; a gentleman of industry, of
                        excellent business habits, of firmness, who would administer affairs of the
                        State prudently, economically, wisely. I refer to Col. Francis Jordan, of
                        Bedford, and am confident that the people of this Congressional district
                        will endorse my declarations, and labor to secure his nomination. FRANKLIN</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In 1862 the ministers of Chambersburg, at a weekly ministerial meeting,
                        called up the subject of intemperance, and resolved to take a financial view
                        of the great evil. They appointed a committee of two to inquire of the
                        proper authorities to obtain facts and report. Their report was as
                        follows--allowing three-fourths expended by the county for Jail, Poor House
                        and criminal courts as the results of intemperance, which is below the real
                        result:</p>

                        $7,826<br><br> $7,826 expended over the gain, or in other words, the
                        taxpayers of Franklin county are paying that much in taxes to afford the
                        sellers of strong drink the privilege and profit to supply strong drink; to
                        make men drunkards; to tempt young men and boys into the snares of
                        intemperance; to destroy the peace and quiet of families; to [illeg] a class
                        of men for business and usefulness, and finally to fill scores of graves
                        with drunkards. Can the working and business men of this county afford to
                        pay $7,826 in addition to their other high taxes!</p>
                    <p>Can it be financially or humanely wise, or good policy, to give their
                        influence by legislation or by petition to keep up such a useless
                        expenditure of money! Surely every financier will say nay.</p>

                            Soldiers,
                    </p>
                    <p>By W. S. Everett, Esq.</p>
                    <p>SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS:--I have never received an invitation, to address a
                        meeting of my fellow countrymen, with so much pride, as the one I received a
                        few days since, from a committee of war-worn veterans who entered the war at
                        its commencement and remained in the army fighting our country's battles
                        until its close.</p>
                    <p>You soldiers have marched under the flag of your country, and wherever you
                        went you unfurled that flag to the breeze, and so bravely did you vindicate
                        it, that no ruthless hand has dared to take it down, or even disturb it.</p>
                    <p>By your bravery and heroism, that flag now waves over the capital of every
                        State, and floats from the rampart of every fort along the entire coast, and
                        has by you been planted in triumph upon the soil of every State in
                        rebellion, so securely that none has even dared to disgrace it.</p>
                    <p>Some of you were among the first to go into battle, and among the last to
                        come out. You have nobly stood by your country's flag, always true to it,
                        carrying it, on many occasions, through the hottest of the battle, the proud
                        emblem of your country's glory, and as the shout of victory went up,
                        planting it upon the field of honor, the glorious symbol of freedom to all
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>"A shout as of waters, a long withered cry<br> How it leaps, how it leaps
                        from the earth to the sky<br> From the sky to the earth, from the earth to
                        the sea<br> Hear the chorus re-echoed 'The people are
                            free'</p>
                    <p>It is always right to celebrate the heroism of our brethren in the field, and
                        the splendid victories of their arms.</p>
                    <p>Looking over this concourse of delighted people in the presence of our grand old flag, of the heroes of many a hard fought
                        battle, who carried it to victory, and amidst the loud bursts of applause
                        that deafens the ear, it seems to me the lips of the most eloquent orator
                        are as dumb and meaningless.</p>
                    <p>We all rejoice in our country's prosperity, and now after four years terrible
                        war with a giant foe, when golden success has crowned our arms with victory,
                        and peace with its benign influence is supplanting the bloody red-hand of
                        war, it is eminently proper that we should assemble together on this our
                        National Sabbath, to welcome home and do honor to those bold and brave
                        spirits who achieved so much for the government we love. Pericles, the most
                        celebrated Athenian orator, once said, "that the citizen who sorrowed not in
                        his country's disasters, and rejoiced not in her triumphs, was unworthy to
                        live, and unfit to die."</p>
                    <p>This day then, is one of rejoicing in our country's triumphs, and to those
                        who labored to achieve those triumphs, and those who supported and sustained
                        our government when the dark clouds of war overhung our national horizon,
                        who contributed to its strength when to do so required a loyal heart and a
                        patriotic spirit, this Fourth of July is one of exultation, joy and national
                        pride. To-day the whole nation feels as with one heart the glorious
                        achievements which have immortalized our arms.</p>
                    <p>The Fourth of July before this called the young and ardent to join the public
                        rejoicing; it now also speaks, in a touching voice, to the retired, to the
                        gray headed, the old and infirm. It is no longer a day for a particular age
                        or class to commemorate, but it calls together all classes, all parties, all
                        associations, all orders, all conditions and all colors of men. It is a day
                        in which all men everywhere have a common interest, for all are alike
                        benefited by the dear bought blessings which it commemorates. The tribute we
                        bring is not to the living alone, but also to the gallant dead, who dared
                        and suffered upon land and sea, that we as a nation might live and grow in
                        greatness and power.</p>
                    <p>To-day we stand a new people, with no stigma resting upon our national
                        escutcheon. Our arms are triumphant upon land and sea, and the great problem
                        of our institutions, that man is capable of self-government, fully
                        vindicated and established.</p>
                    <p>To-day our nation stands disenthralled and re-generated, with the heaven-born
                        principle proclaimed throughout the land, Universal freedom to all mankind,
                        and equal civil and political rights. Liberty blesses a nation with its
                        sweet influence; even the barren earth seems to pour out its fruits under a
                        system where the rights of men and property are secure, while her fairest
                        gardens are blighted by slavery and despotism. We now as a nation stand,
                        where our charter of independence intended we should, throughout the area of
                        our country, a truly free and independent people.</p>
                    <p>There can be no more interesting occasion than that which has called us
                        together to day. To welcome home those who a few years ago went out from
                        amongst us to roll back the swelling tide of rebellion and treason that had
                        threatened our institutions and government with destruction, is a duty that
                        fills every loyal heart with the warmest emotions. Yes, soldiers, in behalf
                        of the people in our town and country, I welcome you home, the comforts of
                        which your patriotism induced you to sacrifice, that you might lend a
                        helping hand in the rescue of your country from the terrible danger that
                        threatened its overthrow. We have watched you anxiously during the last four
                        years, as you moved among the deadly missiles poured on you by the enemies
                        of our government, or lay suffering from wounds and disease in the hospital.</p>
                    <p>Yes, you have filled us with exultant pride on many occasions, as we have
                        read of the hard fought battles from which you nobly won the golden wreath
                        of victory. From Gettysburg, where the tide was turned and the rebellion
                        began to ebb, to the Wilderness, where wading through a sea of blood for
                        forty days and nights; to Spottsylvania, then across the North Anna and
                        South Anna rivers, pursuing the foe with an energy that threw fear aside, up
                        to the very gates of Richmond and Petersburg, there struggling with
                        death-like tenacity for the period of months, and then to the Weldon
                        railroad and Hatcher's Run, on the glorious termination of the war, in the
                        surrender of Lee with his entire force at Appomattox Court House, you have
                        in all these hard fought battles of this terrible campaign, won for
                        yourselves a glorious distinction, and for your country immortal honor.</p>
                    <p>And you, soldiers of the Army of the Cumberland, victors of a hundred
                        battles, from Nashville to Chattanooga, from Chattanooga to Atlanta, from
                        Atlanta to Savannah, and from Savannah to Edisto and Congaree, into the very
                        heart and centre of treason and traitors, only stopping to linger lovingly
                        over the battle fields where freedom's champions stopped to fight her
                        battles and tell her victories; and then at Kenesaw Heights and Lookout
                        Mountain, where immortality was found above the clouds and the starry flag
                        was unfurled to the breeze, and waved the emblem of truth and glory. From
                        this across the State of Georgia, through South Carolina and North Carolina,
                        ever on the march under the sunlight of glory and honor, carrying terror and
                        dismay to the very hearts of those most determined in the destruction of our
                        government, until your triumph over the second army arrayed against law and
                        order, commanded by General Johnston.</p>
                    <p>This war so triumphantly ended by the noble daring and bravery of our troops,
                        has given us as a people, the most prominent position among the military
                        nations of the earth. It has put beyond question the fact that the United
                        States have more military resources, and can put into the field greater
                        armies than any other government now in existence. When the war began four
                        years ago, the people wished the trial to be made in the face of the
                        civilized world. They asked no foreign intervention, they needed no foreign
                        assistance. They had intelligence enough never to suffer a military
                        despotism, nor to allow the seizure of their political rights and
                        guarantees; but fully understanding their destiny, they have urged on the
                        war, have fought bravely, subdued the rebellion, restored peace to the
                        country and established the government strong enough and powerful enough to
                        conduct us in our onward career, until we, as a people, shall be as Rome was
                        when her imperial eagles hovered around the pillars of Hercules.</p>
                    <p>To be identified with a people so permeated with the principle of liberty,
                        that they will not allow the meanest of God's creatures to suffer slavery,
                        is to my mind a most glorious nobility. Yes, the loyal people of America
                        will suffer not even the meanest Negro to remain in bondage. The vast amount
                        of blood that has been poured out and treasure expended since this causeless
                        rebellion commenced, establishes beyond doubt, the love our people have for
                        that priceless boon, universal freedom. No sacrifice too great to vindicate
                        it. No effort too vast to sustain it. It is the leading element in our
                        nationality, the corner stone upon which is reared our beautiful fabric of
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The government during all this bloody war has been faithful to all its
                        constitutional obligations. For more than three-quarters of a century, it
                        has maintained the national honor at home and abroad, and by its power, its
                        wisdom, and its justice, has given the title of an American citizen an
                        elevation among the nations of the earth, which the citizens of no
                        government have enjoyed since the proudest days of the Roman Empire.</p>
                    <p>The rights of no States were invaded, no man's property despoiled, no man's
                        liberty abridged, no man's life oppressively jeopardized by the action of
                        the Federal government. On the contrary, our system of government is such
                        that the sovereignty of the States in its limited capacity does not clash
                        with the supreme sovereignty of the Federal government. Each in its
                        respective orbit revolves independent of the other, yet not separate, but
                        the one within the sphere granted and upheld by the other.</p>
                    <p>The wicked rebellion commenced four years ago for the purpose of destroying
                        our system of government was the legitimate growth of two antagonistic
                        principles contending for the mastery--slavery and freedom. In the very
                        heart of our country, the element of the most haughty and intolerant
                        aristocracy had been nurtured by the institution of human bondage. The most
                        repulsive features of the old European feudalism had been transplanted to
                        our Republic.</p>
                    <p>The war was simply a desperate struggle on the part of the slaveholders, to
                        retain by force of arms that domination in the government of this Republic
                        which they had so long held, and which by the natural operation of the
                        ballot-box they were slowly but surely losing. It was simply a repetition of
                        that great conflict, which for ages has agitated our globe--the conflict
                        between aristocratic usurpation and popular rights. How nobly it has been
                        resisted and crushed we all know. Since the days that crusading Europe threw
                        its hosts upon the embattled plains of Asia, no deeper, or more earnest, or
                        grander spirit has stirred the souls of men, than that which sent forth the
                        mighty masses of citizen soldiery from the North, whose gleaming banners
                        conquered the rebellion, and made bright again the earth and sky of the
                        distracted south.</p>
                    <p>We come now to-day to applaud our own work and to welcome you, brave men,
                        back from the fields of honor and glory, but also to pay a final tribute to
                        the glowing deeds of our revolutionary fathers. It was for us, their
                        posterity, that the heroes and sages of the revolution toiled and bled. It
                        was not their own cause in which they were embarked. The most they could
                        promise themselves was that, having cast forth the seed of liberty, having
                        watered it with tears of waiting eyes and the blood of brave hearts, their
                        descendants might gather the fruit of its branches, while those who planted
                        it should moulder in peace beneath its shade. And so imbued were they with
                        the principle of liberty, that in order to achieve it they hazarded homes,
                        property and even life itself. On the score of interest, it perhaps might
                        have been better for them to have endured the oppressive acts of the British
                        Parliament, than to have plunged into the heavy expense of blood and
                        treasure of the Revolutionary war. But they thought not of shuffling off on
                        posterity the burden of resistance. They well understood their duty to their
                        descendants. They perceived that they, under Providence, were called to
                        strike the blow of resistance in the cause of civil and religious liberty,
                        and it was this day eighty years ago that they, the mightiest among the
                        mighty, stood forth, and in that immortal Declaration proclaimed the
                        doctrine, which is the corner-stone of our Government, that to mankind
                        belong certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the
                        pursuit of happiness. Nor should we on this occasion forget those who stood
                        forth in their arms when the council was over to bravely contend for this
                        hallowed principle. To them belong glory, honor and immortality. The brief
                        space allotted me will not suffice to describe the thrilling incidents of
                        sublimity and woe, agony and triumph, that were theirs to enjoy and endure
                        through the eight long years of the Revolution. Time is bringing forward in
                        glorious relief the men and the deeds of that high souled day, although the
                        generation of Revolutionary heroes is gone, their deeds remain, and the fire
                        which kindled in their hearts the spirit of patriotism still burns upon our
                        National altars, and warms up the same feeling in the bosoms of the
                        generation of men now living.</p>
                    <p>The Fourth of July two years ago exemplified in golden characters the noble
                        heroism of the brave descendants of a loyal ancestry. Then the rebellion had
                        reached the highest point of its strength and power, and as our
                        revolutionary ancestors proclaimed the doctrine of freedom on that memorable
                        day, and stood forth ready to vindicate it, so too did the loyal Union
                        armies, after hard fought battles, turn the tide at Vicksburg and
                        Gettysburg, driving the enemies of freedom dishonored, dismayed, defeated
                        and discouraged, back to the home of treason and slavery, there only to
                        await in rags of beggary the entire surrender of their armies. Noble heroes,
                        You have faithfully and well served your country. The marks of the campaign
                        are still fresh upon your persons. They are marks of honor, and the scars of
                        wounds you bear, are marks of glory brighter than the diamond, and more
                        lasting than names engraven upon tablets of marble. As the fathers of the
                        revolution are remembered with honor and admiration, so too will you stand
                        forth the pride of posterity and the glory of your own day and generation.
                        For you there is a page in history, a bright and honored page, upon which
                        will be written the names and hard fought battles of the soldiers of the war
                        of 1861. The glorious achievement you won amid the missiles of death, is not
                        for your own countrymen alone, but for the oppressed of every land, of every
                        color, upon the face of the earth. Whilst this is the eighty-ninth year of
                        American independence, it is the first year of American freedom. Our
                        Revolutionary fathers achieved our independence. You gave freedom to the
                        oppressed and enslaved. The trial of adversity was theirs--the trial of
                        prosperity is ours. Our position is the most enviable, the most responsible,
                        which men can fill. If we now do our duty, the cause of universal freedom is
                        safe. If we fail, we not only defraud our children of the inheritance which
                        we received from our fathers, but we blast the hope of the friends of
                        liberty throughout Europe, throughout the world, to the end of time.</p>
                    <p>You need not, Soldiers and fellow citizens, that I should dwell upon the
                        incidents of the terrible war just closed. This very place: here in
                        Chambersburg, a town that once nestled so beautifully in the rich and
                        fertile Cumberland Valley, now sitting draped in mourning amidst her
                        crumbling walls, was the scene of perhaps the most terrible act of fiendish
                        atrocity.</p>
                    <p>Yes, Chambersburg stands a lasting monument to the firm and unyielding
                        patriotism of her people. Her people might have saved their town; but rather
                        than suffer the sacrifice of principle, they spurned with contempt the
                        unjust tribute of M'Causland, and challenged him to an act, in the execution
                        of which, they believed humanity would fail before it. But this was not all
                        of our sufferings, our people endured three raids, and an invasion of Lee's
                        entire army. Four times stripped of our horses, cattle and goods, and
                        compelled to undergo the meanest of insults heaped upon
                            us by those intent upon the destruction of our country, we were
                        doomed at last to leave our homes, with all of our valuables, and relics
                        around which fond memories clustered, only to see them disappear in a column
                        of flame that licked the very clouds, the work of the rebel incendiary.</p>
                    <p>She two, like other towns and cities in the country can call the roll of her
                            citizens--heroes, fallen in the desperate
                        struggle for universal freedom. She has never faltered when the order came
                        for more men, but in her enthusiasm for the glorious cause permitted but one
                        draft, raising her quotas other times by volunteers.</p>
                    <p>But what shall I say of those gallant and brave men who went out from amongst
                        us filled with patriotic devotion to their country and its cause, and who
                        returned not again. These men who did so much to preserve our government are
                        no more. These men who gave all they had on earth, their lives, for the holy
                        cause of universal freedom, can now do no more for us, nor we for them. But
                        their memory remains, we will cherish it; their example remains, we will
                        strive to imitate it, and above all the fruit of their last noble act
                        remains, we will gratefully enjoy it. They have gone to the companions of
                        their cares, of their dangers and their toils. It is well with them. How
                        long the list of our brave and good have assembled there. There is our Col.
                        Ho--m, Capt. Easton, Capt. Sam McDowell, Capt. Stevens, Capt. McCulloh,
                        Capt. Kearns, Pomeroy Oaks, Fisher, McGrath, Follesene and hosts of others
                        who followed them in their country's confidence, are now met together in
                        that land where there is no more separation forever. Their bodies lie
                        mouldering in far off States. The faithful marble may preserve their
                        epitaph, but the humblest sod of Independent America, with nothing but the
                        dew drops of the morning to gild it, is a prouder mausoleum than Kings or
                        conquerors can boast. The fabric of our government, like all things human,
                        however firm and fair, may crumble into dust. But the cause of universal
                        emancipation vindicated and achieved will stand forever.</p>
