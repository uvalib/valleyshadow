<b>The Union County Ticket</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that the Union County ticket, which combines "peculiar
                    political and personal strength," was selected with little acrimony.
                    Additionally, they applaud the decision of the Convention to award war veterans
                    the nominations for the most lucrative positions up for grabs in the election.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. John Doebler, Col. D. Watson Rowe,   Kuhn,   Skinner, Capt.  Clayton,   Nevin, Dr.  Maclay, Col. Frederick S. Stumbaugh)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Union Convention of Franklin county met on the 8th inst. in Chambersburg,
                        and nominated a ticket combining peculiar political and personal strength.
                        Its proceedings were harmonious throughout, and after earnest contests for
                        the more lucrative positions all cordially acquiesced in the decision of the
                        Convention.</p>
                    <p>It is worthy of note that the Union party has not been content to manifest
                        its devotion to the gallant heroes of the war by mere reception orations and
                        cheap professions of interest in their behalf. Every lucrative position in
                        the gift of the people of Franklin county this fall has been justly awarded
                        to men who have responded to their country's call and braved the perils of
                        the sanguinary field. Col. Fred'k S. Stumbaugh, the Union candidate for
                        Assembly, was one of the first to volunteer in April, 1861, when the call
                        was made for 75,000 three month troops. He raised a company in a few days,
                        and in the organization of the regiment he was commissioned Colonel. His
                        regiment served under Gen. Patterson in his [illeg] campaign on the Potomac;
                        and as soon as it was discharged Col. Stumbaugh re-enlisted in the service
                        and was soon at the head of another regiment--the 77th--and joined the Army
                        of the Cumberland under Gen. Buell. Gen. Negley, who went out in command of
                        the brigade, was soon at the head of a division, and Col. Stumbaugh
                        commanded the Pennsylvania brigade from Louisville until after Shiloh. He
                        was with the advance of Gen. Buell's army and among the first to join Gen.
                        Grant on the night of the first disastrous day on that hotly contested
                        field, and his command actively and gallantly participated in the successful
                        struggle of the succeeding day. His brigade subsequently returned to
                        Louisville with Gen. Buell, and soon after Col. Stumbaugh was nominated by
                        the President as Brigadier General and directed to await orders at
                        Chambersburg. In the meantime subordinate regimental officers were promoted
                        and his Colonelry filled, and his confirmation failed because of the refusal
                        of Congress to sanction the increase of general officers. He was thus
                        retired from the service in 1863, with honor to himself, and resumed the
                        practice of his profession in Chambersburg. He was originally a Democrat and
                        severed his connection with that party in 1854 when it adopted the
                        Kansas-Nebraska infamy, and has since faithfully alike in the field, on the
                        stump and by his efforts and votes, sustained the cause of the right.
                        Captain John Doebler, the nominee for Sheriff, was in the three months
                        service, re-enlisted in 1862, and was commissioned Captain of Company A in
                        the 126th Regiment. He was first engaged at Fredericksburg in the fatal
                        charge upon the heights, and fell while most heroically leading his company,
                        with his right arm terribly shattered by a minnie ball. His arm was saved
                        but entirely and permanently disabled, and his nomination was a fitting
                        tribute to a most gallant soldier. Col. D. Watson Rowe, the candidate for
                        District Attorney, also entered the three months' service, and joining the
                        126th in 1862 as Captain of the Greencastle company. In the organization of
                        the regiment he was commissioned Major, and was soon promoted to the
                        Lieutenant Colonelry. Colonel Elder fell early in the charge at
                        Fredericksburg, severely wounded in the hip, and Col. Rowe commanded the
                        regiment from there until the term of service expired. He was noted for
                        coolness and [illeg] heroism in battle, as displayed at Fredericksburg and
                        Chancellorsville, and he is as accomplished in his profession as he was
                        gallant in the field. Major Hassler also entered the service in 1862 as a
                        substitute for a drafted man, and served with credit as a line officer in
                        the 158th Regiment, commanded by Col. McKibbin. The regiment had but little
                        active service during its term; but he was a faithful soldier, and is a most
                        worthy citizen. Mr. Kuhn, the candidate for Surveyor; Mr. Skinner, the
                        candidate for Commissioner; Capt. Clayton, the candidate for Director of the
                        Poor; Mr. Nevin, the candidate for Auditor and Dr. Maclay, the candidate for
                        Coroner are all gentlemen of blameless character, of superior qualifications
                        for the respective trusts for which they are presented, and will command the
                        confidence and earnest support of the Union men of Franklin county.</p>
                    <p>The ticket is upon the whole one of peculiar strength and it behooves the
                        Union men to make a most determined effort for its triumphant election. That
                        Franklin county is a thoroughly Union county, and will on a fair poll and a
                        full vote, elect the entire Union ticket by a decisive majority we cannot
                        doubt; but the course of safety is to prepare for an earnest, stubborn
                        contest and leave no honorable measures untried to make its victory as
                        signal as possible. Let the Union men commence their organization by
                        districts and sub-districts without delay, and when the battle surges
                        against them, they will be more than prepared to resist the tireless efforts
                        of their unscrupulous foe. Let each one resolve that the entire Union ticket
                        shall have every available Union vote in the county, and not rest content
                        until it is polled on the second Tuesday of October, and the future
                        supremacy of the Union party in the "Green Spot," will not be a doubtful
                        question.</p>
                    <p>No name was presented for Senator, and the nomination will, we presume, be
                        conceded to Adams without a contest. Franklin had the nomination in 1859 and
                        Fulton in 1862, and the justice of the claim of Adams is conceded. The other
                        nominee for Assembly is of course conceded to the Union men of Perry, and
                        the formality of a conference will not be necessary.</p>

<b>Our National Credit</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Given the nation's dire financial predicament, lament the editors, there
                    are two possible solutions: the government can either "add to our existing debt
                    from one hundred to one hundred and fifty millions a year for several years to
                    come" or it can alter "our system of internal revenue" so "as to double its
                    proceeds." According to the editors, the second option offers the most promising
                    route for the country. Yet, they say, should the Republicans pursue this course
                    of action, the Democrats will seek to "appeal to the cupidity of the people by
                    demanding diminished taxation regardless of consequences."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An official statement of the National debt was made by the Secretary of the
                        Treasury on the 1st inst. The total amount is given at two thousand seven
                        hundred and fifty-seven millions, two hundred and fifty-three thousand, two
                        hundred and seventy-five dollars and eighty-six cents. Over one thousand one
                        hundred millions bear interest in coin at six per cent and a fraction over
                        one thousand two hundred and eighty-nine millions bear interest in lawful
                        money, and nearly three hundred and sixty millions bear no interest. The
                        total amount of annual interest payable in coin is $64,521,837.50; in lawful
                        currency, $74,740,630.78, making a total of annual interest on the debt as
                        now funded of $139,262,468.28. The amount of legal tender circulating notes
                        still out is $685,236,269; but this includes nearly $16,000,000 of five per
                        cent notes and a little over $212,000,000 of compound interest notes which
                        do not circulate freely. They are generally held by individuals and bankers
                        as an investment, and but a small proportion of them are now passing in the
                        ordinary transactions of business. Nearly half a million of the old treasury
                        notes, which are receivable for duties and therefore have nearly the value
                        of gold, are still in circulation, and the fractional currency issued
                        amounts to $25,750,000. The non-interest bearing legal tenders in
                        circulation is $132,687,968, which with the bank issues exhibits the
                        aggregate paper circulation of the country. The increase of the public debt
                        since the 31st of May last is $122,000,000 and the increase of legal tender
                        notes in the same period is $26,075,700. The amount of coin in the treasury
                        is $35,338,000, and the currency in the treasury amounts to $81,462,000.</p>
                    <p>In this statement we have no information of the amount of requisitions now
                        made and unpaid, and the amount likely to be made for expenses already
                        incurred; but the aggregated must be quite large. The entire amount of loans
                        authorized by Congress is embraced in the estimate, leaving a balance of but
                        little over $116,000,000 in the treasure to liquidate old indebtedness not
                        yet in shape for formal requisition, and to meet current expenses and pay
                        the interest. Our revenues from the tariff will fall materially short of
                        meeting the interest on the public debt, and we apprehend that the internal
                        revenue must fall off very largely during the next year. Our iron factories
                        are nearly all at a stand for want of adequate protection. The English iron
                        is now offered in our market at from ten to fifteen dollars per ton cheaper
                        than it can be manufactured here, and under such ruinous competition our
                        furnaces have been stopped. There is not one half the iron manufactured now
                        in this State that there was one year ago. The direct tax upon it and upon
                        the articles entering into its composition is now heavier than the
                        protection our tariff affords, thus actually discriminating against our own
                        manufacturers. The manufacture of whisky is almost entirely abandoned
                        because of the tax of two dollars per gallon, the limited demand, and the
                        apprehension that the tax will be reduced by the next Congress, and thus
                        inflict a serious loss upon those who have a stock on hand upon which they
                        have paid the present excise duty. The consumption of coal has been very
                        largely diminished by the suspension of iron and other manufactures, and the
                        withdrawal of immense numbers of steamers, gunboats and transports from the
                        active service of the government. The close of the war; the depression of
                        our manufacturing interests, and the abrupt termination of the vast supplies
                        demanded by the army and navy in almost every channel of industry, must very
                        largely reduce incomes; and in the aggregate the internal revenue must be
                        reduced not less than one-third, and perhaps so much as one half. Our public
                        lands have ceased to be a source of revenue, as they are appropriated under
                        our homestead and bounty laws, so that the Nation has but its tariff and
                        internal revenue to rely upon for the payment of the interest on the debt
                        and defraying current expenses. From these sources the aggregate revenue
                        during the present fiscal year will reach about two hundred and fifty
                        millions or three hundred millions at the farthest, at least one-half of
                        which will be required to pay the interest on the existing debt, and the
                        remainder will not be adequate to the necessities of the government, the
                        maintenance of a large army, and the large pensions which justice and
                        humanity alike demand shall be paid, cannot possibly be met by the revenues
                        as they now are and in addition to these, there will doubtless be millions
                        of dollars yet to be paid, arising from the war but not now adjudicated or
                        presented for payment. One of two things, therefore, seems to us as
                        inevitable. We must either add to our existing debt from one hundred to one
                        hundred and fifty millions a year for several years to come, or our system
                        of internal revenue must be so revised as to double its proceeds. It is
                        remotely possible that it might be done by export duties on cotton and
                        tobacco, and still more remotely possible that confiscation of rebel lands
                        may avert the necessity of increased taxation or debt; but looking at
                        matters as they are now we incline to the conviction that we must rely upon
                        increased duties and increased internal revenues to maintain our National
                        credit. We must maintain a large army to give any sort of government to the
                        subjugated States, and from present indications this exhausting tax upon the
                        government will stagger us for years to come, while wounded treason is
                        writhing in the convulsive throes of death. We cannot diminish our interest
                        and pensions and ordinary expenses must be paid, and means must be provided
                        in such a manner as to revive our manufacturing and be least oppressive upon
                        the great industrial classes.</p>
                    <p>We do not commit the common error of regarding the great financial problem of
                        war as successfully solved. If depression shall follow war, and values
                        diminish below a just standard while debt and taxes increase, it will
                        severely test the integrity of the people. Just now the issue would not be
                        feared by those who regard the National faith as sacredly as they would
                        their own; but the American people must be prepared to maintain their credit
                        in adversity as well as in prosperity. The Democratic party ever allied
                        itself with more or less distinctiveness with the cause of the country's
                        foes in the late war, and now while silenced as to the "failure" of the war,
                        they have never ceased to denounce our national currency, and the banking
                        system, which is entirely dependant upon the maintenance of our credit, and
                        to poison the popular mind by declaring our inability to raise the revenue
                        necessary to sustain the public faith with our creditors. They do not now
                        proclaim repudiation, nor will they do so earnestly as they intend to. If
                        they were to do so they would be condemned by the people; but they will in
                        every future contest for the election of Congressmen appeal to the cupidity
                        of the people by demanding diminished taxation regardless of consequences.
                        In all our reading we do not know of a single Democratic journal in this
                        State that honestly sustains our National credit. Instead of demanding and
                        supporting such measures as are necessary to enable the government to meet
                        its just obligations, they with one accord quibble about our revenue laws
                        and appeal to every popular prejudice to impair the solemnly plighted faith
                        of the Nation. In this work they have but commenced, and unless the people
                        shall be forewarned and forearmed and frown down every attempt whether
                        direct or indirect to impair the National credit, we shall have a bankrupt
                        treasury and be bankrupt in credit before many years shall have passed into
                        history.</p>
                    <p>Our National debt was an imperative necessity. Treason was inexorable in its
                        work of death, and had to be stayed in its effort to overthrow the Republic
                        at every sacrifice. In the fullness of time its power was broken and the
                        supremacy of the government restored; but three thousand millions of debt
                        remain, and the dregs of treason still breed discord, endanger the peace and
                        safety of the South and require vast additional expenditures, and it may be
                        additional debt to maintain the majesty of the laws. But free government
                        remains to us rescued from its despotic and barbarous foes, and purified in
                        the terrible crucible of civil war; and its blessings are priceless to us
                        and to our children. Of this fair fabric of Freedom, public credit is an
                        integral and most vital part, and if we would preserve our government, for
                        which we have sacrificed so much, the National credit, the public faith,
                        solemnly plighted by the people themselves, must be maintained unspotted and
                        inviolate.</p>
