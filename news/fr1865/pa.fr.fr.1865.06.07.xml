                    <p>No man ever prospered in the world without the consent and co-operation of
                        his wife. If she united in mutual endeavors or rewards his labors with an
                        endearing smile, with what spirit and perseverance does he apply to his
                        vocation; with what confidence will he resort either to his merchandise or
                        farm; fly over land, sail over seas, meet difficulty and encounter
                        danger--if he knows he is not spending his strength in vain, but that his
                        labors will be rewarded by the sweets of home! How delightful it is to have
                        one to cheer, and a companion to soothe the solitary hours of grief and
                        pain! Solitude and disappointment enter into the history of every man's
                        life; and he has but half provided for his voyage who finds but an associate
                        for happy hours, while for his months of darkness and distress no
                        sympathizing partner is prepared!</p>

                <summary>Democrats, assert the editors, rallied behind Johnson following his ascent
                    to the Presidency because they believed that, although he was elected on the
                    Republican ticket, once in office he would support their program. This
                    assumption was based upon the fact that Johnson had been a Democrat prior to the
                    war. Since taking office, however, Johnson's administration has promulgated a
                    number of measures that the Democrats have opposed. Yet, they have repeatedly
                    "exonerated the President from blame" for those policies and have instead layed
                    "the responsibility upon his cabinet." But with the enactment of the Amnesty
                    Proclamation, which clearly bears Johnson's stamp of approval, the Democrats,
                    say the editors, must acknowledge that they have made yet another error in
                    judgement.</summary>

                    <p>The present condition of those States that were actively engaged in the
                        rebellion is in painful contrast with their conditions before the war.
                        History affords but few instances of such total and complete destruction,
                        wrought in such a marvellously short period. Had the contending armies
                        addressed themselves to the work of destruction alone, without any other
                        object in view, the work could hardly have been more thoroughly done. The
                        rebellion swept over the south like a fierce tornado, with resistless force
                        crushing everything before it, and leaving nothing in its track but the
                        wreck of former greatness and prosperity. Before the war the South had
                        attained a power she was unconscious of herself, and which we failed to
                        appreciate. Measuring her progress by our own, we were accustomed to speak
                        of her as lagging far behind in the race, never once reflecting that we were
                        measuring her by the severest standard possible. In comparison with the
                        progress made by the North, her's had undeniably been slow, but measured by
                        the advance of other nations, it was rapid. In 1860 her population exceeded
                        ten millions, and she counted her wealth by thousands of millions. Her
                        prosperity in agriculture, in commerce, in art and in science, was only less
                        remarkable than that of the Northern States.The unity of sentiment that
                        prevailed among her people, added to her numerical force, gave her a
                        political supremacy in the Union. She controlled the patronage of the
                        government and dictated its policy. She exercised a monopoly in the culture
                        of one of the most important articles in the markets of the world. She was
                        protected in her interests and institutions by the Union and enjoyed all the
                        benefits and privileges that flow from a mild and beneficent government.</p>
                    <p>In an evil hour, taking counsel from ambitious leaders and listening to their
                        vain harrangues of prospective power and glory that were to be secured by
                        independence, her people were beguiled from the path of duty. Imposed upon
                        by the ingenious artifices of these same bold and reckless men, they were
                        made to believe that the Union was a curse instead of a blessing, and,
                        maddened by imaginary grievences, they rashly and wickedly struck at the
                        parent of all their prosperity. With this act terminated their prosperity as
                        States. The history of the South from that day to this is a story of fearful
                        retribution. Four years of terrible war have made sad havoc throughout the
                        broad land, and prostrated her proud people in the dust. On everything of
                        interest or value the conflict has left indelible traces, and whatever it
                        touched it blighted. Where but a short time ago there was busy life and
                        thriving industry, there is now utter stagnation; where there was opulence
                        and ease, their is now poverty and despair. Instead of enjoying the high
                        advantages that flow from society well regulated, they are struggling with a
                        sort of anarchy from which they can only escape by the friendly
                        interposition of that power they defied, and which they sought to crush.
                        Cities that were populous and growing into commercial importance have been
                        made desolate, and in some instances almost blotted out of existence. Broad
                        plantations, that were once the source of abundant wealth, no longer yield
                        their rich fruits, but lie untilled. The best and bravest of her sons have
                        fallen in the vain struggle and the land is filled with mourning. Her wealth
                        has vanished and her starving thousands are being fed by the charity of the
                        North. One wide belt of desolation and exhaustion stretches from the Potomac
                        to the Gulf. Such has been the measure of her punishment. Who shall say that
                        it is not just? They sowed the wind and have reaped their whirlwind in the
                        grandest, bloodiest and most destructive war of modern times. The wretched
                        condition of the South to-day is full of warning and instruction, but in her
                        future their is excitement of well grounded hope. She starts now on a new
                        era, released from the mighty incubus that pressed upon her and impeded her
                        in her onward course. Her soil has been reclaimed from the deadly grasp of
                        Slavery, and is now gladdened by the warm sunlight of universal liberty. The
                        glow of that newly risen sun will impart srength and vigor, and as if by
                        magic the waste places will again be made glad. Under its genial influence
                        every thing will be quickened into a new life and her former prosperity
                        return. By reason of her superior natural advantages, the South to-day ought
                        to be far in advance of any other part of our country. In her climate, in
                        her soil and the general configuration of the country, she posseses
                        advantages, which would have rewarded ordinary thrift and energy with a
                        wealth and power that would have been denied severest toil and boldest
                        enterpreise in other sections. Her restoration to the Union and the adoption
                        of the free labor system is the best possible assurance that in the future
                        these will not be neglected, as they have been in the past. As soon as law
                        and order have been established the great work of rehibilitation will
                        commence, and in the near future we anticipate for her a measure of
                        greatness that under the old order of things she never could have
                    attained.</p>

                <summary>In a relatively short period of time, suggest the editors, the South grew
                    to command considerable political and economic power within the country.
                    Southerners, however, sacrificed all they had gained when they chose to follow
                    the "reckless men," who claimed to represent the section's best interests, into
                    battle with the rest of the country. As a consequence of their poor judgement,

                    <p>VALLEY OF THE SHENANDOAH-- A letter written from Winchester, Va., says: The
                        valley begins to look up, under the speedy prospect of peace. The farmer has
                        returned to his plow, and the many broken fields--fields which have been red
                        with the blood of both patriots and traitors--testify to his earnestness in
                        trying to redeem his neglected lands, and have them bring as plentiful a
                        harvest as they did before the war's alarm broke on his ear. The removal of
                        all restrictions on trade in Virginia by Secretary McCulloch was hailed with
                        joy by the citizens of the valley. Trains are leaving here daily for
                        Strasburg, Woodstock, Mt. Jackson, New Market, Harrisonburg and Staunton,
                        laden with dry goods, &amp;c., and everything else desirable to a people
                        who have been deprived of even the necessaries of life for the last four
                        years. These goods are mostly the property of Northern capitalists, who
                        expect to receive fabulous amounts for their goods, and that in gold and
                        silver, which these people seem to have in great abundance, which they have
                        held fast to throughout the war, knowing that specie would be worth its
                        value, whether the rebellion succeeded or not.</p>

                <summary>The end of the war, relates the article, has resulted in a substantial
                    diminution in the demand for coal. As a consequence, the price for the commodity
                    has dropped. To offset the lower prices, mine operators in Schuylkill and Carbon
                    counties reduced the wages paid to their laborers, which, in turn, prompted the
                    workers to threaten violence unless their wages were returned to the former
                    level. Conflict was averted, however, after troops were brought in to quell the
                    demonstrations.</summary>
