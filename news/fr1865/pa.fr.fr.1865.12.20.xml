                <commentary>"Gen. Coffroth is now at Washington appealing to Union members of
                    Congress to sustain him in his fraudulent attempts to gain his seat, because as
                    he urges, he sacrificed himself in the Democratic party by voting for the
                    constitutional amendment. Aside from the morality of asking a seat on such
                    grounds, we deem it but fair to judge Gen. Coffroth by his own explanation and
                    defence of that vote. The following is his letter to Mr. Weyland, one of his
                    constituents, explaining his position, and we command it to the consideration of
                    Congress:"</commentary>

                <summary>In his letter, Coffroth explains his rationale for supporting the
                    constitutional amendment mandating the abolition of slavery as a prerequisite
                    for the southern states to gain readmission to the Union. His endorsement, he
                    assures his constituent, was not given as a means to secure the good graces of
                    the Republicans who will determine whether he or Gen. Koontz won the contested
                    seat for Congress from the Sixteenth District. Rather, he claims to have cast
                    his vote in favor of the measure because he believed it constitutionally
                    correct. Moreover, he asserts the passage of the amendment represents the only
                    way to remove slavery from the public spotlight and the inordinate amount of
                    attention it receives, which is particularly crucial at this point in time
                    because there are much more important issues, such as the current fiscal
                    problems, that need to be dealt with.</summary>

                    <p>THE WAY IT WORKED--At the recent session of the Methodist Conference in
                        Washington, Bishop Simpson and a colored preacher, the Rev. Mr. Lawson, to
                        Staunton, Va., to preach to the blacks there. He preached one half day in
                        the Methodist church vestry to a black audience. The next day the white
                        clergymen of Staunton met and voted that thereafter no colored man should
                        preach in that place, but that once in four weeks one of their number should
                        preach exclusively to the blacks. The black members of the Methodist Church,
                        three hundred in number, and paying nearly all the parish expenses,
                        thereupon seceded, leaving the church to its eighteen white members, and
                        organized a flourishing church of their own in the spacious rooms of a
                        carriage manufactory. The Baptist clergyman, seeing the ruin of the
                        Methodist Church, and conscious of the inability of its own white flock to
                        sustain him, immediately sent an offer of his vestry to a colored Baptist
                        clergyman. The offer was accepted, and ever since that day the two most
                        flourishing churches in Staunton are the Black Methodist and the
                        White-and-black Baptist.</p>

                <head>The English Railroad Raid</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Some years ago a party of English capitalists commenced the extension of the
                        six feet gauge railroads from New York [illeg] by the establishment of the
                        Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. They aimed at a continuous six feet
                        gauge from New York to St. Louis, and that has been accomplished or soon
                        will be. The first grand movement of the English operators being about
                        completed, Sir Morton Peto, the great Railroad King of Europe, with a party
                        of capitalists, visited this country, and personally inspected all the
                        important railroad lines in the Northern States. They were received with the
                        utmost hospitality, and had every opportunity to estimate correctly the
                        resources of the country. While here they conceived or matured the grand
                        idea of constructing a continuous line through Pennsylvania, professedly for
                        the purpose of developing certain portions of the State not favored with
                        railroads; and instead of proposing their scheme to the legislative power of
                        the State, they have attempted to secure the necessary franchises for a
                        through route by leaving the Catawissa and purchasing several charters held
                        by speculators. They have secured possession of the Morris and Essex road of
                        New Jersey, which with the Lehigh Valley, Quakaki and Catawissa gives them a
                        through line from New York to Milton.They have also purchased the Centre and
                        Spruce Creek and the Western Central charters by which they hope to reach
                        Franklin, and also to intersect their own road below Greenville, in Mercer
                        county. Thus do a party of English capitalists, an organization foreign and
                        unfriendly to all our interests, attempt to acquire possession of a through
                        route in our State, that would paralyze both Pittsburg and Philadelphia, and
                        use our territory merely to sweep our own wealth and that of the West, to
                        foreign markets. Such an enterprise might receive the sanction of a
                        Pennsylvania legislature, but it would be under restrictions and conditions
                        which were not deemed important in granting local charters such as the
                        Catawissa and Centre and Spruce Creek roads.</p>
                    <p>At first blush most men are prepared to welcome capital from any part of the
                        world to construct railroads in Pennsylvania; but when the aim and well
                        matured purpose of this enterprise are considered, it would be a suicidal
                        act to allow the proposed route to be constructed without a careful revision
                        of its franchises by the proper legislative power. To understand the
                        character of this enterprise, and its fatal consequences upon our industry
                        and commerce, we must look to the settled policy of English capitalists as
                        acted upon with fatal consistency since they have commenced the gigantic
                        work of controlling the trade of the North and West. England has been ready
                        for years to make almost any sacrifice to control our trade. In this it has
                        had a two-fold purpose. Its first aim was to cripple our industry and
                        paralyze our commerce and improvements, and its secondary aim was to possess
                        the trade, which should enrich our own commercial emporiums. Acting upon
                        this policy, the English government authorized the construction of the Great
                        Trunk line in Canada some years ago; and to enable it to compete
                        successfully with all the great lines in the United States, its bonds,
                        stock, real estate, rolling stock and all its property were exempted from
                        taxation. Thus were millions of dollars made free from the oppressive taxes
                        of the English government solely for the purpose of striking a fatal blow at
                        the commerce, the industry and transporting lines of this country. By this
                        enterprise the English carrier now gives a bill of lading in Detroit or
                        Chicago through to Liverpool, and a few years ago the English line could
                        carry a barrel of flour through Canada to Portland and from thence to New
                        York or Philadelphia at a less cost or certainly not a greater cost, than it
                        could be transported over the direct lines through the States. This
                        enterprise necessitated New York and Pennsylvania to remove their taxes on
                        tonnage, or surrender the whole teeming wealth of the west to the grasp of
                        England.</p>
                    <p>The proposition to secure franchises by stealth through Pennsylvania, and
                        construct a through line from the West to New York, is but a part of the
                        grand scheme that originated the Great Trunk line, and would be the
                        consummation of the same. It would benefit a few localities, because it
                        would hasten their development before their local interests would warrant
                        it; but it would be the work of death to Pennsylvania commerce, and would in
                        time be fearfully destructive to the great industrial interests of the
                        North. Philadelphia and Pittsburg are the great manufacturing centres of
                        this country, and this enterprise would strike at the vitals of both. It
                        would not only isolate them, but it must cripple them far beyond any present
                        calculation. Philadelphia has invested some fourteen millions of dollars in
                        the Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and Erie Railroads. These investments were
                        made not with the view of direct profits on the stock, but mainly for the
                        purpose of bringing to our great commercial and manufacturing centres a fair
                        share of the wealth of the West. Pittsburg as a great manufacturing city,
                        gathers wealth from East and West, and after compensating her vast industry
                        and capital, diffuses it again to home markets on every hand; but here comes
                        the giant foe of both our commercial and industrial prosperity and proposes
                        to sweep the wealth of both and take it, without tribute or any
                        compensation, to foreign markets, thus using our own domain to compass our
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>But there is another and graver objection to this enterprise that has not as
                        yet entered into the discussion on the subject so far as we have observed
                        it. It is of course carefully concealed by the friends of the measure, and
                        perhaps many of its opponents with most neutrals do not at all appreciate
                        the magnitude of the peril this movement will eventually inaugurate to our
                        industry. While commerce and local development appear on the surface to be
                        the great aim of the English movement through the heart of the North, it is
                        evident, upon a careful examination of the enterprise from its inception
                        until now, that its chief aim, in English estimation, is to create a power
                        in our own midst that can be made almost totally destructive of our industry
                        in any depression of our industrial pursuits. Let it not be forgotten that
                        from the day the great Trunk line was originated until the completion of the
                        Atlantic and Great Western, the English investments in Railroads have not
                        been made to pay dividends on stock. They have been made by the English
                        capitalists, who are the English manufacturers, for the purpose of
                        controlling ultimately the industry of both England and our continent; and
                        they need but the completion of the through route in Pennsylvania to place
                        the manufacturing interests of our State and of the North almost entirely at
                        their mercy. Just now this danger is not apparent. Our industry is
                        prosperous and well acquitted; but the time will come, in the mutations of
                        trade, when English coal will blacken our wharfs as of old, and English
                        fabrics and manufactured articles of all kinds will be able to compete
                        successfully with our own. Then would the death blow be struck by this
                        gigantic English artery of trade. Then would the fabrics of the English
                        looms and the handy work of English manufacturers crowd our shores, and they
                        could be scattered through the very heart of our own enterprise, at nominal
                        cost of transportation, and thus would the English cheap labor bring its
                        work in competition with us at our very doors from the Sea board to the
                        Mississippi. In such a contest, we could have no remedy to rescue us from
                        the remorseless grasp of English enterprise without degrading our labor to
                        the English standard. It would be the great artery of death, and we cannot
                        but regard its success as the crushing blow, to be felt in but a few years,
                        to all our present high hopes of industrial progress. Let us be wise in
                        time, if it is the interest of England to develop our own State, then it is
                        ten fold more our own interest to do it; and the fact that the Atlantic and
                        Great Western proposes to develop where the [illeg] themselves do not
                        pretend to say [illeg] capital can be compensating, doing so is the very
                        best evidence that the enterprise must have ulterior purposes and interests
                        which cannot be in harmony with our own prosperity. We ask the calm, honest,
                        earnest attention of the legislature to this question and entreat for it an
                        intelligent judgement that will not loose sight of the thousand sinews of
                        industry on which our greatness and wealth depend. Let it not be jeoparded,
                        and above all let it not be placed at the mercy of English capital, whose
                        only hope of success is in our own destruction.</p>

                <summary>The editors rage against the enterprise proposed by English capitalists to
                    construct railway lines linking the western sections of Pennsylvania with New
                    York. They contend that it "would be a suicidal act" to permit an organization
                    that is "foreign and unfriendly" to "acquire possession" of a route that would
                    "cripple" the state's industry and "paralyze both Pittsburg and Philadelphia."</summary>

                <summary>It is rumored that Congress will issue its report on the controversy over
                    the Sixteenth Congressional seat in favor of Gen. Koontz, despite his rival's
                    repeated attempts to sway the Republican-dominated body to the contrary. Though
                    it commends this development, the article laments that several months may pass
                    before the issue is completely resolved and the "rightful" occupant of the seat
                    is able to claim his place.</summary>
