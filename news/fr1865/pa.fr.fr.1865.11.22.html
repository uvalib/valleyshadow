<b>Reviving An Obsolete Custom</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although blame for the war clearly rests with the former states of the
                    Confederacy, the editors acknowledge that the North was at least partly to blame
                    because it repeatedly accommodated and acquiesced to the demands of the South.
                    But with the end of the war, they promise, that mode of thinking has been
                    abandoned. No longer will the North permit the government to be monopolized; no
                    longer will it continue to pay "tribute" to "Caesar" because a "new order of
                    things has been established."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Before the war the Southern people were notoriously arrogant, exacting and
                        aggressive. Continually exercising absolute power over a large class of
                        their fellow beings, they fell into the belief that they were a superior
                        race and as such entitled not only to the unrequited labor of their bondmen,
                        but to an indefinite amount of respectful consideration, and even
                        respectable servility oftentimes, from those with whom they condescended to
                        hold political, commercial or social intercourse. It cannot be denied that
                        the North failed to meet this unreasonable assumption in the proper spirit.
                        Had it done so, it would have been spared much humiliation and ridicule,
                        while the intercourse between the two sections would have been of a more
                        frank and agreeable character. There were those who in order that thrift
                        might follow, crooked the pregnant hinges of the knee over and over again,
                        and belittled their manhood in the operation. These have had their reward.
                        By far the larger portion of our people however, regarded the claim of the
                        South as a harmless infatuation, and rather than disturb the serene
                        complacency its indulgence seemed to confer upon their noble friends, were
                        disposed to submit to whatever inconvenience its exercise might impose on
                        them. This was exceedingly accommodating, but proved to be harassingly
                        inconvenient, for it was accepted not as a simple indulgence on our part,
                        but as an actual concession that their claim was well founded; and they
                        acted accordingly. They claimed the full benefit of their superiority and
                        regarded any restiveness on our part as insubordination. We had helped them
                        on to considerable importance and they had it in their power to work
                        incalculable mischief, so that all they had to do to repress any resistance
                        of ours was to threaten something diabolical, and taking counsel not from
                        our manhood, but our fears, we would immediately subside. They claimed the
                        right to monopolize the government with its offices and privileges, to
                        silence the pulpit and the pres, or control their utterances, and by way of
                        convincing us that their demands were reasonable and moderate, they would
                        occasionally fracture the skull of an eminent Senator, or give us an
                        exhibition of their terrible swagger and bluster and vain glory. If the war
                        had been postponed a few years longer, and the patience and forbearance of
                        the North had continued, they might have established their claim, but the
                        clash of arms resounding through the land awakened the North to its true
                        majesty. The manhood of both sections was submitted to the terrible ordeal
                        of battle, and the world accepts the result as conclusive evidence that
                        their claim was a fiction. We suspect that even they were undeceived.</p>
                    <p>A new order of things has been established. Henceforth we of the North are to
                        be untrammelled. We are to enjoy an independent press, a fearless pulpit and
                        an unquestioned right to agitate to our heart's content. Genafflection is to
                        be counted a deformity and not a graceful accomplishment. Officious
                        interference is to be rebuked and unmanly servility to be despised.</p>
                    <p>But there are some venerable institutions in the land that have so long been
                        used to rendering an excess of tribute to our exacting Caesar that they now
                        experience great difficulty in accommodating themselves to the new order of
                        things. They have so long been deprived of certain privileges, that now when
                        they are conceded to be theirs they find it impossible to exercise them. For
                        instance, the Episcopal Church, distinguished above all others for its
                        patience in subjection, cannot now exercise even so much independence as to
                        thank God for the greatest blessing he has vouchsafed to this generation.
                        Before the war we would not have expected from her any utterance that would
                        have indicated hostility to human slavery, for we knew what restraints were
                        upon her then, but we confess to considerable disappointment in the
                        obsequiousness manifested by her convention, lately held in Philadelphia, in
                        rejecting a resolution expressing thankfulness for the overthrow of the
                        giant evil. In doing so that convention rendered all its tribute unto
                        Caesar, and repudiated a solemn obligation it was under to Him whom it
                        professes to serve. We call it obsequiousness, but it was worse, it was a
                        servility that was mean and a disregard of duty that was wicked. If the
                        church does not wish to share in the shame, she must repudiate the action of
                        her representatives.</p>
                    <p>The extinction of human slavery within the limits of the United States was
                        unquestionably one of the most beneficent results of our civil war. Of
                        itself it would make the period of the struggle illustrious, for there are
                        few events in the history of our race likely to exercise a more potential
                        influence in shaping and controlling the destinies of men. It is a great
                        mistake to weigh its importance and beneficence by its results as they have
                        already manifested themselves, stupendous as they certainly are, for human
                        vision cannot detect the boundaries of its influence. Future generations
                        will witness it in the construction and government of society centuries
                        after the present. Viewed in whatever aspect, whether as a moral, political
                        or social reform, it is grandly prominent in the world's history. Man can
                        claim little or no credit for its accomplishment. It was the work of a
                        Higher Power and was intended as the great end in our recent trials. Yet in
                        all this the Episcopal Convention professed to see nothing for which a
                        Christian people should be thankful, least of all thankful to the great
                        Author.</p>
                    <p>We like to give every one credit for honesty and sincerity as long as it's
                        possible to resist a different conclusion; but to concede it to this
                        convention would argue a stupidity in one or the other, which neither would
                        like to acknowledge. Who in this broad land, with a conscience, enlightened
                        above heathenism, can fail to see the blessing in the extinction of slavery?
                        The truth is, this convention saw it, but lacked the moral courage to
                        confess it. It quailed in the presence of a dead lion and a disgraceful fear
                        chocked its utterance. Instead of stripping the monster of all its
                        disguises, and holding it up in all its naked deformity, as it should have
                        done, it attempted to plate it with gold and set it up for reverence. The
                        enlightened conscience of the North cries out against such conduct. The new
                        order of things upon which we have entered requires manly and independent
                        action by all. Servility and obsequiousness will no longer pass unrebuked,
                        but will be resented as an insult to our civilization. Let the Episcopal
                        Church learn from an indignant people.</p>

<b>The Reaction</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In spite of the President's efforts to facilitate the re-admission of the
                    southern states, the former rebels and their northern supporters have remained
                    "insolent and defiant" in the face of the administration's generosity. As a
                    result of their actions, say the editors, the northern populace has grown
                    increasingly weary of the demands of its vanquished foe, and demands that
                    Congress refuse to admit the representatives from the rebel states until "all
                    issues arising from the war are satisfactorily and irrevocably adjusted."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>But a few weeks ago the administration and the country were drifting strongly
                        toward the admission of the States lately in rebellion into full fellowship
                        and power as sovereign States of the Union. President Johnson had devised a
                        policy looking to the restoration of the rebel States, which, regarding them
                        as under military rule, was fully warranted by the powers conferred upon the
                        Executive. It was but a preliminary action, in which he gave form and color
                        of regularity by his official aid, to enable them to prove their sincerity
                        in accepting the results of the war, and thus establish their claim to
                        re-admission into their old relations in the Union. That the President was
                        and is sincere in seeking to effect the speedy re-union of all the States
                        there can be no question; but two classes of men have evidently widely
                        missed their mark in presuming upon the position of the President. The
                        time-serving sycophants of the North, who demanded boundless vengeance when
                        the President declared that "treason is the highest crime and must be
                        punished," in their indecent haste to stultify themselves rushed to defend
                        the cause of traitors and demand their admission into Congress, because they
                        believed such to be the policy of the President; and encouraged by the
                        magnanimity of the Executive, traitors themselves became insolent and
                        defiant, and from being supplicants for the generosity of the administration
                        they assumed to define their own terms for recognizing the supremacy of the
                        government. The action of these two classes at last aroused the loyal North
                        and the elections of the great central States proclaimed in thunder tones
                        that there must be no compromise with treason--no halfway submission to the
                        national authority and the results of the war.</p>
                    <p>The South has grievously abused the generosity of the President. He has shown
                        them only kindness, and has exhausted himself to facilitate their return to
                        government and civil law; but every step he has taken to smooth their
                        pathway has but encouraged them to fall back still more boldly upon their
                        rebel prejudices and purposes. Mississippi defeated the Union candidate for
                        Governor by an overwhelming vote to place an avowed rebel in the
                        Gubernatorial chair, and although the legislature has been in session some
                        two months, they have never even considered the proposed amendment of the
                        constitution abolishing slavery. South Carolina refused to declare the
                        ordinance of secession null and void; has made no provision for conferring
                        even the poorest civil rights upon freedmen, and has elected Senators and
                        Congressmen who are disqualified by the law of Congress, and elected Worth
                        Governor over Holden, Union, solely because he is in favor of paying the
                        rebel debt and opposed to extending the rights of negroes in any degree. The
                        same condition of affairs exists in Florida and Georgia, and the result is
                        that the President, admonished by the loyal men of the North and by the
                        treachery of the people of the South, has officially declared his
                        disapprobation of the work of re-construction by directing the provisional
                        Governors in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Mississippi to
                        retain their positions, notwithstanding the election of Governors by the
                        people until those States place themselves in a position acceptable to
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Thus stands the unfinished work of reconstruction now, and its immediate
                        practical results are accepted by the President and by the country as
                        unsatisfactory. We do not mean by this that the policy of the President is a
                        total failure; but it is clear that his generosity has not been appreciated,
                        and that he is so disappointed in the supposed fidelity of Southern people,
                        that he does not himself recognize the State governments he has aided to
                        create, and of course will not ask Congress to recognize them by the
                        admission of their members. Thus has treason again overreached itself, and
                        paralyzed its friends in the North just when they were prepared to make a
                        desperate struggle in its support; and when the President declares his want
                        of faith in the new State organizations as he has already done by his acts,
                        there will be a howl of denunciation from the place-hunters and vampyres of
                        the Union party in the North, equaled in intensity only by the fervor with
                        which they defended traitors but a day before.</p>
                    <p>We notice on all sides within a week past the unmistakable signs of positive,
                        powerful re-action as to the position of the revolted States. The Union
                        press of the State now, with one voice--excepting perhaps a stray mendicant
                        here and there that has not yet realized the progress of events--demands
                        that Congress shall not admit the members from the rebel States until all
                        issues arising from war are satisfactorily and irrevocably adjusted, and we
                        believe now that in this decision President Johnson will cordially concur
                        earnestly as he has desired a different result. He has labored to make the
                        South true to the government--has spared no generosity to lead them to
                        fidelity and success; but they have rewarded his kindness by treachery, and
                        the consequences must be upon their own heads. The Tennessee members may be

                        re-construction will stop until the South makes a record entirely
                        un-exceptional, and in this we now hope that there may be entire concord and
                        unity of action between Congress and the President--Thanks to treason for
                        its early manifestation of its purpose--it has done well for the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The loyal press of the country is again agitating the necessity of trying
                        Jefferson Davis, with an earnestness that cannot fail to be felt at
                        Washington. We do not doubt that had the rebel States given evidence of
                        their sincerity in professing submission to the government and the results
                        of the war, the President meant to demand no more atonement for the
                        causeless strife into which treason plunged the Nation, but the startling
                        events of the last few weeks; the sullenness with which the rebels submit to
                        the national authority, and their manifest unwillingness to call faithful
                        men to official positions, have aroused the loyal people of the North, and
                        they demand in unmistakable tones, through their press and their true
                        representatives, that the magnanimity of the government shall not be thus
                        treated with contempt.</p>
                    <p>We have ever insisted that Mr. Davis should be tried by a competent tribunal,
                        regardless of the condition of affairs in the South. He has been officially
                        charged by the President with conspiring to assassinate the Chief Magistrate
                        of the Nation. As yet that charge stands before the world. It certainly was
                        not made without some reason to believe it could be sustained; and if so, he
                        should be tried as were his co-conspirators and if guilty, share their fate.
                        But there is still another charge no less grave in its character, which is
                        preferred against Mr. Davis by the Nation. It is mournfully uttered in our
                        ears from thousands of bereaved homes whose loved ones were doomed to the
                        most barbarous cruelties and lingering deaths at Andersonville, by direction
                        of the rebel authorities. Mr. Davis was the chief of the rebel usurpation.
                        He had but to command and he was obeyed. Werz was a pliant creature, and his
                        atrocities had been condemned by the civilized world long before the
                        rebellion failed. Mr. Davis either did or did not direct the shocking
                        atrocities of Andersonville. He certainly knew of them, and either did or
                        did not exercise his supreme power to arrest them. If guilty of either
                        charge, he is a monster of inhumanity and should die as the foe of mankind.</p>
                    <p>For this palpable infraction of the accepted laws of war, or for conspiring
                        to assassinate President Lincoln, he can be tried in but one way--by
                        military commission. A commission of the best men the service can
                        furnish--such as Grant, Meade, Sherman, Thomas, Hancock, &amp;c.--should
                        be selected, and Mr. Davis should be patiently and fairly heard. The
                        civilized world would accept the verdict of such a court as true to justice
                        and to law, and if he should be thus condemned to death, he would die
                        unhonored and unsung. Justice to Mr. Davis and justice to our heroic martyrs
                        in rebel prisons demand such a trial, and we hope that it may yet be ordered
                        and accomplished. It must not be entirely forgotten that "mercy to traitors
                        is cruelty to the country."</p>

<b>Philadelphia</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository's Philadelphia correspondent relates that John Given's
                    victory in the contest for City Commissioner was secured through fraud.
                    Apparently, a significant portion of Given's votes came from the returns of
                    soldiers in the 58th Pennsylvania Volunteers. Upon further examination, however,
                    it was determined that these votes were fraudulent since the soldiers in
                    question were not stationed in Lynchburg, as it had been claimed, but were
                    instead scattered throughout Virginia and, hence, did not have an opportunity to
                    cast their ballots.<br>

<b>Local Items--Our Railroad Connections</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial calls on the Cumberland Valley Railroad to provide extended
                    service to Chambersburg in order to allow her residents quicker and easier
                    connections to the major cities on the eastern seaboard.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We think that the time as come when the facilities for travel to and from
                        Chambersburg should be extended. It now requires a full day to reach
                        Chambersburg from Philadelphia or Baltimore, and to get through from New
                        York or Washington requires a very early start and constant travel by slow
                        trains to make the trip in one day. We get the Washington mail through in
                        one day, but it requires thirty-six hours to get a paper or letter through
                        from New York. In this we have been retrograding instead of advancing, as we
                        did formerly have through mails from New York in one day; but now we have
                        extended it a day and a half. The great through lines from Washington,
                        Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York have all concentrated their travel now
                        at Harrisburg at 4pm, just in time to spend a night in Harrisburg if the
                        passenger wants to pass through the Cumberland Valley beyond Carlisle, and
                        we are glad to learn that the direction our railroad is now considering the
                        propriety of progressing with the progress of the lines connecting with it.
                        Long since an additional train was put on the road from Carlisle to
                        Harrisburg and return--starting early in the morning so as to connect with
                        the early trains to all the leading cities, and leaving Harrisburg on return
                        after the arrival of the last lines from Philadelphia and New York, thus
                        giving to Carlisle what Chambersburg should have and needs much more than
                        Carlisle. An extension of the extra train to Chambersburg would be of
                        incalculable advantage to our business men now. Recently a fast through line
                        has been put on the Northern Central, which lands passengers in Harrisburg
                        at 4 pm, leaving Washington at about [illeg] and Baltimore at noon; and the
                        through line leaving Philadelphia at about 12, and the through line leaving
                        New York at about 9, all arrive at Harrisburg about the same time--all in
                        season for the extra train to Carlisle, but too late for Chambersburg
                        passengers. If this extra train was extended to this point our people could
                        leave Baltimore or Philadelphia at noon and reach home by 7 in the evening;
                        they could leave Washington at 8 1/2 and be home the same day; or they could
                        leave New York in the morning and reach Chambersburg the same day either by
                        Easton and Reading or by Philadelphia. They could also leave home at five or
                        thereabouts in the morning, and be in Baltimore or Philadelphia at noon, or
                        New York and Washington by the middle of the afternoon, whereas it now
                        requires a full day of tedious travel to reach any of these points from
                        Chambersburg, and part of the night to reach New York or Washington. The
                        great evil is that with the present connections of the Cumberland Valley
                        Railroad, its passengers can make no fast trains, and in returning they must
                        take slow trains also or lose time waiting at Harrisburg. We submit to the
                        direction of the company that these things should be corrected when it can
                        be done by the simple process of extending to Chambersburg a train already
                        given to Carlisle.</p>
                    <p>We understand well that while it is the duty of Railroad companies to
                        accommodate the public in the best way possible, they must not be expected
                        to do it at their own expense. The Cumberland Valley Company will not, and
                        should not, run any trains which will not pay them, but we take it for
                        granted that the Carlisle train pays or it would long since have been
                        abandoned; and if so, with the recent concentration of all the great lines
                        at Harrisburg, leaving eastward at about 8am and arriving westward about
                        4pm, the additional train would pay well if extended to Chambersburg. At
                        least the experiment should be made to relieve our people of the network of
                        slow lines on which they are thrown in every direction.</p>
