<b>Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The debate over the issue of enfranchising the freedmen, admit the editors,
					is perplexing. Yet, despite the fact that there is no easy solution to the
					dilemma, it is clear that the right cannot be conferred upon them by the federal
					government. That decision, they maintain, is the province of the states.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Several correspondents have addressed us recently on the question of
						universal enfranchisement, without distinction of color. We have not
						discussed the question hitherto because we could see no solution of the
						issue, and even now we cannot pretend to define a policy and its probable
						results. We have noticed much discussion of the question in public journals,
						and have read impassioned speeches in behalf of extending the right of
						suffrage to the negro; but no one has as yet pointed out the way by which
						the desired result can be readily attained.</p>
					<p>President Lincoln studiously avoided the issue, not because he was unwilling
						to have his views known on the subject; but because he could see no means,
						within the scope of the law, by which the general government could enlarge
						or abridge the elective franchise. In his last address, just before his
						assassination, he expressed the wish that the right of suffrage could be
						extended to all who fought to preserve the life of the Republic; but he felt
						powerless to enforce his own convictions of rights without fearful peril to
						our institutions. President Johnson has but followed in the steps of his
						predecessor, and discards the policy of treating the revolted States as
						conquered provinces or territories. He holds that no State can secede, or
						obliterate its organic existence. Its government may be in abeyance, by the
						temporary triumph of treason, just as a mob may for a time override the
						municipal authorities in a town or city; but the existence of the
						sovereignty of the State remains perpetually, and resumes its powers
						whenever the disturbing cause is removed. Preserving the existence of the
						States, Congress is thus without power to define the qualifications of the
						citizen; and the laws in force when treason usurped power, resume their
						supremacy as soon as the power of the insurgents is broken. Upon this
						principle, State governments have been re-established by the loyal people in
						Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia, and in all of them there has
						been no extension of suffrage to the freedmen whose disenthralment all
						acknowledge; and provisional governments have been organized in North
						Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Texas, simply to restore the
						civil rule in the various departments, and each, under the proclamations of
						the President, is to chooses officers by the exercise of the elective
						franchise in accordance with the laws in operation before
						secession--excluding of course such as have, by their overt acts of treason,
						made themselves public enemies.</p>
					<p>While this policy seems to defeat negro suffrage, at least for the present
						and perhaps indefinitely, in the revolted States, we can see no remedy
						within the scope of law. It would have been a flagrant usurpation had
						President Johnson by an arbitrary exercise of power, proclaimed that in the
						organization of the State governments persons should vote who were denied
						the right of suffrage under the laws of those States. Under no circumstances
						whatever could the President exercise such a power. If the States are to be
						treated as conquered provinces and subject to the laws which govern
						territories, Congress, and not the President, must define the qualifications
						of citizenship; and if they are to be treated as States, whose legal power
						was for a time overwhelmed by treason but not obliterated, then the
						President has no more authority to proclaim the enfranchisement of the negro
						in North Carolina or Texas than he has to do it in Pennsylvania. In any
						aspect of the question, the Executive has no power whatever to enlarge the
						right of suffrage. We think that he has acted wisely, because lawfully, in
						the determination of the question, and the issue must in time be decided by
						the competent power of the respective States. To do aught else would be to
						confront the constitution; to bring about the change by violence to law and
						precedent, and the evils resulting therefrom would counterbalance the good
						an hundred fold.</p>
					<p>We share none of the feeling that revolts at the exercise of the elective
						franchise by the negro. He who protests against it merely because the negro
						is black, or because he has been wrongfully enslaved, bows to unmanly
						prejudice or unpardonable ignorance. We have committed the crime and paid
						the terrible penalty of their enslavement for three-quarters of a century,
						and thousands of them have participated in the great struggle for the
						preservation of the Republic, and sealed their devotion to free institutions
						with their blood. They entered the struggle in the darkest hour of the
						war--when treason was victorious, defiant and threatening them with pitiless
						butchery; and they have won from every unprejudiced mind the respect due to
						undaunted valor. To deny the soldier of the Republic the right of suffrage
						because of an exceptional race and color, would be an act unworthy of a free
						people; and we hope to see the day when there shall be such distinction
						among our common defenders.</p>
					<p>We appreciate the force of argument that it is perilous to confer suffrage
						indiscriminately upon a million of men, who are just rescued from the cruel
						bondage that made it a crime to teach them the simplest rudiments of
						education. It is an objection not to race, not to the color, nor to the
						condition of the freedmen; but to the prevailing ignorance of the principles
						of government which must obtain with such a people. True, we confer suffrage
						in exceptional cases much less meritorious and with no higher degree of
						intelligence; but the existence of such a wrong is rather an argument
						against than in favor of its enlargement. We should welcome the standard of
						intelligence--ability to read and write--as the parent of citizenship in all
						classes. With such a qualification ignorance would soon fade away, and a
						nation of over thirty millions would present the sublime spectacle of
						scarcely an exception to the universal education of its people. But in
						stumbling on the question of the ignorance of the emancipated slave, let us
						not be unmindful of the cause of his pitiable deficiency. It is chargeable
						to the predominating race rather than to the victim of slavery. It is our
						act, our law, our social, political, and business ostracism, that has
						plunged and held him remorselessly in mental darkness, and when the crime
						thereof has just avenged itself in a most fearful baptism of blood, it
						becomes not us to stand aside and perpetuate his enslavement in another form
						because we have denied him the fitness for citizenship. Our first duty to
						the freedmen is to enlighten, encourage and strengthen them in their new
						state; and the problem of their citizenship will in time solve itself
						lawfully and justly. That they will become citizens or practically slaves,
						or extinct as a race in the United States, we regard as inevitable. They
						cannot remain as they are now. They will progress or retrograde--increase
						under enlightened and liberal laws, or degrade and diminish under the
						despotism of caste, as the States may be just or ungenerous; and the
						solution of the great question we do not pretend to foresee.</p>
					<p>Looking practically at the proposed enfranchisement of the freedmen, we see
						true hope for it at an early day. It cannot be brought about, as things are,
						except as time may prove their fitness for citizenship and dissipate the
						causeless prejudices which are cherished against them. The general
						government cannot, by any possible means, lawfully secure to them the right
						of suffrage. To the States alone belongs that power and duty; and thus far
						not one of the regenerated States has proposed it. A national convention has
						been suggested; but that would require the States to ratify its action, and
						the States would thus hold the issue in their hands in any event. In
						Pennsylvania it could not even be formally proposed for three years, and it
						would require five years to strike the word "white" from our organic law. By
						the 1st section of article 3d "every white
						freeman of the age of twenty-one years" is a voter, and article 10th
						provides that "no amendment or amendments shall be submitted to the people
						oftener than once in five years." Last year the
						people ratified the amendment enfranchising our soldiers, and no other
						amendment can be offered before 1869, unless by calling a constitutional
						convention. Regardless of the doubtful issue in this State on the merits of
						the question, Pennsylvania is thus precluded from formal action on the
						question at present.</p>
					<p>We have thus presented the question rather as it is than as we would have it,
						and must be content to abide the fruition of time for its solution.</p>

<b>Shall The Leaders Be Pardoned?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although the editors have advocated a "liberal policy" toward the "revolted
					States" and their leaders, they insist that it would be "positively criminal"
					for the federal government to restore citizenship to anyone who had a commission
					in the Army or Navy, or had been a Senator or Congressmen, and subsequently
					joined the rebellion.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Robert E. Lee, late commander-in-chief of the rebel armies, and Alexander H.
						Stephens, late Vice President of the so-called confederate government, have
						filed applications with President Johnson for special pardon. There are
						doubtless scores of similar applications from rebels of lesser note, who
						have held important positions under the government before the war, and under
						the Davis usurpation during the war. Ex-United States Senators and
						Congressmen, ex-Governors, and ex-Army officers of all grades, seem to have
						flooded the Departments of Washington with petitions for their restoration
						to all the rights of citizenship.</p>
					<p>This journal has advocated a liberal policy toward the revolted States, and
						magnanimous dealing even with leaders of the rebellion, now that they have
						failed disgracefully and must be impotent for evil henceforth if merely let
						alone, but to pardon them and make them again citizens would be a degree of
						clemency positively criminal on the part of the general government. No man
						who has held a commission in the Army or Navy of the United States, or who
						has been a Senator or Congressman and subsequently joined in the rebellion,
						or who accepted office as a Senator or Congressman or member of the cabinet
						under the government of treason, or who as Governor of a State aided in its
						secession, or accepted the position of Executive under the rebel
						constitution, should ever be restored to citizenship
							under any circumstance whatever! There can be nothing to
						extenuate the treachery of such men, and it would be suicidal to the
						interests of the Republic just rescued from their bloody grasp, and a
						crowning wrong to the loyal people of the Nation, to make them again
						eligible to the trusts which they need to betray the government by shameless
						perfidy.</p>
					<p>By their own deliberate acts they have wantonly arrayed themselves against
						the government under which they enjoyed the honors of the people, and they
						requited the confidence reposed in them and the distinction conferred, by
						causeless war to destroy the noblest fabric of free government ever reared
						by faithful men; and it is enough, quite enough of leniency on the part of
						the government they have sought in vain to overthrow, if it permits them to
						live. This it must do. Its faith is pledged to every surrendered rebel
						officer and soldier from Lee down that their lives shall not be demanded in
						expiation of their crimes. Quibble as we may about technical distinctions,
						the terms proposed by Gen. Grant to Gen. Lee, and which he accepted by his
						capitulation, preclude the punishment of those men either in the civil or
						military tribunals as traitors. No one misunderstood the spirit and plainly
						expressed language of Gen. Grant's proposal, and no nation can afford to
						violate its solemnly plighted faith. It placed Lee and his armies in the
						position of public enemies, and as such they remain for all practical
						purposes. They have no part, no lot, no interest in the government against
						which they have revolted and deluged the land in fraternal blood to give
						anarchy to thirty millions of people. They are aliens to the Republic,
						strangers to its beneficent rights, and so they must remain. Their homes
						have been sacrificed on the bloody altar of their treason, and the
						fratricide must not be restored to luxury and power while every State is
						dotted with the graves of his victims. As they have wantonly, wickedly,
						murderously made themselves aliens and strangers to the countless blessings
						they enjoyed as citizens, so let them remain. Let them live to wander
						through the land they have stained with gore from the Potomac to the Rio
						Grande, homeless and citizenless, as monuments of the mingled power and
						justice and magnanimity of the great Republic of the World.</p>
					<p>Gen. Lee was the child of favour under this government. He was educated,
						promoted and honored by it; and he left the head-quarters of the
						commander-in-chief to draw his sword against the Republic. We do not known
						that his military career is stained by any immediate act of cruelty at
						variance with the laws of war; but he was the trusted chieftain of the rebel
						cause. No campaign was undertaken without his assent. No policy touching the
						war was adopted without his sanction. His council was potential in the very
						temple of treason's power, and he must at least share the guilt of the
						starvation of prisoners--the crowning crime of treason's fullness of crime,
						unless he shall show that he protested against such monstrous barbarity in
						vain. As yet no evidence has been produced to relieve him of this damning
						charge, and until his skirts are cleared, the government can exercise no
						clemency whatever in his case. If he shall satisfy the unprejudiced
						judgement that he labored fruitlessly to make the rebel government humane,
						it will relieve him of a fearful blot that now stains his reputation; but
						even then we should protest in the name of a Nation that only saved its
						existence by his overthrow, and in the name of the thousands of gallant
						soldiers he has slain, against his restoration to citizenship. Such mercy
						would be a crime. Every consideration of justice forbids it, and the future
						safety of the Republic demands that its discomfited but deadly foes shall
						henceforth have no voice in directing its destiny.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

						the President much to approve and very little to condemn," and in a few

						the Spirit in its lucid intervals, and bid it
						good speed in getting over in support of a sound Union administration. If it
						had leaned a little in that direction in the dark days of the Republic, when
						Johnson stood up against the surges of treason North and South like a wall
						of adamant, and when it counseled only in the interest of the country's
						foes, it would have done the nation some service. Now, when to go wrong
						would be hopeless folly, the Spirit crawls in

<b>Local Items--Changes In The School Law</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece reports that several legislative changes pertaining to the
					state's schools were enacted during the last session of the Assembly.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>CHANGES IN THE SCHOOL LAW--The following changes in the School Law of
						Pennsylvania were adopted by the late Legislature:</p>
					<p>1. Clerks of the Courts of Quarter Sessions are required to furnish the State
						Superintendent a certificate of the formation of any school district,
						whether by incorporation of a borough, the establishment of an independent
						district, or the creation of a new township.</p>
					<p>2. The President of a school board is required to call a meeting of the
						directors upon a written request of three of their number. In case of
						refusal, two directors may call a special meeting, and the business
						transacted thereat shall be legal.</p>
					<p>3. It is absolutely necessary, in order to secure a share of the State
						appropriation, that no teacher shall have been employed in the district
						during the year who had not a viable certificate from the County
						Superintendent, and also that the school shall have been kept open for the
						last four months subsequent to the first Monday in June preceding.</p>
					<p>4. This section relates to the election of County Superintendent. It provides
						that the State Superintendent shall commission such subordinates as are
						certified to have been elected at the tribunal conventions, provided that
						objections be not made, signed by one fifth of the boards of directors of
						the County, and sworn to by at least three of the signers within thirty days
						after election.</p>
					<p>5. The minimum age for admissibility into the Common Schools is raised from
							five to six years.</p>
					<p>Another supplement practically abolishes the system of district institutes
						and re-established the school month at 22 days. District institutes may be
						held on two of these days, but they are permitted, not required.</p>
					<p>The last supplement compels the County Commissioners to make return of the
						triennial enumeration of taxables in each district on or before the first
						Monday in June, 1865. Upon these reforms the distribution of the State
						appropriation is to be based.</p>
