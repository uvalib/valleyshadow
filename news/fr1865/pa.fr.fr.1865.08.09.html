<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. John P. Reed, Sr., is an intelligent and respected citizen of Bedford. He
                        is, we believe, a member of the bar and has tilled important official
                        trusts. He has two sons--John, P. Jr., and Mengel by name--and it may be
                        others, but these have earned for themselves a place in the records of
                        justice. Not knowing to the contrary, we assume that Mr. Reed taught his
                        sons, among other essential virtues, that all their manifold social,
                        religious, and political rights are the fruits of our most beneficient
                        system of government, and that they owe unfaltering devotion to its cause
                        whenever its permanency or priceless principles of freedom are assailed by
                        either foreign or domestic foes. But however faithfully he may have
                        discharged this sacred parental duty, his sons proved faithless to his
                        precepts, to themselves and to their own great inheritance. So far from
                        following the dictates of patriotism when treason made causeless, wicked war
                        to overthrow the government, and responding to the Nation's call in the hour
                        of its deepest peril, Mengel embraced the first favorable opportunity to
                        enlist in the traitors' ranks in 1863, aiming to add to the full measure of
                        his country's woes, and thus served in perfidious, murderous war upon his
                        own home and people. To this crime he was faithful until he was captured, as
                        a prisoner of war and he was held as such until the bloody work of treason
                        ended in discomfiture, when he proposed formally to resume his fidelity to
                        the government by taking the oath of allegiance. The government in its
                        boundless magnanimity permitted him to do so, and he returned to Bedford to
                        enjoy the blessings of the institutions he had vainly sought to destroy, and
                        to mingle with the people again whose sad bereavements he had aided to his
                        utmost power, to shadow with fresh sorrows. A generous people at his home
                        bore with his malignant perfidy to the free North that gave him birth, and
                        the shameless insolence that made him seek the comforts of a home where he
                        had once sought to mark the desolating track of treason's barbarous war. His
                        brother, John P., inspired with hate for the free government under which he
                        had been reared, fled to a foreign land avowedly to escape service in behalf
                        of his imperiled country and the jurisdiction of its laws. When the National
                        enrolment law passed Congress, or was about to pass, he journeyed to Canada,
                        where he supposed that he could unreservedly fraternize with congenial
                        rebels--plotting treason and death to his brethren. He entered an office for
                        the study of law, and meant, as the sequel proves, to remain only until he
                        could return home without danger of being required to aid in preserving the
                        government under which he hoped to live and to which he nominally confessed
                        allegiance. But, although in a distant land, he had forgotten that he had no
                        abiding place, in the eye of the law of either Canada or the United States,
                        other than in Bedford, and he was properly enrolled and drafted a conscript
                        in the Union army. Of course he did not respond, as he had gone away for the
                        purpose of escaping service in the cause of his country, and he quietly and
                        smugly enjoyed British hospitality until our Congress disfranchised all
                        deserters unless they should report within a given period. However much Mr.
                        Jho. P. Reed, Jr. was willing to be called a Canadian when a draft was to be
                        made, he was quite unwilling to be a Canadian in the sense that would
                        prevent him from voting the Democratic ticket whenever an opportunity should
                        offer, and he had his friends at once proceed to appeal to the Provost
                        Marshal to allow him to put in a substitute. Captain Eyster refused; Gen.
                        Hinks finally assented to it, and before he had furnished his substitute the
                        war was manifestly about to close, and he was allowed to pay commutation.
                        Being thus clear of the draft and the rebellion being so out at all fours
                        that future drafts were altogether improbable, he, too, resumed his
                        residence in Bedford.</p>
                    <p>It may be, as alleged, that both these young men behaved on all occasions
                        with becoming reserve and propriety; but while perhaps ninety-nine
                        hundredths of the citizens were disposed simply to treat their perfidy to
                        the government with forbearance or silent contempt, there were a few whose
                        ardor for the cause made them call things by their right names, even at the
                        cost of disturbing the public peace. Among these was Mr. Jacob Crouse, who
                        had acted as an Assistant Provost Marshal in that county, and had doubtless
                        learned in the discharge of his official duties how mean a traitorous
                        sympathizer may be. It is said that he would at times address Mr. Mengel
                        Reed, the ex-rebel hero, as "Johnny Reb," and thus salute him on the street
                        in presence of his companions. Had Mr. Reed retorted on Mr. Crouse by
                        calling him a "Yank," it would have been equally just, but perhaps
                        materially less offensive; and because Mr. Crouse would at times remind him
                        of the companionship he had deliberately chosen and publicly persisted in
                        for more than a year, he deemed it cause for offence. To be reminded of the
                        truth, and of what he would doubtless boast in congenial circles, he felt to
                        be a humiliation in Bedford, and altercation succeeded altercation between
                        Crouse and the brothers Reed until finally the parties met on the street on
                        Tuesday of last week, and Mr. Jho. P. Reed, Jr. shot Mr. Crouse dead.</p>
                    <p>We have not, at the time of this writing, any details of the fatal affray. It
                        may be, as alleged by the Bedford Gazette, that
                        the immediate provocation was all on the side of Crouse; that he was a
                        quarrelsome bully who persistently provoked Mr. Reed without retaliation
                        until words ended in blows and blows in the deadly bullet. Or it may be, as
                        we have heard, that the conduct of the young Reeds was such as justified any
                        loyal man in publicly resenting their traitorous sentiments and actions;
                        that the shooting was deliberately determined upon under the advice of
                        sympathizing friends, and that Mr. Reed practiced with his pistol
                        assiduously before the fatal meeting so as to make sure of his victim. Of
                        these allegations we have no opinion to express. All that we know is that
                        they met; that the skulking conscript was armed while the loyal citizen was
                        not, and the result was the death of the latter on the public street without
                        a moment's warning. The Reed brothers are in custody and we leave them to
                        the verdict of the jury of their country who shall be called to determine
                        the measure of their guilt.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be the determination of the law as to this fearful homicide, can
                        any dispassionate and conscientious citizen doubt where rests the moral
                        responsibility for the murder of Mr. Crouse? If men are educated to espouse
                        the cause of their country's foes; to join their battalions; to wage war
                        against their own homes, kinsmen and neighbors, and to flee the jurisdiction
                        of the law to defy the Nation's call in its day of peril, and do these
                        things with impunity, can it be wondered that it should engender the deepest
                        depth of loathing and contempt to every loyal breast, and that it should
                        even outstrip the bounds of prudence at times as unpunished traitors and
                        sneaking, defaulting conscripts are met on the street-corners pluming
                        themselves as men and citizens! Of such creatures some men will speak what all honest men think, and if
                        breaches of the peace and homicides result there from, who must answer the
                        bar of an enlightened and loyal people, and who at the bar of Him who shall
                        judge all the living. Let each man see well for himself and his household
                        that the blood of Jacob Crouse be not at his door, to cry for vengeance.</p>

<b>Taxable Income</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The Revenue Department at Washington has recognized the propriety of
                    publishing the list of incomes returned for taxation, so that each man may judge
                    of the integrity of his neighbor in assuming his just share of the exactions
                    necessary to sustain our National credit. Believing that it can do no harm--that
                    it can offend no just man and that it may prevent dishonest returns to avoid
                    taxation, we herewith publish the entire list of taxable incomes in
                    Chambersburg, Guilford, Green, Southampton, and Lurgan, and in a future issue we
                    shall give the incomes of the remaining districts. All whose names do not appear
                    on the list have made return[s] that their income does not exceed six hundred
                    dollars:"<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The following candidates will vie for the Democratic nomination for

                    for the Treasurer and Surveyor respectively. Although no candidates have been
                    announced, it is widely believed that C. M. Duncan will run as the party's
                    nominee for state senate and that Mr. Sharpe will decline a re-nomination for
                    Assembly. The article surmises that McClure will get the nod for Sheriff and
                    Doyle for Treasurer. Harbaugh would have won the nomination for Sheriff but both
                    he and Doyle are Catholic and the "Democracy will not award two nominations to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Press of the 2d inst. says that from present
                        indications there is no good reason to doubt that the oil business will
                        speedily recover its wonted prosperity. Every one interested in the oil
                        trade will readily recall the vicissitudes through which the trade has
                        passed since its inception in 1859. In 1860 there were great flowing wells
                        in Venango county--such as the Sherman and Noble Wells--which yielded from
                        two to three thousand barrels per day. The oil became a drug in the market,
                        and sold as low as twenty-five cents per barrel at the wells. As the uses of
                        petroleum were rapidly discovered the article increased in demand and value,
                        and speculation in lands became extensive, until in 1863 and 1864, it became
                        almost a mania. Early in the spring of this year, disastrous freshets
                        overflowed a greater part of the most valuable oil territory along the
                        Allegheny river, which caused a great reduction in the yield by the filling
                        of the wells with water. This put an end for the time to speculation, but
                        the owners of the oil lands have not been idle. New wells have been struck
                        almost daily on the various tributaries of the Allegheny, in Venango county,
                        and the yield is now almost equal to the demand. Boring for oil and the
                        transportation of the same has been a great expense to operators, from the
                        scarcity of labor and high prices of everything. This will in some degree be
                        remedied in a brief time, from the increase of labor now being furnished
                        from the army. The cost of sinking wells will not be so great, and small
                        capitalists will soon be enabled to enter the field. In fact, the
                        indications are strong that we will have this summer and fall such an
                        activity in the oil trade as we have never had before.</p>
                    <p>The receipts from Internal Revenue for July foot up $20,000,000. Estimated
                        receipts for the next two months, $60,000,000.</p>
                    <p>After a few days' suspension of business consequent upon the death of the
                        late Cahier of the Carlisle Deposit Bank it has again opened its doors, and
                        is despatching business as formerly. Mr. J.P. Hassler, the former Assistant
                        Cashier has been elected Cashier. This is a wise and just selection and one
                        that will give universal satisfaction to the stock holders and patrons of
                        the Bank.</p>
                    <p>The total amount of the acknowledged and registered public indebtedness on
                        the 31st of May was $2,635,205,753, and it is now represented to be
                        $2,757,253,275, or an increase of $122,047,522 during the last sixty-one
                        days. The annual interest on the public debt, as it stood on the 31st ult.,
                        was $139,262,468, of which $64,521,837 is payable in coin, and $74,740,630
                        is payable in lawful money. The debt bearing no interest is $357,906,969.
                        Balance in the Treasury, July 31, $116,739,932.56.</p>
                    <p>A dangerous counterfeit of the one-dollar treasury notes issued by the
                        General Government has made its appearance. Excepting a few minor
                        discrepancies, the spurious note is an exact fac
                        similie of the bill. The general appearance of the bill is also very
                        good. The green ink is of a somewhat lighter shade than that used on the
                        genuine, and some parts of the note look scratched and blurred. The figures
                        "1" on the scrollwork on the lower right corner of the note are printed in
                        green; in the genuine they are white. The face of Chase, in the counterfeit,
                        is badly executed, but otherwise the work is well done, and the note well
                        calculated to deceive.</p>
                    <p>Counterfeit fives of the national banks, well executed, are in circulation.
                        The color of the paper is a little paler than the genuine. They are,
                        however, easily detected by observing the position of the letter "I" in the
                        word "This" in the latter, reading "This note is secured by bonds of." The
                        "T" in the genuine is over the left portion of the letter "i" in "United,"
                        while in the counterfeit it is farther to the left, over the middle of the
                        "n" of the same word.</p>
