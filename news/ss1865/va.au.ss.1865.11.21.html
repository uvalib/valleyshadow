                    <p>In speaking of the mortality among the freedmen, the Richmond Times says:</p>
                    <p>"In a county of this State, a gentleman, some time during the year 1863, lost
                        ninety-eight slaves by flight to the Federal lines.--Within two years from
                        the time of the escape of these negroes accurate and reliable information
                        was received, showing that, during the time designated, twenty-five out of
                        ninety-eight negroes had died. Another gentleman, in the same county, lost,
                        about the same time, twenty-six negroes by escape to the Free States. When
                        he heard from them, after a period of thirty-one months, eight of the
                        original number had died. Other similar examples might be given."</p>

<b>The Friends of the Union</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that "it would seem to follow necessarily" from the outcome of the
                    war that "the Union was saved--that the South never got out--that all the States
                    were still in the Union" but instead the North has rejected their own logic,
                    insisting on keeping the South out of the Union, making Southerners "better
                    friends of the Union" than their northern counterparts.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Strange is it may seem, as we stated some time since, the people of the
                        South, who fought so long and so bravely against the Union, are better
                        friends of the Union now than the people of the North who sacrificed the
                        lives of so many thousands in its defence. The North fought for the Union --
                        the South fought against it; the South tired to
                        get out -- the North tried to keep them in; the
                        North succeeded -- the South failed. It would seem to follow necessarily, from
                        the attitudes of the contestants, and the issue of the conflict, that the
                        Union was saved -- that the South never got out --that all the States were
                        still in the Union. The people of the South acknowledge their failure to get
                        out, and claim the rights appertaining to those in the Union. Whereupon the
                        people of the North say, in effect, "You are out of the Union -- we tried to
                        prevent you from going out, and our efforts were crowned with success, yet
                        you are out of the Union, and not entitled to the rights belonging to those
                        in the Union -- you cannot be represented, and yet we will tax you for the
                        support of the Government -- we ignore the "old fogy" principles of our
                        revolutionary forefathers, for which they "fought, bled and died," that
                        there should not be taxation without
                        representation."</p>
                    <p>They do not say this in language, but in conduct. If they were as good
                        friends of the Union as the people of the South are now, they would restore,
                        immediately, to the citizens of the Southern States all the rights which
                        they possessed before the war.--Though the South can do nothing more than
                        claim her rights, the people of the North, in the language of the N. Y.
                            News, have it "within their power to
                        re-establish the political system to its normal condition; it was that they
                        professed to fight for; they have conquered; how is it that they now throw
                        obstacles in the way of the consummation to attain which they sent millions
                        to the field and hundreds of thousands to their graves.</p>
                    <p>When the Southern States attempted to secede from the Union, every effort was
                        made to drag them back; now that they are anxious to return to the Union,
                        the door is shut in their faces. They were told they could not go out, and
                        now they are told that they can not come in. The janitors stand at the
                        threshold and demand their entrance fee. The Union must and shall be
                        preserved at all hazards, was the war cry; but the peace cry is, there shall
                        be no rehabilitation of the Union except upon such and such conditions; and
                        those conditions are of a nature to cancel the very essence of that
                        republicanism that was represented as the object of the struggle. To
                        preserve the integrity of the Confederation was the avowed purpose of the
                        war; why then do those who carried on the war neglect and refuse to fulfill
                        its purpose now that there is now impediment? It is very strange that the
                        respective positions of the contestants should be reversed; but so it is.
                        The Southern States are now clamoring to resume their legitimate places in
                        the political household, and the Administration is holding them back. It
                        denies them the very privilege that it sought to enforce upon them as a
                        duty."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Buffalo Courier publishes the following private letter of the Hon. A. H.
                        H. Stuart, of Virginia:</p>
                    <p>Staunton, Va., October, 1865</p>
                    <p>* * * * It seems to me that we are on the eve of a general break-up and
                        re-organization of parties. We must adopt a new name, and that name should
                        be expressive of the mission of the new organization. The object will be to
                        establish the ascendancy of sound constitutional principles, and I can think
                        of no more appropriate name than they "Constitutional Party." With such a
                        party, and such a name, I think we must defeat the Radicals in any future
                        contest. Mr. Johnson's policy will give us a firm ground to stand upon in
                        the out-set, and the restoration of the authority of the Constitution, in
                        its original simplicity, will form a permanent basis of Union in the future.</p>
                    <p>I can hardly think the Republicans will venture to adhere to the test oath,
                        in view of the fact of its flagrant unconstitutionality. If they do, they,
                        will place a weapon in the hands of their adversaries which can be used
                        greatly to their disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>I mean to present myself and demand my seat as one legally elected and
                        returned, and possessing all the constitutional requirements of eligibility.
                        If admitted, I will give a cordial support to Mr. Johnson's policy of
                        reconstruction, and use ever effort to restore tranquility and good feeling
                        to the Union. If excluded; I will return home and calmly await the
                        development of events. I certainly will not make way for a more pliant
                        representative.</p>
                    <p>So far as Virginia is concerned, every vestige of opposition to the Federal
                        authority has vanished. The people were never, at heart, in favor of
                        secession, and they accept cheerfully the results of the war. In regard to
                        the principal leaders of the attempted revolution, the only fear is that
                        they will run into the other extreme of abject subserviency. Having never
                        lost my balance by going for secession, I do not wish to lose it now by
                        going for consolidation. Moderate men must now preserve the equilibrium of
                        our institutions by holding to the Constitution with a steady hand.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully your friend,</p>
                    <p>Alex H. H. Stuart</p>
