<b>The Oath of Amnesty</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors encourage all their readers to take the oath of amnesty, made
                    available by President Johnson's "humane motives." They warn that failure to
                    take the oath will leave Southerners "at the mercy of every malicious enemy."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A strange delusion prevails in regard to the propriety of taking the oath of
                        amnesty. May seem to think that there is no necessity for taking it and that
                        they can take it or not, as happens to suit the fancy of individuals.</p>
                    <p>This is a dangerous error, and on which should be promptly dispelled.</p>
                    <p>Under existing laws of the U. States, every citizen of the Southern States,
                        [with very few exceptions] has been guilty of treason. Treason consists not
                        only if waging war against the United States, but giving "aid and comfort"
                        to its [unclear]. "Aid and comfort" are very broad terms. They embrace all
                        who have aided or assisted the Confederate Government, during the war. All
                        who have been in the military or civil service of either Government -- all
                        who have given horses, arms, clothing, food, or money to any of the
                        Confederate soldiers -- every Tunker who has paid $500 to the C. States, to
                        keep out of the service -- every detailed farmer who has raised provisions
                        for the C. S. Government, under contract with it has given aid and comfort
                        to the enemies of the U. S., and has, therefore, technically been guilty of
                        treason, and is liable to its penalties. These penalties are confiscation,
                        imprisonment, and death.</p>
                    <p>The President of the U. S. influenced by human motives, has offered amnesty,
                        or pardon, to all, except certain specified classes, on terms prescribed by
                        himself. But the other is conditional.--He says you may be pardoned if you will take the oath of amnesty.</p>
                    <p>That is the condition and the only condition, on which the pardon is
                        promised. Those who do not choose to take the oath, are not entitled to the
                        pardon -- those who do take it, are absolved from the penalties.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen, therefore, that all who desire pardon, had better take the
                        oath without delay. If they do not, both their property and persons are in
                        danger. They will, at least, be at the mercy of every malicious enemy, until
                        they do take it. The oath squares the account, and relieves the party from
                        all apprehension.</p>
                    <p>Every man, therefore, who wishes to stand on a safe footing, and to have his
                        life, liberty and property secure from hazzard, had better take it without
                        any hesitation.</p>
                    <p>If they fail to do so, they may find proceedings instituted against them, in
                        the U. S. Court, and then it will be too late -- the door will be slammed in
                        their faces. Then they will begin to whine and say: "I did not know such
                        would be the consequences; I always intended to take the oath, but was too
                        busy, &amp;." But it will then be too late, and they must take the
                        consequences of their folly. It would be better for them to leave anything
                        else undone to attend to this most important duty.</p>
                    <p>Let all then take warning in time.--The oath can certainly do no harm. It
                        requires nothing unreasonable, and it will certainly save all who take much
                        trouble and anxiety in the future.</p>
                    <p>We have thus given our advise to our readers. If they choose to disregard it,
                        well and good. We, at least, have discharged our duty as a journalist.</p>

                    <p>Staunton, Va., July 7, 1865,</p>
                    <p>Hon. A. H. H. Stuart,</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--There is a question of great public
                        concern how much discusses, and as you are known to have no personal
                        interest in the matter, we are requested by many citizens to obtain your
                        legal opinion upon it -- namely: "Can a person otherwise qualified and who
                        has taken the oath of amnesty and of fidelity,
                            but who held office under the late
                        Confederate or State governments, vote or hold office under the existing
                        State Constitution." Be pleased to give the point the consideration which
                        its importance demands, and let us know the conclusion of your mind.</p>
                    <p>I am respectfully your obt. servant,</p>
                    <p>N. K. Trout, one of</p>
                    <p>Comr. of Election for Augusta Co.</p>
                    <p>Staunton, July 8th, 1865</p>
                    <p>N. K. Trout, Esq.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--I have had the honor to receive you not of the 7th inst.,
                        requesting me, on behalf of yourself and your Associate Commissioners of
                        Election for Augusta county, to give my opinion as to the legal effect of
                        President Johnson's Proclamation of Amnesty, upon the eligibility to office
                        and capacity to vote of persons embraced by its terms.</p>
                    <p>I regret that i have not access to my library, so as to make a thorough
                        examination of all the authorities bearing on the subject, but as my
                        impressions, founded on general principles are very decided I will state
                        them, in as few words as I can, and fortify them by references to such
                        standard authors as are before me.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that if there be any one proposition which has been more
                        firmly established than another, by the terrible struggle through which our
                        country has passed. It is that the Constitution of the U. S. and all laws
                        passed in pursuance thereof, are the supreme laws of the land, anything in
                        any State Constitution or laws to the contrary notwithstanding. As a
                        corrollary to this proposition, it must be conceded, that all proclamation
                        of the President, and other executive action, following up the Constitution
                        and laws of the U. S., and intended to give practical effect to them are of
                        like permanent authority.</p>
                    <p>If we bear this cardinal proposition in mind it will give much aid in solving
                        the difficulties which surround th subject.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution of Virginia provides that "no person shall hold any office
                        under this Constitution who has held office under the so-called Confederate
                        government, or under any rebellious State Government, or who has been a
                        member of the so-called Confederate Congress, or a member of any State
                        Legislature in rebellion, against the authority of the United States,
                        excepting those from County officers."</p>
                    <p>It also requires that every one who shall seek to hold any office under the
                        Constitution of Virginia shall take and subscribe the following oath: "I do
                        solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the U. S.
                        and the laws made in pursuance thereof, as the supreme law of the State of
                        Virginia, or in the ordinances of the Convention which assembled at
                        Richmond, on 13th Feb., 1861, to the contrary notwithstanding, and that I
                        will uphold and defend the government of Virginia, as restored by the
                        Convention which assembled at Wheeling on 11th of June, 1861, and that I
                        have not since the 1st of January, 1864, voluntarily given aid or
                        assistance, in any way, to those in rebellion against the Government of the
                        United States for the purpose of promoting the same.</p>
                    <p>The language of the Constitution and oath, is very broad and comprehensive,
                        and if they be consistent with the constitution and laws of the U. S., the
                        effect will be to disfranchise probably 99 out of every 100 our citizens.
                        For whatever opinions parties may have entertained in regard to the
                        unconstitutionality of secession, and the inexpediency and folly of
                        attempting to dissolve the Union, there is hardly a man to be found, who
                        after the war had been commenced, and his sons and brothers and near
                        relations were forced into it be conscription, did not furnish them with
                        horses, clothing food, money, and other articles necessary to their comfort
                        and thereby incapacitate himself taking the prescribed oath.</p>
                    <p>We cannot disguise the fact that the object and effect of the provisions of
                        the constitution above quoted, were to impose other and onerous penalties on
                        persons guilty of treason, in addition to those imposed by the laws of the
                        U. S. It matters not what the form of the disfranchisement may be: it is
                        substantially a penalty for an offence.</p>
                    <p>Treating it as penalty two questions present themselves.</p>
                    <p>1st. Is it competent for a State Government to impose penalties for an
                        offence against the U. S. in addition to, and different from those which the
                        Congress of the U. S. has thought proper to impose and</p>
                    <p>If such penalties be imposed, how far will the pardon of the offence, by the
                        President, granted in pursuance of the constitution and laws of the U. S.
                        operate to relieve the parties from such penalties.</p>
                    <p>The constitution of U. S. , ARt. III, Sec. 3, declares that "Treason against
                        the United States shall consist only in levying war against them of in
                        adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be
                        convicted of Treason, unless, on the testimony of two witnesses to the same
                        overt act, or by confession in open court."</p>
                    <p>3d, "The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but
                        no attainder of the treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture,
                        except during the life of the person attained."</p>
                    <p>It seems to be an established principle that in those cases in which the
                        constitution of the U. S. has conferred power on Congress to legislate on
                        any subject affecting the general interests; that power is exclusive in its
                        character, and it is not competent of the State Legislature to assume
                        jurisdiction over the same subjects. The Supreme Court so held in regard to
                        the subject of naturalization, 2 Wheaton, 209, and in regard to the
                        regulation of commerce between the States, in Gibbons vs.. Ogden, 9; Wheaton 1, and so of the Bankrupt laws.</p>
                    <p>If was maintained in regard to those subjects, that unless the power of
                        Congress to legislate was exclusive, endless confusion must ensue from
                        conflicting legislation between the States and U. S. and among the States
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>The clause which I have quoted shows that Congress has the "power to deduce
                        the punishment of treason." Following the doctrine settled in analagous
                        cases of naturalization,. and the regulation of inter-States commerce, I am
                        warranted in assuming that the power to declare the punishment of treason is
                        vested exclusively in Congress. If it were not so, there would be no
                        uniformity in the system of penalties. An offender would be punished in
                        Virginia by one set of penalties, in other States by others, which would be
                        subversive of all our ideas of justice and right.</p>
                    <p>The subject of treason against the government of the U. S. properly belongs
                        to that government, and I submit that when in the exercise of its legitimate
                        functions. Congress declares what the punishment of the offence shall be, it
                        is not competent for any State constitution or law to add to or take from
                        the penalties prescribed by Congress.</p>
                    <p>I wold also here suggest (for it would extend this letter too much to discuss
                        the question) whether the penal provisions of the constitution of Virginia,
                        is not of questionable validity, under the clause of the constitution of the
                        U. S. which prohibits a State from passing any ex post
                            facto law. An ex post facto law is
                        defined to e one "which renders an act punishable in a manner in which it
                        was not punishable when it was committed." 6, Cranch, 188.</p>
                    <p>The constitution of Va., was adopted on 13th Feb. 1864,and when it denounces
                        the penalty of disfranchisement against all who held office at any time
                        under the Confederate government, even as early as 1861, it seems to me in
                        conflict with the prohibition above alluded to.</p>
                    <p>I come now to the consideration of the second question above stated.</p>
                    <p>The constitution gives to the President, Art. II, Sec. 2, clause 1, the power
                        to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the U. S., except in
                        cases of impeachment.</p>
                    <p>I take it this power is plenary as well as exclusive. The President is the
                        only person who can grant the pardons embraces the whole offence, and all
                        its incidents and consequences. Bacon says in his abridgment, Vol. 5, page
                        293, that "it seems agreed that a pardon of treason or felony, even after an
                        attainder, so far clears the party from the infamy and all other
                        consequences thereof, that he may have an action against any one who shall
                        thereafter call his traitor or felon; for the pardon makes him, as it were,
                        a new man."</p>
                    <p>In Denning's case, 10 John's, 483, it was held that a person sentenced to the
                        State prisons for life, and afterwards pardoned, is restored to his rights
                        and duties as a parent and becomes entitled to the custody of his infant
                        children who had been, on account of his civil death, placed under care of
                        guardians.</p>
                    <p>Now it seems to me that where a case is clearly embraced, by the terms of the
                        President's proclamation of amnesty, the guilt of the party with all its
                        penalties and consequences, is removed.--He is made, as it were, a new man,
                        and is restored to every right that he would have possession if had never
                        been guilty of that offence. So far as he is concerned, all laws imposing
                        penalties are inoperative. He is taken out of the sphere of their influence.
                        A pardon is an entire thing. It reaches through the whole subject to which
                        it is applied. It sweeps away, and blots out every consequence of the
                        commission of the offence. It regenerates and make a new man of this
                        offence.</p>
                    <p>To maintain the competency of State Constitution, to impose disfranchisements
                        or other penalties of the offence of treason, which the pardon of the
                        President cannot remove, you must hold that a State can abridge the
                        constitutional powers of the President. The Constitution of the U. S. gives
                        the President plenary power to pardon. There is but one limitation to it,
                        and that is in cases of impeachment. Now, can it be possible that while the
                        President, by pardon, has power to relieve from the penalty of confiscation,
                        imprisonment, or death, he cannot absolve from the minor penalties sought to
                        be imposed by State authority? Does not this involve the right of a State to
                        trench on the prerogative of the President of U. S., and reverse the
                        fundamental principle that the Constitution and laws of U. S. are the
                        supreme law of the land? To allow a State to curtail the power of the
                        President to pardon, to absolve from all the
                            consequences of the offence, is practically to assert the
                        supremacy of a State over the U. S. authorities? The consequences might be
                        most disastrous. Each State might prescribe its own limitations to the power
                        of the Executive, and the whole policy of the Federal Government might be
                        frustrated. There would be no uniformity in the punishment in different
                        States, and the prerogative of the Executive would be rendered worthless.</p>
                    <p>I take it when the President grants a pardon, it removes every vestage of the
                        offence, and in the language of Bacon "all the consequences thereof."</p>
                    <p>Those views have been hastily thrown together, (for you informed me a prompt
                        answer was requested,) but I believe they embody, in substance, the true
                        doctrine on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Hence I conclude that all persons who have been specially pardoned, or who
                        have been absolved by the terms of the amnesty are restored to all their
                        rights a citizens, precisely to as great an extent as if they had never
                        committed any offence, and may thereof, be elected to office or vote for
                        officers, notwithstanding the prohibitory clauses in the Constitution of
                        Va., said clauses being in conflict with the Constitution of the U. S. and
                        therefore of no effect.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, your ob't serv't,</p>
                    <p>Alex H. H. Stuart.</p>
