<b>Letter of Hon. A. H. H. Stuart</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from Stuart, just elected to Congress, to the editor of the New
                    York Times, who had written that no one unable to take the test-oath would be
                    seated in Congress. Stuart defends his decision not to take the oath, which he
                    holds to be unconstitutional.<br>

<b>A Sacred Duty</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that it is the "solemn and sacred duty" of the next Virginia
                    legislature to provide for the "maimed and wounded and helpless among her sons"
                    since the United States will not provide for "technical 'rebels' against her
                    authority."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We concur with the Richmond Whig that there is
                        one solemn and sacred duty incumbent on the legislature of Virginia soon to
                        assemble. It is, to declare the will of the people that the maimed and
                        wounded and helpless among her sons, whose prospects in life have been
                        blasted by a devotion of their persons to her service in the field, shall be
                        a sacred charge upon their affectionate care and bounty. This question ought
                        not to be embarrassed by any considerations touching the justice, legality
                        or unconstitutionality of the cause in which these brace and chivalrous
                        soldiers have suffered. If the late war was wrong, the State nevertheless
                        put them into that war. The State called them to arms. For the State
                        thousands upon top of thousands now sleep beneath the sod of a hundred
                        battle-fields. Their bones are mingled with the dust of Georgia, the
                        Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and of every State where they were
                        called upon to uphold and defend the standard which Virginia placed in their
                        hands. Shall the survivors, with shattered health and armless sleeves, who
                        offered their lives at the call of Virginia, be suffered to pine in want and
                        neglect? The United States takes care of her maimed heroes -- but the United
                        States cannot, perhaps, provide for technical "rebels" against her
                        authority. This duty, then, devolves upon the Old Dominion, and there is not
                        a brave and true man from the Penobscott to the Rio Grande, whatever his
                        views about the "rebellion," who will not applaud the act of noble justice
                        by which Virginia shall provide for her maimed and scarred sons.</p>
                    <p>We hope that Gov. Pierpont, who has demeaned himself so well and wisely in
                        his high office, will see his duty clear in giving this suggestion the
                        influence and endorsement of his earnest and energetic recommendation. For
                        such a recommendation would embalm him in the memories of thousands of as
                        brave and noble men as ever labored and suffered in any cause.</p>

<b>The Test Oath</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Suggests that the journals of the state which called for the election of
                    candidates who could take the test-oath so as to take their seats and then work
                    to repeal the oath should "now insist upon its repeal at the earliest moment."<br>

                    desperation," will once again take up arms, allowing the North to inflict "more
                    blood and fire and desolation."<br>

<b>Local--Imprisoned</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer suggests that because of the "spirit of improvement" and the
                    "rush of business" in Staunton, he finds "confinement preferable to liberty" in
                    the streets, where one is met by "hammers, saws, planes, and paint brushes." The
                    "oldest citizens" are easily lost, unable to recognize "what used to be the most
