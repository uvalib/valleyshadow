                    possesses the Constitutional qualifications," considerations of "duty and sound

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The question which seems to be perplexing the minds of the citizens a this
                        time is: "What manner of men should be elected to represent them in the
                        Halls of Congress?" Some maintain that they should elect only such as are
                        willing to take the oath embodied in the Congressional act of July 1862,
                        thereby swearing, "without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion"
                        that "they have voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel or
                        encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility" to the United States --
                        that they "have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government,
                        authority, power or constitution within the United States hostile or
                        inimical thereto." We showed in our issue of last week, by quoting the
                        qualification of eligibility prescribed in the Constitution, that the act of
                        Congress, is palpably unconstitutional, null and
                        void. The object of the Constitution in granting to the people the
                        privilege of electing members of Congress is that the sentiments of the
                        people may be represented. It requires
                        collections to be held every two years that Congress might always be true
                        reflex of popular sentiment. No man who can conscientiously take the
                        Congressional oath would be a fair exponent of the sentiments of the people,
                        and any who would take it otherwise than conscientiously should not be
                        respected, mush less chosen as the honored Representative and guardian of
                        the public interests. If the people should elect men as their
                        Representatives who can take that unconstitutional test oath, they would be
                        responsible for the course they would pursue, however objectionable it might
                        be to them. Rather than be represented by persons who have not entertained
                        the sentiments of their constituents it would be better to have
                        representatives at all; for it is far better not to be represented than to
                        be misrepresented. The people should elect at this time their ablest, most
                        conservative and most prudent and discreet men.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the voters have the right to choose any man who possesses the
                        Constitutional qualifications, we believe that duty and sound policy now
                        require of them to choose such as have not been prominently connected with
                        the rebellion, and against whom no reasonable objection can be urged. Then
                        if the radicals in Congress should deny them admission on the ground of
                        their refusal to take an unconstitutional oath, the outrage would arouse all
                        the latent conservatism of the North -- awaken it from its Rip Van Winkle
                        sleep == and cause the radicals to be overwhelmed with popular indignation.
                        We should do our duty to ourselves, boldly and fearlessly, and leave the
                        consequence in protecting hands of a gracious Providence. We believe it
                        would be better for us, if our chosen Representatives should find the doors
                        rudely slammed in their faces, and admittance peremptorily denied them. If
                        we should be denied representation, we should be exempt from taxation; for
                        the great principle involved in the war of the revolution was, "that there
                        should not be taxation without representation." The radical majority in the
                        next Congress will be so great that our Representatives, if admitted, will
                        not have the power to control legislation, but, by their ineffectual
                        opposition, may only add increased hostility to the tyranizing majority. If
                        we were allowed a choice between ineffectual representation with taxation,
                        and exemption from taxation without representation, we would prefer the
                        latter.</p>
                    <p>Virginia is either one of the United States or she is not -- she is either in
                        the Union or she is out. If she is in the Union, she is entitled to be
                        represented in Congress by such men of her choice as possess the
                        qualifications prescribed in the Constitution; and if she is out of the
                        Union, she is entitled to a free and independent Government of her own. She
                        considers herself a member of the Union, and, as such, recognizes her
                        obligations to the Constitution of the United States, and claims the right
                        to be represented in Congress by persons possessing the Constitutional
                        qualifications, and denies the right of that or any other branch of the
                        Government to impose any restrictions upon eligibility other than those
                        specified in the Constitution. She knows her rights and will maintain them.

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Whig</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>So long as there was any hope of a successful issue, says the Richmond Whig,
                        the people of Virginia and the South continued their resistance to the
                        Federal armies, and fought with bravery and resolution worthy of men deeply
                        in earnest, and which should command for them the respect and admiration
                        even of their most malignant enemies. But when the struggle was brought to a
                        close by the surrender of the Confederate armies, they promptly and
                        unanimously resumed their respective business avocations, with a sincere
                        determination to accept and abide by the legitimate results of the war, and
                        with no earthly thought of offering further resistance, in any shape or
                        form, to the constituted authorities of the land. That they did not once
                        fall to hugging and kissing those with whom they had been so long engaged in
                        deadly combat, and playing the part generally of toadies and boot-licks, is
                        to be ascribed to the fact that, though overwhelmed by superior power, they
                        were still men and gentlemen, high-minded, honorable an sensitive, capable
                        of enduring any amount of hardship, suffering and privation in behalf of
                        their cause, but wholly incapable of doing or saying anything which would
                        tend to diminish their own self-respect and disgrace them in the eyes of the
                        world. It is not always those who talk loudest and biggest in regard to
                        their loyalty and patriotism who can be most depended on. And consequently
                        the people of this State, conscious of the rectitude of their intentions, do
                        not consider it either appropriate or necessary to reiterate every hour in
                        the day that they mean to conform to the oaths they have taken and the
                        obligations they assumed as citizens of the United States. They very
                        properly and pointedly argue that, if the people of the North refuse to
                        believe them on oath, they will hardly believe them on their mere word; and
                        hence they are naturally reluctant to indulge in repeated and profuse
                        professions of patriotism and loyalty.</p>

<b>"Idiots or Knaves"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

                        Virginia cast her lot with her Southern sisters. He had clung to the Union,
                        but after Secession was accomplished, his sympathies were with his own
                        people -- with Lee and Jackson and our glorious soldiers. He prayed
                        fervently for our success. When after three years of blood-shed, he
                        perceived the cause was lost, he struggled and prayed as fervently, for an
                        honorable settlement through negotiation.--Dr. Woods said he could not take
                        the Congressional Oath -- he had taken three oaths, and wanted to taken no
                        more. Those he had taken he meant to keep. (Looking at his friends Mr.
                        Stuart) he said he had signed no ordinance of Secession, to prevent his
                        taking his seat if elected. African slavery was dead -- let us accept the
                        fact. Let it die: it had obstructed the material progress of Virginia. As
                        for the negro, he is the chief sufferer, and we should treat him kindly; for
                        he had behaved well during the war, considering the circumstances. He was if
                        favor of getting rid of them by sending them to territories, or elsewhere.
                        There was no cause for despondency or despair. We must go to work and build
                        up the State. The speaker expressed his confidence in President Johnson, who
                        he had no doubt would make himself the President of the whole nation.
                        Parties in the South, he said, were dead.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Woods had concluded, Col. T. J. Randolph introduced to the meeting
                        the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart said that he had been brought out as a candidate in the most
                        unexpected manner, and had felt it his duty to yield to the numerous and
                        urgent solicitations which he had received. He regarded the time as
                        involving the most momentous Crisis. He had been a member of the Virginia
                        Convention in 1861. He had been educated to regard the Union as the great
                        palladium of our liberties, and had clung to the Union, and cherished it
                        with fondest affection. For its disruption he blamed North and South.--There
                        were two antagonistic parties, and each contributed to work that
                        dismemberment. They were the Fire-eaters and Abolitionists. If you want to
                        break a string, said Mr. S., you catch it at each end, and pull them in
                        opposite directions. The two parties that several the Union were
                        antagonistic, and pulling in opposite directions -- but
                            with a common object. He had no tolerance of either of these
                        parties -- for the leaders -- the people had been their dupes and victims.
                        He foresaw the danger in 1860, and was the first man to suggest the
                        organization of a Union party. Subsequently as a member of the Virginia
                        Senate he was active in getting up the Peace Congress. In the Convention he
                        voted persistently against Secession. He resisted it with all his power to
                        the end. His name stands recorded against it. Others changed their votes
                        when a majority appeared for it, but he never did. At a later day, when
                        people had ratified it at the polls, as their representatives, he signed the
                        ordinance. He then declined a re-election to the Senate, because he felt
                        that he was not in proper sympathy with the people. But he was not an
                        indifferent spectator: he was a Virginian -- and as Ruth said to Naomi, he
                        exclaimed, "whither thou goest, I will go:and where thou lodges, I will
                        lodge; they people shall be my people, and thy God my God." He went with his
                        sons and brothers, and nephews, and brothers-in-law. Now that the sword had
                        decided the contest, he accepted the decision. If elected he could not state
                            what he should do. It was impossible to
                        foresee what questions would arise, or what measures should be adopted. He
                        gave no pledges. He would be governed by circumstances, and do the best he
                        could for the country and for Virginia.--Slavery was dead. It could not be
                        restored. The negro would become extinct or be removed. As a practical man,
                        he accepted the abolition of slavery. The next Congress will have great questions before it. It will be the grandest
                        theatre ever presented to the statesman. As to the oath, it is unwarranted
                        by the Constitution, and therefore null and void. He should despise himself,
                        if he took it; he could not take without perjury. No one who had given a
                        soldier a blanket, or a nights's lodging, could take the oath. Mr. S here
                        argued the Constitutionality of the oath. The Constitution, and not
                        Congress, foxes the qualifications of members of Congress, nor can one
                        Congress prescribe rules of a succeeding Congress. The present dominant
                        party will be certainly prostate in two years, and suppose their opponents
                        require a member of Congress then to swear that he was never a Republican?
                        The pledges of the Southern people, he said, must be fulfilled. They were
                        now citizens of the Union. it was one country -- and its flag was
                        henceforth, our flag. Let us discharge our full
                        duty. The speaker then declaimed against the cherishing of old prejudices --
                        all that he urged should be buried.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis followed Mr. Stuart in a very brief speech. He rested his claims to
                        the suffrages of the people on this: that he could take
                            that oath. If he was elected, he would take it. He only desired
                        to go to Congress because he thought he could be of service to the people.
                        Mr. Stuart could not take, and he knew it. Mr. Stuart and himself stood side
                        by side in th Convention; but Mr. S. had signed the ordinance of secession
                        he did not. He had nothing to retract. He was proud of his record. He was
                        the only member east of the Alleghanies that refused to sign the ordinance.
                        The question was one of eligibility: if you send Dr. Woods or Mr. Stuart,
                        you will go unrepresented.--He would endeavor to have his test oath and all
                        other restrictions, removed. Mr. L. here asked Mr. Stuart, if he had meant
                        to denounce him in his remarks about neutrals? Mr. S. said, certainly not. Mr. Lewis
                        was glad of it: he was no neutral. (Maj. Green Peyton in the crowd then
                        asked, "Then, what were you, Mr. Lewis, if you were not a neutral?") Mr. L.
                        said -- I believed that the Southern Confederacy, if established, could not
                        last five years. L. was for the United States.</p>
