<b>Suffrage In The Free States</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reports on the practice of many "Free States" which "make

                    <p>The following Free States make color (or race) the test of voting: New
                        Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin,
                        California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas. Negroes are not permitted to vote in
                        these States.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution of Ohio limits the elective franchise to "every white
                        freeman," but by the decision of the Courts of that State, every person of
                        one-half white blood, is deemed "a white male citizen," and such are
                        permitted to vote.</p>
                    <p>"Missouri, by her late Free State Constitution, excludes the negro from
                        voting."</p>

                        York, permit negro suffrage to a greater or less extent.</p>
                    <p>In the Constitution of West Virginia, the privilege of suffrage was conferred
                        only upon "white male citizens."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The President's letter to the Governor of Mississippi, with reference to the
                        militia difficulty, and his speech, published in this issue to a large
                        number of Southern gentlemen who called upon him in Washington attest his
                        generous confidence in the Southern people, and liberal sentiments towards
                        them. The speech shows that the President entertains for the South the
                        kindest feelings and indicates a generous and conciliatory policy. We are a
                        little curious to see what the Radical journals in the North, who are
                        constantly vilifying the Government, will now say of the man whom they have
                        been representing as a Nero. It is the duty of the South to sustain the
                        President and his policy as expressed in this speech. Let us demonstrate
                        that the confidence he reposes in us is not misplaced; let us sustain him in
                        his grand struggle for restoration upon constitutional principles; and the
                        future will once more be restored to all her rights and privileges, under
                        the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We believe the President is inflexible in his purpose to do what is just and
                        right, regardless of the heavy pressure brought to bear upon him by the
                        Radicals, North and South. It is, therefore, the duty of every true
                        Conservative man to rally to his support, and sustain him in this mighty
                        struggle to steer the Ship of State safely through the breakers of
                        Radicalism. We hail these utterances of the President with the liveliest
                        satisfaction.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A report on a meeting in Washington, in which "a large number of Southern
                    men" met with the President to praise his "sound and judicious policy" regarding
                    Reconstruction. The President responded with a speech "full of subdued
                    eloquence" in which he explained that while he opposed secession, so too does he
                    oppose the "consolidation or concentration of power" in the federal government.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Fellow Citizens:</p>
                    <p>In obedience to earnest solicitations from many citizens of different
                        counties of the District, seconded by the unanimous wish, of a mass meeting
                        of the people of Augusta County, I have been induced to declare myself a
                        candidate for Congress. The position was once which I neither sought nor
                        desired. Whoever may be elected will find it no bed of roses -- but having
                        been tendered to men under circumstances so flattering, I did not fell at
                        liberty to shrink from its trials and responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Having served the country in various public offices, from time to time during
                        the last 28 years, I have a right to presume that my political antecedents
                        are not entirely unknown to the people.</p>
                    <p>i was educated in the belief that the best interests of our country were
                        inseparably associated with our national Union, and taught to cherish it as
                        the Palladium of our liberties. As a member of the 27th Congress, and at
                        later periods as one of the constitutional advisers of Mr. Fillmore, a
                        Senator of Virginia, and a member of the Convention of 1861, my best
                        energies were dedicated to the preservation of the Union.</p>
                    <p>I was inflexibly opposed to the secession of Virginia and voted persistently
                        against the ordinance which proposed to sever our connexion with the United
                        States. I believed, and in oral and printed addresses to the Convention and
                        the people, I declared my belief that secession was unwise, inexpedient,
                        unconstitutional and impracticable. I endeavored to prove to the people that
                        it was fraught with evils which the mind could not contemplate without
                        horror. Amidst all the tumult of excitement, when it required no small
                        degree of courage to stand up against the popular clamor; and when day after
                        day, members were asking leave to change their votes so as to conform to
                        public sentiment, I remained unmoved. I refused to change my vote against
                        the ordinance of secession, because my opinion of its mischievous character
                        remained and still remains unchanged.</p>
                    <p>The ordinance passed the Convention on the 17th of April 1861. It was
                        submitted to the popular vote for ratification or rejection on 4th Thursday
                        in May following. In the mean time the war had commenced. Hostile armies
                        were within the borders of Virginia, and the vote was a mere matter of form.
                        I voted at the election for ratifying the ordinance, not because I approved,
                        but because I do not believe that the war having begun, unless we all went
                        together, we should have an internecine war added to the civil war which had
                        already been inaugurated.</p>
                    <p>At the adjourned session of the Convention some moths after the ordinance had
                        been ratified by the almost unanimous voice of my constituents, I signed the
                        ordinance not because I approved it (for I still refused to change my vote
                        on the journal) but because I believed it to be my representative duty to
                        authenticate their act with usual forms.</p>
                    <p>When Virginia united her fortunes with those of the Southern Confederacy, I
                        felt it to be my duty to acquiesce in her decision and to submit to the
                        authority of the new government. But I felt it equally due to myself to
                        retire from public life, and to remain in retirement, although and honorable
                        and lucrative position was rendered to me by Mr. Davis.</p>
                    <p>During the war I abstained from all participation in public affairs except on
                        two or three occasions when I was called to address public meetings to urge
                        contribution for the relief of the suffering soldiers, and the prisoners
                        going to as well as returning from the North.</p>
                    <p>My age relieve me from the obligation to render military service, and all the
                        assistance I gave to the Confederate cause was by feeding the hungry and
                        clothing the naked, and nursing the sick Confederate soldiers, and making
                        myself, and urging others to make liberal donations for their relief.</p>
                    <p>But I would be wanting in candor if I fail to say that I did this voluntarily
                        and that after my son and nephews, and brother-in-law, and other relatives
                        had been drawn into the contest, by the inexorable conscription, all my
                        sympathies were with my own people. Though I believed Virginia to be wrong I
                        could not do otherwise than rejoice when she rejoiced and mourn when she
                        mourned. I was proud of Lee and Jackson and Johnston and my kinsman Stuart,
                        and the host of other gallant Virginians who won immortal honor in an
                        ill-advised and unnecessary contest.</p>
                    <p>After the surrender of Lee, I prepared and signed a call for a mass meeting
                        of the people of Augusta, to consider th propriety of accepting the result
                        of the war as a final settlement to the matters in issue an of declaring our
                        readiness to return to the Union and to conform our constitution and laws to
                        the new condition of public affairs.</p>
                    <p>I was called to preside at the meeting and made an address to tit which was
                        extensively published in Northern and Southern papers. It was held in the
                        Southern States, and I have reason to believe that its proceedings did much
                        to mould the public sentiment of the State in favor of the restoration of
                        peace and tranquility to the country.</p>
                    <p>From that time to the present I have been an anxious spectator of the march
                        of events, and I am gratified to be able to say, that under the wise and
                        conciliatory policy of President Johnson, there is every reason to hope that
                        a brighter day is about to dawn on our State. Slavery has been extirpated,
                        and much inconvenience has arisen from the sudden overthrow of the labor
                        system of the South. But the wonderful energy of our people will soon enable
                        them to accommodate themselves to the change, and I believe there are few
                        now who would care to encounter the hazards of a restoration of slavery, if
                        it were left to their choice.</p>
                    <p>When in obedience to the call of my fellow citizens, I declared myself a
                        candidate for Congress, it was with the view of rendering such aid as I
                        could do the President in carrying out his conservative policy. Should I be
                        elected such will be my purpose.</p>
                    <p>But I am met at the threshhold with the objection that I am ineligible, and
                        that if chosen by the lawful voters of the district i will not be allowed to
                        take my seat. On turning to the Constitution of the U. S. to test the
                        question of my eligibility, I find the qualifications of a member of the
                        House of Representatives prescribed in detail in that sacred instrument.</p>
                    <p>Art. 1, Sec. 2, provides that "No person shall be
                        a representative who shall not have attained the age of 25, and been seven
                        years a citizens of the United States, and who shall not when elected be an
                        inhabitant of the State in which he shall be chosen."</p>
                    <p>This is the only clause which relates to the eligibility of members.</p>
                    <p>Art. 6 provides that the Senators and representatives before mentioned and
                        the members of the State Legislatures and all Executive and Judicial
                        officers of the United States, and of the several States, shall be bound by
                        oath or affirmation to support this Constitution; but no religious test
                        shall ever be requested as a qualification to any office or public trust
                        under the United States."</p>
                    <p>All the above qualifications I profess according to the letter and spirit of
                        the Constitution. My age is more than twice 25 -- I am a native of, and have
                        always, to the present hour, resided not only in the State but the District
                        in which I am a candidate.</p>
                    <p>But it is said that Congress in 1862 has prescribed a new and additional
                        qualification for membership, in the form of the following oath, which I
                        will be required to subscribe before I can take my seat:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"I (A. B.) do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never voluntarily borne
                        arms against the United States since I have been a citizen thereof; that I
                        have voluntarily given aid, countenance counsel or encouragement to persons
                        engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I have neither sought nor accepted
                        nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office whatever under any
                        authority or pretended authority in hostility to the United States; that I
                        have not yielded a voluntary support to a pretended government, authority,
                        power or constitution within the United States hostile or inimical thereto;
                        and I do further swear (or affirm) that to the best of my knowledge and
                        ability, I shall support and defend the Constitution of the United States
                        against all enemies, foreign or domestic; that I will swear true faith and
                        allegiance to the same; that I take his obligation freely, without any
                        mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and
                        faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter,
                        so help me God."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I propose briefly to examine this new Congressional test with a view to
                        ascertain whether it is in conformity with the constitution, and whether
                        Congress can consistently with that instrument require it to be taken.</p>
                    <p>In the 52nd No. of the Federalist, which is conceded on all hand to be the
                        highest and most authentic exposition of the constitution, because it was
                        written almost co-temporaneously with it, and by the men who are justly
                        regarded as the fathers of the constitution, Mr. Madison in expounding the
                        true meaning of Art.1 Sec.2. above quoted says: "A representative of the
                        United States must be of the age of twenty-five years -- must have been
                        seven years a citizen of the United States -- must at the time of his
                        election be an inhabitant of the State he is to represent, and during the
                        time of his service, must be in no office under the United States -- under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part
                            of the federal government is open to [unclear] of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether
                            young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or any particular
                            profession of religious faith.</p>
                    <p>The object of a written constitution is to confer on the several departments
                        of government, the powers appropriate to each, and to impose such
                        limitations and restrictions as shall restrain usurpation and abuse. It
                        fixes their boundaries with all practicable precision and hedges them round
                        with every necessary defence. Congress is itself the creature of the
                        constitution and possesses only such powers as are granted by the
                        Constitution. The constitution is the most solemn and authentic expression
                        of the will of the nation. It can be altered only in the mode prescribed by
                        the constitution itself. Congress can neither add to nor take from any of
                        its provisions, for the constitution is as much a law unto Congress, as the
                        acts of Congress are a law unto the people. The Constitution is a rule of
                        action prescribed by the sovereign power, the people, to their agents the
                        representatives in Congress. Whatever the constitution has done Congress
                        cannot undo, nor can Congress do what the Constitution has left undone
                        except in pursuance of some delegated power.</p>
                    <p>Certainly there can be no subject which more appropriately falls within the
                        domain of the organic law, than this regulation of the tests of eligibility
                        of members of the most potent and important department of the federal
                        government. To leave a subject of so much abuse unsettled, and dependent on
                        the caprice, or passion or party prejudices of the day, would argue a want
                        of foresight by no means creditable to the wisdom of the fathers of the
                        republic. Even in our State Constitutions we find the subjects of suffrage
                        and eligibility to office always engaging the most earnest attention of
                        their framers. How much more important is it that these matters should be
                        fixed on a firm basis in a great federal Republic which reaches from ocean
                        to ocean, and from the lakes of the north to the gulf, and embraces such a
                        variety of sometimes apparently conflicting interests.</p>
                    <p>The wisdom of our fathers foresaw this necessity and they have proscribed
                        with clearness all the tests of eligibility. I say all, on the authority of
                        Mr. Madison, who says "under these reasonable limitations the door of this
                        part of the federal government is open to merit of every description." Mr.
                        Madison wielded no careless pen. He was engaged in the discussion of a great
                        subject of constitutional law. He was expounding the fundamental law of the
                        republic for the then present and future generations. No other meaning can
                        fairly be attached to his words than that the enumerated limitations were
                        the only limitations to be imposed on eligibility, and that outside of these
                        limitations were the only limitations to be imposed on eligibility, and that
                        outside of those limitations the door of the House of Representatives was
                        open to merit of every description.</p>
                    <p>The question then rises, can Congress add to the limitations prescribed by
                        the Constitution? Can it enlarge or diminish the qualifications of age or
                        residence? Can it abolish them altogether? If it has a right to mollify them
                        at all, it would seem, by the same process of reasoning, that it would have
                        the power to strike them out entirely. I presume however no such power will
                        be claimed by the wildest zealot. Now if it cannot strike them out, can it
                        nullify these provisions by adding others, which practically unsettle the
                        very foundations of government.</p>
                    <p>The true principle seems to be this. The constitution prescribes the
                        qualifications, and the two Houses apply the tests thus provided, to their
                        respective members. You will look in vain among the grants of power to
                        Congress for any clause which confers on Congress the right to prescribe new
                        tests of eligibility or qualifications to the members of either house.</p>
                    <p>But it has been contended that under Sec. 5 of Art.1 this power exists. That
                        Section reads thus, "Each House shall be the
                            Judge of the elections, qualifications and
                        returns of its own members.</p>
                    <p>Let us consider this clause carefully. In the first place it confers no power
                        whatever on Congress, which is a body composed of two Houses. The expression
                        "each House" clearly indicates that in the performance of the functions
                        devolved on the houses respectively, they act separately. Each acts for
                        itself.--Each is the sole judge of the election and qualification of its
                        members. The House has nothing to do with the election &amp;c. of
                        Senators and the Senate has nothing to do with the election &amp;c. of
                        members.</p>
                    <p>But again the constitution says "each house shall be the Judge of the election &amp;c." Does this clause grant legislative power to Congress? Does it authorize
                        Congress to pass a law on the subject. Clearly not. The function which it is
                        required to perform is simply judicial.--Each house is to Judge, in other words, it is to ascertain
                        judicially, by the examination of evidence, whether each member possesses
                        the constitutional requisites of eligibility, and to decide according to the
                        evidence. In support of this view of the subject, I refer to the opinion of
                        that distinguished jurist and constitutional lawyer, Chanceller Kent. In his
                        Com: Vol. 1 Page 234, he says: "Each house is made the sole judge of the
                        election return and qualifications of its members * * * as each house acts
                        in these cases in a judicial character, its
                        decisions, like the decisions of any other court of justice, ought to be
                        regulated by known principles of law, and strictly adhered to for the sake
                        of uniformity and certainty."</p>
                    <p>I think I am warranted therefore, in saying that this clause of the
                        constitution confers no power on Congress to prescribe a test oath, like
                        that required by the act of 1862.</p>
                    <p>The only remaining clause which bears on the subject, is the one already
                        quoted, which provides that members of Congress, and all executive officers,
                        State and Federal, shall take an oath to support the constitution of the U.
                        S. It would require a keener vision than I possess, to discover in this
                        provision any legitimate authority to require any other test. It can only be
                        deduced by a very strained process of reasoning, from the clause forbidding
                        the application of any religious test.--This system of reasoning involves a
                        complete inversion of the true rule of construction applicable to the
                        constitution, and assumes that Congress possesses all powers which are not
                        prohibited specially, instead of only those which are granted.</p>
                    <p>Upon a fair view, then, of all the clauses of the constitution having any
                        reference direct or indirect to the point under discussion. I am at a loss
                        to perceive any authority delegated to Congress to pass any such law.</p>
                    <p>If we then turn from the language of the constitution, and consider the
                        subject in the light of expediency and common sense, I think we will find
                        the objections to the exercise of such a power, equally strong. If Congress
                        has the power to provide one kind of test oath, why may it not provide any
                        other, it may, from party feeling or prejudices, deem expedient. If the
                        power exists, where are the limitations to it? The only limitation which
                        seems to be recognized, is in regard to a religious test. If this be true,
                        then Congress may pass a law providing for a property qualification, or any
                        political test it may think proper. If this be conceded, then what is to
                        hinder a dominant faction from perpetuating its power, by providing a test
                        oath which will render all persons ineligible to Congress, who have opposed
                        their peculiar policy? The precedent would be fraught with danger, and would
                        convert our government of limited powers, hedged in by constitutional
                        restrictions, into an absolute despotism, regulated and controlled only, by
                        the will of a dominant majority. As the South is destined, in all future
                        time, to be in a hopeless minority, it should be the last to surrender the
                        safeguards of its rights provided by the constitution. We should make the
                        issue at the outset. We should deny the right of Congress, to pass any such
                        law. If our representatives should be excluded, we should appeal to the
                        people, trusting that their patriotism would frown down all such efforts at
                        injustice, and speedily re-establish the government on its true
                        constitutional basis.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the true construction of the oath itself much diversity of
                        opinion seems to exist. My competitor, Mr. Lewis, says he can take the oath,
                        while I cannot. This is the strong objection which he, and his supporters,
                        make to my election. They say, why elect me, when it is obvious that I will
                        not be allowed to take my seat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis is an honorable and high toned gentlemen, and I have no doubt he
                        thinks he can with propriety take the oath. I think he is in error on that
                        point, and I believe that my chance of being received into Congress better
                        than his. He seems to think that all that is necessary to secure his
                        admission is that he shall take the oath. In this I think he is mistaken. If
                        the radicals have the power they will exclude obnoxious members without
                        regard to the oath. They will go behind he oath, and enquire into all the
                        antecedents of every claimant of a seat. If they do this, how will Mr. Lewis
                        stand? It is a matter of public policy, has he sought, obtained, and
                        executed large contracts with the Confederate government to make iron to be
                        used for military purposes. Surely it was quite as strong evidence of
                        hostility to the U. S on his part to furnish its enemy iron to make cannon
                        and shot, and shell to kill federal soldiers, as it was on mine to give, and
                        in public speeches, to urge other to give food and clothing to famishing and
                        naked soldiers, and the prisoners of both combatants.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis and I differ as to the true construction of the oath. He and I
                        occupied the same position of opposition to the war. I fed and clothed
                        Confederate soldiers, and made speeches urging others to do the same. He fed
                        and clothed soldiers and manufactured large quantities of iron for the
                        Confederacy under the special contracts with it. He seems to think that his
                        opposition to the war reaches through and gives color to all his acts during
                        the war, that as he was involuntarily involved in the war that that want of
                        volition will apply to all his acts. In my judgement, the oath requires that
                        the test of [unclear] shall be applied to each separate act. If he
                        voluntarily bought iron works, and entered into and executed contracts for
                        making iron. He has incurred the penalty intended to be denounced by the act
                        of 1812. If I am in error, and Mr. Lewis's construction of the oath be
                        correct then I can take it as readily as he.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I will add that I have received from several NOrthern States
                        assurances that my elections will be hailed with satisfaction, by the
                        conservative men of the North. My earnest and persistent opposition to
                        secession is well known throughout the Northern States, and I have good
                        reason to believe that I would be admitted to my seat.</p>
                    <p>The question seems to men, to narrow itself down to this. Whose views are you
                        to consult in selecting your representatives? Are you to seek to conciliate
                        the radicals or the conservatives? If I am elected, I shall co-operate with
                        the conservatives. The radicals, having taken open ground against the policy
                        of President Johnson, I will seek to strengthen his hands, and support him
                        against his enemies. Common providence as well as common gratitude, dictates
                        this course.</p>
                    <p>Virginia must now take her stand. If we surrender the great principle now in
                        issue, where is concession to stop. Each concession will furnish the ground
                        work for further demands, and we may find in the end that we have conceded
                        until we have forfeited our own self-respect, and the respect of our
                        adversaries. Better that Virginia be unrepresented than underrepresented.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Alex. H. H. Stuart.</p>
