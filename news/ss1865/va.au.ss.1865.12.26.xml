                <transcript>
                    <p>We have already advised, says the Richmond Republic, all able-bodied men who
                        are not out of employment to got to work on the farm, where there is a great
                        demand for labor. The example set by most of the returned soldiers of
                        General Lee's and Johnston's armies is worthy of general imitation. The
                        large corn crop of the State is due in great measure, to their manly
                        industry.--Young men who are lounging about cities and villages in quest of
                        clerkships would do well to imitate the example of the greater number of
                        returned soldiers. They would, besides, secure for themselves much larger
                        pecuniary return than any clerkship, public or commercial, affords. If any
                        of them cherish the delusion that labor is beneath the dignity of a
                        gentleman, we have nothing to say to them. Such hopeless idiots are not to
                        be reasoned with. The time has gone by when labor was the peculiar badge of
                        the servile class. If labor was not respectable formally, it is necessary to
                        make it so now. The South is never going to be regenerated if any
                        considerable number of its white population sits with folded hands and
                        spends its time in invoking foreign labor and denouncing the indolence of
                        the blacks. It is no way to bring foreign labor here, to brand labor with
                        disgrace, nor the best mode to cure negroes of laziness by showing them that
                        the white people regard work as a special hardship.</p>
                    <p>Virginia cannot afford now to have a single drone in the hive. The idle man
                        now is the enemy of his State, and ought to be treated as such. Indolence
                        must now be the badge of degradation. Public sentiment should brand with
                        disgrace every creature who, amidst universal poverty, insists upon being
                        consumer and pensions himself upon the public industry. A more disgusting
                        spectacle cannot be found than that of an able-bodied man looking up and
                        down and old family mansion whose inmates are threatened with actual want,
                        whilst broad acres spread around crying out for cultivation, but which he
                        refuses to touch because labor is beneath the dignity of a gentleman. A
                        gentleman indeed! Such an animal has not the faintest conception of what a
                        gentleman means.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In the report of J. W. Garret, the President of the Baltimore and Ohio
                        Railroad, he says:</p>
                    <p>"The Baltimore and Ohio Company has increased its equipment to about three
                        hundred locomotives and four thousand cars. Its capacity for business is now
                        far beyond the ability of lines working in connection with it to dispose of
                        the vast quantities of freight it brings to Baltimore. At this time more
                        than seventy-five trains daily of passengers and freight pass over the main
                        stem of the Baltimore and Ohio road upon the Baltimore division. The power
                        of the Company, by its large additions of double track, and increase of
                        facilities and equipment, with its additional branches, will be constantly
                        enlarged. The direct outlets for this vast accumulation of traffic must
                        follow."</p>
                    <p>Ponder it -- think of it -- 300 locomotives, 4000 cars, and more than 75
                        trains daily! Consider the vast business done upon that road, remember that
                        Baltimore wished to run the road through this populous Valley, increasing
                        with production, thirty years ago, and admire the wisdom of the
                        "dog-in-the-manger" policy adopted by the Legislature of Virginia of that
                        time! Will Virginia continue to act thus blindly, or will she welcome the
                        construction of railroads and canals through the State, it matters not by
                        whom?--We hope that our Legislators will take a practical view of this
                        subject, and encourage other to invest largely in the construction of
                        improvements in this State. We would like to see railroads running in all
                        directions throughout Virginia, and would be glad to see them made by other
                        people's capital. Virginia can protect herself by prescribing the conditions
                        upon which she may grant the privileges to construct them. Let the roads and
                        canals be built.</p>
