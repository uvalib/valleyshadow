<b>A Southern Convention Suggested</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors commend the idea of a convention of Southern delegates to
                    correct the "false impression" held in the North that Southerners "are still
                    cherishing a spirit of rebellion." The suggestion was first made by the Memphis
                    Commercial, and endorsed by the Richmond Whig and the Charlottesville Chronicle.<br>

<b>Before And During The War</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The pre-war editor of the Spectator returns to editorial duties, and
                    recalls his views, and those of his paper, before and during the Civil War. He
                    was, he explains, opposed to secession but supported the Confederacy once the
                    North attempted to use "military coercion." He also maintains that "the citizens
                    of the South should be restored as soon as possible to all the rights,

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>I respectfully announce myself a candidate to represent you in the 39th
                        Congress. As I have few personal acquaintances in some of the counties, and
                        have neither the time or health requisite for canvassing so large a
                        District, I take this method of announcing to the voters my opinion on some
                        of the subjects which claim the consideration of the people.</p>
                    <p>Before the election for members of the Convention which passed the ordinance
                        of Secession, I had never sought nor held office. I was elected to the
                        Convention by an overwhelming majority of the voters of my county, who, up
                        to that time, differed from me in political opinion, and elected with the
                        distinct understanding that I admitted neither the right, justice or
                        practicability of secession, and that, under no circumstances would I vote
                        for or sign an ordinance claiming to exercise such a right.</p>
                    <p>I have always opposed and condemned the radicals of the North, and am as much
                        as ever opposed to their principles and policy; but now, as before the war,
                        I would oppose them in the way and with the means compatible with the
                        Constitution of the United States and the institutions of our common
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Such was the wisdom that formed our system of Government that the grossest
                        mismanagement and corruption in the Executive and Legislative departments
                        never wrought oppression upon any human being, and I believe the wise and
                        pure men who established it were instrument in the hands of Providence to
                        provide for the people of the United States a Government which will be to
                        them a blessing and protection for all time.</p>
                    <p>I have never believed slaveholding a sin, whilst it was allowed and protected
                        by the Constitution and by the laws of the States; but the experience of the
                        last fifteen years had convinced me that it was not an economical
                        institution. I do not believe it has been legally or Constitutionally
                        abolished, but it has been practically destroyed, and I think it the part of
                        wisdom to accept the situation as it is. I am afraid the violent disruption
                        of the relation of master and slave will be productive of much evil,
                        principally to the freed class but I hope and believe (if the people act
                        wisely) Virginia will attain to a much greater degree of prosperity and
                        happiness than she ever would have done with slave labor. That strenuous
                        efforts will be made to forego negro suffrage upon the States which are
                        without Constitutional State Governments, I cannot doubt; by I rely on the
                        wisdom of the present Federal Administration, and the conservative members
                        in the next Congress, to avert that evil from our country. Hence the
                        importance of sending to the next Congress, from the Southern States, men of
                        whose loyalty there can be no question, and in regard to whose rights to
                        their seats no serious issue can be raised. The voter of every conservative
                        member of the next Congress will be of priceless value to the South.</p>
                    <p>What influence I could exert was used to have the restrictions removed from
                        the voters of this State, and, if elected to a seat in Congress, I shall
                        exert myself to have every one restored to all the political rights he
                        enjoyed before the war. I do not believe that a Republican Government can
                        exist with the present restrictions upon the qualification to hold office. I
                        am satisfied that the only requirement should be an oath to support the
                        Constitution of the United States, to restore every one to all the rights of
                        citizens. I think the most lenient and kind course that can be pursued
                        towards the Southern people consistently with the duty of the Government,
                        will be best calculated to restore peace, prosperity and fraternal feelings.
                        I am opposed to any attempt upon the part of the United States to enforce
                        the Monroe Doctrine. I am emphatically for
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>John F. Lewis</p>
