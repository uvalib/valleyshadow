<b>Republican Mass Meeting. The Victory of Vermont Celebrated. The Boys in Blue
                    Present. Hartranft, Campbell, and Cessna</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper announces that a mass meeting will be held on September 25th to
                    support the Republican county ticket. The Boys in Blue will attend, and all will
                    celebrate the recent victories in Vermont.<br>(Names in announcement: Gen.  Hartranft, Gen.  Campbell,  John Cessna,  Henry S. Wilson,  W. H. Burleigh,  John Cessna,  Edward M'Pherson,  S. F. Greenawalt)</blockquote>
<b>The Mass Meeting</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reminds readers that the Republican mass meeting will go forward
                    on the 25th. It promises to be the largest meeting that Franklin County has
                    witnessed in quite some time. Speakers will stress the importance of the
                    upcoming election. "Let every loyal man in the county give one day at least to
                    the cause of the country. Better let the plow stand idle in the furrow for one
                    day, than by your indifference endanger the cause of Right."<br>

<b>From Maine</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper celebrates Republican victories in recent state elections in
                    Vermont and Maine. "It bore on the breeze the same message to all, to the
                    patriotic and to the disloyal, to the veteran soldier and to the veteran
                    traitor. To the one it was confirmation beyond all doubt that the universal
                    sentiment of the loyal masses, who brought the rebellion to a successful and
                    glorious issue is still true to the principles upon which that rebellion was
                    fought. To the other it was confirmation no less sure that treason, whether in
                    arms or under the thin disguise of Democracy, is as odious as when Lee
                    surrendered to our Matchless Chieftain."<br>

<b>Senatorial Contest and the Candidates</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository throws its support behind Dixon rather than Duncan for
                    Senate, basing this support on his war record. Duncan, it continues, is an able
                    lawyer but was against the war and is not worthy of the office.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We trust our friends are sufficiently alive to the great importance of the
                        senatorial contest in this district. The coming legislature will have a
                        United States Senator to elect in the place of Mr. Buckalew, whose term has
                        been a stigma upon the loyal reputation of the State. We have been
                        unfortunate in losing several districts in late elections, so that the
                        Senate is in danger of falling into the hands of the opposition, which would
                        seriously embarrass legislation and thwart measures approved by the
                        sentiment of the people. It would be lamentable if a party so capable of
                        mischief, and whose record is so unpatriotic and shameless, were to get
                        control of a branch of the legislature, whereby they might lock the wheels
                        of the government at their wicked will. Every thoughtful Republican will see
                        the danger we allude to, and will use special effort to prevent its
                        occurrence. This district is a close one, but honest and faithful work will
                        save it to us. We should labor zealously for the sake of the interests at
                        stake; and we should labor heartily for the sake of the gallant and most
                        worthy gentlemen, whom we have asked with unexampled unanimity to be our
                        representative. He is not on our ticket by his own seeking, or from his own
                        choice. In his case emphatically, "the office sought the man," and we owe it
                        to him, whom we found quietly attending to his own business, without
                        political aspirations and with a native aversion to partizan ambitions - we
                        owe it to him to struggle with special energy to justify the county
                        convention in asking him to serve the country once more "for three years."
                        In Gen. Dixon we have a candidate in every regard worthy of our support. The
                        meanest of his opponents dare not question his integrity. He is a man upon
                        whom the shadow of reproach never rested - plain, quiet, open, honest, just
                        such a legislator as the times demand. There is a general feeling in this
                        country that our legislatures have been too often afflicted by politicians
                        who have been tainted by corruption in office, and that reform is needed in
                        our legislative halls - that a seat in the Assembly has been sought for
                        dishonest purposes, not as a post of honorable distinction, or for the end
                        of serving the people. We point the friends of reform to Gen. Dixon, and bid
                        them "go, mark him well." True, the General is not a lawyer: but we are not
                        convinced that a knowledge of how to draw up an indictment, or to fit
                        together pieces of evidence so as to convict under a given statute, is what
                        is needed for a legislator: a man may know all this and be a miserable
                        pettifogger, the least to be trusted member of a community.</p>

                    <p>Candid men of all parties admit the fitness of Gen. Dixon for the position.
                        This is enough to secure him a full vote. But he has more than fitness to
                        commend him. He has claims upon the gratitude of the people for his gallant
                        services in the field during the rebellion. He was a prominent and
                        distinguished officer in that body of heroic men, whose achievements on so
                        many bloody battlefields gave such lustre to the fame of the soldiers of
                        Pennsylvania. Wherever the history of the Pennsylvania Reserves is known,
                        Gen. Dixon will need no voice to sound his praise. His company joined the
                        Sixth Regiment in Harrisburg in June, 1861, having participated in almost
                        all of the fierce battles and wearisome marches of the Army of the Potomac,
                        beginning with the triumph at Drainesville and ending their services with
                        the decided victory at Bethsaida Church, in the Wilderness campaign, after
                        their term of enlistment had expired. Men of the Reserve Corps are living
                        among us, and we refer to them, whoever may inquire of the military or
                        personal character of Gen. Dixon. We of Franklin are proud of our soldier
                        citizen, - Adams, our associate in the Senatorial district, owes him a debt
                        of gratitude which it were a damning shame if she did not seek to repay. As
                        long as the Round Tops lift up their heads above that memorable field of
                        glory, which has given Adams county a name in the world's annals forever,
                        they will be monuments of the valor of the Division which saved the fight;
                        and we will not believe that the men of Adams will turn to disgrace the
                        opportunity of rewarding a soldier who so largely participated in "that
                        glorious day's renown." To save your property, your families, your own
                        persons, fellow-citizens of Adams, Col. Dixon ventured his own life upon
                        your son - can you vote against him, in return? Such of you as wished Lee as
                        your master may; those whose hearts sank when Reynolds fell - Reynolds who
                        was so long the immediate commander and personal friend of Dixon - must be
                        perverted from all good impulses, if you can.</p>

                    <p>The opponent of General Dixon is happily selected. The rival candidates have
                        nothing in common. No man can lean to both. Mr. Duncan is a professional
                        politician, a member of a family of politicians. As a man, we respect and
                        like him; as a private citizen, no person can rightfully object to him. He
                        is a lawyer of good standing at our bar; and, we believe, can render as
                        valuable services to any unfortunate who is involved in the administration
                        of the law as any of his professional brethren. During the rebellion, he and
                        Col. Dixon fought upon opposite sides - the Col's enemies were clothed in
                        gray; and murdered, and poisoned, and starved "the boys in blue;" Mr.
                        Duncan's foes were they who "rallied around the flag," whether borne in the
                        smoke of battle, or among those at home whose hearts yearned for the brave
                        men at the post of danger and glory. Mr. Duncan had no stomach for
                        soldiering, and no pride in the soldier's cause. His voice was not for the
                        war. He opposed it manfully. He opposed all who favored it. Vallandigham was
                        his type of a statesman then, Seymour and Forrest are now. He is a constant
                        in his love and practice - he may be relied upon in his hostility to
                        suppressors of the rebellion. And he has had his reward. The party which
                        would have given up the Union when the war was just closing in success,
                        chose him three years ago as its standard bearer; the same party which finds
                        its models of patriots, statesmen and soldiers in men steeped in the blood
                        of loyal citizens, choose him now as their pet representative. Then he
                        claimed his election by the votes of deserters; now, he would add to his
                        peace-men and deserter voters as many "boys in blue" as may be deluded to
                        follow him.</p>

                    <p>Fellow citizens, can you mistake your duty in your vote for Senator?
                        Soldiers, will you go back upon your record? How many of M'Causland's men,
                        could they vote at our polls, would have General Dixon's name on their
                        ticket? How many would not have Calvin Duncan's?</p>

                    <p>Answer, and govern yourselves accordingly in October!</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The "Fantasticals" had a grand parade on Friday night last, in honor of the
                        victory in Maine. It was a most ludicrous spectacle and evidently intended
                        to burlesque the Democracy. About eight or nine o'clock they formed in the
                        Diamond with Chinese lanterns, on which were inscribed "Seymour and Blair,"
                        and with transparencies bearing the following ludicrous mottoes: "Abolish
                        the Freedman's Bureau and pay the debt," "Vote against the Congress that
                        gives millions to niggers but nothing to burnt out white people," "White men
                        made this Government, and white men should administer it," "No negro
                        suffrage: No negro office holders," "Republican majority in Maine reduced to
                        23,000. Hurrah for Maine."</p>

                    <p>The burlesque was so capital, and withal so funny, that one could scarcely
                        held believing it to be a real Democratic demonstration. The Teutonic
                        element was largely brought out in the display, and in the parade which
                        followed, repeated cheers were heard for "Simoyer." When the procession
                        returned to the square, a speech was loudly and vehemently called for, until
                        at length one of the number was introduced as a distinguished Democrat of
                        our borough, whose devotion to the p-a-r-t-y was guaranteed by many years of
                        laborious and painstaking and poetical speeches made in its service. This
                        was doubtless the most humorous feature of the evening and the speaker
                        didn't look unlike the gentleman whom he personated. He began by expressing
                        his regret that Democrats were so much more numerous than Chinese lanterns,
                        but hoped on future occasions the supply of the latter might be equal to the
                        demand. However, said the orator, inspired by the occasion with genuine
                        Miltonian frenzy, if we have not lamps enough, snatch a Star-r-r-r from the
                        sky and light you on to Democratic victory, over the uncivilized African who
                        is trampling the noble Anglo-Saxon under his heel; and the welkin rang with
                        cheers, and the Teutonic shouts for "Simoyer"
                        rent the air, and the horns blowed, and the dogs barked, and the crowd
                        dispersed, and altogether they behaved as much like Democrats as any thing
                        so broadly farcical possibly could do.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On last Saturday evening the Democrats held a meeting at Greencastle, and the
                        Republicans one at Waynesboro. On returning from the meeting at Waynesboro,
                        the Republicans encountered some ten or twelve Democrats returning on horse
                        back from the Greencastle meeting. As the Democrats passed along the line of
                        wagons filled with Republicans, the former employed their time in striking
                        at the lighted torches carried by the latter, and otherwise acting in such a
                        manner as to create a fear with many that they would be injured. Finally the
                        Democrats surrounded and attacked a carriage containing four Republicans,
                        when George Benner, in the carriage, fired a pistol, instantly killing a
                        young man named Lechrone, residing near Waynesboro. A gentleman by the name
                        of Adams, who was riding with Benner, said "why, Benner, you might shoot
                        some one." "No danger of that," Benner replied, "as I fired into the air for
                        the purpose of frightening them off." It was not until they reached Shady
                        Grove, about a mile from where the shooting occurred, that they learned
                        Lechrone had been killed. Benner at once proceeded to Greencastle and handed
                        himself over to the authorities. He was brought to Chambersburg on Sabbath
                        morning, and placed in jail.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The "Boys in Blue" and the Grant and Colfax Club of Chambersburg had a grand
                        torch light procession on Tuesday evening, the 15th inst., in honor of the
                        great Republican victory in Maine. Over three hundred men turned out with
                        torches. There was no effort made to have a large crowd, or the number could
                        have been doubled. The "Boys in Blue" formed in front of Repository Hall, in
                        command of their Marshal, Col. F. S. Stumbaugh, where they received their
                        torches. They then marched up Front street to the South Ward, where they met
                        the Grant and Colfax Club in charge of its President, Harry Stoner, Esq. The
                        two bodies then united, and marched through the principle streets of our
                        borough. Cheers were frequently given for our next President and Vice
                        President, Grant and Colfax, for Maine, Vermont, and our state, District and
                        County Tickets. Our patriotic ladies welcomed these loyal men by the waving
                        of handkerchiefs and their presence at doors and windows all along the
                        route. After their return to the Court House appropriate remarks were made
                        by I. H. M'Cauley, Esq. This demonstration was a success and showed signs of
                        activity and earnestness on the part of Republicans that mark the defeat of
                        our opponents in Franklin county.</p>

                    <p>The Democracy have no reason to congratulate themselves on their meeting in
                        Greencastle on Saturday evening last. We are informed that from the time
                        they reached the town until they left, they made the streets echo and re
                        echo with their drunken yells. The hotel keepers closed the bars against
                        them. It was almost impossible to hear the speakers, who attempted to
                        address the meeting, on account of the noise and confusion caused by these
                        Seymourites. The good citizens living along Railroad street felt compelled
                        to close their windows and doors as the train left for Chambersburg, fearing
                        that stones might be hurled into them from the cars. One inoffensive quiet
                        old gentleman, who was watching the cars pass, was shot at from a car-window
                        and narrowly escaped being killed, as the ball in its course almost touched
                        the back of his neck. A few more assemblages of this kind will give the
                        Republican ticket at least 150 majority in Antrim.</p>
