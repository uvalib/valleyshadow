                    <p>"The highest authority in the nation" has charged Gen. Sheridan with being
                        "tyrannical and a partisan." We do not intend to put in a plea for gallant
                        "Phil," for the people have judged between him and his accuser, and hurled
                        back into the teeth of the "bold, bad man" his groundless charges. The
                        people have commended the course of the hero of Winchester, in no niggardly
                        manner, and thereby rebuked the mean jealousy and wicked policy of a
                        faithless President.</p>
                    <p>But while we offer no plea for the late commander of the Fifth Military
                        District, because he needs none, he has seen fit in a report to his chief to
                        defend himself against the charges of the Executive of the nation. In this
                        able report the Gen. modestly sets forth the difficulties with which he had
                        to contend, and the means he used to overcome them. He found upon careful
                        examination that all, or nearly all, the civil functionaries had been
                        soldiers in or aiders and abettors of the rebellion, that they had been
                        elected solely upon the ground of their services in the attempt to overthrow
                        the general government; that they were disfranchised by the law; that they
                        were either openly or secretly opposed to the law and to himself as the
                        officer charged with its execution. This was undoubtedly a difficult
                        situation in which to be placed, and was rendered still more so, says the
                        General, by the apparently open sympathy of the President with the
                        functionaries above alluded to. Certainly it was absurd to expect any man to
                        execute the law and retain these unrepentant rebels in office. He was
                        enjoined by the law of Congress "to protect all persons in their rights of
                        person and property, to suppress insurrection, disorder and violence, and to
                        punish or cause to be punished all disturbers of the public peace and
                        criminals." He found it impossible to execute this enactment without
                        exercising the power of removal. He resorted to this power and forthwith the
                        bull of Pope Andrew was fulminated; because he did in his humbler sphere
                        what Andrew Johnson failed to do in this higher office, viz: executed the
                        laws, therefore he is denounced as a partisan and tyrant by the latter. "I
                        decided," says the report, "to use the authority vested in me as leniently
                        as possible, to allow myself to be forced to the wall by open overt acts
                        before action was taken; and in every order issued the cause of removal was
                        specified. I had no desire to oppress and did not oppress. I only wished to
                        give security to all good citizens, and did so; and insecurity to all office
                        holders who failed to carry out the law, or who put impediments in the way
                        of reconstruction. In all my dealings with the people of Louisiana and Texas
                        it was governed by honor, justice and truth; no political influences or
                        interests were allowed to control my actions."</p>
                    <p>These are manly words, and as they are embodied in an official report to the
                        Gen. in Chief, and therefore always subject to investigation, we can have no
                        doubt of their truthfulness; the people have accepted them as such and hence
                        the axe has fallen upon "Phil" Sheridan's official neck in vain. Nay, not in
                        vain, for it has been the means of bringing to the view of the people the
                        gallant services of Gen. Sheridan, and of showing to the same first source
                        of power the faithlessness of the chief magistrate to the welfare of the
                        Republic. Sheridan will live in the remembrance of those services and his
                        gallant deeds in war.--Andrew Johnson will also live in the recollection of
                        his deeds else Benedict Arnold, Aaron Burr and John Tyler would have lost to
                        memory.</p>

                <summary>The paper reports on Andrew Johnson's attacks on Phil Sheridan and the
                    latter's defense of himself. The editors sides with Sheridan by pointing out
                    that Sheridan removed certain men from office in his district because they were
                    former rebels disfranchised by acts of Congress. They claim that since Johnson
                    would not execute the laws, Sheridan was justified in doing so. They also
                    predict that future generations will praise Sheridan and vilify Johnson.</summary>

                    <p>CONGRESS committed a very serious mistake when it entrusted the appointment
                        of commanders for the military districts of the South to the President. So
                        far he has used this power to delay and embarrass the very work Congress
                        sought to accomplish. A bill is now before Congress which, if passed, will
                        correct the mistake so far as regards the future operation of the
                        reconstruction law. It takes the appointing power from the President and
                        virtually places the whole responsibility on General Grant, who will neither
                        fear to assume it, nor hesitate to enforce the law in all its parts. It
                        would have been far better had Congress passed this or a similar bill last
                        spring and saved the country the misfortune and disgrace of the Hancock
                        rule. Its necessity was just as apparent then as now.</p>

                    The editors are pleased with a newly proposed bill that would transfer that
                    authority to General Grant, whom the editors feel would appoint better generals
                    to carry out Reconstruction policy.</summary>

                    <p>The best commentary on the recent order of General Hancock proscribing the
                        colored men of Louisiana, is the order of Judge Howe of New Orleans,
                        discharging a white jury, empanelled under the Hancock rule, for want of
                        sufficient intelligence. In view of the action we presume Gen. Hancock will
                        supplement his famous order, and proscribe certain white men who are
                        unfitted for jurors. He disqualified the blacks because they were too
                        ignorant. Will the General let the rule work both ways?</p>

                <summary>The paper ridicules General Hancock for dismissing black jurors on the
                    grounds of ignorance despite the fact that a judge in his military district did
                    the same thing to a white jury. The editos sarcastically ask if Hancock would
                    uphold the judge's ruling or hypocritically reinstate the white jurors.</summary>
