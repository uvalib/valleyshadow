<b>Nasby</b><br> (Column 08)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Petroleum Nasby, writing in a low class southern vernacular(though the
                    vernacular actually fluctuates between educated and uneducated), offers up
                    Jethro Kippins, a complete unknown, for the Democratic nomination for President.
                    He lists Kippin's strengths, the most powerful of which is that nobody knows him
                    and he has no position on anything.<br>

                    <p> POST OFFIS CONFEDRIT X ROADS,</p>
                    <p> (Wich is in the Stait ov Kentcky, June 1, 1868.</p>
                    <p>The matter uv a Presidenshal candidate hez opprest me, and hez also exercised
                        the gigantic intellex who congregate at the Corners. We hev desided that
                        Cheef Justis Chase won't do. We kin support him cheerfully, for his method
                        uv conduktin the impeachment trial hez satisfied us uv his hankerin for a
                        standin in our party. Besides this havin made a start, we consider him safe
                        anyhow. The man wich kin take a nominashen at our hands, or identify hisself
                        with us, may alluz be counted onto. The Ablishnists never forgive sich, and
                        there aint no other place to go. When Johnson and Doolittle and that crowd
                        left the Ablishnists, I new wher they wood land beter than they did. Facilis decensus averni, wich bein translated into
                        vulgar tongue, means, the road to hell is macadamized. Hancock won't do
                        becoz our Southern brethern hev a prejoodis agin the flag he drawd his sword
                        under. Pendleton wood anser the West, but the East is opposed to him;
                        Seymour wood do the East, but the West opposed to him. I therefore, after
                        givin the matter matoor considerashen, hev decided to propose for the
                        posishen, the name uv Jethro L. Kippins, uv Alexander county, Illinoy.</p>
                    <p>I hev the follorin reasons for insisten on his nominashen:</p>
                    <p>1. He's geographically level. By look on the map, it will be seen that that
                        county in Illinoy is the extreme sutheasterly part uv the State. It is a
                        Norther county with southern ideas. Across the river is Kentucky, west is
                        southeastern Missoury, and east is lower Injeany. They grow tobacco there,
                        and yearn after slave labor ez intensely ez we do across the river.</p>
                    <p>2. Nobody knows him. The name of Jethro L. Kippins hez never filled the
                        soundin trump uv fame. With him on our tikkit several pints would be gained.
                        On all the questions on which there is a doubt in the minds of the
                        Democracy, Jethro L. Kippins is uncommitted. He is unembarrassed with views,
                        and on troublesom questions hez nary an opinyun. The trouble Pendleton hez
                        with the greenbax wood not affect him, neither would any uv them other
                        questions which are ruther emarrassin than otherwise. He hez but one
                        political principle, which he holds is enuff for any one man, and that is
                        Democracy, ez it hez bin, ez it is, and ez it may be. He beleeves firmly in
                        the cuss uv Canan, he holds close to Onesimus and Hagar, and hez sworn a
                        solemn oath that no nigger shall ever marry a daughter of hizzin. This noble
                        sentiment which, alluz strikes a responsive cord in every Democratic buzzum,
                        wood be emblazoned on the Kippins banner.</p>
                    <p>3. Jethro L. Kippens's posishen on the war question is happy. He opposed all
                        the steps wich led to it, and when it finally broke out, he proposed the
                        only troo Demokratic way uv stoppin it. It wuz his opinyun that we hed no
                        right to coerce the South--that there wuz no warrant in the Constooshen for
                        any sich proceedin. "Ef Boregard fires onto Major Anderson," sed he "let
                        Major Anderson go afore the nearest Justis uv the Peece and hev him bound
                        over to keep the peece. If he won't keep the peece, the Justis can't go
                        beyond the Constooshen." After hostilities actooally begun, his posishen wus
                        eminently satisfactory to both sides. He wuz in favor uv the war, but
                        opposed to its prosekooshen. He remarkt that the South had committed a
                        indiscreashen, but were he in Congris, he shoodent vote for nary man nor
                        dollar for carryin on a war agin em. His two sons served in the war--one in
                        the Confedrit servis and one in the Fedral, both ez sutlers. The war bore
                        heavy on him--he made great sacrifices. Three other sons he supported in
                        Canada dooring the continyooance uv the unnachral strife.</p>
                    <p>4. Jethro L. Kippins hez all the elements uv popularity. He wuz born in a log
                        cabin--he studied Daboll's arithmetic by the lite uv a pine knot, held for
                        the purpose by his mother--he drove a hoss on the canal, was a salt boiler
                        in Southern Ohio, a wagon-boy on the Nashnel Road, wuz left an orphan when
                        six weeks old, swept a store in his early youth, went down the Mississippi
                        on a flat boat, was in the Mexikin war, and hez a consoomin pashen for
                        horses.--He hez, in this, the advantage uv Grant, ez his pashen was so
                        consoomin that it got him into a temporary difficulty, which required twelve
                        men a judge and two lawyers to settle, one uv the lawyers bein the State's
                        Attorney uv the county. These facts in his byography I got from his own
                        lips. Ef there's any dircrepancies, uv course the committee on byography
                        will reconcile em.--It may be that he may hev done too much--wich is to say,
                        ef all he says is troo, he would be two or three hundred years old. Ef so,
                        it will have to be pared down. He hez bin jussis uv the peace for ten years
                        in his native township, wich gives him a splendid knowledge uv constooshenel
                        law.</p>
                    <p>5. He's trooly nashnel in his views. He knows no north, no south, no east, no
                        west, no nothing. That last qualification mite prejudis some agin him, but
                        to me it's his chief holt. For with sich a man in the Presidenshel chair I
                        wood be safe. We hev an abundance uv sich men as Wood, Seymour, Vallandygum,
                        et settry, who can manage a President, but are too odorous to be electid
                        very much to that posishen themselves.--Therefore it's necessary that
                        precisely sich a man ez I hev described be electid; and the fact that Chase
                        knows too much is the objection I hev to him. Polk was manageable. Pierce
                        eminently so, and poor old Bookannon was wonderfully pliable.</p>
                    <p>Sich is the candidate wich I present. There are many pints in his favor. Our
                        people would to wunst exclaim, "Who'n thunder is Kippins?" and before they
                        cood find out the day uv election wood be on em, and they'd vote him. His
                        hevin no record is also in his favor. Wat wood Pendleton, Vallandygum,
                        Seymour and Wood give ef they hed no record? A record is like a tin kittle
                        to a dog's tale--it's a noisy appendage wich makes the dog conspicous, and
                        invites every body to shy a brick at him.</p>
                    <p>I hevent menshened in this, nor shel I, who wood be a proper man for the
                        second place on the ticket. I hev my opinion. Kentucky is deservin uv
                        recognishen--that's all I shel say.--The modesty wich is characteristic uv
                        me prevents me from segestin the partickeler citizen of Kentucky who ought
                        to be thus honored. We shelsee whether or not republics is ongrateful.</p>
                    <p> PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P.M.,</p>
                    <p> (wich is Postmaster.)</p>
                    <p>P.S. The fact that Jothro L. Kippins holds my note for $18.63, with interest
                        for two years, has no inflooence in my segesting his name. I am inflooenced
                        by no mercenary considerashuns.</p>

<b>The Lesson of Impeachment</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"A.P.M." summarizes the consequences of the acquittal of Andrew Johnson.
                    Above all, he laments the decision because Johnson can now act with impunity
                    without regard for the laws made by Congress. Also, the Republicans lost any
                    hope of keeping the southern states under loyal governments or of shutting down
                    the "whiskey ring."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The impeachment of Andrew Johnson involved much, very much more than is
                        apparent on the record, or is generally appreciated by the public. The
                        doctrine that it was a criminal trial, that it should be governed by the
                        same technical rules that obtain in police or quarter sessions courts, is as
                        dangerous as it is fallacious. It was the invention of partizans and
                        faithless Senators to shield a usurper from the just consequences of his
                        lawlessness. In despotic governments there is no impeachment of the crown.
                        Revolution, banishment and the guillotine or scaffold are the remedies for
                        intolerable rulers. In obedience to the progress of civilization the
                        Republic of the new world substituted a civil tribunal to which the highest
                        officers must be subject, and empowered it as the grand inquest of the
                        nation. To guard against the quibbles of technical lawyers, the Senate was
                        constituted the tribunal to judge between the ruler and his accusers, and it
                        is left by the fundamental law as the sole judge of the character of the
                        offences. What shall be regarded as "high crimes and misdemeanors," on the
                        part of an officer subject to impeachment, was left for the Senate to
                        decide. Common law or statutary offences are all punishable by the courts,
                        no matter who the offender may be; but there are unendurable crimes that a
                        ruler may commit against the people and their liberties, undefinable by any
                        established law. Mr. Buchanan it is conceded, made the ablest exposition of
                        the power of impeachment nearly for ty years ago, and he declared
                        that official acts lawful in themselves, but done in an oppressive,
                        revengeful or faithless manner, may subject the officer to just conviction
                        and removal, while unlawful acts done in mistaken judgment may not warrant
                        conviction.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson has been arraigned before the grand inquest of the nation on
                        various charges. Mainly owing to the predetermined purpose of Chief Justice
                        Chase to acquit the President, the Senate was ruled as a court, subject to
                        judicial rules and prey to the technicalities of legal tribunals. It was a
                        flagrant assumption for Mr. Chase to assume judicial power, and an
                        unpardonable weakness on the part of the Senate to concede. It was a
                        compromise with wrong, and, as usual, wrong triumphed, and the President has
                        been acquitted.</p>
                    <p>What are the lessons of the verdict?</p>
                    <p>1. It is established that henceforth officers are to be tried before the
                        court of impeachment as crimnals and must have the full benefit
                        of all the technical rules in pleading, practice and evidence that protect
                        citizens on trial for felonies. No matter what crime they may commit against
                        the peace, prosperity or safety of the nation, unless they violate the
                        written or established law, and are found guilty against all the
                        presumptions of the law, they must go unwhipped of justice. A score of New
                        Orleans and Memphis massacres may be committed under the immediate
                        inspiration of the President, and, as he did not individually commit the
                        murders, or in legal terms advise them, he must be held as innocent.</p>
                    <p>2. It is established that the President may violate any law of the nation
                        with impunity. He may assume that the law authorizing our national debt is
                        unconstitutional, and arrest the payment of interest and the redemption of
                        matured obligations. There is now no power to restrain him if he shall
                        decide so to act. Until the Supreme Court shall formally decide that the law
                        is constitutional, he can utterly repudiate every obligation of the
                        government; and even when the Supreme Court shall have decided against him,
                        he may assume that the organization of the court is illegal. He may also at
                        once arrest the collection of the revenue by pronouncing the law invalid,
                        instead of allowing half of it to be stolen by partizan favorites, and the
                        army, the navy, the treasury, and every department and every law of the
                        government are subject to the whims of the Executive. To arraign him now for
                        such offences would be folly. It is made the established law of the nation
                        that no usurpation on the part of the President can be an offence against
                        the people, unless he accompanies his acts with the open declaration that he
                        commits them "with the intent" to destroy the government.</p>
                    <p>3. The President has henceforth unbridled license to denounce the supreme
                        power of the nation as irregular, unconstitutional and revolutionary. He may
                        not only violate its laws at his pleasure, but he may teach popular
                        disrespect for Congress and its enactments, and no measure of indecency,
                        sedition or blasphemy can constitute an offence. There is no statute
                        demanding the proprieties of life on the part of the President, or requiring
                        him to teach obedience to the laws, and he is not therefore amenable for
                        such offences.</p>
                    <p>4. The President can now, with entire safety, practically defeat the loyal
                        reconstruction of the rebel States. Had Wade become President, treason would
                        have yielded to the loyal power of the nation; but now a new invitation is
                        given to every unrepentant traitor to persist in opposition, even to blood
                        shed, to every act of Congress. It has been done so far without punishment
                        in a single instance, when the President and his supporters were under some
                        measure of restraint. Now they have no retribution to fear, and why should
                        not they maintain their consistency and gratify their fiendish instincts by
                        fresh butcheries. The military authorities may henceforth be subject to the
                        purposes of the President, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, and how
                        far lawlessness and disorder shall sway in the South depends upon the
                        courage of the President to enforce his own triumphant policy.</p>
                    <p>5. The entire patronage of the nation has been decided to be within the gift
                        of the President. While the Senate has been regarded as part of the
                        appointing power, and the laws regulating offices have been hitherto
                        accepted as binding upon the Executive, the Senate has judicially decided
                        that the President may disregard the Senate and the laws whenever they
                        interpose to defeat his purposes. The Senate, after having repeatedly
                        decided that its prerogatives must be respected, has formally and solemnly
                        decided that it has no rights the President must respect and that there are
                        no laws the President must obey. He may suspend, remove and appoint just as
                        he pleases, with or without the concurrence of the Senate; and if the Senate
                        claims its constitutional rights, it is only necessary for the President to
                        assume that the Senate, and if need be the constitution itself, are
                        unconstitutional, and he must be vindicated. The Senate has practically
                        decided that there is no Senate and no laws unless the President condescends
                        to recognize them.</p>
                    <p>Such are some of the leading principles decided by the acquittal of the
                        President. Of the practical, tangible results of the decision, but two are
                        conspicuous among the many:</p>
                    <p>1. Of the eleven states once in rebellion, but three can now be relied upon
                        to maintain loyal ascendency in the administration of their governments.
                        Tennessee is safe because the rebels are sweepingly disfranchised, and South
                        Carolina and Florida are safe because the negroes largely predominate over
                        the whites.--Beyond these three States I do not regard any of the eleven as
                        likely to vote for Grant and Colfax in November. Louisiana, North Carolina
                        and Arkansas may be debatable States, but with the practical withdrawal of
                        the military power from the side of the loyal people, I do not hope that
                        more than three of the rebellious States will vote Republican, while seven
                        are likely to vote for the nominees of the New York Convention, as Davis,
                        Beauregard and Forest will advise them.</p>
                    <p>2. The whiskey tax is practically repealed as far as the government is
                        concerned. Not one dollar in ten is collected now, and as there is no
                        possibility of removing the "ring" while its chief, the the
                        President, remains in office, and keeps its agents in every channel of power
                        reaching the public revenues, its collection henceforth under this
                        administration is an utter impossibility. If it nominally remains, it will
                        be but a gigantic fraud to debauch the people as it debauched the United
                        States Senate, and Congress will act wisely in repealing it, or reducing the
                        tax to a nominal figure. It is not now a question of revenue. It is a
                        question of how many millions the whiskey ring can make up to defeat the
                        election of Grant to the Presidency. The whiskey tax is now but a corruption
                        fund and its repeal will affect only the occupation of the thieves and
                        hyenas who swarm around the pestilential camp of Andrew Johnson.</p>

<b>Wants to Get Away</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper ridicules the Valley Spirit's belittling comments about General
                    Grant. The editors vigorously defend Grant's character and ask why the Spirit's

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Gen. Grant is said to be very anxious to get out of Washington, but he is
                        ashamed to apply to the President for leave of absence. He sneaks from his
                        residence to his headquarters with his head down, hardly daring to look
                        anybody in the face. He is "dead beat." He knows it and is conscious that
                        everybody else knows it. He is said to look small enough to be shut up
                        inside of an ordinary soup tureen. No wonder. Any man would look small and
                        feel mean, who had done what Grant has been guilty of."--Valley Spirit.</p>
                    <p>WHEN the present proprietors assumed charge of the REPOSITORY, they also
                        pledged themselves to the people to furnish the earliest and most
                        interesting news. Hitherto they have held up their heads proudly in the
                        belief that they had fulfilled their promise. Now alas, bowed down with
                        humiliation and shame, "scarcely daring to look anybody in the face," they
                        admit their miserable failure and concede to their neighbor, the Spirit, the place which they had vain gloriously
                        assumed. To think that Gen. Grant is the candidate of the great Republican
                        party for the Presidency, and that we profess to be it may be the unworthy
                        organ, still the organ, of the party in this part of the "footstool," and
                        not know, until informed by the Spirit, that Gen.
                        Grant is "sneaking about Washington with his head down, hardly daring to
                        look anybody in the face." To add to our humiliating confusion, the Spirit continues with the most perfect nonchalance, and that, too, in the hot month of
                        June as if it was as common as an old gossip's twice told tale. "No wonder.
                        Anybody would look small and feel mean who had done what Grant had been
                        guilty of."</p>
                    <p>If the Spirit had only informed us what Grant
                            has been guilty of, we might have accepted
                        the alternative of denying it, or admitting it and boldly asserting that we
                        knew it long ago, but didn't deem it worthy of consideration. But these
                            Spirit men are sagacious fellows, perfect
                        Mrs. Nancies. They know something "so very terrible, perfectly dreadful. It
                        makes them shudder. Tell! Oh, no, they couldn't think of telling, for the
                        world. Just think of their poor sensitive nerves. But it was a dreadful
                        thing. To think of the boldness of this bad little man. What will become of
                        us!"</p>
                    <p>We are reminded of Sam. Weller and the Shepherd's "particular wanity" and
                        wonder what is the particular crime in the Spirit's catalogue of criminality, but we are at a loss to
                        conjecture. We did think that fighting rebels and traitors reached its
                        conception of crowning villainy, and but that the war has been over for
                        three years, we would be ready to believe that this was Grant's offence. He
                        did wallop them awfully, didn't he? But it can't be for this that he "sneaks
                        about hardly daring to look anybody in the face." We never knew him to boast
                        about it, but it always seemed to us that he was pretty well satisfied with
                        his work. Gen. Grant was a temporary member of Johnson's cabinet, which we
                        admit is fearfully demoralizing and enough to make almost any man hang his
                        head with shame. But while he was among them he was not of them. He was
                        incorruptible, and passed through the ordeal with character and reputation
                        unsullied. He executed the trying duties of the war office with integrity
                        and economy. His statesmanship was as marked and able as had been his
                        military ability in the field, and instead of disgracing himself, he won the
                        commendation of all loyal men. So this can't be the Spirit's ghost.</p>
                    <p>But is there anything else Grant could have been guilty of? The Democracy say
                        that he can neither write nor speak. But a man's failure to master these
                        accomplishments can scarcely be classified among crimes. The lack of these
                        cannot be said to make up the essence of guilt.
                        It is true Grant don't write voluminously, nor make long speeches. Still he
                        might make out to ask the President for leave of absence. Besides, we have a
                        number of his speeches and letters on record, which may be found in every
                        creditable history of the late war, which, in addition, will show that he
                        had a most extraordinary facility at making his mark. Unlike the marks of
                        other illiterate men, his never needs a witness to identify them. Buckner
                        and Pendleton, Johnson and Lee, and a host of other rebels learned to know
                        his style so well that it was not even necessary to wait for the mark to
                        identify his letters. If the Democracy are still incredulous as to his
                        literary attainments, we refer them to these gentlemen, who will, we doubt
                        not, be pleased to give the most satisfactory testimonials.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Chief Justice Chase, in his letter of the 25th of May, wherein he bids for
                        the Democratic Nomination makes this extraordinary statement: "If the
                        Democratic party would take ground which would assure the party against all
                        attempts to subvert the principles of universal suffrage established in all
                        of the Southern Constitutions, then I think the fortune of the great cause
                        for which I have labored so long would be secure, and I should not regret my
                        absence from political labors."</p>
                    <p>This declaration, alone, coming from Chief Justice Chase, who cannot be
                        ignorant of the history the Democratic party has made for itself in the
                        past, shows the degree of political blindness and stupidity which overtakes
                        men when possessed with an unholy desire for the Presidency.</p>
                    <p>Consider what the man asks, and deny if you can that his ambition has made
                        him a hopeless imbecile; or how could he expect the Democratic party to take
                        ground in favor of the principle of universal suffrage? What are the facts?
                        Their entire history has identified them with the system of slavery, and an
                        obtrusive, radical hostility to the freedom of the black man. Their boast
                        has ever been, and still is to-day, that this is a white man's government.
                        Their prominent leaders and law makers were always slaveholders and their
                        legislation was a studied and persistent recognition of the right of one
                        race to enslave another. The rebellion was a war for slavery and made solely
                        by the Democratic party. There were only Democrats in the rebel ranks. And
                        let it not be forgotten that the Democratic Party in the North have put
                        themselves as thoroughly on the record against the principle of universal
                        suffrage, and even universal freedom, as their Southern brethren. They ever
                        voted against furnishing men and money to carry on the war and save the
                        Government. They declared every act of Congress and every act of the
                        martyred Lincoln to suppress the rebellion unconstitutional. They declared
                        the war a failure and that the Government must cease to oppose their
                        Southern brethren. They rejoiced over rebel victories, and were sad when
                        Union armies were triumphant. They declared the draft unconstitutional, and
                        urged resistance even to blood. They refused the payment of war taxes. They
                        denounced Union Soldiers as "Lincoln hirelings." They inaugurated bloody
                        riots in New York to defeat the Union cause. To-day they are the same party
                        in principle, spirit and sympathy, and love the cause of the rebellion as
                        much and as honestly as they did then. If it were possible to elect him,
                        they would rather vote for Jeff Davis for President than for Judge Chase. In
                        view of this record what must we concede of a life long advocate of
                        universal suffrage who seeks a nomination for the Presidency in the
                        Democratic Party. Is he only unveiling the demagogue, or is he mad?</p>

                        valuable paper, that after the leaders of the so-called Democratic
                            party party, in secret conclave at Democratic headquarters,
                        near the Court House had determined to hold a Conservative Soldiers' and
                        Sailors' Convention, to send delegates to the Democratic Convention at New
                        York, on the 4th of July next, runners were sent out to invite the soldiers.
                        The town and country was minutely canvassed, letters were written and mailed
                        urging the faithful to see to it that there should be a grand turn out. The
                            Valley Spirit published the call, parading a
                        good many names, some of whom say they never signed or authorized any one to
                        sign the call for them. Be that as it may, at an early hour on the morning
                        of the 15th inst., our citizens were aroused from their usual quiet by
                        martial music, which must certainly have been a reminder of the advance of
                        Gen. Lee upon our borough, or some of the lesser Rebel Generals.</p>
                    <p>At 8 1/2 o'clock the Conservatives were gathered and formed into column, viz:
                        Brass band, one drummer and one fifer, standard bearer, twelve soldiers (one
                        of whom wears the letter "D,") and eight or ten home guards--the latter
                        under the immediate command of Col. J.A.S. Cramer, the former under Segt. N.
                        Humelshine, and all under command of Chief Marshal F.M. Kimmel, who, by the
                        by, was in the saddle early in the morning, much to the delight of the boys,
                        who had for the first time the pleasure of seeing this distinguished
                        military officer mounted, and who greeted him with "whoa! January." The
                        column marched under the command of their chief to the Cumberland Valley
                        depot, to receive the hosts that were to come in the Hagerstown train, from
                        Waynesboro, Greencastle, Mercersburg and other places.</p>
                    <p>The train came at the usual time, not having been detained one minute in
                        loading up the lame and wounded soldiers and sailors. The cars were emptied
                        and the braves formed, when it was found that a division of two brass bands,
                        martial music, twenty-eight soldiers, one half of whom never smelled
                        gunpower in battle, and forty three home guards, comprised too large a body
                        for the command of the Chief Marshal (he never before having commanded so
                        many soldiers, who therefore took advantage of serious indisposition, and
                        turned over the command to Sergt. Humelshine, and with his aid road up
                        Second street to Catharine, up Catharine to Main, down Main to the Diamond,
                        refusing along the route to receive boquets or ribbons, but carefully
                        reviewing the improvements, as he had done on a former occasion, just before
                        he made haste out the Pittsburg Pike to meet and surrender the town to his
                        particular friend, General Stuart, after which he dismissed his aid,
                        dismounted and returned to his office to prepare his pronunciamento,
                        declaring General Robert E. Lee the greatest Military General of the age.</p>
                    <p>The column marched from the depot up Second to Market, and down Market to the
                        Court House, amidst the most vociferous shouts from the Colored Gents from
                        Wolfstown (whether the shouting was in honor or derision of the column, we
                        were unable to learn) and at the Court House were dismissed.</p>
                    <p>At one o'clock the convention assembled in the Court House, and was organized
                        by calling Col. Frank Winger to the chair, who said he had not prepared a
                        speech and would not make a speech, "at the same time pulling out of his
                        side pocket a manuscript which he commenced reading as follows: "But I am
                        proud to be permitted to address such a vast assemblage of soldiers, sailors
                        and marines," and continued reading until he had finished all that he or
                        some one else had written.</p>
                    <p>Capt. G.W. Skinner offered a series of resolutions, and Lieut. Detrich moved
                        to amend one of the resolutions, but the president being familiar with
                        parliamentary law, decided that tweedle dee and tweedle dum meant one and
                        the same thing, and poor Detrich, the U S Revenue officer was cried down.
                        Then Capt. Skinner being called, said he had not expected to be called on,
                        and would not make a speech, but continued talking for some time, commencing
                        every new thought with now one word about Grant, and finally got off the
                        following decided clincher, viz: notwithstanding General Grant's military
                        record as a soldier, he is the greatest villain of them all, and concluded
                        with the warning that Grant would manipulate the electoral vote, by the
                        military if by no other means.</p>
                    <p>After which Wm. S. Stenger, Esq., was called, who dwelt long and loud in his
                        thanks to the soldiers and empty seats for the privilege of addressing them.
                        He then paid his respects to Gen. Grant by saying that no Republican speaker
                        in this county, in this State or the United States, would dare assert in
                        public that Gen. Grant had sufficient capacity to fill the Presidential
                        chair, and concluded by saying that he knew the white race in the South were
                        so far superior to any other race in this country, that when they got into
                        Congress, as he had no doubt they would notwithstanding the opposition of
                        the Democratic representatives, they would repudiate all acts of Congress
                        passed since they voluntarily left the halls of Congress, and he would stand
                        by them in doing so. We thought this good law and logic, coming from the
                        District Attorney, who is sworn to support the laws as they are. After
                        Stenger concluded the Convention adjourned sine
                        die.</p>

                    <p>THE "Boys in Blue" had a large and enthusiastic meeting in the Court House on
                        Monday evening last. James G. Elder, the gallant Colonel of the 126th P.V.,
                        called the house to order. On motion of Col. M'Gowan, a committee consisting
                        of Col. M'Gowan, Lieut. J. W. Fletcher, Godfrey Greenawalt, John H. Leisher,
                        and David Forbes was appointed to report permanent officers and draft a
                        constitution. Whilst they were performing their duties, Adjt. John Stewart
                        made an eloquent and earnest address. The Committee after the conclusion of
                        Mr. Stewart's remarks, reported as permanent officers the following
                        gentlemen, who were real soldiers during the war, who never flinched from
                        danger, nor shirked a duty: Prest., Col. James G. Elder; Vice Prests.,
                        Sergt. Thomas Grimason, Private Theophilus Stratten; Sectys., Sergt John A.
                        Seiders, Sergt. Harry Strickler; Treasurer, Capt- Calvin Gilbert; Marshal,
                        Col. F.S. Stumbaugh; Asst. Marshals, Maj. L.B. Kurtz, Maj. John Doebler;
                        Chairman Executive Committee, Thad. M. Mahon. Their reputation as brave men
                        is not limited to Franklin county, and their patriotism and daring is but a
                        part of the history of the Armies that conquered treason. There is not one
                        who has not proved his devotion to his country in battle, several were
                        promoted for bravery, and two of them, Col. Elder and Sergt. Strickler were
                        severely wounded in the discharge of their duties. If the Conservative
                        soldiers, whether picked from those that met in the Court House on the 26th
                        inst., or from their conquered allies in the armies of Lee and Johnson,
                        think they can find ten soldiers of equal merit, we ask them to match ours.
                        The following resolutions were unanimously adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we hereby endorse the action of the
                        National Union Republican Convention, which recently met in Chicago, in
                        selecting as their standard bearer in the coming Presidential contest, our
                        beloved Chief, General Ulysses S. Grant, and Hon. Schuyler Colfax, for the
                        offices of President and Vice President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we also hereby express our cordial
                        approval of the Platform of principals adopted by that convention, and
                        pledge ourselves to do all in our power to secure the triumphant election of
                        the candidates selected by that convention.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we hereby cordially invite all our
                        old associates in arms, who fought for the preservation of our glorious
                        Union and the defeat of the traitors who were endeavoring to destroy it, to
                        join with us in the election of our nominees to the hisghest
                        offices in the fight of the American People.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned to Monday evening next, at their room on the third
                        story of Austin &amp; Elder's Banking House, which they propose holding
                        as their permanent head-quarters.</p>
                    <p>We are authorized by the 'Boys in Blue" to say that they will furnish us with
                        a list of members for publication next week, men that were actual soldiers,
                        not having found it necessary to use names of persons who were never in the
                        service to swell the list.</p>
