<b>Grant as a Man and a Soldier</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints a campaign biography of Grant including sections on his
                    "Kindness to Subordinates," his "Place Among Great Generals," and the fact that
                    he is "Not a Martinet."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper endorses the ticket decided upon at the Republican County
                    Convention. The paper concedes that some "good men" may be disappointed with the
                    results, but all must put factionalism aside in the interest of unity.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Blair and his Letters</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper criticizes Frank Blair, Democratic candidate for vice-president.
                    The paper marvels that the ex-Republican and strong supporter of Lincoln could
                    so completely defect to the Democrats. That fact causes the editors to wonder if
                    all of his beliefs and positions are merely public poses.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Which is It?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper challenges the Democratic Party to declare whether it is "loyal
                    to the government" or if it is "pledged to the heresies which brought about the
                    rebellion."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Democratic Convention</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports on the Democratic nominations for county offices. The
                    article has kind words for some of them but predicts total failure for the
                    Democrats as a whole in the coming election.<br>(Names in announcement: Judge  Kimmell,   Sharpe,   Duncan, Col. B. F. Winger,  W. S. Stenger)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In another column will be found the proceedings of the Democratic County
                        Convention, which met in Chambersburg yesterday. It did its work
                        expeditiously, if not well, and whipped in the refractory members of the
                        party, as usual. The larger number of the candidates nominated have
                        travelled over the course before, some with good, some with indifferent
                        success. The names of Kimmell, Sharpe, Duncan, Winger and Stenger are
                        familiar to most of us, and even the candidates for the minor offices have
                        been willing to serve their fellow citizens in the past.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kimmell, if he is seeking compliments, is doubtless satisfied, since
                        the Convention declared him the choice of the county for Congress, and took
                        care to appoint Conferees who will see that he is not nominated.</p>
                    <p>Sharpe is presented by the county for the office of Additional Law Judge, and
                        will doubtless be nominated by the Democracy of the district. If he could
                        possibly be elected, he would make an able and upright Judge, but as his
                        chances for election are not quite so good as they were two years ago, when
                        his party gave him the empty and expensive nomination for Congress. We would
                        advise him not to be lifted up, but to "go slow," for on the question of
                        Judgeship the Democracy lack voters "first rate."</p>
                    <p>Duncan was a candidate for the Senate three years ago, and became so taken
                        with the idea that it has stuck to him ever since. He is not without hope,
                        as, if any part of the ticket is to be elected, it is that part to which he
                        has attached his fortunes. His nomination is assumed to be certain, as Adams
                        concedes the candidate to Franklin county.</p>
                    <p>Col. B. F. Winger is the choice of the the Convention for
                        Assembly, which is equivalent to his nomination. He represented this
                        district in the House last winter with as much credit as any Democrat,
                        especially such a new one, is likely to do, and would be quite willing to
                        serve it in the same capacity again. But we Republicans have concluded to
                        resume the place occupied by Winger, and he will therefore be retired. He
                        will withdraw from public life with our very kindest wishes for his comfort
                        and happiness, having been amply compensated by his friends for his apostacy
                        from the Republican party.</p>
                    <p>W. S. Stenger was again nominated, and for the third time, for the office of
                        District Attorney. His opponent, Welsh, has never had anything of his party,
                        is in moderate circumstances and was a soldier in the war of the Rebellion.
                        His right to the nomination was conceded on all hands, but Stenger was the
                        pet of Chambersburg, and of the lawyers, and the Democracy are not rewarding
                        soldiers now, except those who fought at the other end of the line; so Welsh
                        was executed and loaded on the tumbril with the corpses of six decapitated
                        candidates for Sheriff, and carted out of sight.</p>
                    <p>Taking the whole ticket together, it may be regarded as possessing more than
                        the average of merit and ability. It makes little odds though, as the second
                        Tuesday in October will dispose of the offices and candidates in a away that
                        will leave the Democratic ticket very much as these candidates, with a
                        single exception, left the war to suppress the rebellion, to take care of
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>We may have something to say of them hereafter.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the Platform of Principles adopted
                        by the late National Republican Convention at Chicago, is the embodiment of
                        the true, essential and cardinal principles of our Great Party; a triumphant
                        appeal to the reason and loyalty of the people, and in the whole and every
                        part merits and meets our cordial assent and endorsement.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in the selection of Ulysses S.
                        Grant, whose name is the synonym of victory, for President, and Schuyler
                        Colfax, the model of Christian Statesmen, for Vice President, the National
                        Convention but formally expressed the wish of the loyal people, and ratified
                        a nomination long before made by them; and nothing intervenes between these
                        candidates of the people and the offices they have been indicated by destiny
                        and their own pre-eminent merits to fill, but the formalities of election,
                        and the ceremonies of inauguration.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the citizen soldiers of the
                        Republic, whose persistent bravery, unparalleled heroism secured the land
                        from the dangers of anarchy and dissension and restored it through peril and
                        suffering, merit a renewed recognition of their patriotism and fidelity;
                        that the Republican party now, as heretofore; gratefully tenders to them the
                        thanks of the nation, saved, redeemed and disenthralled; and pledges to them
                        and their dear ones, widowed and orphaned in the strife, the support and
                        protection of which war's chances may have bereft them.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That this Convention has presented to
                        the voters of Franklin county, in the persons of its nominees, gentlemen
                        every way worthy of the cordial support of the people for their respective
                        offices, a ticket that ought to be and can be elected, and to the election
                        of which we pledge our united energies.</p>
                    <p>On motion Convention adjourned.</p>
