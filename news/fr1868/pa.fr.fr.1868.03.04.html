<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor maps out the prime reasons why the impeachment of President
                    Johnson was justified and inevitable. Johnson violated the Tenure of Office Act
                    by removing Stanton from the War Department and the Senate impeached Johnson as
                    a result. The paper predicts that although public opinion could swing the
                    verdict, both Congress and the public know Johnson should be impeached.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The President of the United States is now arraigned before the Senate on
                        trial for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors. Because a President has
                        never before been impeached in the history of our government, many people
                        are slow to accept the proceeding as likely to depose the Chief Magistrate
                        of the nation.</p>
                    <p>Of course Senators are reticent on the subject, and no one can speak for
                        them, but there are circumstances surrounding the case from which the result
                        may by conjectured with reasonable certainty. While Senators will not
                        declare in advance how their verdict will be made up, we may with propriety
                        consider the facts likely to control their decision.</p>
                    <p>The first step towards impeachment, although an indirect one, was taken in
                        the Senate. When the President notified the Senate that he had "removed" Mr.
                        Stanton, the Senate, by a united Republican vote, officially notified the
                        President, Mr. Stanton and Gen. Thomas that the act was unlawful, and in obedience to that notification, Mr. Stanton
                        refused to surrender the Department of War. The Senate thus initiated
                        impeachment by its solemn, official declaration that the act of the
                        President was without authority of law, and, of necessity, an act of
                        usurpation. The language used by the Senate was as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Resolved, That under the constitution and laws of
                        the United States, the President has no power to remove
                            the Secretary of War, and designate any other officer to perform
                        the duties of that office."</p>
                    <p>Such was the decision of the same Senators who are to sit as jurors to decide
                        whether he has been guilty of usurpation. The resolution was not passed in
                        haste or without careful reflection. It was well considered, and passed with
                        a full appreciation of the momentous nature of the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>Following the action of the Senate was the action of the House, in adopting a
                        resolution impeaching the President by a solid Republican vote. Thus have
                        the Republicans of both branches of Congress unanimously expressed their
                        convictions as to the lawlessness of the Executive, and every Republican
                        vote in the Senate cast to acquit the President, must be in violation of a
                        positive record already made. We do not say that because Senators so voted,
                        they must necessarily declare the President guilty. If they believe that the
                        first vote was wrong, they should vote to acquit him; but in view of all the
                        facts, we do not consider any such changes in the convictions of Senators as
                        probable.</p>
                    <p>While the law and the facts will doubtless control the verdict in this case,
                        in a grave national trial, involving the removal of the President, the tone
                        of public sentiment will have great if not controlling weight. The people in
                        this government, after all, are the sovereigns of the Republic, and they
                        revise either directly or indirectly the decisions of all tribunals known to
                        the law. If the movement to impeach Andrew Johnson had met the decided and
                        positive disapprobation of the people, it would have failed; but the public
                        expression from all classes and interests, outside of mere politicians, have
                        been in earnest accord with impeachment. This sentiment would not be
                        sufficient to convict the President wrongfully, but it will strengthen the
                        impeaching power to deal with his usurpations justly.</p>
                    <p>Looking over the whole ground calmly, we believe that impeachment will be
                        successful, and that after a patient and impartial trial, Andrew Johnson
                        will be deposed from the Presidency, and disqualified for holding any office
                        of honor or profit in the United States.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The chief editor of this journal was one of the Delegates at large from
                        Pennsylvania in the convention that nominated Andrew Johnson for Vice
                        President; and alike in these columns and by his vote and efforts at
                        Baltimore, he earnestly urged Mr. Johnson for the Vice Presidency. When he
                        was to be inaugurated as the second officer of the government, he came a
                        reeling, maudlin drunkard, and, after the most humiliating exhibition of his
                        debauchery in the Senate, he was hurried away by some friends. He never
                        afterwards appeared in the Senate to take the Vice President's chair, for
                        the reason that his presence there would have led to his censure if not his
                        expulsion from office.</p>
                    <p>We held then, as we hold now, that there are occasions when party interests
                        fade in utter insignificance before the great interests of the nation. We
                        had been the earnest personal and political friend of Andrew Johnson, and
                        had borne some humble part in effecting his nomination and thereby in
                        effecting his election to the high position he disgraced when on the very
                        threshold of its honors and duties. Every party interest and personal
                        inclination would have shielded him, but every public interest demanded his
                        censure and removal. In THE REPOSITORY of March 15th, 1865, we expressed our
                        convictions of duty in the plainest terms in the leading article in the
                        paper, and although gravely censured by enthusiastic and ambitious
                        politicians, we never had reason to regret that the occasion had been met by
                        the vindication of the truth and a demand for the just consequences of the
                        wrong.</p>
                    <p>Soon after Mr. Johnson became President, and, while we joined in the
                        prevailing sentiment to sustain him, we did not in any degree recede from
                        our position, nor did we ever approach him until he twice requested a
                        personal interview.--Some six months after his accession to the Presidency,
                        in obedience to his invitation, we had a conference with him, and again
                        incurred the displeasure of those who love to bask in the sunshine of power,
                        even at the cost of principle, by declaring that he was "not insensible to
                        the flattering ap"proval of his administration by the "Democratic
                        party," and that where in his record "the nation shall see that "'treason is
                        the greatest of crimes and "must be punished,' is not to my mind apparent."</p>
                    <p>--Andrew Johnson has fully justified the apprehensions we expressed when he
                        was inaugurated Vice President. That all may be reminded of the bold and
                        earnest stand this journal took to correct palpable evils within its own
                        party, we republish in to-day's paper the article of March, 1865. It was
                        republished in triumph by the Democratic journals throughout the country,
                        although it told no truth that was not known to every intelligent citizen.</p>
                    <p>The crime of Andrew Johnson at that time was not against a political party,
                        but against a common country--a blot upon our common nationality. Now he has
                        repeated the offence, only in a graver form--an offence so monstrous that
                        drunkenness would be a charitable excuse for it. He assails the laws of the
                        land; assumes to be superior to, and in no way bound by them; and his
                        offence is a crime against every citizen of the republic. Cunning attorneys
                        may quibble as they can, but he has thrown off all disguise and stands
                        before the world as a reckless usurper.</p>
                    <p>Yet partizan journals sustain him, and cry revolution to divert the people
                        from his crimes. If he had committed the same offences in the interest of
                        the Republican party, there is not a Democratic journal that would not
                        demand his impeachment; but as his offence was in the interest of treason,
                        every sophistry is called into requisition by Democratic journals to defend
                        him. When he wronged the nation as a representative of the Republican party,
                        we condemned him, and now when he has defied the constitution and the laws,
                        and periled the peace and safety of the country by his madness, we can
                        consistently join in the general demand for his expulsion from the high
                        office he has so shamefully dishonored.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Andrew Johnson is to be removed from office at last, by the mode provided in
                        the Constitution for just such men as he. He has been no doubt before this
                        sheet is circulated summoned before the bar of the Senate, and there is no
                        appreciable probability that he can escape conviction.--True he is to be
                        defended by able and ingenious counsel. Jeremiah Black and O'Connor, among
                        the chosen few.--Shrewd lawyers, to catch on technicalities and to mystify
                        the law by a thousand wily ways. Heaven pity the ordinary jury before which
                        such men should argue an important political case. They would soon become
                        entangled in such a maze of points, doubts, decisions, and inferences, that
                        they would have to summon the shade of Webster from the other world to
                        unravel the tangle. But in this trial fortunately, the children of darkness
                        are not wiser than the children of light. The men who compose the United
                        States Senate are conversant with the law of the land. Dark and well thrown
                        will be the cloud of legal dust their eyes cannot penetrate. The light from
                        the lanterns of the advocates of the stern Diogenes of the White House will
                        do well to pale and overcome the gleam from the small candles of ordinary
                        minds, but when it mingles its rays with those brighter sun beams of
                        intellect, which will play round the Senate chamber, where that trial is
                        held, the lantern light will be scarcely noticeable. No legal necromancy can
                        save Johnson now. In the natural course of legal proceeding, after judgment
                        usually comes execution. But some persons think when the law comes to be
                        executed on Andrew Johnson, the would-be executive, judiciary and
                        legislature, that the Democratic party will veto it. We know that it will be
                        a bitter pill for some of their leaders, both North and South of the
                        Potomac, but what will they do to avoid it. They have had to swallow more
                        than one dose of wholesome medicine prescribed by the Constitution of the
                        land since 1861, and they will swallow this though they may make wry faces
                        at it now.--Congress have right and justice on their side and the people of
                        the North of both parties know it. The people of America are too honest and
                        intelligent to be led as a mass into what they know to be lawlessness, by
                        the leaders of any party. As in '61, so now, the rank and file of the
                        Democratic party will not as a mass take up arms to fight for treason and
                        against law. To vote for Sharswood at the last election, and to rise in arms
                        against the United States government now; to fight with Lee and Beauregard,
                        and Johnson, and Jeff Davis, against the United States army under Grant, and
                        Sheridan, and Sherman, and Geo. H. Thomas, and Meade, and Burnside and
                        Geary, and a host of loyal Generals sustained by all the loyal people in the
                        country, are different affairs. However evil disposed, men will hesitate
                        long before they will enter such a contest with the chances so fearfully
                        against them. Before they raise badly armed and undisciplined mobs without
                        munitions of war to a great extent, and entirely without artillery, unless
                        indeed it be Swann's three light batteries, to fight the legal governmental
                        armies under the leaders who crushed the last rebellion, supported by a
                        people like those of America, men will consider, and waver, and stop. No
                        danger of violence assuming alarming proportions now. The day for that has
                        gone by. Congress has been driven to the wall, and then has stood up nobly
                        in the struggle. This government has ever shown itself to be in a crisis the
                        strongest in the world, and it will not be overthrown and crushed by a
                        little ground swell of treason. The decision of Congress has saved us from
                        national ruin. When this scene in the Republican drama has been enacted, the
                        wisdom of the old couplet will be again vindicated.<br> "Gently, softly,
                        touch a nettle,<br> And it stings you for your pains.<br> Grasp it with
                        hand of mettle,<br> And it soft as silk remains."</p>

                        confederacy as his guide. In the Jeff Davis constitution of the so called
                        confederacy, this provision is found:</p>
                    <p> "The principal officers in each of the Executive departments, and all
                        persons connected with the diplomatic service, may be
                            removed from office at the pleasure of the President."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson is therefore clearly within one
                        constitution in his removal of Mr. Stanton, but unfortunately he is
                        President of our government and the constitution he accepts belongs to
                        another government that now exists only in its bloody and blotted history.
                        Will not the National Intelligencer, the Age, or the Spirit
                        explain to Mr. Johnson that he is either President of the wrong government
                        or has got hold of the wrong constitution? He may take his choice, but we
                        insist that he shall not run both as President of the United States.</p>
