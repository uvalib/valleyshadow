<b>Does it Pay?</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author casts scorn on President Johnson during his impeachment trial,
                    accusing him of betraying his political friends in his removal of Stanton as
                    Secretary of War.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson developes as one of its incidents the
                        madness and folly of betraying ones political friends in order to conciliate
                        one's political foes. Except as a warning to traitors and demagogues, the
                        trial by the most august court of the land of the Chief Executive, attracts
                        no less and more attention than that of any great criminal; and the people
                        judge correctly in the premises. Andrew Johnson is to-day as completely
                        without sympathy from either Democratic or Republican party as the wandering
                        Jew, and his distinguished counsel defend him just as they would defend any
                        one charged with a felony. This is his real attitude before the country. No
                        one believes that the attempted removal of Stanton from the War Office and
                        the appointment of Adjutant General Thomas as Secretary of War ad interim was prompted by an honest desire to
                        serve the country, obey the laws, or to allay the fear and anxiety of the
                        people. It was simply the blind clutching at straws of a drowning man. He
                        had mounted the political wave and it was rapidly carrying him into rocks
                        and breakers where his boat, freighted with all his treasonable schemes,
                        must inevitably have gone to pieces. Cast out from the party which has
                        raised him to power, because of his crimes, it became necessary to secure
                        another; but Congress had so hedged him about that he was not able to pay
                        the price of admission into the band of leaders of the Democratic party.
                        True the offers were tempting enough to beguile even better men than the
                        Democratic leaders, but the consideration always failed. The admission of
                        traitors to Congress from the seceded States, with blood on their hands and
                        perjury in their hearts, was a generous bid and would have secured a
                        correspondingly high place in the copperhead ranks; especially as the
                        re-enslavement of four million freedmen was a trifle thrown in. But Congress
                        was on alert and the consideration failed. The attempt to debauch the great
                        Captains of the army, which Johnson's position gave him an opportunity to
                        try, might have made him friends of the disloyal party, but, except by a few
                        adventurers, his blandishments were spurned with virtuous and indignant
                        contempt, and the consideration failed. Postmasters were willing to lick the
                        dust and revenue officers to defraud the Government in his service, but
                        these alone could not rescue the Democratic party from defeat, nor fill the
                        rapacious maws of hungry office-seekers. The price was inadequate, and
                        Johnson was in despair. Only one thing remained to be done. Congress could
                        neither be frightened, swindled, nor bought; and Stanton, by the action of
                        the Senate, had been restored to the War Office, where so long as he
                        remained the treasonable designs of the President must fail.</p>

                    <p>In his last attempt to defeat a loyal Government, and place its power in the
                        hands of traitors, Johnson may have judged wisely of the willingness of the
                        Democratic party to sustain his wicked policy but he certainly failed to
                        measure their party courage. The people are honest and just, and no party
                        dare ask them to do a wrong thing as a wrong thing. Hence it is, when the
                        extreme test came the President found himself without a party and without a
                        friend. The several Democratic State Conventions have wholly ignored him;
                        the Democratic National Committee insulted him, and the army officers whom
                        he cajoled, and flattered and raised to power prudently avoid any
                        expressions or actions in his favor. His favorite "policy" has become a
                        scorn and a byword, and he stands before the people whom he outraged, today,
                        a culprit to be tried for violating and trampling upon laws which he had
                        sworn to maintain and defend.</p>

                    <p>Andrew Johnson failed to remember, in his besotted madness, that if he
                        betrayed his political friends, he could not deceive his political foes.
                        Circumstances now transpiring will doubtless refresh his memory.</p>

<b>More Fruits of My Policy</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper gives an account of the assassination of an important man by the
                    Klan and calls for swift justice against "southern traitors" who continue to
                    commit outrages.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Encouraged by the reprobate who so unfortunately for the interest of the
                        country presides over the destinies of this nation, southern traitors are
                        still at work. No crime is so enormous, no act so heinous, that they will
                        not perpetrate to retard the growth of loyal sentiment, or check the
                        sympathies of their own neighbors in behalf of the Union.</p>

                    <p>In Columbus, Ga., on the 3d ult., there was held a Republican meeting for the
                        purpose of listening to the eloquent remarks of the celebrated colored
                        orator, Rev. Mr. Turner. Hon. George Ashburn, who resided in that city, a
                        sterling Radical, and one of the most prominent advocates of Congressional
                        Reconstruction, was present. Traitors could not permit this. He must pay a
                        penalty for his love of the "old flag," the "stars and bars" must be
                        vindicated, and loyalty must be suppressed, even if the assassin's weapons
                        should be used. At two o'clock on the following morning, he was murdered by
                        the admirers of Andrew Johnson and the friends of Modern Democracy.</p>

                    <p>He adds but another name to the list of patriots whose devotion to liberal
                        ideas made them martyrs. This noble band could easily have purchased peace
                        and safety for themselves and their families, by silence or an outward
                        acquiescence to the subjugated members of Jeff. Davis' confederacy, but
                        their consciences forbid it. Our statesmen and our people cannot regard
                        these expressions of hostility and deadly enmity in any other than their
                        true light, and demand of those in power an honest investigation, a speedy
                        trial, and a certain execution. Let it once be known that the hour of mercy
                        has passed forever, and that stern retributive justice shall be meted out to
                        both the principals and accessories in those horrible outrages, and then,
                        and not till then, will the "Ku Klux Klan" melt as rapidly as Lee's army at
                        Appomattox Court House.</p>

<b>A Registry Law</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article details a new bill requiring voters in the state to register
                    before voting.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Legislature has passed, and the Governor signed, a supplement to our
                        election laws, requiring the registration of voters throughout the State.
                        This is a much needed measure, and calculated to accomplish a great deal of
                        good in the way of preventing fraud at elections. The following is a
                        synopsis of the most important features of the bill:</p>

                    <p>Section 1: - That the assessors shall make lists of voters annually with
                        their residence, whether housekeepers or boarders; the occupation and name
                        of employer, if working for another; whether native citizen voting on age,
                        naturalized, or having declared intentions, expecting to vote upon full
                        payers to be procured before election.</p>

                    <p>During the present year such list to be made out sixty days after the passage
                        of the act; qualifications to be then inquired into before the 1st of
                        September; meetings for rectification and placing additional names on the
                        registry, to be held by the assessors during four days, if necessary, and
                        ten days before the election.</p>

                    <p>Section 2 - Duplicate copies of the registry lists to be made out; one copy
                        to go to the County Commissioners, the others to be posted on the door of
                        the house where the election is to be held prior to August 1st in each year.</p>

                    <p>Section 3 - Assessors, inspectors and judges of election to attend at places
                        for holding elections on Saturday, the tenth day preceding the second
                        Thursday of October, to place names on the registry not thereon, upon due
                        proof of the right of the voter. At the election no person to be allowed to
                        vote whose name is not on the list. Where a person has been omitted he may
                        request a special meeting of the officers to decide on his case; and all
                        such claims may be heard at the election house on the Saturday before the
                        election.</p>

                    <p>Section 4 - Voters may be challenged and put to proof, notwithstanding the
                        fact that their names are on the registry, and the matter be decided
                        according to the law. Naturalized voters must produce their certificates of
                        naturalization, the election officers to place the word "voted," with date
                        and place of election.</p>

                    <p>Section 5 - Registry papers to be sealed up after the election with other
                        election papers.</p>

                    <p>Section 6 - Registry to be reopened in years when there are Presidential
                        elections ten days before the election, and names of voters omitted to be
                        placed thereon.</p>

                    <p>Section 7 - At special elections the registry to govern, but not to exclude
                        citizens not registered who have the right to vote according to law.</p>

                    <p>Section 8 prescribes the oath of office for assessors, inspectors and judges
                        of elections.</p>

                    <p>Section 9 - On the petition of five or more citizens, under oath, setting
                        forth reasons for believing that frauds will be practiced at an election,
                        the Court of Common Pleas may appoint two persons as overseers of elections,
                        one from each political party, if the inspectors belong to different
                        political parties; but when these officers are both of the same party, the
                        overseers are both of the opposite party. The overseers to have a right to
                        be present at the election and to see what is done, keep lists of voters,
                        &amp;c. If said overseers are not allowed to perform their duties, or
                        are driven away by intimidation, the whole pole of that election district or
                        division to be thrown out.</p>

                    <p>Section 10 - If a district polls more votes than are registered, it shall be
                            prima facie evidence of fraud, and the whole
                        vote may be rejected up on a contested election.</p>

                    <p>Section 11 - No court of the State to naturalize any foreigner within ten
                        days of an election, under penalty of misdemeanor in the officer issuing the
                        naturalization certificate. Voting, or attempting to vote, on a fraudulent
                        certificate of naturalization, subjects the party to imprisonment not
                        exceeding three years, and fine not exceeding one thousand dollars.</p>

                    <p>Section 12 - Issuing false receipts by a tax collector, fine not less than
                        one hundred dollars, imprisonment not less than three months.</p>

                    <p>Section 13 - At elections hereafter, polls to open between 6 and 7 o'clock,
                        A. M., and close at 6 P. M.</p>

                    <p>Another excellent bill is pending before the State Senate, which if passed,
                        as it assuredly must, will prove a most valuable and acceptable adjunct to
                        the Registry law. This bill proposes to compel officers of elections to
                        register the names of naturalized voters, with such facts connected with
                        their naturalization as will prevent fraud.</p>
