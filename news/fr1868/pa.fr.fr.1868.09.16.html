<b>A Plea for Coffee</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article outlines an episode of voter fraud orchestrated by the
                    Chairman of the Democratic State Committee. According to the author, the
                    Chairman used coffee to make naturalization papers look properly aged, then sent
                    Irishmen around the state voting for Democrats. This was discovered, but the
                    author warns readers to be vigilant against further fraud.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some things the Democracy claim as their especial election machinery, and the
                        Republicans as readily concede their right to them. They have been theirs so
                        long that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, certainly so long
                        that the law of the land would declare their title good in any court. These
                        are such as Free whisky, Free Fights, Colonizing voters. Ignorance,
                        Hostility to Free Schools. An honest fear of the superiority of the Colored
                        Race, and subserviency to the Slave Masters of the South.</p>

                    <p>With the aid of these, their favorite weapons, they fought and won many
                        battles, and sat down and enjoyed the victory. Success made them boastful,
                        and confident, and insolent, and they believed their power would never end.
                        But the people became intelligent, and learned to know the harmlessness of
                        these weapons. They resisted the encroachments of the Democracy and defeated
                        them. Stung to madness that their right to rule the Government in the
                        interest of Slavery should not only be questioned but denied at the ballot
                        box, they plunged the country into civil war.</p>

                    <p>For four years they strove to overthrow the government and establish one
                        whose corner stone should be Slavery. Again defeated by the loyal people,
                        and their arms taken from them, they turned from the trial by battle to
                        their old tricks, hoping with these and by the introduction and skilful
                        manipulation of new ones to recover what they had lost.</p>

                    <p>In Pennsylvania was found a man whose proficiency in all the old tricks and
                        his knowledge of new ones, pointed him out as one who, if any, could restore
                        his party to power. As all the agencies of the devil were already
                        subordinated to the partie's use, he called to his assistance such as are in
                        themselves harmless.</p>

                    <p>To give him greater facilities, he was made Chairman of the Democratic State
                        Committee and instructed to manufacture enough of votes to carry the State.
                        In 1867 he set himself to work to forge the requisite number of votes, and
                        this is the way he did it. He prepared a large number of naturalization
                        papers, and that the fraud might not be detected, he steeped them in a
                        solution of coffee to give them the appearance of age. He then armed
                        Irishmen with these papers and shipped them into counties where they were
                        not known, gave them a ten days' residence and voted them. By means of these
                        votes one Shugart was elected to the State Senate, and it is said Judge
                        Sharswood was also elected to the Supreme Bench by such votes.</p>

                    <p>But unfortunately for Mr. Wallace, whose name we had forgotten to mention,
                        his nice little trick was found out and his little game was spoiled. John
                        Cessna, the gentleman whom the Spirit loves so much, and calls pet names,
                        and by the way, this is the secret of the Spirit's affection for him, set
                        himself to work and unearthed this nice plot, and cast Mr. Shugart out of
                        the Senate, and proved that Mr. Wallace was the chief devil in this,
                        perhaps, the most infamous fraud upon record.</p>

                    <p>Now, Mr. Wallace is Chairman of the Democratic Senate Committee again, and
                        Mr. Cessna, who is ardently fond of a good cup of pure Java or Mocha,
                        protests against subverting it to such base uses as manufacturing Democratic
                        votes. The Spirit says he is a temperance man and as such he is willing that
                        Mr. Wallace should use whisky and benzine and all other Democratic agencies
                        in this campaign; that he should arouse the Democratic spirit by pouring
                        spirits down Democratic throats, that Democratic voters should have
                        torchlight processions both about them and in them, but that a beverage so
                        harmless and pleasant as coffee, must not be made an engine to manufacture
                        Democratic votes. Suppose that by the aid of a very strong effort made with
                        very strong coffee, Mr. Wallace succeeded in carrying Pennsylvania in
                        October. Who knows but it would be the means of electing a coffee colored
                        President in November. Then the Democracy, we suppose, would deify coffee as
                        they did Slavery, even though it might be necessary to dispose of their
                        dupes when the election is over as they did of one in Pennsylvania last
                        year. We wonder if Mr. Wallace don't know what became of him.</p>

                    <p>It's very commendable to protect your hearth-stones, to strike for your
                        altars and your fires, but we say protect your coffee pots. Guard them with
                        a zealous care, Wallace and his minions are about.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper lambastes General Rosecrans, a Union general who since has
                    written letters to Lee and other once-rebel Generals stating that he feels he
                    fought on the wrong side of the Civil War. The paper then contrasts this with
                    the Confederate General Longstreet, who not only defeated Rosecrans during the
                    war, but also seems to be loyal to the Union and reconstruction now.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The extraordinary conduct and letters of General Rosecrans, coupled with the
                        letters signed by General Lee and a number of other rebel generals and
                        civilians have surprised and wounded his friends. It is well known that he
                        has never forgiven General Grant for rescuing his army from the awful defeat
                        it sustained at Chicamauga through his unaccountable blunders; but no one
                        believed he would debase himself as he has done to the rebels merely on this
                        account.</p>

                    <p>It is a noticeable fact that the reply of General Lee and the other
                        confederate generals to General Rosecrans is not signed by General
                        Longstreet. The people of the North and especially the soldiers will not
                        have forgotten that General Longstreet is the Confederate General who
                        defeated General Rosecrans at Chicamauga, and is now giving his cordial
                        assent to the reconstruction measures of Congress and calling on the troops
                        he so often led to victory to follow him now to peace, success and
                        prosperity, under the leadership of Grant. Are these the reasons why
                        Longstreet's name does not appear to that epistle; first because he defeated
                        Rosecrans and second because he is now loyal, in favor of the election of
                        General Grant and the Reconstruction acts of Congress? The contrast between
                        the two men is certainly mortifying. Rosecrans folds his banner, and by his
                        sycophantic, humiliating adulation of the arch traitor Lee and others
                        manifests his belief that he was fighting on the wrong side during the war,
                        while Longstreet, perhaps the ablest general of them all, lends his voice
                        and intelligence to the cause of the loyal people.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit was thrown into violent spasms by Mr.
                        Cessna's speech, and foamed and worried through a column and a half of
                        personal abuse. It is apparent that the wholesome truths Mr. Cessna had to
                        tell sit very uneasily on the Spirit's political
                        stomach. Perhaps it thinks that as Mr. C. was once a Democrat in good
                        standing, his experience may have enabled him to know many things the Spirit would prefer to have kept concealed, and
                        hence its agitation when he gets up to address a public meeting. Is this the
                        reason why it howls "renegade" so fiercely? We would advise the Spirit to preserve its soul as patiently as its
                        gloomy and agitated feelings will permit. We have many distinguished
                        Republicans who are doing the country yeoman service every day, of whom we
                        are justly proud, against whom the same epithets could be shrieked with as
                        much force as against Mr. Cessna. He needs no vindication at our hands, any
                        more than they do. But if it does you good, gentlemen, by all means keep up
                        the howling.</p>

                        surrendered the professed principles of a life, when he went over to the
                        Democracy. He surrendered a long cherished and oft expressed love for the
                        black man, through an imbecile fear that he might become the superior of the
                        Anglo-Saxon race. He surrendered his adopted home - Chambersburg - through a
                        dread of nasty rebel marauders, and he surrendered his manhood when he
                        publicly apologized to the copperheads of Bedford for having at first

                        nearly all his life; and if his surrendering propensity so completely

                        Friday evening. We were curious to learn what reply a Democrat could make to
                        the vigorous assault of our own champion. The Judge came promptly to time,
                        and much to our surprise and gratification, began to roar as gently as any
                        sucking dove. Having cooed a little in amicable difference with Mr.
                        M'Cauley, who had preceded Mr. Cessna at our meeting, in a few brief and
                        well chosen sentences, the Judge avowed his purpose of treating his theme in
                        a fair, frank and candid manner. Not he to throw dust in his
                        fellow-citizens' eyes! He scorned the trick; he would aim to convince his
                        opponents of the shortcomings of their party, and the need of calling
                        Democrats to power.</p>

                    <p>So he began by saying that we had peace at Lee's surrender - that the war had
                        abolished slavery and had proved by its logic the fallacy of the doctrine of
                        secession. Therefore he concluded that, at Appomattox, the country was
                        completely restored in statu quo ante bellum.</p>

                    <p>The Radicals, however, had refused to so consider it, and by their evil
                        conduct were responsible for all the evil and mischief of the last three
                        years.</p>

                    <p>Just here the Judge was indignant that the Radicals should wish, in this
                        campaign, to recur for any purpose to the years and events of the war. It is
                        idle, quoth the Judge, to revert to the past - it is folly to revive dead
                        issues. Accordingly, he proceeded to arraign the Republican party for its
                        ill conduct, since 1865, in the matters of reconstruction and the finances,
                        and thus made it evident that the past, which Democrats do not wish to care
                        to touch upon, must be the years prior to 1865; and the issues which it is
                        useless and foolish to review are those of the war and anterior to it. Why
                        the Democracy should fight so shyly of what most men now regard as the most
                        instructive, as it certainly is the most glorious period of American
                        history, we are not informed, but with careful particularity the orator
                        proceeded to inform us that although the Government had expended only three
                        hundred millions of money in all, for its working expenses, from Washington
                        to Buchanan, yet the wasteful Republicans are now spending $400,000,000
                        annually for the same purpose. Our debt, it was said was greater than the
                        British - our taxes higher than the French. In these four allegations the
                        Judge was not perhaps aware that there are only four errors. It cost much
                        more than $300,000,000 up to Buchanan's day - the working expenses of the
                        Government, independent of pensions and extraordinary payments on account of
                        the war, and temporary expenses of the war and navy departments are not over
                        $60,000,000 annually - our debt not half of that of the British, our
                        taxation not greater than the French.</p>

                    <p>The speaker attributed the annual expenses to the army, which he said had
                        cost $917,000,000 in three years - that 60,000 men were retained to do the
                        work of ten thousand. He forgot to say that most of that large sum was paid
                        in a few months after the war to the soldiers for their services in the war,
                        and that $38,000,000, were paid in '67 and '68 as additional bounties, and
                        he was in gross error when he said that 10,000 men could do the work. The
                        truth is that the fifty-five skeleton regiments of infantry and ten of
                        cavalry have been inadequate to garrison our posts and keep the Indians
                        down.</p>

                    <p>A fling at the navy, which he said cost $117,000,000 annually, just
                        $74,000,000 greater than the actual cost of 1866, and 87,000,000 greater
                        than that of 1867, followed, but doubtless because he had determined not to
                        go behind 1865, not even a passing word of credit was given the floating
                        fortresses of our country which are ready to repel all foreign armies as
                        successfully as they stormed with shot and shell and coasst-trongholds of
                        the rebels. The Freedman's Bureau, Congress, impeachments and reconstruction
                        were set down as the remaining causes of expenditure. The Judge here grew
                        hazy, for he could not say how much reconstruction had cost us, so giving
                        the rest credit for about three millions annually, he heaped all the
                        remainder upon reconstruction as having a back broad enough to bear it. By
                        way of clincher, at this point, the authority of Jerry Black was invoked,
                        who said somewhere and at sometime, that the Radicals stole $1,000,000,000,
                        but in pity for the convicted Republicans, who, of course, cannot gainsay
                        Jerry Black, Judge Kimmell candidly admitted that the Democrats had stolen
                        some also. How much he did not say, but Black, perhaps, would say they took
                        all the balance. What that balance was we were kindly informed in the next
                        statement, where it was alleged that $1,594,000,000 had been collected in
                        the three years now last past, and but $124,000,000 vouched for. If it be
                        true that the Democrats, out of place and power, as they feelingly complain,
                        stole over $370,000,000, what must they have done in the same time had they
                        had full swing in all of the offices? This conundrum perhaps the Judge will
                        answer when he next comes to talk finances. However, it was boastfully
                        answered that if the Democrats were in power they would begin retrenchment
                        and reform at once - the army would be cut down to a nominal force - the
                        navy would shrink to the redoubtable five frigates and a schooner, which, as
                        Halleck or Drake sang, would sweep the seas from Nova Zembla to the line -
                        Butler would go home and stay in Lowell and stealing would cease. The
                        venerable speaker's face grew placid as he thought of this gladsome
                        consummation. The beautiful picture of a government administered by
                        Democrats - from a Democrat in the White House to Democrats in the "post
                        orifices" at the cross-roads in the remotest rural districts - and all
                        honest and hard working in the service of this country, was so touching to
                        contemplate that we momentarily expected a burst of thanksgiving from the
                        orator and fervent "halleloogias" from the audience. But the MacPelters and
                        Bascoms of the assembly didn't get their cue, unfortunately, and the speech
                        went on. The 'colored cuss,' as he was appropriately styled, was called up
                        and severely rebuked for his irrepressive habit of capturing Radicals and
                        impressing governments in his interest. Here the Judge waxed eloquent and
                        impressive - the antipathy, normal and everlasting, which exists between the
                        blonde, blue-eyed Saxon, and the sable son of Africa, was appealed to, and
                        the sympathetic hearers urged to guard their posterity from the dominance of
                        the so rapidly rising black race. Fear is certainly the most moving of the
                        passions, and the Judge's blue-blooded auditors responded with yells to his
                        forcible appeals. The Court House rang with their shouts, as though they
                        meant to intimidate, then and there, the absent usurpers. With ready tact,
                        the reconstruction measures, which threaten to be the guarantees of this
                        supremacy, were then held up for execration - these abominable expedients
                        were heartily condemned, with saving remark, however, that so far as they
                        were not inconsistent with the Constitution, they should stand. Did the
                        Judge happen, then, to remember that the 13th and 14th amendments of the
                        Constitution sanction all that has been done by the Congress in
                        reconstruction or does he mean, when he goes to Congress to insist that
                        these amendments are null and not parts of the instruments as the nation has
                        believed? If he did remember, then he will accept the situation, and,
                        letting them stand, will accept the situation, and, letting them stand, will
                        either have to contest with the negro for intellectual supremacy some day,
                        or he means, with Frank Blair, to sweep away the whole concern, amendments
                        and all. Which will happen, when he sways the Congress to his will, it will
                        be perhaps a matter of interest to the voters to know, for in the latter,
                        then the war for which he hooted Mr. M'Cauley for predicting, will be a
                        thing to be apprehended, if the voters and soldiers of the North are not
                        grown suddenly tamer than we deem them.</p>

                    <p>Denying, in the face of fact and history, that the debt has been lessened
                        from $4,000,000,000 to $2,500,000,000 in three years, the bonds came for
                        their share of attention. This great question - gold or greenbacks - was
                        summarily treated by the Judge. He bluntly asserted that the bargain was and
                        is to pay the principal in paper. As a lawyer, the Judge should have brought
                        out the Acts of Congress and shown the facts. That he did not, when the
                        Statutes at Large were at his hand, is excellent evidence that they would
                        not serve his purpose. On the contrary, he chose the most unfair of all
                        arguments - that from an extreme and exceptional case. He excited envy by
                        instancing the good fortune of the man who had gold to sell, and patriotism
                        and pluck enough to lend it to the Government when gold was 2,90 - he said
                        3,00 - and triumphantly asked if he should profit by a payment in gold. We
                        dare to say not a man in his audience but would claim the gold if he had the
                        bonds, but we fear few would have bought in '62 or '63, even at 2,90, and to
                        help the Government in that "unholy war," which was proving to be only
                        "debt, slaughter and disgrace." The hole at which the Judge essayed to creep
                        out of the financial difficulties, proved at last, however, to be the same
                        which, all timid men first choose for themselves, in argument, and one which
                        even Republicans may employ when reasoning with timid men, namely: that the
                        country will soon get back to specie payment and then we can pay in gold as
                        easily as in paper. To get back, though, the Judge proscribed a trial of
                        Democratic ordering. The army and navy were to go to nothing - the
                        reconstruction governments to fall to pieces and then - said he, as
                        gleefully as the last man will feel when he, standing alone, surveys the
                        wreck of matter and the crush of worlds - out of the debris of the concern
                        we will pay up and fork over. But the nigger shan't vote! No sirs, elevate,
                        cultivate, dignify him as you may, so help me Bob I won't, as a member of
                        Congress, aid in such iniquity! What a pity the Judge has not been a
                        Congressman for six years past! The emancipation proclamation would have
                        been withheld and Sam would be hoeing cotton as peacefully as ever in
                        Arkansas, instead of going to barbeques at Democratic invitation or being
                        courted by Democrats in Mississippi for his vote!</p>

                    <p>Such must have been the current of the Judge's secret thoughts, for,
                        connectedly enough, he now spoke of Alabama, and predicted that the negroes
                        would "go back" on their Radical friends. This declaration gave the audience
                        much of comfort, for they yelled consumedly, an individual in the rear of
                        the room rivalling the vocal bird of Australia, the laughing-jackass, in his
                        stentorian shouts. The enthusiasm being thus at its height, the orator
                        gracefully closed with a reference to the tomb of Washington, which, as it
                        was slightly marred in its effect by some doubt the speaker seemed to have
                        on which side of the Potomac the said tomb is lying and being situate, only
                        the more fitly closed an address which was uncertain in its facts, misty in
                        its logic and wonderfully mixed in its rhetoric.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Stenger followed the Judge, in an animated attack on Mr. Cessna, in
                        which, as he set out to prove that Mr. C. had been a Democrat in '63, he
                        succeeded in establishing not only that fact which Mr. Cessna admitted the
                        night before, but showed conclusively by his own testimony and that of other
                        equally reliable Democrats, that he was, to use his own words, in 1862 "too
                        rotten a Democrat" to be supported by the party for office. Mr. Stenger did
                        not explain why Mr. Cessna had thus early lost caste in the party - but as
                        it had only been because he had from the outset been a warm War Democrat and
                        supported Mr. Lincoln in all his war measures, we are certainly obliged to
                        Mr. Stenger for thus strengthening our candidate in our estimation. We hope
                        he will repeat his testimony this campaign as often as he can find it
                        convenient.</p>

                    <p>The Republicans by this time were tired, and when Mr. Stenger ceased, they
                        began to leave - the Democrats, being witnesses, left also and thus this,
                        the first meeting of the Democrat club, adjourned.</p>
