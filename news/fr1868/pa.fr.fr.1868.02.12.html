<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper endorses the candidacy of Governor Curtin for the Vice-Presidency

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The recent spontaneous and positive expressions of the Republicans of a
                        number of counties in Pennsylvania, presenting the name of ANDREW G. CURTIN
                        as their choice for Vice President on the national ticket with Gen. Grant,
                        have no common significance, and indicate an ultimate unanimity of sentiment
                        that will carry the whole moral power of our great State to Chicago to urge
                        his nomination. It is most natural that such expressions should come from
                        the faithful citizens of the State, and coming as they do from the hearts of
                        the people rather than from systematic political effort, they indicate an
                        earnestness to which the coming State Convention will heartily respond.</p>
                    <p>The fitness of such a nomination we need not now discuss. It is recognized by
                        all classes of loyal men from convictions which have associated with them
                        the liveliest recollections of his eminent fidelity and patriotism, while
                        Chief Magistrate of our mighty Commonwealth during six years of the most
                        trying period of our history; and his noble deeds, his unstained record, and
                        his high measure of administrative success in every department, are pointed
                        to with pride by every lover of his country's cause. Especially with the
                        soldiers of the Republic, is his name a tower of strength. In every issue
                        affecting their interests he was their ablest and most potent champion. In
                        adversity his presence and eloquence in their camps inspired them to fresh
                        deeds of valor. In victory he told the story of their triumphs and pointed
                        to the beneficent fruits of man's noblest struggle for man. In sickness he
                        visited and comforted them, and his ministrations were felt in every section
                        of the country where sorrow shadowed the defenders of the Flag, and in the
                        sad bereavements for the martyred dead the silver lining to the cloud was
                        visible as he gathered the fallen heroes to sleep with their kindred. The
                        first great victor of the revolution of 1860, he was again the invincible
                        leader who restored our State to loyal supremacy in the dark days of 1863,
                        and when he had filled the constitutional measure of Executive duties, he
                        retired with the emphatic endorsement of the people, and left our great
                        Commonwealth mightier and nobler and more prosperous than ever before in our
                        history.</p>
                    <p>The presentation of GOV. CURTIN'S name for the Vice Presidency is no empty
                        compliment. His fame needs no such gilding--his proud record needs no such
                        commendation. His name is presented in obedience to the earnest desire of
                        earnest and faithful men who ask the prestige of his name on the ticket for
                        the great national struggle of 1868. Not only in his own State, but in every
                        State where loyalty is cherished, he is esteemed one of the first of the
                        representative men of the Republic, and we feel well assured that the appeal
                        of Pennsylvania for his nomination will be warmly responded to in other
                        sections of the Union. We believe that he can be nominated if Pennsylvania
                        will be true to herself, and when the People shall have spoken through their
                        convention, we cannot doubt that there will be such cordial and earnest
                        support of their expression as must command the enthusiastic endorsement of
                        the Republican National Convention.</p>

                    by over 20,000 votes, and appear likely to defeat leading Democratic
