<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>Patriotic men of Franklin county, and the 16th Judicial District: this is the last
                  time the Repository will reach you before the 13th of October, and this the last
                  appeal we can make you to stand firmly by the immortal principles of the
                  Republican party. To you and your State have both parties throughout the whole
                  country conceeded the proud but responsible duty of determining the future destiny
                  of our beloved country. The people of all the States stand and wait with intense
                  eagerness your verdict. During the last month both sides have been ceaselessly
                  active, marshaling their forces for the decisive battle. The lines were not more
                  clearly defined when during the war legions of brave "Boys in Blue" hurled
                  themselves against the columns of Gray until rebellion and treason were trampled
                  into dust, than now. The same issues are at stake; the same beloved country is in
                  deadly peril. The same sad result will follow on the heels of your defeat that
                  would have succeeded your overthrow then. The same grand future awaits your
                  triumph now which would have been consummated in its fulness then, but for the
                  foul murder of your venerated President, and the black apostacy and reason of his
                  unworthy successor.</p>

               <p>The time is past for argument. Day after day and week after week the true issues
                  have been clearly and forcibly set before you, and even the madness of our
                  country's enemies has driven them to conceal nothing of their dangerous and
                  disloyal intentions. No one can any longer be deceived except he who is wilfully
                  blind. Active, earnest, patriotic action alone is left to maintain our dearly
                  bought liberties, threatened by the blood red hand of treason. Let us arouse then,
                  gird on our armor, and strong in the right, inspired by our brilliant history,
                  mindful of the sacrifices we have already made for our country, the memory of our
                  departed heroes and the presence among us of their widows and orphans, and armed
                  with the resistless weapon of freemen, strike another blow at treason and win a
                  victory that shall be lasting and imperishable.</p>

               <p>Look on this, and then on this.</p>

               <p>If we are defeated on next Tuesday there is not a concealed or open traitor
                  throughout the North or South, who will not rejoice; there is not a booted and
                  spurred murderer raiding through the late rebel States destroying the property and
                  taking the lives of loyal men, both white and black, who will not find in it ample
                  justification for his lawless deeds; there is not a Memphis, or New Orleans, or
                  Fort Pillow, or Camilla, that will not repeat itself, aye surpass itself, in deeds
                  of murder and butchery of loyal men and women, and all under the broad warrant of
                  this election; there is not a willing participant in the cruelties of
                  Andersonville, Belle Isle or Libby, who murdered your brothers and sons by slow
                  torturing deaths, and sent others, gibbering maniac skeletons, back to your arms
                  to rend your souls with anguish and then die, who will not hold high carnival and
                  say, "at last the Democracy of the North have lent us their long promised aid and
                  support."</p>

               <p>On the other hand, if the friends of freedom carry the State by a triumphant
                  majority, treason will recoil from its unholy attempt to overthrow our free
                  institutions. This last effort of the traitors of the South, aided by the leaders
                  of the Democratic party in the North, to win by the ballot what they fairly lost
                  in the arbitrament of the sword, will be forever defeated. The legitimate results
                  of the war, peace, based upon the equal rights of all, justice to all, and freedom
                  for all, will then be secured for all time, high above the vain and idle efforts
                  of traitors and demagogues to endanger them. Labor, the only real wealth of a
                  country, will be honored; intelligence, and prosperity, and happiness will spread
                  their wings over the whole land, and blessed peace, born out of the much suffering
                  of war, and devastation, and poverty, and the evil passions of men, will take her
                  final abode among us and teach us that "her ways are ways of pleasantness and all
                  her paths are peace."</p>

               <p>These are some of the things that will follow a Republican victory on next
                  Tuesday, because that will insure the triumphant
                  election of our standard bearer, Gen. Grant, the man who more than all others, has
                  learned, through the fearful ravages of necessary war, the unspeakable blessings
                  of peace. When honorable and lasting peace lay beyond a gigantic and unholy
                  rebellion, he alone of all our leaders was strong enough to break down the
                  bulwarks and reach it. Who of all men so capable, so fitting to secure its
                  blessings to his fellow men as he? In whose keeping is it so safely instructed as
                  in his? Surely not in that of Horatio Seymour and Frank Blair, the one an original
                  and recorded enemy of his country, the other a mad revolutionist, and both pledged
                  by the highest court of the Democratic party to accomplish for the traitors of the
                  South what they could not do themselves, the overthrow of our liberties.</p>

               <p>If General Hartranft and General Campbell are defeated greetings will flash over
                  the wires from the Democracy of Pennsylvania to the high priest of treason in the
                  White House, that the Keystone State has placed her seal of approbation upon the
                  blood-stained policy of his administration, and traitors from Virginia to Texas
                  will rejoice with illuminations and bonfires that they can perfect in peace and
                  under warrant of the administration the work of National destruction and death.</p>

               <p>This is no idle talk. We warn you in view of the awful consequences of defeat, and
                  before it is too late not to be deceived.</p>

               <p>Loyal men of Pennsylvania: This is the last great struggle of treason, and your
                  State is the rock upon which it must be broken to pieces. Your vote on next
                  Tuesday will place the capstone upon the temple of Reconstruction and fix forever
                  the generous and beneficent policy of Congress. If treason falls now it falls
                  forever. The representatives of the Southern States will take their places in our
                  National Council purged of their crimes, and manifesting the fruits of their
                  repentance. The rights of all human beings will be sacredly protected wherever the
                  starry folds of our National banner float, and they will float on every acre of
                  the National domain. Our gallant "Boys in Blue," who have cast their fortunes
                  among those who would have dragged it in the dust, will no longer be scoffed and
                  jeered and driven from their homes and murdered, but will be honored and esteemed
                  and respected and protected, as the pioneers of a higher and purer civilization.
                  It cannot be possible that, hereafter, an American citizen can go anywhere, and so
                  long as he obeys the laws of the land and does not interfere with the rights of
                  others, not be completely protected in life, liberty and property.</p>

               <p>Rally then for the conflict. Though desperate it cannot be doubtful. Inspired by
                  the sacred rights of the living heroes and the honor of those who died for their
                  country, strike in your might to secure the one, and perpetuate the memory of the
                  other forever.</p>

               <p>Let your watchword be Freedom for all, Justice to all and Victory.</p>

<b>Equal Taxation. Men of Pennsylvania, Read and Ponder</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This attack against the Democratic tax policy details why the Repository sees
               equal taxation of property across the board as an evil. It describes past and current
               tax policies of the state and nation in its analysis.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>The fourth section of the Democratic platform, made at New York by Wade Hampton
                  and other traitors, demands -</p>

               <p>"Equal taxation of every species of property, according to its real value,
                  including government bonds and other public securities."</p>

               <p>These are the very words of the fourth resolution in that platform. Have the
                  farmers of Franklin county ever considered the meaning of this declaration, which
                  the Democratic party is bound to enforce if they get into power? Let us see. "Equal taxation of every species of property, according to its
                     real value."</p>

               <p>Property is chiefly of two kinds, real property and personal property. Recollect
                  that the taxation meant here is taxation by the United States, not be the State of
                  Pennsylvania, or by the county of Franklin. Real property is that which is fixed
                  and permanent, as lands, houses, factories, &amp;c. Personal property is that
                  which is temporary and movable, and includes all kinds of property not of a
                  permanent nature. Now, first of all, the farmers of Franklin county will be taxed
                  on their Farms, "according to their real value." If
                  your farm is worth ten thousand dollars, then, my friend, your Democratic party
                  has pledged itself to tax it upon that amount. If your mill is worth that sum, you
                  will pay a tax on so much to the party which boasts itself to be the only true
                  friend of the people. This tax on real property is a novelty. The United States,
                  in its worst extremity during the war, never dreamed of taxing real estate. But
                  this was under Republican power, and then the few Democrats in Congress tried to
                  prevent any tax at all when the Democratic rebellion made it necessary to expend
                  two millions daily. But this was consistent. It was a Democratic rebellion and
                  they didn't want to have it put down.</p>

               <p>The State of Pennsylvania, under Democratic rule used to tax your farms and mills,
                  &amp;c., but the State debt kept growing larger all the time. When the
                  Republicans got into power the tax on real estate was taken off, and that on
                  personal property was reduced, and the State debt has been paid off at the rate of
                  a million a year ever since.</p>

               <p>In the next place, farmers and every person else, no matter how poor, if they have
                  any property at all, must pay a tax to the United States upon it. During the war
                  personal property of every person was taxed except that of poor people, but when
                  the war closed a Republican Congress removed the tax from everything except a few
                  luxuries. Almost the only things taxed now by the United States are tobacco and
                  whisky. The poor now are not taxed at all. No one, whose yearly income is not
                  above a thousand dollars and his necessary expenses, pays any tax at all. But the
                  Democratic party has pledged itself in advance to change all this, and tax the
                  rich and poor man alike. The farmer's horses and cows, his wagons and farming
                  implements, his wheat, and corn, and oats, and potatoes, must all be taxed, unless
                  the Democrats lie and they tell you that they never do. The poor man's cow and
                  pig, his patch of potatoes and cabbage, the main support of his family, must be
                  taxed according to its real value, because that is the avowed policy of the
                  Democratic party. And what is more, there is no Democrat who has any regard for
                  truth dare deny these allegations.</p>

               <p>Now taxes are necessary. No one can deny that. A Democratic rebellion entailed
                  upon us an immense National debt, and it must be paid. It is part of the price we
                  owe for the preservation of our liberties and the maintenance of our Union in its
                  integrity. One-fourth of that debt has already been paid, and every year the
                  Republican party in spite of a traitor President and a Democratic administration,
                  is reducing it and making the taxation less burdensome. It is true the Democratic
                  party ought to pay this debt, it is theirs, they made it. But they never intend to
                  pay it. Put them into power and they will destroy the national credit by an
                  overwhelming issue of "greenbacks." The Republicans have been building up the
                  national credit, and every defeat they give the Democracy makes it better. Thus
                  you see that the people of Europe, who hold millions of our bonds, as well as the
                  people of the United States, look to the Republican party as the real saviors and
                  preservers of the country.</p>

               <p>We call upon all classes of our people, rich and poor, farmers and tradesmen,
                  Dunkers, Mennonites, and River Brethren, to weigh these plain facts calmly and
                  carefully, and come to the rescue, not of their imperiled country as something
                  independent of themselves, but of their own property, of their homes and their
                  families. If the national credit is destroyed your bonds and your greenbacks and
                  your farms and your business will all be worthless, for all depend for their
                  prosperity upon the credit and stability of the country.</p>

               <p>Can you weigh these truths and vote the Democratic ticket?</p>

                  and has to our personal knowledge made such arrangements as will enable him to
                  fulfill his engagements.</p>

               <p>We congratulate the loyal people of Franklin county on their success in securing

               <p>W. S. Stenger, the Democratic candidate for District Attorney in Franklin county,
                  became inspired on the occasion of the Democratic Mass meeting last week and, it
                  is said, made the following taunting prediction. Looking over the crowd of men and

                  community in the country. Take care William, and curb your eloquence with a strong
                  bit and a steady hand, or it will carry you to political death. The Dunkers and
                  men of similar persuasion should of all others least provoke such cowardly and
                  unmannerly remarks. They have ever been loyal to the Government and give a willing
                  and material support during the war, which you were very far from doing. They are
                  both ready and willing to support it at the ballot-box on next Tuesday, by voting
                  the Republican ticket, where they will not forget to give you a quietus for your
                  ungenerous and unprovoked slander.</p>

               <p>During the Rebellion, Col. William D. Dixon, and Calvin M. Duncan, Esq., rival
                  candidates for the State Senate, fought upon opposite sides. The Col's. enemies
                  were clothed in gray; and murdered, and poisoned, and starved "the boys in blue;"
                  Mr. Duncan's foes were those who "rallied around the flag," whether borne in the
                  smoke of battle, or among those at home whose hearts yearned for the brave men at
                  the post of danger and glory. Mr. Duncan had no stomach for soldiering, and no
                  pride in the soldier's cause. His voice was not for the war. He opposed it
                  manfully. He opposed all who favored it. Vallandigham was his type of a statesman
                  then, Seymour and Forrest are now.</p>

               <p>Franklin county is becoming thoroughly aroused, The political excitement that has
                  prevailed in Vermont and Maine is now being shared by us, and promises us as grand
                  a victory as it did our friends in the East. We had meetings every night during
                  the past week and they were well attended.</p>

               <p>Col M'Gowon, J. M. M'Clure, W. U. Brewer, and Geo. Zeigler, Esq, addressed the
                  meeting at Shady Grove, on Tuesday evening, the 19th ult.</p>

               <p>Lyman S. Clarke, Esq., and Mr. Jno. M'Dowell addressed a meeting at Greenwood, on
                  the 31st ult. The same evening P. Hamman, Esq., and Volney Rogers addressed a
                  meeting at Monterey.</p>

               <p>Messrs. M'Elwaine, Eyster and Bonebrake spoke in Fannettsburg, on the evening of
                  Oct. 1st. On the same evening, Messrs. M'Dowell, Chambers and M'Clure addressed a
                  meeting in Hege's School House.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Bonebrake and M'Gowan spoke at Dry Run, on Friday afternoon, and the same
                  evening at Eckenrode's Store, in Amberson's Valley.</p>

               <p>Messrs. M'Clure and Henninger spoke in Scotland on Friday evening.</p>

               <p>The meeting at New Franklin, on Saturday evening, was addressed by Messrs.
                  Henninger and M'Cauley. The school houses were filled to overflowing, and at all
                  times the best of order prevailed. Men came to listen and the closest attention
                  has been paid to our speeches.</p>

               <p>The meeting at Greencastle on Saturday evening last was a grand success. Never
                  before has there seen such a crowd in attendance at a political meeting in that
                  town. Men came from all quarters. Delegations were present from Washington,
                  Montgomery and Quincy townships. There were over five hundred men in the
                  torchlight procession. The Greencastle and Waynesboro bands were in attendance and
                  enlivened the occasion with harmonic airs. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed.
                  Speeches were made by Geo. Chambers, Esq., Col. Black and Capt. Eyster. Antrim is
                  alive, and will give twenty five majority for the County, District and State
                  tickets - Mr. Wm. M'Lellan's figures to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Thad M. Mahon, J. M. M'Clure and A. M'Elwaine addressed a meeting in
                  Sharpe's school house on the 28th ult.</p>

               <p>On Monday evening, the 5th instant, large and enthusiastic meetings were held at
                  Funkstown, Loudon and Green Village. Judge Charles Lee Armour, Col. Geo. B.
                  Weistling and our old friend P. Hamman, Esq., made telling and effective speeches
                  to the largest and most quiet and attentive meeting ever held at Funkstown,
                  composed of the voters of Quincy township, Waynesboro and Fayettesville. By her
                  good order and sobriety Funkstown has redeemed herself from the imputation of
                  rowdyism which so long attached to her in spite of her many good citizens, and on
                  next Tuesday, she will do much to rescue Quincy township from the real odium of
                  Democracy which has disgraced her for years.</p>

               <p>The meeting at Loudon was largely attended by Democrats, always a good sign, and
                  was addressed by Major Calhoun, Capt. Norris, Capt. Eyster and Lieut. S. W. Hays.
                  Loudon is awake to her duty, and the telling, candid and eloquent speeches of
                  Major Calhoun and the others staggered the confidence of their Democratic hearers
                  in the integrity of their cause. The Democratic gain claimed in Loudon will have
                  the mark of a minus quantity before it.</p>

               <p>Greenvillage, which seldom fails to cover herself with glory, swarmed on Monday
                  night, and turned out the largest crowd ever held in that quaint and ancient
                  village.</p>

               <p>"Boys in Blue" paraded, with lamps, to the number of one hundred and twenty-five.
                  The original Buckeye Blacksmith, the fame of whose eloquence comes to us from the
                  days of our fathers, was among them, and spoke over an hour with all the
                  eloquence, fervor and enthusiasm of his youth. He has lost none of his power, and
                  his energy is unabated. He was followed by Stewart, Chambers and Stumbaugh in
                  telling speeches. The Chambersburg Silver Coronet Band was in attendance and
                  pleased everybody as usual. Democrats will one hundred and ten satisfy you from
                  Green?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
               <p>The Democratic-Conservative-Copperhead-Rebel Mass Meeting, on the 30th ult.,
                  brought quite a number of people to town. Some came to parade, some to look on and
                  a few to listen to the speeches which might be delivered. The reception of the
                  delegations that came from Greencastle and Hagerstown was a fizzle, as but few
                  marched to the train. The cars were pretty well filled. An enthusiastic "Cop." was
                  so elated that he sent an extra train for stragglers to Greencastle, and brought
                  back twenty-three men and one woman. A goodly number of rebels were present from
                  Hagerstown.</p>

               <p>The procession was well strung out through our streets, and contained about seven
                  hundred persons, at the head of which was placed the Hagerstown rebels, carrying a
                  banner representing the white man under the foot of the negro. If this is the case
                  in Maryland few have heard of it. The loyal men of that State are groaning under a
                  burden of taxation and debt imposed upon them by a rebel from Lee's army. It was
                  an insult to the loyal people of Franklin county, to bring such men into a town
                  that was burned by rebels, to cheer for Jeff. Davis, Bob Lee and the Southern
                  Confederacy. Another grand feature was a wagon representing the Freedman's Bureau.
                  Two black niggers and four white ones had a jolly time of it. The niggers seemed
                  to enjoy it and no doubt they did. They were more than equal to their white
                  associates, and it would not take long to prove their superiority to the white man
                  who conceived the idea. The "white trash" who was sawing wood was a very low down
                  individual, and did not add much to the appearance of the team. The Ku Klux Klan -
                  that great Democratic institution of our deluded Southern brethren - was there
                  too, and intimately connected with the Freedman's Bureau - its appropriate place;
                  for its members live off the bounty of a beneficent government by day, and at
                  night in disguises murder Union men.</p>

               <p>Mayor Hooffman, of New York City, arrived in the 11 A. M. train. A few of the
                  faithful met him at the depot. He spoke at the Fair Grounds in the afternoon. His
                  speech was full of misrepresenting of facts and figures. He played the part of the
                  demagogue. In regard to the manner of paying the national debt, he said he had his
                  own opinion but did not think there was any necessity for him to express it. He
                  spoke nearly two hours and every body was glad when he had finished. Mr. Stenger
                  followed him in a few brief remarks. Among other things he prophesied that the
                  Democracy would carry Franklin county even if they could not
                     get the Dunker vote. As a good many of these men have bonds and don't
                  desire repudiation nor another war, we do not suppose there is much hope of them
                  voting with the supporters of Mr. Seymour. There was no demonstration in the
                  evening.</p>
