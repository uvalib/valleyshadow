                <head>A Second Review of the Grand Army</head>
                <origin/>

                <transcript>
                    <p>I read last night of the Grand Review<lb/> In Washington's chiefest
                        avenue--<lb/> Two hundred thousand men in blue<lb/> I think they said was
                        the number--<lb/> Till I seemed to hear their trampling feet,<lb/> The
                        bugle's blast and the drum's quick beat,<lb/> The clatter of hoofs in the
                        stony street,<lb/> The cheers of people who came to greet,<lb/> And the
                        thousand details that to repeat<lb/> Would only my verse encumber--<lb/>
                        Till I fell in a reverie, sad and sweet,<lb/> And then to a fitful
                        slumber.<lb/> When, lo! in a vision I seemed to stand<lb/> In the lonely
                        Capitol. On each hand<lb/> Far-stretched to portico, dim and grand<lb/> Its
                        columns ranged like a martial band<lb/> Of sheeted spectres, whom some
                        command<lb/> Had called to a last reviewing;<lb/> And the streets of the
                        city were white and bare,<lb/> No footfall echoed across the square,<lb/>
                        But out of the misty midnight air<lb/> I heard in the distant a trumpet
                        blare,<lb/> And the wandering night-winds seemed to bear<lb/> The sound of a
                        far tattooing.</p>

                    <p>Then I held my breath with fear and dread,<lb/> For onto the square, with a
                        brazen tread,<lb/> There rode a figure whose stately head<lb/> O'erlooked
                        the review that morning,<lb/> That never bowed from its firm-set seat<lb/>
                        When the <sic>hving</sic> column passed its feet,<lb/> Yet now rode steadily
                        up the street<lb/> To the phantom bugle's warning;<lb/> Till it reached to
                        the capitol square, and wheeled,<lb/> And there in the moonlight stood
                        revealed<lb/> A well known form that in state and field<lb/> Had led our
                        patriot sires;<lb/> Whose face was turned to the sleeping camp,<lb/> Afar
                        through the river's fog and damp<lb/> That showed no flicker, nor waning
                        lamp,<lb/> Nor wasted bivouac fires.</p>

                    <p>And I saw a phantom army come,<lb/> With never a sound of fife or drum,<lb/>
                        But keeping time to a throbbing hum<lb/> Of wailing and lamentation;<lb/>
                        The martyred heroes of Malvern Hill,<lb/> Of Gettysburg and
                        Chancellorsville,<lb/> The men whose wasted figures fill<lb/> The patriot
                        graves of the nation.</p>

                    <p>And there came the nameless dead--the men<lb/> Who perished in fever swamp
                        and fen,<lb/> The slowly starved of the prison-pen;<lb/> And marching beside
                        the others,<lb/> Came the dusky martyrs of Pillow's fight,<lb/> With limbs
                        enfranchised and bearing bright;<lb/> I thought--perhaps 'twas the pale
                        moonlight--<lb/> They looked as white as their brothers!</p>

                    <p>And so all night marched the Nation's dead<lb/> With never a banner above
                        them spread,<lb/> Nor a badge, nor a motto brandished;<lb/> No mark--save
                        the bare uncovered head<lb/> Of the silent bronze Reviewer--<lb/> With never
                        an arch save the vaulted sky,<lb/> With never a flower save those that
                        lie<lb/> On the distant graves--for love could buy<lb/> No gift that was
                        purer or truer.</p>

                    <p>So all night long swept the strange array,<lb/> So all night long till the
                        morning gray<lb/> I watched for one who had passed away,<lb/> With a
                        reverent awe and wonder--<lb/> Till a blue cap waved in the lenth'ning
                        line,<lb/> And I knew that one who was kin of mine<lb/> Had come, and I
                        spoke--and lo! that sign<lb/> Awakened me from my slumber.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic party in National Convention assembled, solemnly admit and
                        declare slavery and secession to be dead. Slavery dead! Secession dead! And
                        this by the Democratic party, too, at the very moment when no one knew the
                        instant when Salmon P. Chase, the original abolitionist and foremost
                        champion of manhood suffrage, would be sprung upon the convention and
                        nominated amidst a whirlwind of applause, which greeted his name whenever
                        mentioned there. Liable to be nominated on a platform which utters not a
                        whisper against colored suffrage, which simply remits the question of
                        suffrage to the States, accompanied with a broad deliverance in favor of
                        "Equal rights for all native born and naturalized citizens."</p>
                    <p>Equal rights for all! why that might have been seen flying at the head of
                        Greeley's New York <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> any time within the
                        last two or three years, as the expression of the quintessence of
                        Republicanism. Here is matter for astonishment. What are we, and whither are
                        we fending? Do we not know that not a year ago the whole staple in trade of
                        the Democratic orators here was the niggers' hell, lips, nose and monkey
                        origin? Do we not remember how they rattled these poisoned arrows,--Pshaw,
                        threw these dirty bats against the broad shield of the Republican party? Did
                        not Col. Brewer carry to New York in his pocket a resolution, carefully
                        prepared by the Big Ingens at Chambersburg, declaring it "a time-honored
                        principle of the Democratic <emph rend="italic">p-a-r-t-y</emph>," that the
                        negro is descended immediately from the Chimpanzee, and remotely from the
                        baboon? And now, lo! Equal Rights for all native born citizens, following:
                        Slavery is dead; secession is dead.</p>
                    <p>And as a tender to the Democratic machine, they had a soldiers' convention
                        there, of the boys in blue really, as well as of the boys in gray. They
                        didn't have either at Chicago four years ago, for they were then denouncing
                        the war a failure, and the boys in blue "Lincoln's hirelings," and the boys
                        in gray--Wade Hampton, Forrest and the rest--had a little engagement with
                        one Grant, which prevented their attendance.</p>
                    <p>And they have inserted in their platform their great doctrine of "Greenbacks
                        for all purposes forever." And this is but the "Forward March" to the grand
                        consummation of Repudiation, the objective point of all their
                        movements.--Years ago the Democracy were a hard money party and christened
                        one of their favorite leaders, who afterwards left them in disgust, old
                        Bullion; and although Jeff Davis did repudiate the Mississippi bonds in
                        times past, the party as such were not until lately avowed repudiators. But
                        the onward movement is rapid. They are fast hastening the day of the
                        destruction of the currency, when the prediction of one of the most
                        prominent of the delegates to the convention will be realized, and a cord of
                        greenbacks be insufficient to buy a cord of wood.</p>
                    <p>So the world moves and thus the Democracy advance. It is not to be supposed
                        of course that the body of the party rejoice over Slavery dead and Secession
                        defunct, <sic>norwere</sic> the strong manifestations in favor of Chase the
                        product of a genuine sentiment of a majority of the party. The great bulk of
                        the Democracy is still afflicted with negrophobia; but it all shows that the
                        leaders who have the manipulating of conventions dimly discern the march of
                        history and the progress of ideas.</p>
                    <p>On the questions of slavery and secession they seem like a party awaking from
                        sleep to a realization of accomplished facts, and devoutly utter God bless
                        me! Slavery and Secession are dead! Not that they would have it so, but that
                        to their amazement they find it is so. And as to Greenbacks, the issue of
                        which they violently opposed when essential to the life of the nation, we
                        have given them such a jerk forward as to addle their brains. Now they would
                        have nothing else, and so much of that as to repeat the mistake of the
                        people of the so called confederacy, who, according to Seymour, the Belmont
                        bondholder's candidate of the Democracy, at first went to market with their
                        money in their vest pockets and brought home their provisions in a basket
                        and afterwards went to market with their money in a basket and brought home
                        their provisions in their vest pockets.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy advance: slowly, to be sure, but still they advance, following
                        the Republicans like Peter his Master, afar off. In 1860, when they were the
                        champions of Slavery, and advocated <sic>trafic</sic> in the bodies and
                        souls of men, they were advanced to about the period of the invention of
                        gunpowder, and were soon made acquainted with its use as a great civilizer.
                        Now they may be considered to have reached the invention of printing, and a
                        general enlightenment succeeding we may hope the dawn of the great
                        reformation of the party approaches. But the Republican party, living and
                        working in the <sic>nineteeth</sic> century, profiting by its light, its
                        steam and its electricity, its grand discoveries and its subtile inventions,
                        its demonstrations of new political truths, and its realization of better
                        governmental forms, learning its higher philosophy and accepting its better
                        morality, as she presses forward to the goal of absolute justice, equal
                        freedom, immaculate honesty and peerless glory, can only beckon forward the
                        tardy Democracy, while she follows close after Grant and Colfax, who bear
                        high-advanced the standard of Human Progress.</p>

                    secession while still denouncing blacks and greenbacks. In contrast, the

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Democratic Convention has settled several things which have been the
                        subject of considerable speculation for some time, but that they were
                        settled to the satisfaction of the parties most deeply interested, we do not
                        believe. We have heard of things being "hog cheap," and of others as being a
                        "drug in the market," and have an idea that the terms express the largest
                        supply and the smallest demand possible; but that they more than very
                        faintly typify the price sought by Johnson and Chase for their apostacy, and
                        that paid them by the Democratic Convention, we do not believe. It may be
                        that the former estimated their services to the Democracy too high, and the
                        latter too low; but be this as it may, new terms must be fabricated before
                        the infinite distance between the two can be represented on paper.</p>
                    <p>Johnson was the most pronounced radical in the country during the rebellion,
                        and displayed remarkable facility in calling rebels hard names. He used to
                        call the negroes of Nashville about him and tell them how that their former
                        masters had forfeited their property by rebelling against the Government,
                        and that they (the negroes) were morally entitled to their lands and houses
                        and should yet occupy them. Assuming an attitude intended to the majestic,
                        but which was only a happy combination of a drunken tailor and a conceited
                        demagogue, he assured them that they must have a Moses to lead them out of
                        Bondage into the Promised Land, and that if no other Moses was raised up, he
                        would be their Moses.</p>
                    <p>In this way he deceived the loyal people into electing him to the second
                        place in their gift. The assassin's bullet removed the only bulwark between
                        the safety of the Government and the treasonable designs of a cowardly
                        demagogue, and Johnson occupied the lofty place once honored by Washington
                        and Jefferson, and Jackson and Lincoln. He was no sooner President than he
                        arrayed himself against Congress, put himself in active sympathy with the
                        unrepentant traitors of the South, removed all loyal office holders, and
                        arrayed the entire power and patronage of the Government against its loyal
                        people and against the peaceful restoration of the seceded States to the
                        Union. He encouraged resistance to the reconstruction laws of Congress at a
                        time when the people of the South were willing and anxious to accept the
                        just and salutary measures proposed to them, and incited riot and murder
                        among them.--He unlawfully organized unconstitutional and revolutionary
                        governments among them and attempted to introduce into Congress from these
                        bastard States men whose hands were still red with the blood of loyal
                        citizens; and all this he did for the Democratic party. But for him the
                        shattered elements of the Democratic party would still be drifting without
                        chart or rudder and without a head as it was left immediately after its last
                        defeat.--Whatever power and strength it may have now is simply the old
                        treason to the Government both North and South, unified and systematized by
                        Johnson's efforts.</p>
                    <p>Chase, whose boast is that his life has been given to the emancipation of the
                        colored race, while equally willing and far more able, lacked the
                        opportunities given to Johnson to betray the loyal people. He had chance
                        enough and time enough however to destroy the splendid name he had won to
                        crawl on his belly and eat dirt; to demolish like a vandal the fair temple
                        of Liberty he had reared, and standing amid its ruins, still clad in the
                        robe of Justice, beg pitiously for the Presidency till his countrymen cover
                        their faces with shame.</p>
                    <p>These men have received their reward. The Democratic party has settled with
                        them in full. The debt they owed them is cancelled. Johnson received the
                        votes of Tennessee, and the <emph rend="italic">thanks</emph> of the
                        Convention, and Chase didn't receive any thanks nor any votes either, except
                        half of one from the Pacific Coast. Let disappointed or dazzled demagogues
                        in the future reflect upon the fate of these two men before they sell their
                        manhood. The price it brings does not come up to the standard of living
                        rates. Poor Chase. Poor Johnson.</p>

                    <p>An adjourned meeting of the citizens of Chambersburg and its vicinity, was
                        held in the Court House, on the evening of the 8th inst., to receive the
                        report of the committee appointed to solicit subscriptions to aid in
                        constructing a railroad from Waynesboro, through Quincy, Funkstown and
                        Fayetteville, to this place.</p>
                    <p>The committee on that occasion, reported that they had succeeded in securing
                        about $25,000--and that they had no doubt that sum would soon be increased
                        to $40,000. The history of this enterprise and the benefits to be derived
                        from its successful prosecution have been pretty fully discussed in the
                        REPOSITORY during the past four or five months, and need not be repeated
                        now. It seems proper to state however that owing to the unaccountable
                        indifference of the people of Chambersburg, to the importance of the
                        railroad movement they have greatly jeoparded the chances of bringing it to
                        this place as its northern terminus, and to that degree forfeited a splendid
                        opportunity to add to the lasting and material prosperity of their town.</p>
                    <p>If the same interest had been manifested at the inception of the railroad
                        project that is felt now, there would be no question as to its terminus. But
                        the people along the line of the projected road were in earnest while we
                        slept; and while they have secured the means of constructing it to Scotland,
                        they have also acquired from our apathy a disregard for the real interest of
                        Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>A committee of three of our citizens has been appointed to advise with the
                        other committees and inform them of what we have done, and what we are still
                        able to do, and if possible secure this point as the terminus; and we know
                        that those to whom this is trusted will allow no trifle to prevent their
                        success.</p>
                    <p>We are informed by the committee that their efforts to obtain subscriptions
                        received the greatest encouragement. Mechanics and laboring men, and small
                        property holders to a man, are anxious to assist in securing the road, and
                        even women in some instances contributed handsomely. It is an indication of
                        the earnestness that is now felt, and we should not allow the opportunity to
                        escape. This railroad once completed, it but begins an era of progress and
                        prosperity for Chambersburg and for Franklin County whose importance we very
                        much fail to appreciate.</p>

                    <p>GEN. FRANK P. BLAIR is the Democratic nominee for the Vice Presidency. A few
                        days before the convention met, he wrote a letter defining his position, and
                        it is safe to say that this letter secured his nomination.</p>
                    <p>The gist of his policy is contained in the following extract, which tells
                        clearly what he would have done and how he would do it:</p>

                    <p>There is but one way to restore the Government and the Constitution, and that
                        it is for the President elect to declare these acts null and void, compel
                        the army to undo its usurpations at the South, disperse the carpet-bag State
                        governments, allow the white people to reorganize their own governments and
                        elect Senators and Representatives. The House of Representatives will
                        contain a majority of Democrats from the North, and they will admit the
                        Representatives elected by the white people of the South, and with the
                        co-operation of the President it will not be difficult to compel the Senate
                        to submit once more to <sic>tht</sic> obligations of the Constitution. It
                        will not be able to withstand the public judgment, if distinctly invoked and
                        clearly expressed on this fundamental issue, and it is the sure way to avoid
                        all future strife to put this issue plainly to the country.</p>

                    <p>Frank P. Blair was a member of Congress during two years of the war, and
                        commander of the 17th Army Corps under Gen. Sherman. In the first position
                        he participated in the legislation of the Government to suppress the
                        Rebellion; in the second he fought the rebel armies and thus enforced the
                        laws of Congress. He cannot now claim that he was ignorant of what Congress
                        was doing when he was a member, or that he was compelled to fight against
                        the South during the war, for he is an intelligent man. Yet he repudiates
                        both the one and the other, insults the Government and the army and declares
                        in favor of another rebellion. He ignores the war and its consequences and
                        sees nothing constitutional except copperheadism. He expresses himself in
                        favor of disfranchising the southern blacks and virtually in favor of
                        re-enslaving them. He urges the admission of Representatives of the Southern
                        States elected by the white people of the South alone. In a word, he would
                        undo all that has been done since the close of the war and turn back the
                        government into chaos.</p>
                    <p>This is the Democratic Platform and the party cannot deny it. In the full
                        force of this letter when it was fresh upon them, the Convention nominated
                        Blair, and but for this they would not have chosen him. You men who want to
                        renew the horrors of the war, vote for Seymour and Blair. They will not
                            <sic>disappaint</sic> you. You have them fully on the record. But if you
                        want Peace and Prosperity, and a strong government, vote for the soldier and
                        the statesman, Grant and Colfax.</p>

                    <p>The Democrats, by the nomination of Seymour for President, have driven all
                        Union-loving citizens who might have been friends of Chase or Hancock, to
                        the standard of Gen. Grant. Conservative Republicans cannot forget the
                        course pursued by the Governor of New York during the war, and they must
                        know that he has only been honored on account of his record as a Copperhead.
                        In sympathy with treason from its very inception, an enemy to all measures
                        that had in view the suppression of the rebellion, a foe to emancipation,

                        the New York mob in 1863, who were burning orphans' homes, murdering
                        innocent negroes, threatening to destroy the printing establishments of
                        papers that advocated the prosecution of the war, while our gallant patriots
                        were winning immortality at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, under Grant and Meade,
                        it is but proper he should receive this empty homage from his admiring
                        friends. Forrest, the murderer of helpless prisoners at Fort Pillow; Wade
                        Hampton, who received the surrender of Chambersburg during Stuart's
                        invasion, invited by Copperheads in 1862, and other gallows deserving
                        traitors, will return to their friends with the news that the Northern
                        doughfaces are as pliant in the hands of their Southern masters as of old,
                        and will arouse the enthusiasm of Lee and Johnson's disbanded forces, by the

                <summary>A large fire in Chambersburg consumed the stables belonging to Henry
                    Shepler and John Stewart. Luckily, there was no wind, so the fire did not
                    spread. The editors use the incident to urge the town to purchase new
                    firefighting equipment.</summary>

                    Blair ratification meeting in the Court House on Saturday. The paper reports
                    that a number of Democrats and Republicans attended. "It was taken for granted
                    by the gentlemen who spoke that Gen. Grant, who commanded the greatest armies of
                    modern times, is a man of no intellect, talent, or administrative ability, while
                    Horatio Seymour, who never held an office outside the state of New York, was the
                    first statesman of the age. Seymour's election was predicted, and a great many
                    other foolish things said."</summary>
