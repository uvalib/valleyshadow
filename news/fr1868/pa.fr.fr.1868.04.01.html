<b>The Policy of Unity</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper urges unity among Pennsylvania's Republicans during the upcoming
                    campaign. Even if Gov. Curtin is denied a vice-presidential nomination by rival
                    factions within the state, all party members should support the ticket.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper introduces John Stewart, candidate for presidential elector from
                    the district including Franklin. He "was a gallant officer of the 126th Pa.
                    regiment, has been twice Chairman of the Republican County Committee, was
                    elected by the conference of this end of the district, four years ago, a
                    delegate to the Republican National Convention, was selected as candidate for
                    elector by the Republican State Convention, and is one of the ablest campaigners

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper claims that results show that turnout for the spring elections
                    was very small. That explains why Republicans were able to elect a judge in
                    Quincy and Democrats succeeded in Mercersburg. In Chambersburg, the Republican
                    majority stood at 20, where 200 was not uncommon. In Guilford, the Democrats
                    prevailed by only four.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The legislature passed a bill stating that claims for losses for border
                    county residents during the war can be filed at Harrisburg. The paper applauds
                    this as a step in the right direction.<br>
