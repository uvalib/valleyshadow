<b>The Election</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This analysis of the recent elections blames the two local Democratic
					victories on voter fraud. Further, it names a perpetrator - George Weistling,
					himself a candidate for Congress. After losing his bid through showing bad
					character, the paper claims that he worked to cheat the Democrats into office.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The election in Franklin county resulted in the triumph of the State ticket
						by a majority of 43, making a Republican gain over that of last year of 232.
						We give in another column the official vote for Congress, Additional Law
						Judge, State Senator, Assembly and county ticket.</p>

					<p>The whole county ticket is elected by an average majority greater than that
						of the State ticket, except Mr. Bowman and Mr. Hays. Judge Kimmell has a
						majority in the county of 221 over Cessna, putting him 254 votes ahead of
						the state ticket. Stenger beats Hays 190 making his gain over his ticket
						230. These remarkable changes, as will be seen by the official vote of the
						county, are effected chiefly in Chambersburg and Quincy township, though
						Cessna and Hays loose slightly in Waynesboro and Greenvillage. If these two
						gentlemen ran behind their ticket generally throughout the county it would
						be needless to ask why, for the most natural cause would be that they were
						less popular than the rest of our candidates. Because they do not, though we
						are lothe to speak of it, the loyal Republicans have a right to know why
						they were slaughtered in favor of two men whose bitterness toward the
						principles of the Republican party and whose efforts in behalf of the
						success of the Copperhead ticket have been more marked than those of any
						other Copperheads in the county.</p>

					<p>We believe, on very reliable authority received from Quincy township, that
						more than half, the Republican votes cast in that district, against Cessna
						and Hays, and in favor of Kimmell and Stenger, were fraudulently obtained by
						the treachery of George B. Weistling, a local politician residing at Mont
						Alto Iron Works, whither he emigrated a few years ago from Dauphin county,
						and who aspired to be the Republican candidate for Congress in this
						District. The nominating convention of Franklin county, however, instructed
						the Congressional conferees to support Mr. Cessna by a vote of 57 against 24
						for Mr. Weistling, which instruction Mr. Weistling indorsed in a
						speech, wherein he pledged himself to support the whole ticket, and declared
						the principles of the Republican party to be the principles of the Christian
						religion, of civilization and of Free Schools, and called God to witness as
						to the honesty of his declarations. During the campaign Mr. W. made several
						political speeches and wrote several letters, one of which we had the
						satisfaction of hearing read, which breathed the same spirit as the speech
						above mentioned.</p>

					<p>Though rumors were afloat ten days before the election that Mr. W. had made a
						combination with Kimmel and Stenger to defeat Cessna and Hays they were
						universally discredited for two reasons. First, because he was believed to
						be an honest man, and sincerely devoted to the principles of the Republican
						party as he declared himself to be; and Second, because he was credited with
						possessing a reasonable share of common sense and would not thus sacrifice
						himself as he necessarily would do in secretly combining with the Democratic
						party to secure the defeat of his own candidates. The result proves that in
						both these essential requisites he was lamentably deficient; and while he
						succeeded in defeating Mr. Hays he experienced the keen mortification of
						knowing that his treachery in the matter of Congress has effected nothing
						but his own political disgrace and death. Mr. Cessna is triumphantly elected
						and Mr. Weistling himself has vindicated the judgment of the people of
						Franklin county in refusing to make him their candidate for Congress. So
						much at least has been gained.</p>

					<p>If it be true, as is represented, that Mr. Weistling, by means of the
						confidence the Republicans of Quincy township reposed in him, succeeded in
						fraudulently distributing tickets with the names of Kimmell and Stenger
						instead of Cessna and Hays, and depositing them in the ballot box, he will
						doubtless bring on himself the righteous indignation which such dishonest
						acts merit. For true men will not patiently permit their honest suffrages to
						be filched from them, and themselves made to support principles that are
						obnoxious and dangerous and have well nigh brought the country to ruin, and
						that too merely to gratify the unreasonable envy and malice of a man whom
						the people did not see fit to make their representative in the Counsels of
						the Nation.</p>

					<p>As to the successful part of this plot, the defeat of Mr. Hays, and the
						reelection of Mr. Stenger by Republican votes, we are able to say that Mr.
						Hays was the real and unselfish friend of George B. Weistling throughout,
						and that Weistling and his subordinates, both here and in Quincy township,
						repeatedly assured him of their appreciation of the fact, and their desire
						to secure his election. That they secretly worked against him both here and
						there the returns conclusively show, and whether their immediate end was his
						defeat or some other equally unjustifiable act, it was none the less
						ungrateful and unmanly.</p>

					<p>If Mr. Weistling is satisfied with his work we have no doubt that the men who
						voted the Republican ticket, as well as those who voted for Kimmell and
						Stenger unwittingly through the deception practiced upon them, can
						congratulate themselves on having learned to know him at so small a
						sacrifice. Hereafter he will be powerless to deceive, and can only oppose
						their wishes by putting himself in the ranks of their enemies.</p>

					<p>Those who lent him their aid and influence in the matter have committed a
						blunder which, however prejudiced, they cannot fail to see. We feel assured
						that now, since the excitement is over and wisdom has resumed her sway, they
						will be ready to acknowledge by their earnest efforts in the Republican
						cause that they were wrong, and that though their principles and patriotism
						were obscured by their prejudices they now see their duty clearly and mean
						to perform it.</p>

<b>We Have Won</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository interprets Republican victories in state elections across
					the Union as an affirmation of the results of the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Nebraska sat in judgment, yesterday a week
						ago, on the verdict rendered by our loyal armies and confirmed it. The
						appeal of traitors from bullets to ballots proves to have been badly taken,
						and the decree of the heart of the Union is, "Judgment affirmed." In the
						bitterness and strife engendered by the fierce political conflict, many
						loyal hearts trembled to see the momentous question of country or no country
						put upon the hazard of an exciting election. But the loyal people who met
						and defeated the enemy in arms, came gallantly at their country's call, and
						won a victory that promises to be beneficent and lasting. Truly it is no
						longer vain to hope that we are about to secure to our people the legitimate
						results of the war. Peace, prosperity, contentment and happiness are no
						longer mere fancies in the brains of optimists, but real, tangible blessings
						that come at the end of the long and wearisome road of trial, and
						tribulation, and bereavement, and blood, over which our country has passed.
						We believe confidently that the end has been reached, and that the real
						needs of the country are as well assured, as was the end of the war when
						Sherman's invincible army planted the national emblem over Atlanta. It but
						needs the disorderly retreat from Richmond and the surrender and
						capitulation at Appomattox to crown all, and that will come with the 3d of
						November. Yes it has determined the November
						struggle.</p>

					<p>Gen. Grant, who received the sword of Gen. Lee and disbanded the confederate
						forces, will accept the surrender of a less brave but more dangerous enemy;
						one who under the thin guise of loyalty has repeatedly stabbed his country,
						and whom the unrepentant traitors of the South chose as the champion of the
						"lost cause."</p>

					<p>Such is the verdict of October.</p>

					<p>It points with the clearness of prophecy to the discomfiture of the Northern
						tools and Southern traitors who assembled in New York, and emphatically
						declares that neither the one nor the other shall be allowed to imperil the
						nation's life. It has fixed the policy of the people. It has declared that
						the flag shall protect, everywhere, the humblest as well as the most
						exalted, and has placed the seal of condemnation of lawlessness, disorder
						and riot in the Southern States, so heartily approved and endorsed by the
						servile Democracy of the North.</p>

					<p>Its immediate fruits are loyal legislatures in all the States wherein the
						elections were held, by decided majorities, save in Ohio, where the
						Democratic legislature of last year remains in power another year, as many
						Republican Congressmen from Indiana as before, the defeat of Vallandigham in
						Ohio, and Vorhees in Indiana and the loss of but one member in Pennsylvania.
						It also guarantees a Republican Senator instead of Hendricks of Indiana, and
						one to take the place of Buckalew who has so long misrepresented our own
						State.</p>

					<p>Loyal men of Pennsylvania, "You have acquitted yourselves nobly and won a
						glorious victory over a dangerous and unscrupulous foe. But one more combat
						is needed to consummate their political defeat and death. Come boldly to the
						work, let there be no stragglers and no laggards. Your country's cause
						demands a little more sacrifice, a little more earnest and devoted labor.
						The battle has been won but the enemy has not yet surrendered. They still
						carry the arms of treason in their hands. These must be taken from them. Let
						there be no future for treason, no rest for perfidy, no hope for unholy
						ambition.</p>

					<p>"Let us have peace."</p>

				<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Coming Events</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the recent nation-wide Republican electoral gains, the Repository
					reports that Democrats in some states are backing off of their stronger
					positions. For example, in Georgia the Democratic Party issued a proclamation
					supporting the 15th Amendment and pledging to "protect the colored race." The
					paper calls this a demonstration of the peace a Grant presidency will bring.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Democracy are beginning to appreciate the inevitable logic of events, and
						are putting their houses in order accordingly. The result of the elections
						of last Tuesday makes the election of Grant and Colfax as morally certain as
						anything still in the future can be, and like their nomination at Chicago it
						but requires the formal act of the people at the polls on the 3d November to
						consummate their choice. Already the verdict of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana
						and Nebraska has driven some rationality into the obstinate heads of the
						Democratic leaders in the South and a corresponding share of madness out.
						The Democrats of Georgia see the hand-writing on the wall and are preparing
						to arrest the blow that must fall upon the heads of those traitors who
						persist in encouraging the reign of anarchy and lawlessness which has
						ravaged the reconstructed States since the nomination of Seymour and Blair.
						Three days after the October elections the Democratic Executive Committee of
						that State met and issued the following resolutions:</p>

					<p>Whereas, It has been represented by Republican
						speakers in the present canvass that the Southern people are in favor of the
						reestablishment of Slavery in their respective States, and will commence by
						depriving the blacks of the suffrage; for the purpose of meeting this
						allegation, and giving it positive denial, be it</p>

					<p>Resolved, By the Central Committee of the
						Democratic party in Georgia, representing the people of the State, that the
						charge is unequivocally false; that for evidence that they do not desire to
						reestablish Slavery, and could not effect it, if they would, we refer to the
						fact that this State has assented to and ratified the
							Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, forever abolishing
							Slavery and involuntary servitude, except for crime, whereof the party
							shall be legally convicted: that we reiterate the positions taken
						by this Committee in a late address, and in the report of the Committee on
						the State of the Republic, adopted by the house of representatives in the
						Legislature of this State, on the 26th ult., that we also indorse the
						address of Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others in response to the letter from
						Gen. Rosecrans: that we acquiesce in the present status of the colored race
						among us, and will protect that race to the full extent
							of our power in the exercise of the right of suffrage secured to them by
							the Constitution of the United State and amendments thereto, and by the
							Constitution and laws of this State. E. G. CABANISS, Chairman.</p>

					<p>The loyal people of the United States may be assured that this means peace,
						the peace contemplated by General Grant. It means a prompt obedience to the
						laws, and safety and security to all the citizens of the United States
						whether in the South or the North. It will not be many days before the brave
						"Boys in Blue" yet remaining will pursue their various avocations as safely
						and quietly as we can do with none to molest or murder them, for we predict
						similar signs of returning reason from all the Southern States. The end of
						"carpet-baggers" and "scalawags," thanks to General Grant, has come, and the
						day is dawning when universal liberty, freedom to do right, will be a fact.</p>

<b>Hon. John Cessna Elected</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper congratulates John Cessna on election to Congress from the 16th
					district, and praises the "loyal men of the State" who supported him. Cessna won

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Democratic leaders in Franklin county entered into the October contest
						with all the vigor and enthusiasm born to unmixed confidence, and fought it
						to the close of the polls as they have rarely contested an election. They
						were never better organized and never more regardless of honor and honesty
						than in this campaign. They entered heartily into the guerilla system of
						warfare inaugurated by Wallace, the Democratic vendor of coffee-pots,
						defended none of their own acts, and falsified those of the Republican
						party. Money was lavishly expended among the doubtful, and those who could
						not be cajoled or coerced into a support of the Copperhead ticket, were
						gently tickled along the pocket nerve, in some instances, we regret to say,
						with marked success. Disaffected aspirants to office in the Republican
						party, whose devotion to principle and patriotism proved no match for
						disappointed ambition, were secured, we do not care to know how, to betray
						honest Republican voters into voting for Copperhead candidates by skilfully
						manipulating tickets with the names of Kimmell and Stenger instead of these
						of Cessna and Hays. But all was of no avail. Cessna was triumphantly elected
						and the whole county ticket, except Mr. Bowman, for Director of the Poor,
						and Mr. Hays, for District Attorney. The latter has the satisfaction of
						knowing that his defeat is the price the Repository pays for its fearless
						and independent course previous to the nomination of the county ticket. If
						that journal needed any vindication, it has been amply made by the record of
						those who strove to defeat Mr. Cessna and did defeat Mr. Hays. We wish them
						joy for their newly formed associates; but the defeated Democracy we would
						advise to gather up their tarnished rags and lanterns and all their damaged
						stage machinery and stow them out of sight. The play is over, the people are
						disgusted and the whole "out fit," recruits and all, and if anything be left
						of the rotten concern on the 3d of November, they mean to hold an inquest
						and bury it out of sight and smell forever.</p>

<b>Election Day</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This report focuses on the events of election day aside from the vote; for
					example, it reports successful arbitration for questioned votes and a high voter
					turnout. It also describes the general events in Republican headquarters.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Election day passed off quietly and peaceably. Both parties endeavored to
						poll their full vote and were successful. The bitterness of the campaign for
						the time being ceased, and everything was done with a view to success. Votes
						were challenged, and the decisions of the elections boards were conclusive
						and quietly submitted to. Some amusing incidents occurred in the efforts of
						the workingmen to secure the floaters, and the parties who won could ill
						conceit their satisfaction. There was never a larger vote polled in this
						town.</p>

					<p>In the evening after the closing of the polls, the Republicans and Democrats
						repaired to their various headquarters to await the result. As the returns
						from the North and South wards were received the Republicans gave cheer upon
						cheer. Next came Hamilton with her 58 Democratic majority, which
						disappointed her friends. Green with 100 for Hartranft and Campbell was
						gladly welcomed by the "Boys in Blue." The county seemed then to be going
						Republican. Zollinger's gain in Letterkenny, owing to the trading of our
						party put Fletcher in jeopardy, but Mercersburg with her 190 saved him.
						Quincy gave 55 majority for the State ticket, but made certain the defeat of
						Cessna and Hays. There were many bitter denunciations of the men who calling
						themselves Republicans, had only used their influence to serve Democracy and
						defeat men who had been more successful than themselves. But it was too late
						then to remedy the treachery and deceit of political tricksters. There was
						not much doubt of Cessna's election in the District, the state was safe, a
						majority of our county ticket had been elected, and the victory was
						virtually ours. When this was made known all Union loving citizens felt that
						our struggle against treason was not in vain, and that the party that
						preserved the nation in war would govern it in peace. The opposition blew
						out their lights, retired disappointed and discouraged, fully satisfied that
						the county was going to the D---l, and the Con-sti-tu-tion would be
						overridden by another Radical Congress.</p>
