<b>The Trial</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author reports that the impeachment trial of President Johnson has
                    neared its end and argues for his conviction. It largely argues on the basis of
                    what impact his conviction or acquittal would have on the political parties and
                    results of the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The trial of the President progresses slowly, but it is scarcely possible
                        that it can last more than ten days or two weeks longer. The spectacle has
                        lost much of its novelty for the people since it began, weeks ago, and now
                        its success or failure, and the effect either will have upon the country is
                        most thought of. The subject is worthy of serious consideration, for great
                        good or grave misfortune to the country must come of it. Not for revenge
                        does the Republican party seek and demand the conviction of Andrew Johnson;
                        neither for friendship nor faith in his policy does the Democratic party
                        strive and hope for his acquittal. The one is prompted by better motives;
                        the other is worse. We see it alleged that the failure to convict the
                        President would work the destruction of the Republican party. That may or
                        may not be true, but affords no reason for his conviction. It does, however,
                        furnish a key to the universal desire of the Democracy that he be acquitted.
                        That party has a policy. Its end is power and plunder. The adoption of means
                        to the accomplishment of that end is its policy, and if failure of the
                        impeachment trial is the club to break in pieces the power of the Republican
                        party, they will use it vigorously. After seven years of defeat, desperate
                        circumstances call upon them for desperate efforts. Andrew Johnson, too, has
                        his policy. We take his word for the fact. What it is the managers of the
                        impeachment trial have in part pretty clearly developed. Its effect has been
                        and still is to paralyze and distract the country, to build up higher the
                        obstacles left by the war in the way of peaceable reconstruction of the
                        South, to unsettle the financial condition of the country, and thereby
                        create fear, and distrust, and apprehension every where; in a word, so far
                        as lay, in his power to bring about a state of anarchy.</p>

                    <p>A party is always held responsible for the acts of its administration. The
                        Republican party will be held responsible for the acts of this
                        administration because the people entrusted it to them, and do not know that
                        it has been basely stolen from them. The removal of the President would
                        place the opportunity for remedying our evils where the responsibility lies.
                        It would remove all obstructions from the policy which resisted the
                        dismemberment of the Union, defeated the rebellion and made freemen of both
                        whites and blacks in the South. It would put the administration in harmony
                        with Congress and the People, who have not changed. It would break up
                        whiskey rings and prevent the enormous frauds in the revenue department by
                        which, to day, nearly as much is stolen as comes into the treasury. It would
                        restore the lost confidence of the loyal people who made great sacrifices
                        during the war, who suffered much and never despaired so long as an honest
                        administration was at the head of the Government, and not least of all it
                        would take out of the hands of the Democracy their most effective engine of
                        power, the Federal patronage and the Government funds.</p>

                    <p>Let us hope that we are about to see the end of this prostitution of our
                        country and its best interests to the besotted ambition of Andrew Johnson,
                        and the building up of the Democratic party.</p>

<b>That Walk</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article discusses the popular story of a man walking from Vicksburg to
                    Washington draped in the Union flag, dismissing the man's claims to have been
                    welcomed and applauded along the way.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson, the Democratic party and Southern traitors have vainly
                        endeavored to induce the people to believe that the Southern States have
                        been thoroughly subdued and have a great admiration for that emblem of
                        Liberty which waived triumphantly when they went skulking to their homes,
                        and hid in the mountains and caves, because a man called Sergeant Bates -
                        known among his comrades as a "hospital bummer" - pretending to have served
                        in the Union Army, walked from Vicksburg to Washington with the "Stars and
                        Stripes" wrapped around him.</p>

                    <p>It may be exceedingly gratifying to Conservatives to know that no harm befel
                        the gallant and courageous "standard bearer," and we do not wonder that
                        their lazy bones become active over this great achievement. It may seem to
                        them as a certain proof of the loyalty of the "late rebellious," but it
                        certainly cannot convince any man who has any knowledge of the condition of
                        affairs in the South. This movement was thoroughly understood by the
                        disloyal inhabitants of the districts, through which he passed with his
                        flag. Men who were absent when Sherman's boys carried it from "Atlanta to
                        the sea," fighting under Lee and Davis, or picking off with deadly aim his
                        gallant followers and color-sergeants, were the first to greet Sergeant
                        Bates. Ex-rebel officers with their wives and daughters strewed this man's
                        pathway with flowers. We challenge any of his friends to show a single
                        instance where those who had remained loyal to the "Government of our
                        Fathers" went forth to meet him. Not once did the men that fled from rebels
                        and traitors for their lives; not once did the hunted and persecuted Union
                        men of the South give him any aid or comfort. And why? Because the
                        aristocracy of the South would not permit it, because loyal men dare not
                        forge chains for their enemies to bind them, because if they had said it was
                        perfectly safe for loyal men, unless near military posts in the South, they
                        would have told an atrocious falsehood. Who received this man at the end of
                        his journey? What men of note in civil life were present? Did he even
                        receive the countenance of any of our military chieftains? The ad interim President, Senator Doolittle and one of
                        the most bitter Copperheads in Congress were his committee of reception.
                        After demonstrations from the men whose hostility to Freedom, Justice,
                        Humanity and Liberty, is well known; further comment is unnecessary. It
                        furnishes conclusive evidence that the bravery of Sergeant Bates is a myth;
                        that his stories are unworthy of belief and that from its very inception the
                        sole idea pervading his minds of those who concocted this pleasant and
                        delightful walk, was to deceive or to excite the sympathies of Northern men.
                        It has failed to do this. The people know that the friends of this second
                        Weston were silent in '64, when thousands of "Boys in Blue" carried the same
                        ensign of Freedom over the same ground, or if they spoke it was to further
                        treason's cause.</p>

<b>The Judgeship</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gov. Geary appointed D. W. Rowe, "a promising member of the Chambersburg
                    bar," to fill the office of Additional Law Judge for the Sixteenth Judicial

                    course of the summer, he will be sitting along with Judge King in Franklin and
                    neighboring counties, and citizens will be able to "judge of his fitness." The
                    paper asserts that, despite his young age, he has many of the "qualifications to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository:
                    </p>

                    <p>By your kindness I will occupy a little space in your columns, and claim a
                        little of the time of your readers in reference to the late examinations of
                        the public schools of our town. As the examinations were designed for the
                        eye of the public, it will not be amiss for one
                        of the public to speak of them publicly.</p>

                    <p>We cannot but thank our efficient board of directors for what they have done,
                        and are doing, for the schools of Chambersburg. Slowly, but efficiently,
                        they have brought them up from an insecure beginning to a position in which
                        they contrast favorably - according to the say of those who speak by
                        authority - with the schools of the larger cities of the State.</p>

                    <p>We do not deny that there are deficiencies yet to be supplied, deficiencies
                        of which our board are well aware and which they are willing to supply as
                        soon as possible, and which will be the sooner supplied if properly aided by
                        an interested public.</p>

                    <p>One fact has long been apparent to all connected with the schools, - that the
                        schools and the citizens have heretofore stood too far apart - have stood as
                        though they were independent parts of opposite conditions, and not linked
                        together as they really are in interest and destiny.</p>

                    <p>We see no reason why the schools should be isolated and shut off from the eye
                        of the public, away from the sympathy and co-operation of the outside world
                        of which they are really in the life and the
                            hope. They should be more in sympathy and in
                        union, and in conducting the examinations the directors have taken a wide
                        step toward the consummation of this desirable end; it is bringing together
                        the eye of the public and the work of the school, and if we are not mistaken the
                        interest manifested by parents and others will show the wisdom of the step.
                        We trust the interest thus begun to be manifested will increase and go
                        beyond the public gatherings of the schools - go into the inside operations
                        of the school-rooms themselves as into a place not too secluded or private for the intrusion of the feet of any of the public. Every kind face that looks in
                        upon the school is a ray of sunshine from the outside world to the little
                        world within, and every sympathetic word dropped upon the ear is cheer and
                        joy to the hearts of teachers and pupils, spoken never so lightly though it
                        be.</p>

                    <p>This being the first course of examinations, we could not expect every thing
                        to be as well conducted as years of experience would do, but from the
                        skillful manner in which most of them passed off, the spectators could not
                        help but be well pleased. The examinations, beginning a few weeks ago and
                        closing on last Friday evening, presented to the practical observer many
                        things worthy of thought and study. The short time allotted to each one
                        rendered it impossible to tell just how much each school knew, or how
                        thoroughly each one has been taught, yet as each teacher conducted his own
                        exercises, and it is to be supposed in the same manner in which each one
                        conducts his school, the different manner and systems of the different
                        teachers were brought together in clear contrast, and an opportunity
                        afforded to judge of the efficiency of each one.</p>

                    <p>This is one important particular in which there cannot fail to be a good
                        result. A teacher's position should depend entirely upon his success - his success in discipline and his
                        success in teaching. The examination will bring out his ability and tact,
                        and be a stimulus to his own improvement as well as to that of his school.
                        The consciousness that the eyes of the public are on him is a great
                        incentive.</p>

                    <p>The examinations have shown most of the schools to be well disciplined and
                        well taught, as evinced by the orderly and skillful hearing of both teachers
                        and pupils in all the exercises, and by the prompt and decided manner
                        displayed in the recitations. Whatever lack or deficiency of discipline and
                        skill displayed by any, we have no doubt, will be a lesson for good.</p>

                    <p>We cannot close without a reference to the colored schools, not because we
                        think they made a better appearance or were better taught than the others,
                        but because of their hitherto condition, and their position with respect to
                        others. Notwithstanding it has been affirmed by certain pseudo doctors of a spurious Democracy that the African is
                        incapable of thought, or of progress in the scale of humanity, numerous
                            individuals of the race have demonstrated
                        the contrary to be true, and the appearance and exercises of the schools in
                        question have proven to those who saw them that the race can learn.</p>

                    <p>Shame on the christianity (?) or the philanthropy
                        (?) that plants itself in the way of the progress of the long oppressed and
                        degraded sons and daughters of Ham. How much more becoming coworkers with
                        God to take them by the hand and help lead them up the paths of progress to
                        an elevated Humanity. Whatever difference there may be in the phrenological
                        development of the two races, may be one of race, or it may be of difference
                        of condition. One thing is clear, the phrenological organ of order is not
                        very largely developed in the African character, but that is probably owing
                        to his long situation in the under and more demoralized strata of society. A
                        good system of training and discipline will, no doubt, improve them greatly
                        in this respect.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As stated in our last issue, Judge Rowe presided at the opening of the court
                        on account of the absence of Judge King, who arrived in the afternoon. As
                        usual, the Court House was crowded by witnesses, parties to suits and
                        spectators. The criminal cases first came before the Court on Monday
                        afternoon and engaged the time of juries, lawyers, and judges until Thursday
                        noon. Several of the cases were of a trivial character and should never have
                        been allowed to leave the docket of the Justice of the Peace, but the
                        prosecutors received what they were searching for, justice.</p>

                    <p>Court being in session on Thursday morning, it was announced by the Court
                        that owing to the departure of Judge King for Washington, the Additional
                        Judge would hold the usual courts. His honor having consulted the members of
                        the bar, issued the following order: "The Additional Judge appoints an
                        additional term of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county, to be held
                        at Chambersburg, on Monday, the 1st day of June, 1868, and award a venire for jurors at the said additional term."
                        This action is in accordance with the act of Assembly under which there was
                        another Law Judge placed upon the bench. It is alleged that there are three
                        hundred cases waiting trial before our court. Some of the cases are
                        doubtless very short, and a week in June will remove many from the list.</p>

                    <p>For the information of our readers who may feel an interest in the
                        proceedings, we append a list of the cases tried and those not prosecuted:</p>

                    <p>QUARTER SESSIONS.</p>

                    <p>The Commonwealth tried the following cases:</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. David L. Taylor - Obtaining money under false pretenses. Not guilty.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. John Lane - Surety of the Peace. On hearing the case the court
                        sentenced the Defendant to pay costs of prosecution, or give bail for
                        payment of the same, and be in custody until he complied with the sentence.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Patrick Conner - Felony. The Defendant plead guilty. Sentence to pay
                        a fine of one cent, costs of prosecution and go to jail for thirty days.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. John Kimple, Allen Ward, Upton Ward and Jane Duncannon, charged with
                        disturbing a public meeting. Found, not guilty and that the costs be divided
                        between Upton Ward and Michael Diehl, the prosecutor.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Isaac Wright - Found guilty of an attempt to commit arson. Sentenced
                        to pay a fine of one cent, the costs of prosecution and an imprisonment of
                        six months in the county jail.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Irving M'Dowell, charged with disturbing Singing School. Found
                        guilty.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. James Larpen - Surety of the Peace. The Court sentence the
                        prosecutrix, Marv Beatty, to pay the costs.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. John Gsell - Assault and Battery. Defendant plead guilty and
                        sentenced to pay a fine of five dollars and the costs of prosecution.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Wm. Furley, Mrs. Wm. Furley and Caroline Furley - Assault and
                        Battery. The Jury found them not guilty and divided the costs between Lydia
                        Grove, the prosecutrix, and the defendants.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. P. D. Ostrander - Passing counterfeit money. The Jury found him not
                        guilty. There was also another bill found by the Grand Jury against the
                        prisoner, charging him with having counterfeit money in his possession on
                        the evening of the 25th March last. As the District Attorney insisted on the
                        trial of the latter case going over until August term, when he would produce
                        an important witness for the Commonwealth, who resides in New York, the case
                        was continued and bail fixed at $1,000. The Defendant was committed to
                        prison in default of surety. The bail was afterwards reduced to $600 at the
                        request of C. M. Duncan, Esq., the prisoner's counsel.</p>

                    <p>On motion of W. S. Stenger, Esq., District Attorney, the court granted leave
                        to enter a nolle prosequi in the following
                        cases: - Com. vs. Peter Sewell and Elizabeth Sewell; Com. vs. Houson Horner;
                        Com. vs. Elias Brumbaugh and Samuel Barger; Com. vs. John Bray; Com. vs.
                        Josephine Franklin; Com. Joseph Miller; Com. vs. R. W. Ramsey; Com. vs. E.
                        J. Wallace; Com. vs. Caroline Johnson; Com. vs. James Cauffman; Com. vs.
                        David Bergenstock, et al; Com. vs. Michael Cressler; Com. vs. William
                        Weicht; Com. vs. Lewis Etter; Com. vs. Jacob Flory; Com. vs. Thomas

                        Caroline Stoops; Com. vs. David Smith.</p>

                    <p>The grand jury ignored the following bills: - Com. vs. Wm. Flory; Com. vs.
                        Wm. Weicht; Com. vs. Francis Bowden and the prosecutor Conrad Ruths to pay
                        the costs; Com. vs. Dr. S. D. Kell; Com. vs. Cornelius Vincent; Com. vs.
                        David Guyer and prosecutor to pay the costs of prosecution, except jury fee.</p>

<b>Borough Officers</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The legislature passed a bill requiring borough officers to be elected on a
                    date separate from the regular spring elections in March. Many citizens opposed
                    this, but, according to the paper, Col. Winger blocked any attempts to change
                    it. The editors assert that Democrats hope, by adding an extra election, to gain
                    an advantage that will allow them to "slip in a Councilman or two." On the first
                    Monday in May, Chambersburg will elect a Chief Burgess, five Town Councilmen,
                    one Auditor, and one High Constable.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A Grand Jury recently visited the Jail and the Alms House. They ordered
                    repairs in the outer walls of the jail. They found the alms house to be in good
                    condition, but objected to the small size of the hospital and its proximity to
                    the main building where it might "fumigate" the healthy "paupers."<br>

<b>School Examinations</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The examinations of the public schools concluded on Friday. The results
                    "reflected great credit on both teachers and scholars, and also the good
                    judgement of our Directors in their selection of teachers and manner of
                    governing the schools." The "colored schools" also were found to be in good
                    condition, the results proving conclusively that "the colored race, where an
                    opportunity is offered, is capable of being educated."<br>
