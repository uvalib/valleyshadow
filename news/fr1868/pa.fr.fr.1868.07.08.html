<b>Democratic Inconsistency</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper ridicules the Democrats for flip-flopping on Reconstruction
                    policy. The editors point out how the Democrats worked so hard to defeat
                    Reconstruction bills but then opposed the readmission of the southern states
                    once the latter complied with the requirements set by Republicans. The article
                    charges that the Democrats only wanted what was best for their party and not the
                    nation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democratic party is invariably great in little things and small in great
                        things. Like a tempest in a teapot, if you confine it it hisses and fumes,
                        and sputters and blows tremendiously, but if you take off the lid
                        and give it a chance to spread itself, it subsides at once. Democracy is
                        worth nothing except when it believes itself injured, outraged, oppressed
                        and abused. Then, like Mark Taply, it feels jolly and comes out strong.
                        Democratic hygienne demands this condition to insure a reasonable
                        degree of enjoyable health, and the party enjoys feeling miserable
                        amazingly.</p>
                    <p>This peculiar feature has been well illustrated in the part taken by its
                        members in Congress in the passage of the Arkansas Bill, and the Omnibus
                        Bill admitting six other Southern States into the Union. With great pretence
                        of patriotism, the Democratic party has during more than two years resisted
                        all the reconstruction measures of the Republican Congress. At every step in
                        their progress their vote was solid against the policy adopted by Congress,
                        and always accompanied by a protest against what they were pleased to
                        denominate the unjust and unconstitutional measures of a radical Congress,
                            and a declaration that the rebellious states were
                            entitled to an immediate and unconditional admission into the
                        Union. In spite of this opposition, which was only strong enough to
                        amount to an annoyance, Congress pushed on the work of reconstruction on a
                        basis which would protect the Government against future rebellions and
                        secure to all classes of citizens of the South equal rights and privileges.</p>
                    <p>At length seven of the Southern States having complied with all the
                        requirements of Congress present their State constitutions and ask, what the
                        Democratic party all along has been clamoring for, their restoration into
                        the Union, and the reestablishment of the civil law among them. One would
                        naturally suppose that a bill for the admission of the Representatives of
                        these States into Congress would be heartily approved by the Democracy. But
                        not so. When it is presented, they are as much opposed to it as they had
                        formerly seemed in favor of it. Every Democratic member votes against it and
                        suddenly becomes the violent opponent of the immediate return of the
                        Southern States. But they not only vote. They protest. They who have during
                        the last two years or more filed innumerable protests in favor of the
                        admission of the South, now enter their solemn protest against it. They
                        protest against what the South asks and the North desires to give. They
                        protest against what the whole nation wants. They protest against a national
                        necessity. They protest against the public good. They protest against their
                        own protests, and declare they never felt so blissfully unhappy, so
                        lugubriously jolly in all their lives.</p>
                    <p>These are the Democratic statesmen who stand boldly on the Constitution, and
                        call themselves the champions of the South, the men of broad and expansive
                        views, who stand between the defeated slaveholders and their oppressors. On
                        the contrary, they are small demagogues and partisans, who knew no higher
                        duty than to oppose everything that is done by the Republican party. They
                        will prevent the performance of that which they want done, if it is to be
                        done in any other way or by any other party than their way or their party.
                        They will make high sounding speeches and enter melancholy protests against
                        what they call the abuses of the Republican party, and when the opportunity
                        offers will vote to perpetuate these abuses and belie their speeches and
                        protests, and besmear themselves all over with infamy.</p>
                    <p>If there is no more statesmanship, no more honesty and integrity, no more
                        patriotism in the Democratic party than its leaders in Congress exercise,
                        the people will hesitate long before entrusting the government in their
                        hands. They are miserable swindlers and humbugs, who have never learned that
                        there has been a war, nor its lessons, and now are stupidly blind to the
                        only conditions that will make a lasting and beneficent peace.</p>

<b>Andrew's Amnesty</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper argues that Andrew Johnson's declaration of amnesty for all
                    ex-Confederates besides Jefferson Davis that coincided with the Democratic
                    National Convention was simply a ploy aimed at securing the nomination. The
                    editors doubt it will have the desired effect, since white southerners always
                    considered the president a "low down white," and Democratic politicians have no
                    further use for him. The paper also denounces the principle of amnesty that
                    would take away "the last badge which the government has seen fit to attach to
                    them as traitors."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor continues his attacks on the Democratic party. He links them
                    with the Slave Power and jokingly asks how the Democrats can make a claim for
                    power when so many of their own party members defected to the Republicans since
                    the war. The paper urges voters to remember the traitorous deeds of the
                    Democrats and to support the Republicans.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We know not which should most excite our astonishment, the cool effrontery of
                        the chameleon Democracy in asking Republicans, and especially the
                        soldier-citizens, to assist in placing them again in power, or the
                        disposition any Republican or soldier might have to give them aid and
                        comfort in the mighty efforts they are now making to get control of the
                        offices and emoluments of the government. Before the war, by their
                        obsequious devotion to the Slave oligarchy of the South, they had driven
                        from their ranks those Democrats who were honest in their purpose to
                        preserve the party from the infamy which it was foreseen must overtake it in
                        its attempt to subjugate the free labor system to the despotic sway of a
                        slavocracy. How came the Democracy that carried James Buchanan so
                        triumphantly into the Presidency in 1856, to fail in their efforts to retain
                        the government in their own hands? Let the damning history of that party
                        during the incipiency, the progress and consummation of the Kansas frauds be
                        recalled to explain why good, honest and freedom loving Democrats left the
                        sinking ship, and with others who would not bow the knee to the aristocracy
                        of the South, formed and swelled into a host the Republican party of 1860.
                        Why did the Charleston Convention split, and give a victory to the
                        Republican party? We defy contradiction, when we say that the spirit of
                        backbone animated the majority to that extent that they obeyed the behests
                        of manhood, and refused to lower their necks to the yoke, which the lordly
                        slaveholders of the South were prepared to lay upon them and fasten with
                        permanent and unyielding boughs. Why when the chagrined and beaten cohorts
                        of slavery rebelled against the lawfully constituted authorities, did
                        another exodus from the already thinned ranks of the Democracy take place,
                        so that there appeared to be "none so poor to do it reverence?" It is within
                        the recollection of every voter, that the fragments of what had once carried
                        terror to the ranks of their political antagonists, were now merely held
                        together by the carping complaints against the government which was bending
                        its energies to suppress a rebellion only less odious in their eyes than the
                        government itself. That such a party reduced to a mere skeleton, should ever
                        have recuperated, or upon the anti-Republican principles have acquired
                        strength to stand up in a contest for the control of the government, should
                        astonish every thinking man. Has the party reformed? No one can hear a
                        modern Democrat talk ten minutes without betraying his veneration for the
                        relics of the party's creed, when they shouted long live slavery, don't
                        touch slavery, the "war is unconstitutional," the "cursed bloody war," in the language of a veteran in their ranks
                        in this county; "no draft," "don't punish deserters from our army," "don't
                        put the blacks into the army," "the war is a failure," "Lincoln's a
                        tyrant--an ape--should be hung." The same animus that gave impulse to these
                        symptoms of the disease they have labored under, still inspires the party.
                        To-day they would re-inaugurate Slavery in the South, they would plead for a
                        chance to make Kansas a Slave State, they would decry Douglas for ever
                        giving to Kansas a chance to save itself from the curse of Slavery, and vote
                        for Breckenridge none the less readily that he has since proven himself a
                        traitor. The present Democracy show no symptoms of repentance for its sins
                        of ignorance or its sins of high-handed defiance against our God-given
                        freedom. To-day the Republican party has as its record the proud eminence
                        which our nation occupies in the eyes of Europe, the only claims, that can
                        be shown by a party, on the gratitude of a people saved from anarchy and a
                        perpetual war. It holds that the people, through its representatives, have
                        the right to make their own laws and to have those laws legally and honestly
                        enforced.</p>
                    <p>No good Republican can fail to see that a triumph of the Democracy now, would
                        be to turn back on the dial of progress the hand that marks our advance in
                        the scale of civilization and enlightenment.--It would be true that the
                        United States Government as well as Andrew Johnson has swung around the
                        circle merely to be in the same condition she was when she started, a
                        revolution truly--but of blood and carnage--and all for nothing. We would
                        have the absurd spectacle of a host of Democrats deserting their
                        party--helping build up the great Republican party to retrieve the errors
                        from which they retired in disgust only to long for the leeks and onions of

                        the bloody experience of the four years of sanguinary conflict, that good
                        has been achieved by the Republican party and not by the so-called
                        Democracy, which now so clamorously demands to be re-instated in power, that
                        power in the government from which they were driven but eight years ago by
                        an insulted and indignant people.</p>

                    dismissed Col. George B. Wiestling as a potential Republican nominee for

                    excellent nominee, and cites his service to the party, his strong war record,
                    and his support for the proposed railroad that would link Waynesboro to the
