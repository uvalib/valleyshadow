<b>Reconstruction. Speech of Hon. W. H. Koontz</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints and address delivered in Congress by W. H. Koontz,
                    representative for the district including Franklin. Koontz defends a recent act
                    to place reconstruction power in the hands of Congress and the General-in-Chief.
                    He gives an elaborate justification for the bill, especially in his
                    denunciations of the southern governments as invalid because of their prior
                    treason. He also takes great pains to portray the Republicans as the party of
                    the Constitution and the Democrats as traitors. <br>

                    <p>
                        Delivered in the House of Representatives, January 20,
                            1868.
                    </p>
                    <p>The House having under the consideration the bill (H.R 439,) additional and
                        supplementary to an act entitled "An act to provide for the more efficient
                        government of the rebel States," passed March 2, 1867--</p>
                    <p>Mr. KOONTZ said:</p>
                    <p>Mr. SPEAKER: This bill has been pretty thoroughly discussed on both sides of
                        the House, and I will endeavor, in as brief a time as possible, to present
                        to the consideration of the House my reasons for supporting the measure. In
                        discussing this bill there are three things to be considered: First, what is
                        proposed to be done by the bill? Second, has Congress the power to pass it?
                        Third, is there now such a pressing public necessity as calls upon Congress
                        for the passage of the bill?</p>
                    <p>This bill proposes to declare that in the late rebellious States "there are
                        no civil governments republican in form, and that the so-called civil
                        governments in said States, respectively, shall not be recognized as valid
                        or legal State governments, either by the executive or judicial power or
                        authority of the United States."</p>
                    <p>The bill also proposed to confer upon the General of the Army the power "to
                        enjoin, by special orders, upon all officers in command within the several
                        military departments within said several States, the performance of all acts
                        authorized by said several laws above recited, and to remove by his order
                        from command any and all of said commanders, and detail other officers of
                        the United States Army, not below the rank of Colonel, to peform
                        all the duties and exercise all the powers authorized by said several acts."</p>
                    <p>The bill also confers upon the General of the Army the power of removal from
                        and appointment to civil offices under those several provisional
                        governments. It further declares that "it shall be unlawful for the
                        President of the United States to order any party of the Army or Navy of the
                        United States to assist by force of arms the authority of either of said
                        provisional governments in said disorganized States to oppose or obstruct
                        the authority of the United States, as provided in this act and the act to
                        which this is supplementary."</p>
                    <p>Then there is added a section making it a penal offence for any person to
                        attempt to prevent by force the execution of the orders of the General of
                        the Army.</p>
                    <p>These, sir, are in brief the provisions of the bill. The next question is,
                        has Congress the lawful power and authority to pass this measure? And, sir,
                        in asserting the power of Congress over this question it becomes necessary
                        to sustain the allegation of the fact contained in the first section of the
                        bill, that in those States there are no civil State governments republican
                        in form; for, sir, I concede that if it be not true in point of fact that
                        there are no such civil governments in those States, then this proposed
                        legislation and all the legislation of Congress pertaining to the question
                        of reconstruction is wrong; but, if on the other hand, it be true in point
                        of fact that there are no valid State governments in those States, then I
                        apprehend that gentlemen on all sides of this House will concede that there
                        is necessity for some legislation, either in the shape of this bill or some
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Now, sir, is it true that there are no legal State governments in those
                        States? I maintain that it is. I do not deny that prior to 1861 there were
                        legal State governments in those States holding their true relation to the
                        Government of the United States, and acting harmoniously with the other
                        States of the Union, under the Constitution, the supreme law of the land.
                        But I assert that those governments were overthrown by traitors; that they
                        were seized by men whose hearts were filled with treason, and all, or nearly
                        all, of the legislative, executive and judicial officers of those States
                        assisted in carrying them outside of the Government of the United States.</p>
                    <p>It is necessary, sir, to briefly allude to some of the leading events of that
                        period. A Republican President had been elected in accordance with the
                        provisions of the Constitution of the United States; but because he and his
                        party were of a different political faith to theirs, they seized upon what
                        they considered a favorable opportunity to enforce their long cherished
                        doctrine of State rights. For many years the political leaders of the South
                        had been promulgating the wicked and dangerous theory, that it was within
                        the power of any one of the States, at its pleasure, to sever its connection
                        with the Government of the United States, and the election of a President by
                        the Republican party was made the pretext for rebellion; and I would here
                        remind gentlemen who are continually denouncing the Republican party for
                        what they allege to be its unconstitutional acts, that in the election of
                        Abraham Lincoln that party was strictly within the limits of the
                        Constitution, and that the leaders of the rebellion not only disregarded the
                        plain provisions of the Constitution in refusing to abide by that election,
                        but engaged in their unholy work before his administration had come into
                        power, and without waiting to see whether, so far as they were concerned, he
                        would not take care that the laws of the land were faithfully executed. It
                        will be remembered that they passed their ordinances of secession, and by
                        the most solemn legislative enactment declared that their States were no
                        longer bound to the General Government. Not only that, but they seized upon
                        all the public property within the limits of those States. They seized upon
                        the forts, arsenals, mints, custom-houses, navy-yards, and all the property
                        belonging to the United States Government therein. They went further, sir;
                        they elected their representatives and sent them to Montgomery, Alabama, and
                        there they united together under another government, formed a constitution
                        for themselves, and adopted a flag different from the flag of our fathers.
                        By the most solemn forms of law they created a separate and independent
                        government, with the avowed intent and purpose of destroying the Government
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>And, sir, for four long years they wielded the power of this great and
                        tremendous organization, extending over ten States, a vast empire in
                        themselves, holding within and under its control ten million people, and
                        with almost unlimited resources, for the purpose of destroying the
                        Government which had been trained by Washington and his compeers. They were
                        unsuccessful, but I need not remind gentlemen on this floor of the
                        tremendous cost to the loyal people of the country in precious blood and
                        treasure to maintain the unity and integrity of this Government.</p>
                    <p>Now, sir, during these four years of civil war where rested the legal power
                        and authority of the United States Government? I answer that they were with
                        the loyal, adhering, organized States of the Union. Does any gentlemen on
                        the other side say that the legislation for those ten States during that
                        time was wrong because they were in armed rebellion? Will they deny that the
                        legislation necessary to carry on the Government within the organized States
                        was illegal, unconstitutional, and void because those ten States happened to
                        be in organized revolt? Was not the legislative, executive, and judicial
                        power of the Government of the United States fully recognized by the people
                        of the loyal States during that time?</p>
                    <p>Mr. MUNGEN. We get appeals to his side of the House, and I should like to
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. KOONTZ. Not now. I answer that during the time that those States were
                        outside of the Government, so far as they could place themselves, the
                        sovereign power of the nation was represented in the organized States of the
                        Union. He would be a bold man, indeed, who would controvert this position;
                        for to deny the authority of the law-abiding, organized States, to wield the
                        sovereign power of the Government during an insurrection or rebellion in
                        others, would be equivalent to an admission that the bare organization of
                        rebellion in any section of the country would of itself work a dissolution
                        of the Government, for those not in revolt would be powerless to prevent it.
                        But not only were the legal power and authority of the Government of the
                        United States vested in the organized States by recognition of the loyal
                        people but they were recognized by foreign nations. The United States of
                        America did not in the eyes of other Powers cease to be a nation because a
                        portion thereof was in rebellion, but its dignity and sovereign power were
                        as fully acknowledged by them as before.</p>
                    <p>Now, sir, if the proposition be true that during the rebellion the legal
                        power and authority of the United States remained in the loyal States, when
                        did that power cease over the disorganized communities? When the war ended,
                        say the rebels; when Lee surrendered, say the Democratic party. This would
                        be equivalent to saying there should be no penalty for treason, for there
                        would be no power to impose it, as the guilty would have an equal voice with
                        the guiltless in settling the controversy. Against this doctrine the loyal
                        people protest, earnestly protest, and insist that the terms of settlement
                        shall be fixed by them; that as the power and jurisdiction of a court over
                        the criminal attach until the sentence is pronounced, so the power and
                        jurisdiction of the loyal States attach and remain over the disorganized
                        part until all the questions springing up and arising out of the rebellion
                        have been fully and entirely settled.</p>
                    <p>But, sir, if those States were not entirely overthrown, gentlemen will admit
                        with the President of the United States, as they now seem to have come to
                        his position, that they required at least some legislative or executive
                        action in their behalf, because they were so far disorganized as to require
                        it, to set them on foot again. The President recognized this when he
                        declared that they were without civil governments, and undertook to assume
                        the power of legislation on this question. He recognized the fact that their
                        civil governments had been overthrown when he established provisional
                        governments for them. We only differed with him so far in asserting that the
                        question of reconstructing these States was with the Congress of the United
                        States and not in the hands of the Executive.</p>
                    <p>Then, sir, to establish the point I am making, namely, that these are not
                        valid civil governments. I deny that they are such, because they are the
                        creatures of executive power and not of legislative authority. It was a
                        question that belonged exclusively to Congress, and not to any other
                        co-ordinate branch of the Government.</p>
                    <p>But I object to these governments further, because they have had the breath
                        of life breathed into them for the purpose of reviving the fell spirit of
                        treason that for four long years spread disaster and sorrow throughout the
                        land.</p>
                    <p>Now, sir, I think I have clearly shown that the power of this Government
                        belongs to the loyal States of the Union--those that remained true to it
                        during civil war. Then the only question remaining is, is there a public
                        necessity for this bill?</p>
                    <p>I urge, in the first place, that there is a necessity for the passage of this
                        bill to protect the loyal men of those States. Does any man doubt, from all
                        the evidence we have had during the last two years, that if the military
                        power is withdrawn, from the States the loyal men, black and white, will be
                        entirely under the control of the rebels, who will have an ascendency as
                        complete and effectual as when Lee held undisputed power over the whole
                        region?</p>
                    <p>It is needed, further, to prevent the obstacles that have been thrown in the
                        way of reconstruction. We have had obstacles not only on account of the
                        reconstruction of the law, as was stated by my colleague, but in adverse
                        executive action; and in order that there may be a harmonious policy, and
                        that all obstacles may be removed in the way of the policy of Congress, it
                        is necessary that this question should be under control of the General of
                        the Army and not of so many different military commanders. We would thus be
                        relieved of the difficulty that exists under the present law, having of one
                        policy for Louisiana and another for Virginia.</p>
                    <p>But it is needed, further, because the rebels and their sympathizing friends
                        in the North refused to accept the generous terms that were offered by the
                        Thirty-Ninth Congress. That Congress offered a plan of settlement of those
                        difficulties so fair and generous that no honest mind could controvert it;
                        and yet these people, aided and encouraged by the President of the United
                        States and by the Democratic party of the North, refused to accept the
                        generous terms proffered in the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of
                        the United States. Therefore it becomes necessary that Congress should
                        exercise its authority and demand that other terms shall be acceded to them
                        since they have refused to accept so generous an offer. Indeed, the terms of
                        settlement contained in these several reconstruction bills are more generous
                        than were ever offered to a vanquished foe before. A magnanimous
                            peopled demand neither the lives nor property of their late
                        enemies; but they do insist that they shall only be restored to political
                        power in the Union upon the considerations prescribed by the loyal people of
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>These, sir, are in brief my reasons for advocating this bill, and I propose
                        now to advert to a few arguments--I can hardly say a few, because it seems
                        to me there is but a single argument advanced on the other side against this
                        bill. The whole cry is that this bill is unconstitutional. Sir, all the
                        reconstruction bills that have been passed by this and the preceding
                        Congress have been denounced by gentlemen on the other side as
                        unconstitutional. This is the old cry repeated. We heard it at the beginning
                        of the war. We were then told it was unconstitutional to coerce a State;
                        that it was unconstitutional to call out armies and defend the capital of
                        the nation; that it was unconstitutional to draft men into the armies of the
                        United States; that it was unconstitutional to issue money to pay the
                        soldiers who were drafted; that it was unconstitutional to and wrong to arm
                        the negro. In short, every measure that was ever advocated by the Republican
                        party in these Halls for the suppression of the infamous rebellion has been
                        denounced by the Democratic party as unconstitutional. They seem to assume,
                        or rather they do assume, that they are the special guardians and protectors
                        of the Constitution. I desire, in the brief moments that are left me, to
                        point to some of their own acts in regard to the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>It will be remembered, in 1860, when the conscience of the people had become
                        aroused by the aggressive spirit of slavery, and had brought into life and
                        being a party that planted itself upon the ground of opposition to the
                        extension of that institution, that John J. Crittenden, a Senator from
                        Kentucky, offered in the other branch of Congress a series of resolutions to
                        perpetuate the curse of human bondage. He proposed to place in the
                        Constitution of the United States that word which James Madison refused to
                        permit to go in. He was willing not only to insert the word "slave" in the
                        Constitution but to dedicate the whole of that vast empire south of 36d 30s
                        to the curse of slavery. That was Democratic doctrine then. The Constitution
                        might, by their consent, be changed, provided it would be to the interest of
                        the slave power.</p>
                    <p>We go a step further. After the Montgomery constitution had been adopted
                        there was a portion of the Democratic party that was willing to run the line
                        north of Pennsylvania and to exclude New England from the Union. They
                        proposed to take in Pennsylvania, New jersey, New York, and as many western
                        States as chose to come in, and adopt the Montgomery constitution for the
                        purpose, as they said, of leaving New England out in the cold.</p>
                    <p>Sir, let me say that New England will not be kept out in the cold, and the
                        reason of it in brief is this, that she is true no to the cause
                        of human liberty as she was when the Mayflower landed her precious cargo
                        upon her shores and<br> "The sounding aisles of the dim woods rang<br> To
                        the anthem of the free."</p>
                    <p>But, sir, in answer to gentlemen upon the other side who claim that the
                        Democratic party is the great protector and defender of the Constitution. I
                        want to point out to gentlemen upon all sides of this House this significant
                        fact, that when the great unconstitutional work of this country was
                        undertaken, namely, organized rebellion in ten States for the purpose of
                        breaking up and destroying this Union, never, during all that time, was
                        there promulgated from a Democratic State convention or from a Democratic
                        State committee, a single authoritative enunciation expressive of their
                        indignation at the great unconstitutional work that the rebels were engaged
                        in; no, not one. And permit me to say now, that if that party had denounced
                        that great unconstitutional work, with half the zeal and half the energy
                        with which they have denounced the measures that were necessary to keep it
                        down, the war would have ended a year sooner than it did, $1,000,000,000 of
                        public debt would have been saved to the Government, and many firesides
                        would now have chairs occupied that are vacant. This was the policy of that
                        party that has assumed to act as the special defenders of the Constitution.
                        Let me add another item on this point. I remember that in the latter part of
                        June, 1863, the news spread abroad throughout the North that General Lee was
                        advancing upon the State of Pennsylvania, and soon that news was confirmed,
                        and the invaders stood upon the soil of Pennsylvania. At that very time
                        there was a Democratic State convention sitting in the capitol at Harrisburg
                        and although the enemy was ready to carry destruction and devastation
                        throughout the broad limits of the Commonwealth, and, indeed the whole
                        North, if it had been in his power, not one word in condemnation of the
                        rebellion, or denunciation of the unconstitutional work its leaders were
                        engaged in, went out from that convention and yet, sir, this is the party
                        that professes to speak for the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BOYER. Mr. Speaker--</p>
                    <p>Mr. KOONTZ. My time is nearly out. I would like to yield to my colleague, but
                        I cannot.</p>
                    <p>Sir, I think I have effectually answered the claim that the Democratic party
                        has set up to be considered the special guardian and protector of the
                        Constitution of the United States. We maintain that the power we have had
                        ever since the war began, the power that belonged to the remaining organized
                        States of the Union to crush and destroy the rebellion, remains with us
                        until every vestige of treason is destroyed. And if the provisional
                        governments in those States, created without any authority of law, are to be
                        made instruments to reinstate treason in the high places of this Government,
                        then they must just as surely fall as did the military power of the
                        rebellion before the invincible armies of the Republic. We claim that this
                        bill is necessary to a proper enforcement of the reconstruction acts
                        heretofore passed, and to a just and fair settlement of this vexed question.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, sir, permit me to say that we are now engaged in rebuilding
                        the foundations of this great Government that have been shaken by the fierce
                        temper of civil war. Treason did its work in attempting to pull down and
                        destroy, let it be the work of loyal hands to build up, beautifully, and
                        adorn this temple of liberty. Let us see to it that the loyal people are
                        protected throughout the limits of the whole country; that equal and exact
                        justice to all men shall be the rule by which the Republic is guided, and
                        then we shall have faithfully executed the trust committed to us.</p>

                    <p> HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                    <p> WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 17, 1868.</p>
                    <p>
                        To Gov. Reuben E. Fenton, Albany, N.Y.
                    </p>
                    <p>SIR:--I have read with sorrow and astonishment your letter recommending
                        national honors to the rebels whose invasion of the North was stopped by
                        death in battle on the field of Antietam. You say:</p>
                    <p>"A strong local and individual feeling in the neighborhood of Antietam and
                        other parts of Maryland, naturally engendered by the invasion, may have
                        created some indifference in regard to the Confederate dead, and an
                        indisposition to see them buried side by side with those who died in defence
                        of our nationality. But it is confidently believed that no such feeling
                        pervades the breasts of the American people, or the surviving officers and
                        soldiers of the Union armies.</p>
                    <p>"When we recall the generosity and moderation that marked the conduct of the
                        people, the Government and the army during the war, and the magnanimity that
                        presided at its close; when we remember that our countrymen are now engaged
                        in the work of reconstructing the Union, on the basis of universal freedom,
                        and with an earnest desire to restore to the Southern States a prosperity
                        infinitely greater than that which slavery and rebellion conspired to
                        destroy, it is impossible to believe that they would desire to make an
                        invidious distinction against the mouldering remains of the Confederate
                        dead, or that they would disapprove of their being carefully gathered from
                        the spots where they fell and laid to rest in the National Cemetery, on the
                        battlefield of Antietam.</p>
                    <p>"Conquerors as we were in that great struggle, our stern disapproval of the
                        cause in which they fought need not forbid our admiration of the bravery
                        with which they died. They were Americans, misguided, indeed, and misled,
                        but still our countrymen; and, we cannot remember them now either with
                        enmity or unkindness."</p>
                    <p>I have read these paragraphs twice and thrice, but a dimness other than the
                        film of age, obscures them to my vision. It is in vain that I have wiped the
                        spectacles of an old man, and endeavored deliberately and clearly to see in
                        your words a justification for the recommendation they make. Two forms come
                        between me and the printed page. They stay there, and will not move away.
                        One of them is the figure of my eldest son, the Colonel of the Fourth
                        Pennsylvania Cavalry--as brave, devoted, and generous a boy as ever filled a
                        father's heart with pride and made a mother happy. He covered with his
                        regiment a retrograde movement of a column of our army under Sheridan, in
                        June, 1864, fighting every rod of his way. He fell badly wounded. His men
                        endeavored to carry him off; but, hotly pursued, several of them were killed
                        or disabled. He told his major to leave him and save himself and the
                        command, and try to make a stand on the next height, and there gain time for
                        the great wagon train ahead to escape to the James river. My son was laid
                        upon the grass beside the highway, his men obeying his orders to return to
                        their ranks, and leave him with the dead and wounded of his regiment to
                        await capture.</p>
                    <p>The rebels soon came up, and, as I have been told, shot him again when he lay
                        helpless on the ground, stripped him of his sword, money, watch, boots and
                        clothing, and left him naked to die. An old colored women, living in the
                        neighborhood, brought him water to drink while he was dying. The next day he
                        was buried in her garden.</p>
                    <p>Gov. Fenton, the figure of the murdered boy so comes between my eyes and the
                        text of your recommendation of national honors to the rebel dead, that I
                        cannot see in it a reason from which fathers and mothers who love their
                        children should not instinctively shrink, and which should not shock
                        patriots who have loved their country, and have made sacrifices for it.</p>
                    <p>There is, sir, another figure which makes filmy reading through my old
                        spectacles. My youngest son, a private in the Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry,
                        who entered the army before he was fifteen years of age, was captured at
                        Sulphur Springs, when Meade fell back to Centreville, with one hundred and
                        fifty-six of his regiment, one hundred and forty-two of whom afterwards
                        perished in prison. Twenty-four of those who died went out in the Covode
                        Cavalry, from my immediate neighborhood--all the sons of my neighbors--all
                        objects of interest and care to me. After passing from one den of
                        imprisonment and cruelty to another, they were finally immured with
                        thousands of other unfortunates in the death pen of Andersonville. Eighteen
                        months of hunger and nakedness, exposure to the scorching sun and the
                        winter's freezing, did their work on these stalwart and brave men. Many of
                        them died idiotic, some of them feebly insane--all the victims of a system
                        of starvation and cruelty planned by demons and executed by devils. My son's
                        bodily vigor and resoluteness of spirit carried him through the horrors of
                        Andersonville, with life left in him--with hardly any thing more. He is home
                        again with his mother, and I have just received a letter from her urging me
                        to "try another doctor, for he grows worse." But the energetic, intelligent,
                        hopeful, self-reliant, brave boy who left my house to fight the enemies of
                        his country, has not returned to me, and he never will return.</p>
                    <p>I think you will find that, in common with me, hundreds of thousands of loyal
                        men, whose hearts yet bleed with wounds received in the wicked war the
                        slaveholders waged against the nation's life, have been shocked and outraged
                        by your recommendation to do honor to the authors of their sorrows and the
                        workers of their country's woes.</p>
                    <p>Had you served in the army, either in person or through a son, and presented
                        your offering of patriotism to your country on the picket line or the line
                        of pitched battle, you would never have made the heartless mistake you have
                        made, in what your biographer, writing your life, will call "the Antietam
                        letter." How much I wish you had imitated the manly and sympathetic behavior
                        of Gov. Geary of Pennsylvania, a soldier and a statesman, who thus repelled
                        the proposition to mingle the rebel with the Union dead under the Antietam
                        Monument:</p>
                    <p>"The custom has ever prevailed to specially honor those in death who won
                        special honor by meritorious lives. The monuments reared to the memory of
                        departed worth bear ample testimony that our people have not been unmindful
                        of this custom. But where were such memorials ever erected for men whose
                        actions were infamous, and who perished in an ignoble cause? Who would
                        glorify the treason of Benedict Arnold with such monuments as have risen to
                        the memory of Washington? Who would dare to insult the loyal heart of this
                        nation by proposing to lay, side by side, in the same sepulchre, the body of
                        the assassin Booth and that of Abraham Lincoln? No loyal man would take the
                        heartless Wirz and the other demons that presided over the prison dens of
                        cruelty, starvation and death, and the executed conspirators against the
                        nation's illustrious chief, and deposit them in the same tomb with the
                        patriotic men who sacrificed their lives in battling for 'the right against
                        the wrong.' Yet it is proposed that the loyal States construct cemeteries
                        for their heroic dead, and then desecrate them by the burial therein of
                        those who prosecuted against the country a warfare which, for its diabolical
                        ferocity, is without a parallel in the history of civilization, and even to
                        erect monuments to their memory. Carry out this purpose, and what inducement
                        can be hereafter offered to the loyal citizen to fight against treason, when
                        he feels assured that should he fall in battle the traitor's grave will be
                        honored equally with his own?</p>
                    <p>"The cause of the Union was a holy one, while that which opposed it must have
                        been its converse. To one side alone the glory belongs. This was not a war
                        of nations, but of treason against loyalty. It was a contest of rebels who
                        would have drained the life's blood of the government which had sustained
                        and protected them, against its patriotic sons who fought to save it from
                        destruction. It was a war carried on by the defenders and promoters of
                        oppression, against the friends and lovers of liberty and their country's
                        integrity.</p>
                    <p>"While there is no reasonable objection to giving decent sepulture even to
                        the rebel dead, those who consider them deserving of honorable testimonials
                        may give them, it is our duty to render honor only to whom we believe honor
                        is due."</p>
                    <p>It is with grief,, Gov. Fenton, that I write this letter to you. The subject
                        is painful to me. But there sits on my hearth-stone, and there lies in my
                        village graveyard, and there broods in my heart a controling
                        reason why, since the appearance of your Antietam letter, I should regard
                        your entrance into a National Republican Convention, a candidate for office,
                        as an intrusion to which the survivors of the Union Army, and the relatives

<b>The Grant-Johnson Correspondence</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper discusses the verbal duel between General Grant and President
                    Johnson. The editors express the opinion that Johnson was the vile liar trying
                    to set up an innocent patriotic Grant. The editors predict that public opinion
                    would show its support for Grant in the upcoming elections.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The war of words between the President and Gen. Grant, when briefly stated,
                        consists of, "you lie!" and, "your'e another!" True! the President supports
                        his assertions by the testimony of five of his Cabinet ministers, but
                        unfortunately for him the great jury, before which the testimony is offered
                        regard it as the latest phase of official flunkeyism; as the utterances of
                        so many tutored parrots, save only, that of the Secretary of State; no one
                        will dispute its authorship, who is at all conversant with his diplomatic
                        way of expressing himself. The Secretary would have Mr. Johnson believe that
                        he confirms his statement of the conversation which occurred at the Cabinet
                        meeting on the 14th of January, but the President and the jury before
                        mentioned will find some difficulty in getting such confirmation out of his
                        lengthy and somewhat verbose communication. The people will very likely
                        throw out the somewhat unreliable evidence of the Secretaries and decide the
                        dispute by the affirmations of the parties themselves. In that case it will
                        not be difficult to foretell the verdict of the jury. On the one hand we
                        have the sophistry of a scheming, distrusted, Janus-faced Executive; on the
                        other the straight-forward, indignant declarations of a brave and able
                        soldier, conscious of his own integrity and that he had spoken nothing but
                        the truth.</p>
                    <p>The President was undoubtedly caught in a trap which he had arranged for
                        Grant, and the result of the unearthing of this correspondence cannot but be
                        damning to his Excellency? He has exposed a cloven foot which he meant Grant
                        should cover for him. Ever since his first apostacy he has defended his
                        measures upon the ground of the public good; he put himself in opposition to
                        the party that elected him, and by all the arts of the demagogue and
                        political trickster, endeavored to put in force a narrow-minded policy, and
                        as an excuse for his erratic course affirmed that it was pro bono publico. But the music of the syren can lure
                        no more, Our Ulysses, having conducted to successful issue a war mightier
                        than the Trojan--now by peaceful means defeats the machinations of a recent
                        Chief Magistrate, and opens to the light the real animus of the man. Mr. Johnson is not content to play a subordinate
                        part; like great Louis of France, he himself would be the State, and
                        therefore he continually grasps at the substance of the power whose shadow
                        he holds. The radical party has been accused of attempting to centralize
                        power in the direct representatives of the people. Suppose it has, it has
                        been driven to the step to prevent power from becoming centralized in an
                        ambitious and unscrupulous President, and is it not safer in the hands of
                        many than when entrusted to one?</p>
                    <p>The most important part of this correspondence is not the question whether
                        Grant or Johnson has told the truth, but the fact that the latter has
                        commanded his subordinates to resist the laws of Congress. It was with the
                        purpose to embarrass reconstruction that Stanton was suspended; Grant
                        understood this and tells the President squarely that it was to defeat this
                        purpose that he accepted the appointment of Secretary of War ad interim.
                        When the Senate failed to approve of the suspension of Stanton, the
                        President hoped to gain time to accomplish his ends by forcing him to have
                        recourse to the courts for his reinstatement, but Grant would not play stool
                        pigeon for him and the game was up. Chagrined at his defeat, and knowing
                        that in the eyes of the people his own infamy is established, he would fain
                        drag Grant down to his own level. How far he has succeeded will be known
                        next fall when the jury renders its verdict.</p>

<b>Alabama Reconstructed</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper praises the current reconstruction status of Alabama, citing it
                    as proof of the superior nature of Congressional Reconstruction. The new state
                    government was organized on the basis of equal enfranchisement among loyal
                    voters, thus lessening the need for military occupation. The editors assert that
                    all southern states should follow the path of Alabama to peacefully return to
                    the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>ALABAMA is the first of the seceded States to return to the union under the
                        Congressional plan of reconstruction.--Latest advices assure us that a
                        majority of the registered voters of the State have voted for the
                        ratification of the constitution, thus securing a civil government for
                        themselves, and for that government a place in the Union. Thus is being
                        vindicated the Congressional policy. It will be complete only when all the
                        rebellious States shall have been restored to their former relations. So
                        auspiciously has the great work commenced that we cannot think that its
                        final consummation will long be delayed.</p>
                    <p>The great purpose of the Republican party is and has been to reconstruct the
                        union upon the policy of equal rights, and its first triumph has been in
                        Alabama. The war left her without a civil government and without slaves.
                        Upon the national authority was thrown the responsibility of providing a
                        local State government for her people. It sought to do this with the consent
                        of all her people, except a few who were denied a voice in the matter by
                        reason of their prominence in rebellion and crime. It further proposed to so
                        reorganize her system that henceforth no person within her limits shall be
                        disfranchised on account of color. This was the Republican scheme of
                        reconstruction as regards Alabama, and still is as regards those States
                        which are still out of their practical relations with the Union. It intends,
                        as the case of Alabama will prove beyond all doubt, the restoration of all
                        States peaceably and securely, as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>This cannot be done by creating arbitrary political distinction among the
                        inhabitants of the State; least of all by giving political power to the most
                        disaffected class. No sane man supposes that there can be any effective
                        reconstruction until there is a majority of truly loyal voters in every
                        State, or a minority so large and important as to hold the majority in
                        check. There was but one way to have this number, and that was to
                        enfranchise the whole population, with certain conspicuous and notorious
                        exceptions. Such a system admitted the ignorant white and the ignorant
                        colored inhabitants to vote. It was a great pity that all were not
                        intelligent, and that the matter could not be delayed until all were
                        educated. But delay was indefinite military occupation, which must be
                        avoided if possible. Public impatience must also be considered. The law was
                        therefore passed, every honest man feeling that a man who could not read,
                        but who was instinctively loyal was a safer citizen than a man who could
                        read and was disaffected.</p>
                    <p>The result has proved the justice of this view, and Alabama under the
                        provisions of this law thoroughly reconstructed, and established upon a sure
                        republican foundation, resumes her place in the sisterhood of States. What
                        is true of Alabama will in brief time be true of all the other Southern
                        States. The Republican policy of reconstruction is that of practical common
                        sense, and it will therefore be maintained. Its strength and security do not
                        rest upon any partiality for the colored race, nor upon any
                            re-remarkable love of justice, nor upon any vindictive
                        feeling toward rebels, but upon precisely the instinct and determination
                        that carried the war to an unconditional triumph.</p>
