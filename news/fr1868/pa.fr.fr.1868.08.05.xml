                    <p>In another column will be found the proceedings of the Democratic County
                        Convention, which met in Chambersburg yesterday. It did its work
                        expeditiously, if not well, and whipped in the refractory members of the
                        party, as usual. The larger number of the candidates nominated have
                        travelled over the course before, some with good, some with indifferent
                        success. The names of Kimmell, Sharpe, Duncan, Winger and Stenger are
                        familiar to most of us, and even the candidates for the minor offices have
                        been willing to serve their fellow citizens in the past.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kimmell, if he is seeking compliments, is doubtless satisfied, since
                        the Convention declared him the choice of the county for Congress, and took
                        care to appoint Conferees who will see that he is not nominated.</p>
                    <p>Sharpe is presented by the county for the office of Additional Law Judge, and
                        will doubtless be nominated by the Democracy of the district. If he could
                        possibly be elected, he would make an able and upright Judge, but as his
                        chances for election are not quite so good as they were two years ago, when
                        his party gave him the empty and expensive nomination for Congress. We would
                        advise him not to be lifted up, but to "go slow," for on the question of
                        Judgeship the Democracy lack voters "first rate."</p>
                    <p>Duncan was a candidate for the Senate three years ago, and became so taken
                        with the idea that it has stuck to him ever since. He is not without hope,
                        as, if any part of the ticket is to be elected, it is that part to which he
                        has attached his fortunes. His nomination is assumed to be certain, as Adams
                        concedes the candidate to Franklin county.</p>
                    <p>Col. B. F. Winger is the choice of <sic>the the</sic> Convention for
                        Assembly, which is equivalent to his nomination. He represented this
                        district in the House last winter with as much credit as any Democrat,
                        especially such a new one, is likely to do, and would be quite willing to
                        serve it in the same capacity again. But we Republicans have concluded to
                        resume the place occupied by Winger, and he will therefore be retired. He
                        will withdraw from public life with our very kindest wishes for his comfort
                        and happiness, having been amply compensated by his friends for his apostacy
                        from the Republican party.</p>
                    <p>W. S. Stenger was again nominated, and for the third time, for the office of
                        District Attorney. His opponent, Welsh, has never had anything of his party,
                        is in moderate circumstances and was a soldier in the war of the Rebellion.
                        His right to the nomination was conceded on all hands, but Stenger was the
                        pet of Chambersburg, and of the lawyers, and the Democracy are not rewarding
                        soldiers now, except those who fought at the other end of the line; so Welsh
                        was executed and loaded on the tumbril with the corpses of six decapitated
                        candidates for Sheriff, and carted out of sight.</p>
                    <p>Taking the whole ticket together, it may be regarded as possessing more than
                        the average of merit and ability. It makes little odds though, as the second
                        Tuesday in October will dispose of the offices and candidates in a away that
                        will leave the Democratic ticket very much as these candidates, with a
                        single exception, left the war to suppress the rebellion, to take care of
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>We may have something to say of them hereafter.</p>
