<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>E. Cowan, ex-United States Senator, is scheduled to speak in Franklin
                    County at a Democratic Mass Meeting. The paper challenges Cowan to explain how

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper warns Republicans not to be taken in by the affability of
                    Democratic candidate Judge Kimmell, and criticizes him for making personal
                    appeals to Republican voters. "For shame, Judge. This is a fight for principle.
                    You denounce the whole policy of the Republican party in unmeasured terms, and
                    don't hesitate to misrepresent it fearfully. How can you with credit to yourself
                    ask Republicans to stultify themselves, to renounce their dearly beloved and
                    dearly bought principles, merely on the ground of personal friendship. Your
                    friendship, if real, should restrain you from asking them to unman themselves in
                    a matter of so much moment."<br>
