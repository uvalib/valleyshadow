                                             <p>
                                                  To the Voters of Franklin
                                                  County:
                                             </p>

                                             <p>We congratulate you upon the splendid result of the
                                                  late election. You have restored our County to
                                                  its proper position, and shown our opponents
                                                  that its voters have no sympathy with
                                                  disloyalty, and that "Green Spot," so often
                                                  trodden by rebel raiders and incendiaries, is
                                                  faithful to the party which wrested their arms
                                                  from the hands of traitors and preserved the
                                                  integrity and honor of the Republic.</p>

                                             <p>The friends of Seymour and Blair, who shamelessly
                                                  accepted their principles and men from
                                                  audacious leaders of the rebellion, wrought
                                                  with characteristic energy and corruption to
                                                  carry their ticket, and were buoyant with
                                                  assured success. They have exhausted
                                                  themselves in their efforts and now see the
                                                  hopelessness of their cause.</p>

                                             <p>Everywhere we behold the harbingers of our triumph
                                                  in November. We have driven the enemy all
                                                  along the line, from Maine to Nebraska. The
                                                  loyal people, who have repeatedly spoken with
                                                  emphasis against the common foe at the ballot
                                                  box, "now feel like ending the matter," and
                                                  winning a lasting peace by the final overthrow
                                                  of the disturbers of the national tranquility.
                                                  We exhort you to do your part in the good
                                                  work, Fall in and dive forward! Do not pause
                                                  to divide the spoils or wrangle over past
                                                  differences, but push on solidly until the
                                                  work is done. Let every voter be at the polls.
                                                  Swell the majority to its fullest reach. Do
                                                  not trust to the supineness and dismay of our
                                                  adversaries. If they have a hope of any kind,
                                                  it is that we may think the field won, and
                                                  [unclear] our vigilance. Disappoint such
                                                  expectations. Labor as earnestly as though
                                                  there were a doubt. We do not appeal to you to
                                                  achieve a partisan victory; the peace, good
                                                  feeling and honor of your country are at
                                                  stake.</p>

                                             <p>We point our Democratic fellow-citizens to the
                                                  unmistakable will of the American people, as
                                                  expressed in the recent elections, and we ask
                                                  them to respect and obey that will. We conjure
                                                  them to remember how implicitly they put their
                                                  trust in the great leader of our armies,
                                                  throughout the long and dark hours of the
                                                  rebellion, and how gloriously he justified
                                                  their trust; and believe that party prejudice
                                                  has not destroyed their assurance, that as he
                                                  has never yet failed us, that he never will
                                                  fail us; and we beseech them to join us in
                                                  November next, in doing honor to him who is
                                                  "first in war, first in peace, and first in
                                                  the hearts of his countrymen."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                                             <p>The Democratic National Committee have issued an
                                                  address to the conservative voters of the
                                                  United States. It was promulgated after the
                                                  result of the October election had been
                                                  clearly ascertained, and strange to say, or
                                                  perhaps naturally enough in view of the
                                                  history of the party, it failed to say one
                                                  word in relation to it. No doubt Mr. Belmont
                                                  could see little enough, from his lookout in
                                                  New York, to bring comfort to the Democratic
                                                  masses if he directed their attention to the
                                                  candidates whom the leaders had imposed upon
                                                  them, and, we fear, still less to encourage
                                                  the candidates themselves by a straitforward,
                                                  candid statement of the feelings of the masses
                                                  toward them. On the whole, then, he did the
                                                  only thing that was left him to do, assuming
                                                  that an address had to be issued. He said
                                                  nothing, or as nearly nothing as it was
                                                  possible. And with one or two exceptions what
                                                  he failed to say is the most significant
                                                  circumstances of the whole.</p>

                                             <p>After devoting one-half of the address to the most
                                                  glittering nothings he comes a little nearer
                                                  home in the following paragraph:</p>

                                             <p>Fellow Democrats, you are fighting for a good and
                                                  righteous cause. You have for your leader a
                                                  tried statesman; a patriot who stood by the
                                                  Union in its darkest hour; a man equally
                                                  beloved for the purity of his private
                                                  character as honored for his public virtues.</p>

                                             <p>This evidently refers to one of the candidates,
                                                  either Seymour or Blair, but which one the
                                                  reader is unable to discern. A statesman is a
                                                  man eminent for political abilities; a tried
                                                  statesman, one who has had the opportunity,
                                                  and whose political ability has stood the test
                                                  of trial. This cannot mean Seymour, for he has
                                                  never participated in national affairs at all.
                                                  He has not been tried in statesmanship, and if
                                                  his declarations should be allowed to make up
                                                  one judgment in the matter, they would work
                                                  against him. For example, we recollect two of
                                                  his most famous ones. At the beginning of the
                                                  rebellion he said that "successful coercion by
                                                  the government was no less revolutionary than
                                                  successful secession;" and about the same
                                                  time, that "the Montgomery constitution was
                                                  better than the constitution of the United
                                                  States, and the free States ought to adopt
                                                  it." A compliance with the first sentiment
                                                  would have deprived us of all government, and
                                                  the adoption of the second would have forever
                                                  fastened slavery upon the free States as well
                                                  as the slave States. These, then, can hardly
                                                  be taken as the sentiments of a statesman.</p>

                                             <p>If the first clause of this statement is untrue, is
                                                  the second worthy of more credit? "A patriot
                                                  who stood by the Union in its darkest hour."
                                                  The above declarations we have already shown
                                                  to be unstatesmanlike, are they not as well
                                                  unpatriotic and disloyal? A patriot is one who
                                                  loves his country, and zealously supports and
                                                  defends it and its interests. But Horatio
                                                  Seymour did not defend his country and its
                                                  interests. On the contrary, he said that his
                                                  government has no right to put down an unholy
                                                  rebellion, and expressed his preference for
                                                  the rebel constitution. We all know that
                                                  further on in the war he lent aid and comfort
                                                  to the rebellion by encouraging disloyal men
                                                  to resist the draft when he was Governor of
                                                  the State of New York, and caused thereby, in
                                                  addition to strengthening the enemy, the
                                                  sacrifice of hundreds of innocent lives, and
                                                  the destruction of much valuable property. It
                                                  is not true, then, that he is "a patriot who
                                                  stood by his country in its darkest hour."</p>

                                             <p>And lastly he is "a man equally beloved for the
                                                  purity of his private character as honored for
                                                  his public virtues." If he is honored for his
                                                  public virtues only in the degree which, as we
                                                  have already shown, he deserves, we have no
                                                  reason to fear that the respect for his
                                                  private character will be such as to spoil him
                                                  with vanity. But on this subject we forbear.</p>

                                             <p>Perhaps, however, as Mr. August Belmont evidently
                                                  has turned the cold shoulder to one of the
                                                  Democratic candidates, and cannot by his
                                                  description mean Mr. Seymour, he may have
                                                  intended to describe Frank Blair in these
                                                  terms. Frank managed to spend some years in
                                                  Congress as a Radical Representative from
                                                  Missouri, mainly in advocating the principles
                                                  which the Republican party support today. At
                                                  the close of the war he allied himself to the
                                                  rebel party and since then has not been
                                                  surpassed in denunciation of his principles
                                                  even by Wade Hampton and Butcher Forrest.
                                                  Indeed, in the matter wherein he outstripped
                                                  them, the Broadhead letter, he so won the
                                                  hearts of the rebels, both North and South,
                                                  that they vociferously nominated him for the
                                                  Vice Presidency. Does he fill the measure of a
                                                  statesman? Assuredly not.</p>

                                             <p>But this, they say, must certainly mean Blair, "a
                                                  patriot who stood by the Union in its darkest
                                                  hour." Whether a patriot or not so he did, and
                                                  he has repented it in sackcloth and ashes ever
                                                  since, if one may judge from his almost
                                                  infernal villainy and his fondness for
                                                  traitors. But a patriot loves his country and
                                                  zealously supports and defends its interests.
                                                  Mr. Blair is a dangerous demagogue in favor of
                                                  revolution and the overthrow of the
                                                  constitution and the restoration of rebels to
                                                  power. Such a man cannot be a patriot. It
                                                  cannot mean Frank Blair.</p>

                                             <p>How does the last clause fit "one of the Blairs"
                                                  moral character. "A man equally beloved for
                                                  the purity of his private character as honored
                                                  for his public virtues."</p>

                                             <p>If, as the departed Artemus Ward used to say, and
                                                  above is a "goak," it means Blair exactly, if
                                                  not it don't. We rather think it don't. But if
                                                  not why is he ignored in the address? Is he
                                                  not the Democratic candidate for the Vice
                                                  Presidency? Did they not nominate him
                                                  unanimously amid cheers and rebel yells? Did
                                                  not that pink of chivalry, Wade Hampton,
                                                  second his nomination in gushing terms? and
                                                  did not the courtly and refined Forrest stop
                                                  picking his teeth with a bowie knife while he
                                                  made a congratulatory speech? Then why is
                                                  Blair made the raw head and bloody bones of
                                                  the party? Why is he treated thusly? Alas, Mr.
                                                  Blair, your Broadhead letter was a boomerang,
                                                  more fatal to yourself in your inexperienced
                                                  hands than to your enemies. It both nominated
                                                  you and defeated you. The October elections
                                                  didn't kill you, they only gave notice of your
                                                  demise. Mr. Belmont simply accepted notice and
                                                  therefore in his address he didn't notice you.
                                                  We ask our readers isn't what this address
                                                  fails to say very significant?</p>

                                             <p>But it contains one more idea, and only one. After
                                                  arraigning the Republican Congress for their
                                                  work of the past three years, it says:</p>

                                             <p>Against these men and all their despotic purposes,
                                                  which Gen. Grant would be as powerless to
                                                  hinder as he whom they elected four years ago
                                                  has been: against these men, their crimes in
                                                  the past, their nefarious designs in the
                                                  future, you are soon to make one final and
                                                  determined onslaught.</p>

                                             <p>We may be very stupid, but we fail utterly to see
                                                  what Horatio Seymour, in the Presidential
                                                  chair, would be able to hinder against a
                                                  Republican House and Senate, if, as the
                                                  address says, even Gen. Grant would be
                                                  powerless to do so. If it were possible to
                                                  elect Seymour, the only hope of the loyal
                                                  people against the overthrow of their
                                                  liberties would be in the loyal Congress,
                                                  which is already assured. With such a Congress
                                                  Seymour would have neither power nor
                                                  influence, while the exalted patriotism,
                                                  ability and honesty of Gen. Grant would make
                                                  his influence almost unlimited with the same
                                                  body. On the showing of the address itself, it
                                                  would be worse than folly to elect Horatio
                                                  Seymour to the Presidency, and with this and
                                                  its other silly capers we leave it.</p>

                                             <p>An impromptu meeting held in Mercersburg, on
                                                  Saturday evening, by the Republicans, was
                                                  addressed by Capt. McMahon, of New York, and
                                                  Lieut. Wilson, of Iowa. The meeting was large
                                                  and enthusiastic, the speeches eloquent and
                                                  impressive. Capt. M'Mahon is an Irishman who
                                                  lost a leg in the service of his adopted
                                                  country, and has all the fervor and enthusiasm
                                                  of his people. Lieut. Wilson, now of Iowa, was
                                                  born in Mercersburg, from which his father
                                                  removed when he was a boy. Many of the old
                                                  residents of the place remembered him, and
                                                  gave him a hearty welcome. Mercersburg will
                                                  make good the majority she gave Lincoln on
                                                  next Tuesday.</p>

                                             <p>The grand parade of the citizens of Waynesboro, on
                                                  Saturday night, showed that they have not been
                                                  lulled into indifference by the result of the
                                                  late elections. The procession was very large,
                                                  and might have been twice as large if they
                                                  could have secured lamps. An eloquent address
                                                  was delivered by J. Matthews, Esq., of
                                                  Hagerstown, who argued ably and at
                                                  considerable length the issues of the day. Two
                                                  bands were in attendance, and added to the
                                                  pleasures of the evening.</p>

                                             <p>If a large and respectable portion of the Republican
                                                  party were holding meetings in favor of
                                                  Seymour and Blair; if many of the best
                                                  Republican journals were clamoring for the
                                                  withdrawal of their candidates; if their
                                                  candidates for the Presidency were daily
                                                  making speeches begging the people to elect
                                                  him President, it would not be putting too
                                                  fine a point on it to say that in such a
                                                  muddle they were doomed to humiliating defeat.</p>

                                             <p>Fortunately such is not the condition of the
                                                  Republican party. Its members are united,
                                                  harmonious, buoyant and confident, inspired by
                                                  the late victories and only waiting for the
                                                  3rd of November to close out the Copperhead
                                                  party along with the political campaign. Its
                                                  journals press on the column vigorously, its
                                                  loyal masses organize solidly and work
                                                  earnestly for the election of their
                                                  standard-bearers and the triumph of their
                                                  principles. Its candidate, the unanimous
                                                  choice of the loyal people, calmly and
                                                  serenely awaits their verdict at the polls,
                                                  well satisfied that the best interests of the
                                                  country are safe in their hands.</p>

                                             <p>On the contrary it is literally and truly the
                                                  condition of the Democracy. Within a week of
                                                  the election they find the party disheartened
                                                  and discouraged with its candidates, and the
                                                  candidates afraid of each other. In New York
                                                  the extraordinary spectacle of Democrats
                                                  holding Grant meetings is seen. Large bodies
                                                  of the best and the most influential men of
                                                  that party representing much of its wealth,
                                                  ability and patriotism, meet and urge upon the
                                                  people the election of Grant as the only hope
                                                  of the country. The World, the organ of the Tammany ring,
                                                  demands the withdrawal of the candidates, and
                                                  it is echoed throughout the whole country.
                                                  Blair, the candidate for the Vice Presidency,
                                                  is openly repudiated, and the hopeless
                                                  condition of the party since the October
                                                  elections is cruelly charged to him. Never was
                                                  anything more unfair than this. He has not
                                                  deceived them in any particular, and if the
                                                  people had declared in favor of the
                                                  revolutionary doctrines adopted in the New
                                                  York Convention, no man would be so warmly
                                                  supported by them as this same Frank Blair. As
                                                  it has turned out, however, Blair is not the
                                                  man they want. Anybody else would suit them
                                                  better. But they can't get rid of him. He
                                                  won't be suppressed. They were so highly
                                                  delighted with the Broadhead letter, and
                                                  commended it so warmly, that he has been
                                                  traveling through the country giving them
                                                  doses of the same kind of medicine ever since
                                                  the convention. Though they are nauseated and
                                                  sick, and beg him for mercy's sake to abstain,
                                                  he still persists in administering it.</p>

                                             <p>In despair Seymour is driven from his retreat, is
                                                  forced to forgo his bucolic delights, and the
                                                  contemplation of his beloved watermelons, and
                                                  plunge himself into the whelming tide of
                                                  politics, if perchance he may yet rescue the
                                                  Democratic party from the blunders into which
                                                  Blair and the New York convention have carried
                                                  it. With ill concealed reluctance he betakes
                                                  himself to the hopeless task, beckoned on by
                                                  the bloody hand of the master spirit of
                                                  treason at Washington. He goes to undo what
                                                  Blair has done, to put in a mild protest
                                                  against Blair's revolutionary letter and
                                                  speeches. It is too late. Seymour's milk and
                                                  water speeches can't explain away the force of
                                                  these, nor the platform. They have already
                                                  been explained too often by Wade Hampton, and
                                                  Vance and Wise and Forrest, and are fully
                                                  understood both North and South. The October
                                                  elections prove that in the one, and the
                                                  Camilla and Louisiana slaughters in the other.
                                                  They mean virtual reenslavement of the blacks,
                                                  and the restoration of the rebels to power.</p>

                                             <p>In the meantime the people have determined to settle
                                                  these vexed questions in their own way. They
                                                  will elect Grant and have peace. The White
                                                  House will soon be delivered of the chief
                                                  instigator of murder and treason. Grant will
                                                  take his place, murder and rebellion will be
                                                  at an end, the laws will be respected and we
                                                  will have Peace.</p>

                                             <p>Is this so? Is it not rather the effect of the late
                                                  victory to inspire us with determination and

                                                  the last fight, its squadrons broken, even its
                                                  leaders fearfully demoralized, with no
                                                  possible hope of concentrating their shattered
                                                  divisions, and closing up the breaches, it
                                                  nervously counts the brief days and hours
                                                  which remain before its final dissolution, and
                                                  yet must keep up the semblance of hope.</p>

                                                  oppression, wrong and slavery, and regards the
                                                  late victory only as the last pledge of the

                                                  to you again that because the rebels burned
                                                  Chambersburg you should vote to put the rebels
                                                  into power. That was a bold trick, but
                                                  desperate circumstances make bad men and
                                                  cowards very bold. We would not be surprised
                                                  if they went a step farther now, and told you
                                                  that because they murdered your fathers and

                                             <p>Remember, their lies do not change their

                                                  a loyal man. The former is the work of the
                                                  Southern rebels and the later their friend and
                                                  confederate. They do not make the man who

                                                  revolutionary than secession, the man who

                                                  his friends, a loyal man. Blair is just as bad
                                                  and as dangerous as he represented himself to
                                                  be in his Broadhead letter, and Seymour is
                                                  just as time serving and as cowardly and as
                                                  treasonable as he was during the war, when he
                                                  opposed it with all the courage he could
                                                  muster. Grant is the only man whom the people

                                                  of his country at Gettysburg, delivered an

                                                  fought. His speech was full of sound reasoning
                                                  and did great good. P. Hamman, Esq., followed

                                                  this made known, than Mr. Cessna was called
                                                  out and given to understand that he must make
                                                  a speech. He complied with the request of his
                                                  friends, who returned to the Hall. In a few

                                                  those who desired to hear him. Mr. Cessna was
                                                  greeted with frequent rounds of applause, and
                                                  when he had concluded every man present felt
                                                  that his district would be represented in the
                                                  next Congress by an able and efficient
                                                  Representative, who would reflect credit on
