                <summary>The paper denounces those who put personal ambition and grudges ahead of
                    party unity. The editors celebrate their own even-handedness in helping the
                    Republican Party achieve victory.</summary>

                <summary>The paper argues that Pennsylvania should be represented in Grant's
                    cabinet. The editors dismiss those who call for cabinet members who are "above
                    politics" as those who "opposed Grant's election." Anyone who was neutral during
                    the war is not fit to serve: "It was the pure and simple question of government
                    or no government, and men were necessarily arrayed on one side or the other. The
                    cause of universal liberty and equal rights triumphed" and Grant should choose
                    those who represent those principles.</summary>

                <summary>The paper urges the new Republican-controlled legislature to pass a
                    registry law designed to prevent election fraud. The editors hold that such a
                    law is not partisan and would help Republicans and Democrats alike. The article
                    also advocates tougher naturalization laws, arguing that many foreigners "cannot
                    possibly understand anything about the genius and spirit of our institutions."</summary>

                <head>The illumination on Tuesday evening</head>
                <origin/>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The illumination on Tuesday evening, the 10th inst., was one of the grandest
                        sights that has been witnessed in Chambersburg for a long time. Early in the
                        evening the "Boys in Blue" and Grant and Colfax Club lighted their rooms and
                        transparencies, but the dwelling houses were not illuminated until about
                        7:30. The procession was formed with the right resting on Market street.
                        Col. Elder was Marshal of the occasion, and had as assistants Capt. John
                        Doebler and Mr. Samuel F. Greenawalt. The "Boys in Blue," Grant and Colfax
                        Club and South Ward Invincibles were out in full force. Hagerstown sent to
                        our aid a large delegation of loyal men. They were welcomed with cheers as
                        they always will be by their brothers in Chambersburg, who are working with
                        them in the same good cause.</p>
                    <p>One of the most amusing sights in the procession was the "carpet-baggers,"
                        numbering some twenty-six persons, with a large banner in front, on which
                        was inscribed "Wm. Penn and Christopher Columbus were carpet-baggers." The
                        Salt River ticket wagon, with the bells that tolled the knell of dying
                        Democracy, was another feature that attracted the attention of everybody.
                        The procession marched through our principal streets. In the line of the
                        procession there were four bands of music--Hagerstown, Greencastle,
                        Chambersburg Silver Cornet and Citizens--and the "Boys in Blue" Drum Corps.
                        Our citizens seemed to have spared neither trouble nor expense in
                        beautifying their houses with lights, mottoes, transparencies and other
                        signs of sympathy with the great object of the evening, as circumstances or
                        taste might dictate. They seemed determined to show their great satisfaction
                        at the election of Grant and Colfax and the success of Republican
                        principles. We can truly say that our town has never before been so
                        illuminated on any occasion. The ram interfered somewhat with the order of
                        marching, but the body did not cease moving until after 9 o'clock, when it
                        was make known that Hon. John Cessna and Hon. A.K. M'Clure were in town.
                        They were serenaded at the National Hotel, and invited to speak from the
                        Court House steps. Both delivered appropriate addresses, which were received
                        with frequent applause. They were followed by Judge Armour in an effective
                        address. We must not forget to mention that the late Democratic headquarters
                        were brightly lighted up, and helped to do honor to the occasion. Nothing
                        occurred to mar the pleasures of the evening. The work is now done and every
                        one feels glad that it is as it is.</p>

                <summary>Several different groups, led by the "Boys in Blue", marched through
                    Chambersburg celebrating the recent Republican electoral triumphs. John Cessna,
                    A.K. M'Clure, and other Republican spokesmen gave speeches praising the voters'
                    decision.</summary>

                    <p>The last Republican County Convention passed the following resolution,
                        establishing a basis of representation for future conventions:</p>
                    <lb/>

                    <p>"<emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the County Convention shall be
                        composed as follows: each district shall be entitled to three delegates, and
                        one additional delegate for each one hundred Republican votes, or fractional
                        part of one hundred votes exceeding fifty, and that the vote given at the
                        Presidential election of 1868 shall be the basis of representation."</p>
                    <lb/>

                    <p>The following table gives the Republican vote of the several districts, and
                        the number of delegates each is entitled to, with the number of delegates
                        from each district under the old basis.--The total number of votes in a full
                        Convention will be 116, an increase of 29 over the old basis:</p>
