<b>Border Damages</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports on the progress of border compensation. Not much has been
                    done and the editor urges the citizens of the border counties to ask the
                    legislature to take the issue more seriously.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As the time appointed for the meeting of the Legislature approaches, the
                        subject of border damages again becomes one of interest and discussion.
                        Every session since these damages were sustained has an effort been made,
                        always more or less feebly, to secure compensation to those of the border
                        counties who suffered material loss from the armies during the rebellion. It
                        has met with no further success than the appointment of a commission to
                        ascertain and adjudicate the losses with a view to their payment by the
                        General Government at some future day.--Even this much was obtained only
                        last winter, after being at least twice refused by former Legislatures.</p>
                    <p>The losses of the border are of three kinds, those inflicted by the rebels,
                        those sustained by the citizens on account of property taken or destroyed by
                        troops in the United States service, and those losses of property taken by
                        or given to our State troops during the war. Neither of these has been paid;
                        and hitherto our law makers have managed to find more genial, perhaps more
                        profitable, occupation than in rendering justice to a worthy but
                        impoverished and bankrupt portion of the citizens of the State. While we do
                        not believe that anything will come of the commission of last winter so far
                        as securing compensation from the General Government, it is at least an
                        entering wedge, inasmuch as it is an admission that these losses should be
                        paid.</p>
                    <p>We confess that we fail to see how on principles of equity and justice the
                        State can refuse to make compensation to that portion of her citizens whose
                        loss was sustained in the interest of all, and, indeed, whose loss was the
                        price paid for the safety of the property of the rest of her citizens. While
                        the rebels were devastating the border counties, burning, destroying and
                        plundering everywhere, their invading steps were arrested and they were
                        driven back beyond the limits of the State. But for the time thus consumed
                        they could have penetrated beyond the Susquehanna, and instead of counting
                        the loses by a few millions, they would have been counted by
                        hundreds of millions. The border counties did not stint in their men and
                        means for the general defence, and if much the largest part of her able
                        bodied men had not been in the service of the country they could have done
                        much towards defending themselves against the invaders. It has been alleged
                        that the border counties must look to the General Government for
                        compensation, because these losses were sustained in a rebellion against the
                        General Government and the forces of the State were employed in its defense.
                        This is true but it is no less true that the State was as vitally concerned
                        in the success of the union arms as the General Government, and far more in
                        the protection and security of her own citizens.</p>
                    <p>There is no question, that these claims should be paid, and that too by the
                        State. She is an empire in herself, with inexhaustible resources, and making
                        splendid progress in wealth and power. Even the rebellion, while it
                        sacrificed the best lives and impoverished many, only gave additional
                        impetus to her development, besides bringing wealth to the doors of numbers
                        of the citizens. Those whose names and property the rebellion consumed as by
                        fire were no less loyal nor less worthy her protection, and failing in that,
                        her aid and assistance than the more fortunate, and it is as humiliating as
                        unjust that their petitions for relief should be heard with indifference and
                        neglect.</p>
                    <p>The Commission which has during the summer ascertained the losses resulting
                        from the war to the border counties can report, as never has been done
                        before, with reasonable certainty both their extent and kind. Those citizens
                        whose property went to supply our own troops, whether in the service of the
                        State or the General Government, should be repaid without unreasonable
                        delay, to the full extent of their loss, not as a gift or a charity, but as
                        their just due. Having taken it, the State is as much bound to pay for it as
                        if it had first purchased the same. Now is the time for the people of the
                        border counties to urge upon those whom they have elected to the legislature
                        to make an effort to secure compensation for their losses. It is their right
                        and they can get it if they persist. If they themselves neglect to do so we
                        know of none who will take up the work for them.</p>
