<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper urges Republicans to take united action in the coming campaign.
                    The editors blame previous defeats upon low turnout and low enthusiasm, and wish
                    to prevent a similar result.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To the Republicans of Franklin county, we say don't neglect to attend the
                        delegate meetings on Saturday next. A year ago the county was lost to us,
                        not for lack of loyal voters, but because the Democracy were united and on
                        the alert, while we were dissatisfied and divided. Seven hundred Republican
                        voters remained away from the polls on the day of election, while but two
                        hundred of the Democracy failed to respond.</p>
                    <p>It is in our power, as well as it is our bounden duty, to wipe out this
                        stigma of defeat. We can do it by beginning right and in earnest, just where
                        we began wrong and foolishly then.</p>
                    <p>There is important work to be performed on Saturdap next. A
                        failure to elect our ticket in the coming election will put the power of the
                        county in the hands of the Democracy. Let loyal men not forget this fact
                        when the time to elect delegates arrives. The delegates sent to the
                        Convention to make our county ticket, and to assist in the formation of
                        Legislative, Senatorial, Judicial and Congressional tickets, should be
                        elected by a majority of the Republican voters of their respective wards and
                        townships, and should come here prepared to represent understandingly the
                        wishes of those who sent them, on every question that will legitimately come
                        before that body. If this be done, we will have started right in the
                        campaign, and will nominate a ticket that will enlist the earnest and united
                        labor of the whole party to secure its election.</p>
                    <p>Do not forget that no one has a right to demand of the people a nomination
                        for any office at their disposal, wither for preeminent services or personal
                        fitness. They are themselves the best judges of both, and should never
                        surrender their inalienable right to select their own servants. Among the
                        duties of the delegates when they met in Convention, will be to determine
                        either for or against the Crawford county System of nominating candidates.
                        The county committee has so instructed, and it would be well if this
                        question were finally settled for the future, especially as our present
                        system is regarded by many as imperfect. The verdict of a county convention
                        for either the one or the other will give the force of authority for
                        whichever method it approves.</p>

<b>The Democratic Party and Repudiation</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper denounces Democratic proposals for repudiation of the national
                    debt. The editors charge that the Democratic Party has fallen away from its
                    original principles that championed the rights of the common man.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The man who will write the history of the past few years, will doubtless
                        express his wonder at the fatuity of the Democratic party. Founded by men
                        who were both wise and good, and intended to subserve the interests of the
                        many as opposed to the few, it started upon its career when the course
                        seemed unobstructed and every augury auspicious. The expansion of our
                        domain, however, soon gave rise to questions of policy connected with the
                        territory newly acquired. The slaveholders, with the insolence that has
                        always characterized oppressors, demanded one policy, whilst the friends of
                        humanity and civilization demanded another. At this point the Democratic
                        party made that notable departure from the purposes of its founders, and
                        allied itself to the interests of a class, whilst their opponents, standing
                        upon the immutable rock of the equal rights of all God's creatures, bid
                        defiance and calmly awaited the outset. It came; the shock was soon over;
                        and all around was seen lying the wreck of the consolidated forces of an
                        insolent despotism and a temporizing political organization.</p>
                    <p>Not content with their signal chastisement at the polls, the forces of
                        despotism at the South invited the nation to war. There was no alternative
                        but to accept the wager tendered. To refuse it was to die. The history of
                        the conflict is too recent to require rehearsing, and it were well for the
                        Democratic party could its utterances and its actions be expunged from the
                        record of the times. The men of the present will not fail to remember, and
                        the men of the future will have the opportunity to read, how it clamored for
                        compromise when the nation was being spit upon; how it pronounced the war a
                        failure when our armies were reaching forth to grasp dearly earned
                        victories, and how it discouraged enlistments and refused supplies in the
                        very agony of the strife. But in this, as in most of its course since it
                        allied itself to the cause of oppression, it was consistent. It could not
                        consort with and love the nation's enemies without hating the nation itself.</p>
                    <p>Beaten in a great political contest, vanquished in an appeal to arms, it
                        might have been expected that the Northern half of this unnatural alliance
                        would seek to dissever itself from the dead body to which it had been
                        united, but instead it bewails its foster child now no more and strikes
                        about with the wild malignity of deep disappointment. Practically it insists
                        that there has been no war. It would cover our Southern countrymen, before
                        their fierce anger has abated, with the mantle of national forgiveness, and
                        exact no guarantees in the interest of freedom, so as to prevent a
                        recurrence of the fearful strife through which it was established. It would
                        make it possible to pay the debt incurred in warring upon the nation, whilst
                        it would throw every obstacle in the way of the honest fulfillment of the
                        national monetary obligations.</p>
                    <p>The questions of finance and reconstruction are all that enter into the
                        campaign of the present year. Indeed, in view of the fact that
                        reconstruction under the Congressional plan, is now an accomplished fact
                        over almost the whole South, unless the Democrats design if successful to
                        tear up the fabric of government established against their bitterest
                        opposition, and plunge the country again into anarchy and strife, the
                        financial question is the main one entering into the canvass of 1868.</p>
                    <p>The position of the Democrats is that where the obligations of the Government
                        do not expressly state upon their face, or the law under which they were
                        issued does not provide, that they shall be paid in coin, they ought, in
                        right and justice, be paid in the lawful money of the United States. Such
                        are the words of their platform. This is the scheme of repudiation to which
                        the country is invited. It had its origin in the brain of George H.
                        Pendleton, of Ohio, who had the Presidency in his eye at the time he
                        published his views. He foresaw that with the unpatriotic, the unscrupulous,
                        the unthinking and the debased, it would make a popalar rallying
                        cry, and trusted that upon it he could become the nominee of his party and
                        afterwards the chief executive officer of the nation. But Pendleton is not
                        the first man who has made a miscalculation, and his failure to reach his
                        primary object is an earnest that his party will meet with no better
                        success.</p>
                    <p>That the Government have a contract with the creditors who hold its bonds to
                        pay them in the common, usual currency of the nation, which is gold and
                        silver, is almost too plain for argument. Since it has been a Government it
                        has paid its loans in nothing else, and even in the fall of 1862 when the
                        loan of 1842 amounting to $3,000,000 fell due, and after legal tender had
                        been issued, it was paid religiously notwithstanding the necessities of the
                        government were then great. Nothing was said in that loan about coin
                        payment, and an opportunity was offered to test the theory of payment in
                        paper. Pendleton sat in Congress then as he had the previous February and
                        offered no word of objection. He listened to the discussion upon the bill
                        providing for the first five-twenties, and although it was replete with
                        declarations that the bonds about to be issued were payable principal and
                        interest in coin and none seemed to take the opposite view he remained
                        silent.</p>
                    <p>The five-twenties were put upon the market. The agent of the government
                        announced that they were payable as has been stated. The language of the law
                        not expressly stating that they were payable in coin (and this peculiarity
                        is found in all previous laws relating to loans), Secretary Chase was
                        applied to for information and officially announced that they were payable
                        in coin, that such was the spirit and meaning of the law, and that such had
                        always been the practice of the department. Early in 1863 the ten-forties
                        were created by an act of Congress, and in this law it was expressly
                        provided that principal and interest were payable in coin. This was
                        inserted, doubtless, to guard against any possible attempt at repudiation.
                        At this time but about $25,000,000 of the $500,000,000 of five twenties
                        authorized by the act of February 25, 1862, had been issued. It was after
                        the ten-forties, made absolutely payable in gold, had been created, that the
                        people came forward and took up the whole remainder of five-twenties which
                        the repudiationists would now have us to believe were to be payable in
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party heard and saw all this. They saw the people, poor and
                        rich, low and high, come forward and put their money in this great fund for
                        the saving of the nation. They saw money flowing into our coffers from the
                        great European nations and our bonds sent in return. They saw our national
                        banks, insurance, savings and trust companies, and numberless private
                        trustees, invest their money similarly, and they uttered no warning cry.</p>
                    <p>Since that time Mr. Fessenden, as the chief officer of the Treasury, has
                        spoken, as also Mr. M'Cullough, who succeeded him. Both concur with Mr.
                        Chase. In the summer of 1864, Congress refused to incorporate the words
                        "payable in coin" into the bill creating the seven-thirties and additional
                        five-twenties, for the reason, as appears from the official record of the
                        debate on that occasion, that if the unnecessary practice were continued of
                        providing each loan bill, that the bonds to be issued were payable in gold,
                        an unjust discrimination might be made against the five-twenties of 1862.</p>
                    <p>The existence of our greenbacks is probably to be deplored, and it would be
                        better for every interest that we should resume the payment of specie as
                        soon as we can safely do so. Their issue, however, was a necessity, and in
                        the nature of an enforced loan. They must at some day be redeemed if we ever
                        expect to resume specie payment, or be made of equal value with specie.
                        Notwithstanding their peculiar hard money theories in years gone by, the
                        Democrats now propose that the government set its printing presses to work
                        and issue immediately five hundred millions of paper money to pay the five
                        hundred millions of five-twenties due now--at the option of the government,
                        and again in 1872 print eleven hundred millions additional of paper
                        currency, to pay the bonds then maturing. In other words, it is proposed to
                        pay the national creditors, whether foreign or domestic, rich or poor, in
                        promises to pay.</p>
                    <p>The distress and ruin that an inflation so enormous as this must occasion
                        will be terrible. Not only the wealthy classes and the holders of bonds will
                        suffer, but the humble poor man who had nothing but his prayers to give his
                        country and who is satisfied so that by his toil he may subsist, will be
                        deprived of all that makes his life tolerable. The Democratic party do not,
                        can not mean it. It is an electioneering cry. They will practice no such
                        cruelty. They will assign us no such portion among nations. They will not
                        bring down upon us the wrath of heaven by rascality so henious
                        and unconscionable.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. WALLACE, Chairman of the Democratic State Committee, in his address to
                        the Democracy says that "Pennsylvania owes Horatio Seymour a debt of
                        gratitude for his prompt aid, when her border was attacked."</p>
                    <p>This, if not contradicted by those whose unfortunate experience enables them
                        to know, would reasonably make Pennsylvanians feel kindly toward Governor
                        Seymour. The citizens of Chambersburg, and indeed of the whole county of
                        Franklin, have, however, not forgotten the great rebellion, nor the loss of
                        life and property incident to it. Three times they were overrun and
                        plundered, their fields laid waste, their stocks and goods stolen and burned
                        by the rebels, and only once by the New York Militia. Yet but for the last
                        visit of the rebels, when they left our town in ashes, we fared quite as
                        well if not better at their hands than at the hands of Governor Seymour's
                        New York bummers. If the two regiments sent to Chambersburg were not a
                        raiding party of Seymour's New York City friends, who held that city for
                        three days in 1863, they acted so much like them as to deceive every one
                        here into that belief. The rights of citizenship and private property were
                        perhaps as much respected by them as by the rebels themselves, certainly not
                        more and as for defending the border from the enemy, it was farthest from
                        their thoughts. The regiments sent here arrived on Sunday, at a time when
                        rumors were thick that the rebel army was crossing at Williamsport. After
                        being bountifully fed by the citizens, they spent the rest of the day in
                        disorderly and riotous conduct through the town, and at evening marched two
                        miles South to watch the enemy. Though the enemy did not reach Chambersburg
                        until days afterwards, the patriotic New Yorkers skedaddled during the
                        night, leaving their camp equipage, supplies and all, seized the cars at the
                        depot, and the next morning formed their line at Carlisle, with their faces
                        toward New York.</p>
                    <p>Our citizens gathered up their tents and baggage and returned them, with
                        gratitude it is true, not for their aid, but that they had not remained with
                        us longer.</p>
                    <p>In November Franklin county will cancel the debt of
                            gratitude she owes to the Democratic and Secession candidate for

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper referees the ongoing debate between "Franklin" and "Republican."
                    The editors chastise "Franklin" for attacking Col. Wiestling's military record
                    by asserting it consisted only in organizing drafted men. "The military service
                    of Col. Wiestling is no better or worse because the regiment he commanded in the
                    field was a drafted one. It was composed of first-rate men, many of them from
                    our own county, who would have done their duty any where, and who were proud of
                    their commanding officer.<br>
