<b>The President's Message</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor mocks President Johnson's last message to Congress and is
                    thankful it is the last one from him. He especially criticized Johnson's
                    negative comments on Reconstruction policies and proposals for repudiation of
                    the debt.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To-day a week ago President Johnson submitted his annual message to Congress.
                        Being the last time he had the legal right to bore Congress and insult the
                        people his message was looked for with even more than ordinary curiosity. Of
                        course when he becomes, as he soon will, a private citizen, no one will care
                        to listen to what Johnson, the tailor, or even the accidental ex-President,
                        may have to say on the affairs of the Union. But the people repudiated him
                        at the polls last fall, as they did in 1866, and endorsed the action of
                        Congress in every measure wherein Congress had found itself compelled to
                        differ from him. And it is barely probable, thought some, that in his last
                        message the President may abstain from his disgusting abuse of Congress and
                        stop his blind appeals to the people who have condemned him and all his
                        official acts, every time he has appealed from Congress to the polls. Hence
                        the desire to see what he had to say.</p>
                    <p>Except in the matter of Reconstruction, the message covers the same ground of
                        all former Presidential productions written in peace times. The finances our
                        foreign relations, Indian affairs and other matters receive their share of
                        consideration. But it is in the discussion of Reconstruction by Congress and
                        in the view taken of the financial field, that he out Johnson's Johnson. In
                        these he exceeds the expectations of even the most sanguine, and he embraces
                        the opportunity afforded by the message to scold Congress, and through them
                        the people, for disposing of "My Policy" and electing Grant.</p>
                    <p>The inmate of a lunatic asylum explained his confinement by saying that there
                        was a slight difference of opinion between his neighbors and himself, the
                        former all believing him insane while he was fully satisfied that the whole
                        community was crazy except himself. The majority carried, as in most cases
                        it does, and he found himself in confinement though still unconvinced. This
                        is precisely the relation of Johnson and the people. In spite of themselves
                        he means to warn them against their mad freaks, as he believes them, no
                        matter how often they refuse to hearken. He begins by referring to his duty
                        to call attention to the state of the Union, and its continued disorganized
                        condition under the various laws which have been passed upon the subject of
                        reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>As more than half of the reconstructed States, and nearly all those that were
                        not included in its provisions, have approved Congressional reconstruction,
                        this declaration is refreshing at least, especially as the only opposition
                        to it came from active rebels, encouraged and aided by the administration.
                        Referring to unjust and arbitrary legislation and the unrelenting decrees of
                        despotic rulers as the greatest wrongs that can be inflicted upon a people,
                        he says that "the legislator and ruler who has the wisdom and magnanimity to
                        retrace his steps, when convinced of error, will sooner or later be rewarded
                        with the respect and gratitude of an intelligent people." This is well said,
                        and prepares one to expect that at last he has learned to submit to, if not
                        to respect, the will of the people. But it is a mistaken expectation. He
                        hastens to add that our own history, during the last three years, gives
                        abundant proof that all our domestic trouble is directly traceable to
                        violations of the organic act and excessive legislation. Here, of course,
                        the people, who think that our domestic trouble is due to slavery and the
                        rebellion are, from Johnson's stand point, all crazy, and he alone is sane.
                        They rejected such false and contemptible sentiments in the most decided
                        manner before this his last utterance of them, and yet, in the narrowness of
                        his blind and bigoted soul, he forgets the rebellion and the causes which
                        led to it, his own open sympathy with its leaders during the last three
                        years, his encouragement of all the riots and lawlessness and bloodshed
                        which have almost made the South a waste his manifest desire to instigate a
                        war of races between the whites and blacks of the South, and tells Congress
                        that the Reconstruction measures have failed, and "that legislation which
                        has produced such fearful consequences should be abrogated."</p>
                    <p>His message suggests one satisfactory emotion to all loyal hearts, at least,
                        that of unalloyed thankfulness that this is the last of Johnson.</p>
                    <p>In his discussion of the finances of the country is an elaborate statement
                        showing the relative growth of the yearly expenditures of the Government
                        since it began with the increase of population. The result shows that the
                        expenditures have incresed in a much greater ratio than has the
                        population, and that at the same relative rate it will eventually lead to
                        bankruptcy. He does not make any allowance however for the interest on the
                        war debt, and the necessary expenditure resulting from the war, independent
                        of the war debt itself, which may not be wholly obviated for several years.
                        Nor does he deem it worth the while to mention that the yearly expenditures
                        of the Government, independent of those things made necessary by the war, is
                        less to-day than it was during Buchannan's administration. It might be
                        justly added, too, that wherein he charges Congress with extravagance, he
                        does not see fit to tell that the appropriations asked by the different
                        departments of his administration have been cut down in most cases nearly
                        one-half.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of the payment of the public debt the President has an idea
                        both startling and original. It is well that it comes from the expiring
                        administration and not from the new one.--Among the various plans proposed
                        for relief from its burden, it is not surprising that he who has been false
                        in all else should aspire to be the champion of bad faith to the Nation's
                        creditors. It is left for Johnson to urge and recommend, in a grave message,
                        simple and unadorned repudiation. We have seen the same thing in all sorts
                        of disguises before, but never has it presented itself in its native
                        ugliness, as it does in his hands. There is no mistaking this:</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Our national credit should be sacredly observed; but in making provision for
                        our creditors we should not forget what is due to the mosses of
                        the people. It may be assumed that the holders of our securities have
                        already received upon their bonds a larger amount than their original
                        investment, measured by a gold standard. Upon this statement of facts it
                        would seem but just and equitable that the six per cent, interest now paid
                        by the Government should be applied to the reduction of the principal in
                        semi-annual instalments, which in sixteen years and eight months would
                        liquidate the entire national debt. Six per cent in gold would at present
                        rates be equal to nine per cent in currency, and equivalent to the payment
                        of the debt one and a half times in a fraction less than seventeen years.
                        This in connection with all the other advantages derived from their
                        investment, would efford to the public creditors a fair and
                        liberal compensation for the use of their capital, and with this they should
                        be satisfied. The lessons of the past admonish the lender that it is not
                        well to be over-anxious in exacting from the borrow rigid compliance with
                        the letter of the bond.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>So much for the official end of a bad man.</p>
                    <p>For the information needed as to the various Departments of the Government,
                        the President refers briefly to the reports of their various heads. Our
                        relations with foreign nations are said to be promising, and hopes are
                        expressed for the satisfactory adjustment of the difficulties so long
                        pending with some of them. But apart from the questions of Reconstruction
                        and the payment of the public debt, there is little of interest to be found
                        in the message.</p>
