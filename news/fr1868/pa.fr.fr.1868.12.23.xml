                <head>Should Our Farmers Sell Their Grain?</head>

                    <p>The scarcity of money which prevails is not limited to Franklin county, nor
                        even to the Cumberland Valley. The complaint of hard times is general,
                        though here there is a special scarcity of money owing to our heavy losses
                        and the fact that our farmers are holding their produce for higher prices.
                        Trade of every kind has contracted itself to its minimum standard, and
                        manufacturers, if not obliged to stop altogether, turn out but a trifle of
                        the amount of their former work.</p>
                    <p>The distress of our community is due then to the prevailing hard times, to
                        the losses of 1864 which are felt more keenly now than then, to the
                        contraction of that kind of work which gave employment to the laborer, and
                        to the unwillingness of farmers to sell their grain at ruling prices. Owing
                        to the two latter causes our community has been drained of currency and
                        there is nothing done to bring it back. We sell nothing, neither raw
                        materials nor manufactured articles.</p>
                    <p>We propose to ask if our farmers are acting wisely in thus refusing to sell;
                        and, if we differ from them, will try and produce satisfactory reasons for
                        so doing.</p>
                    <p>The price of wheat, oats and corn is regulated, like that of every other
                        commodity, by the law of supply and demand. If the supply is abundant and
                        the demand small prices must rule low. If their relative positions be
                        changed prices must necessarily become high.</p>
                    <p>There are two conditions which, if true, will tend to keep the price of grain
                        at its present standard, if they do not bring it still lower. These are the
                        abundant crop of cereals throughout the United States, and the little demand
                        from them in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The impression which prevails among our farmers that the wheat crop of last
                        summer was a failure is a mistake. Our best information from a careful
                        scrutiny of the reports from all the States leads us to this conclusion. The
                        yield in California has been marvelous, and wheat is shipped from San
                        Francisco in vast quantities to the Sandwich Islands, to Asia, Australia and
                        to New York. That shipped to New York alone will reach millions of bushels.
                        The territories of Colorado, Montana and Idaho have each raised enough to
                        supply all their wants, and Utah has a large surplus on hand. The miners of
                        these territories and the employees of the Pacific railroad will all be
                        supplied without drawing on the States.</p>
                    <p>The corn crop of Texas is reported large, though there are complaints that
                        wheat is in short supply. Of the crops in Alabama it is said that the
                        production has exceeded that of last year. The accounts from Georgia are
                        said to be discouraging, though the complaints are chiefly in regard to
                        cotton. Wheat is not so good as was expected. In North Carolina and South
                        Carolina, where more attention is paid to the cultivation of breadstuffs
                        than before the war, the reports indicate an abundance. The crops of
                        Virginia reached a full average, and owing to the rapid influx of farmers
                        from Pennsylvania and other Northern States, a much larger crop was planted
                        last year than formerly. Kentucky and Tennessee were both blessed with a
                        full average of grain. Kansas, young, vigorous and healthy yields like a
                        garden and boasts of large crops of wheat, corn, oats, and other grains. Her
                        aggregate is largely in excess of that of other years. Some instances are
                        mentioned wherein the value of the crop, exceeded the value of the whole
                        farm, including the improvements. Missouri is little behind Kansas unless it
                        be in the general inteligence of the inhabitants of the two States, and has
                        too a bountiful harvest. Further North the same abundance prevails. Iowa
                        never harvested a more bountiful crop, and, with her superior advantages for
                        transportation, is rapidly shipping it to market. Minnesota rivals
                        California in the productions of her wheat crops, and the average this year,
                        says the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph>, is perhaps higher than in any
                        States east of the Rocky Mountains. Wisconsin had a fine crop, and has been
                        industriously engaged in shipping it. In Illinois the wheat crop is
                        represented as an average, and in the central part, devoted to corn, the
                        yield is large. The fruit crop, which has been made a specialty in this
                        State, generally failed.</p>
                    <p>From Michigan we hear of no complaints and presume that her farmers have met
                        with reasonable success. The complaint is general that the wheat crop in
                        Ohio has failed, and that in comparison with former years the result is not
                        flattering. Wheat has been an uncertain crop in Ohio for some years, and the
                        number of acres planted is much smaller than formerly.</p>
                    <p>As to Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey the crop of wheat in each has been a
                        full average and of first rate quality, and the corn was both good and
                        plentiful. New York, says the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> has never
                        had a more abundant harvest. Throughout New England the crops are not behind
                        the average standard, both as to kind and quality, of former years. Our own
                        State has produced a large crop both of corn and wheat, though not so large
                        as we have sometimes had. In the Cumberland Valley it can scarcely be called
                        an average, and the quality is indifferent. Our farmers are disappointed at
                        the yield, and, perhaps somewhat spoiled by the high prices of the last few
                        years, hold on to what they have hoping to make the most out of it.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that they are likely to be benefitted by waiting, and our
                        reasons for this are the general abundance of the crops throughout the
                        country, as we have briefly stated it, the immense quantity finding its way
                        into market from the West, and the absence of a demand in Europe. Our whole
                        community would be benefitted largely if the wheat and corn of Franklin
                        county were brought into market, and we have grave doubts whether a longer
                        delay will not subject those who own them to losses instead of bring them
                        gain.</p>

                <summary>The editor questions Pennsylvania farmers' decision to stop selling their
                    grain in the hopes of getting higher prices later. The crop yields from the
                    entire country show that the abundance of crops combined with a poor demand in
                    Europe caused the deflated prices. He tries to convince farmers that prices will
                    not rise in the future and urges them to sell grain now to diminish economic
                    misfortunes.</summary>

                <summary>Rev. R. H. Williams of Maryland lectured in the Court House for the benefit
                    of the Young Men's Christian Association. He spoke on "Trifles: their littleness
                    and greatness." The paper declares that it was full of "common sense." Rev. John
                    Hunter delivered a lecture in the Court House on temperance. Rev. Irving Magee,
                    pastor of the Lutheran Church, preached a sermon to the young men of
                    Chambersburg. "Solemn facts were presented in such a manner as should cause each
                    one to stop and reflect if his or her influence was detrimental to those of the
                    rising generation." Prof. Shumaker gave a "very instructive and entertaining"
                    lecture at Greenvillage.</summary>
