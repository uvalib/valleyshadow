<b>The Canvass in Franklin County</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper calls on all Republicans to donate their time and energy to the
                    upcoming campaigns. The editors especially want volunteers to distribute
                    campaign literature and compile lists of all Republicans and Democrats in the
                    county. They also claim that Republicans lost in the last election because of
                    lethargy and must avoid a similar result.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As has already been stated in our columns, the Republican Committee of
                        Franklin county met week before last in this place and organized. The
                        delegations without exception at the late Convention reported good men, and
                        it is matter for congratulation that no superior Committee has ever
                        heretofore had confided to it the interests of the Republican organization
                        of Franklin county. The body has been especially fortunate in the selection
                        of its Chairman. We have no more sagacious, prudent, energetic and reliable
                        gentleman than Samuel F. Greenawalt. For years he has done good work in the
                        party's cause in this borough, especially in the South Ward. The bitter
                        disappointment that the Democrats there have more than once of late been
                        compelled to feel, has been mainly due to the energy and determination of
                        such gentlemen as Mr. Greenawalt. Defeated at the polls for Treasurer last
                        year because of the light vote that was cast by the Republicans, he is
                        determined that no similar calamity shall overtake any of the gentlemen now
                        upon the ticket.</p>
                    <p>But notwithstanding the excellence of the Committee to whom has been
                        committed the conduct of the campaign, to make the canvass thorough and
                        successful, the co-operation of every patriotic citizen is now needed. An
                        appeal from the authorized source, whether for labor or money, should not go
                        unheeded. Some can labor effectively in one department, some in another, and
                        citizens ought so far as they are able allow those who are charged with the
                        management of affairs to indicate the particular duty that each should
                        perform. A hive of bees furnishes an illustration here. All work busily and
                        to a common end, and yet each has his separate duty and appointed task. In
                        the political hive some are wanted to distribute documents and newspapers,
                        some to visit doubting Republicans (these are few, thanks to the justice of
                        our cause) and repentant Democrats, some to canvass the districts and make
                        out lists of voters, some to act as tally men at the polls, some to bring in
                        the tardy voters, some to do the challenging and preserve the purity of the
                        ballot-box, some to address the meetings, and all to attend the meetings, go
                        to the polls and go--for the Democracy generally and all the time.</p>
                    <p>And here, without wishing to give offense, we would say a word to the
                        gentlemen who are in the habit of addressing political meetings. It too
                        often happens that coaxing and pressure are required to obtain the
                        performance of a plain duty. That it is a duty we have not time to stop to
                        argue nor do we think this necessary. The time does not suit one, the
                        distance is too great for another, or a third prefers some other place than
                        the one to which he is solicited to go. One peremptorily declines because he
                        does not like to ride in the night air, whilst another engages positively to
                        go--if his wife should be no worse after supper.--This is all wrong.
                        Thoughtlessness, however, is at the bottom of it. A little reflection would
                        convince the persons we are now addressing that it is their duty in so
                        important a crisis as a national election to do all that may reasonably be
                        required of them without supplementing with ifs and buts an acquiesce
                        obtained by importunity and resorting to trifling excuses. We allude to no
                        particular person or persons and are not sure that we ourselves do not
                        belong to the class whose error we seek to correct. We would like all to
                        feel the importance of our County Committee finding ready and willing
                        workers in any department in which they may be required.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that the County Committee has requested each of its members
                        to solicit from the members of the party in his election district funds for
                        carrying on the campaign. It is scarcely necessary to remind the party that
                        the traveling, canvassing, documents, newspapers, speeches, mass and
                        township meetings, flags, banners, transparencies, music, tickets, etc.,
                        etc., of an exciting political campaign cost money and more money than many
                        suppose. The candidates it is true should bear a liberal proportion of the
                        expense and they usually do, but then they run the risk of defeat and
                        generally have more or less personal outlay. The party at large that has a
                        deep interest in the success of its cherished candidates and meas
                        ought not and does not want to be relieved from assuming a proper
                        responsibility in this regard. Until two years ago no effort that we are
                        aware of had been made here to obtain funds for party purposes from the
                        rural districts. Through the County Committee an appeal was then made and
                        the people were waited upon at their homes. None were asked for much and all
                        gave a little. The result is known. Governor Geary was triumphantly elected
                        and Franklin county contributed her fair share to the victory, besides
                        electing a Republican county ticket. The people are waiting to aid in every
                        way they can in the present important canvass. Let them but be called upon
                        and they will respond.</p>
                    <p>We presume that at its next meeting the County Committee will have before it
                        complete lists of voters in every election district and take measures to
                        have each voter visited personally and supplied with proper reading matter.
                        We have heard of certain localities in which there is a demand for
                        Republican newspapers on the part of Democrats. Many such have been supplied
                        from private sources, but steps should be taken by the Committee to place in
                        the hands of all the truth, and so large a quantity of documents and
                        newspapers should be kept on hand as that any possible demand may be met. It
                        is true that the ignorant and unthinking may spurn the truth when offered to
                        them in this shape, but Republicans owe it to themselves, their neighbors
                        and their country to propagate the principles of the party, and it is even
                        possible that seed sown in this way although not at present taking root may
                        some time produce an abundant harvest.</p>
                    <p>Probably no agency in a political campaign is of so much importance and so
                        powerful as a correct enrollment and classification of all the voters in the
                        several election districts. Where districts are very large, either
                        territorially or as regards population, it answers a good purpose to
                        subdivide into school districts or arbitrarily, as the case may be. The work
                        should be made as light and divided among as many laborers as possible, care
                        being taken to have the lists completed very early in the
                        compaign. The work of enrollment and classification can be
                        revised later in the campaign with profit, before and after which it may be
                        made the basis of much other valuable effort. No army, not even an
                        association or society, is considered well organized or efficient that has
                        not a complete list of its membership. In military warfare it is considered
                        essential too to know with greater or less precision the strength of the
                        adversary. The operations of political parties have their offensive as well
                        as their missionary characteristics, and a due regard to both requires that
                        the strength of the enemy be duly estimated.</p>
                    <p>We had intended saying something in relation to public meetings, but to do
                        this would swell this article to a greater length than we intended. Of
                        course meetings will be called and Republicans will attend. Not alone by
                        attending meetings themselves, however, can Republicans be active and evince
                        a proper interest in their cause. Each individual should endeavor to take
                        with him to the meetings one or more persons of opposite political
                        convictions, thereby bringing such under the influence of the truth.</p>
                    <p>In short there is work for all to do, and it is our object now to impress our
                        friends with the idea that it is the duty of each and all to labor
                        diligently wherever and whenever he may be able, and especially, that our
                        labors may be effective and systematic, to labor in the department to which
                        each may be assigned by those charged temporarily with the management of
                        affairs.</p>

<b>Are We to Have a Railroad to Waynesboro?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper supports the construction of a railroad to Waynesboro. The
                    editors assert such a railroad would decrease costs and taxes for the county and
                    provide direct access to important cities like Baltimore.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This question is often asked these days. There seems to be some doubt about
                        it yet. Too much consideration cannot well be given to this question. True,
                        meetings have been held, speeches, and very plain, intelligent and forcible
                        reasons advanced in favor of this railroad, a committee was appointed to
                        solicit subscriptions for stock, yet up to this time, this question has not
                        been satisfactorily answered. One reason for this delay, no doubt, is that
                        our people, town and country, have not yet been made to realize the great
                        importance of this railroad. Of all the enterprises that have been brought
                        before the people of this section, since the building of the Cumberland
                        Valley railroad, this exceeds in general development, material advantage and
                        prospective utility. Taxes in any form we deprecate, more so when they are
                        levied on the products of the soil, or the actual result of labor and
                        capital. As we are now, these products are made to pay tax for their
                        transition to market. The best markets we have for all our products are
                        situated on tide water. When that point is once reached, we can easily move
                        from one point to another by cheap water transportation. To reach tide water
                        we must go by rail. Of course the shortest route to the coast is our
                        cheapest, because we have less tax to pay in the shape of tolls. Now what
                        are our means of reaching tide water, as we are now situated? We have the
                        old wagon road to Baltimore, that is no longer used. We have the Franklin
                        road to Hagerstown, thence by wagons to Williamsport, thence by Chesapeake
                        canal to Baltimore. We have then our great outlet, the Cumberland Valley
                        railroad. By that road we now have communication to Baltimore, via
                        Harrisburg, in about 140 miles. We have to Philadelphia, via Harrisburg,
                        about 160 miles, and to New York, via Reading and Easton, about 260 miles.
                        Thus, it is seen, that for all the products of our labor or soil, we must
                        pay tolls on at least 110 miles before we can reach market or tide water.
                        The Cumberland Valley railroad has control of all the railroads leaving this
                        county. True, they are about extending the Franklin railroad to
                        Williamsport, thus giving us the advantage of the Chesapeake canal, and also
                        bringing us close to Cumberland coal. For this act of
                        considerntion, that company deserve the thanks of this community,
                        and we trust may be abundantly compensated. It is to be hoped they will not
                        discriminate in their tolls in favor of the Pennsylvania Central railroad.</p>
                    <p>Now how is this road to Waynesboro to help our case? Just in this, that by
                        the construction of that road, and the making of about four miles of road
                        from Waynesboro, to connect the Western Maryland railroad, we would have a
                        direct communication by rail to Baltimore, by some 85 to 90 miles. This is
                        the consideration that is vital in favor of this road, and challenges our
                        attention and earnest labor. And it is in this view that we say the
                        projected road is the most important movement that has claimed the public
                        attention for years. By this road we would pay tolls on but 90 miles,
                        against 140 on any other road out of this valley, from Chambersburg to tide
                        water. It is easily seen in this view, how all classes are benefitted. If
                        the toll on a barrel of flour to Baltimore, via the Cumberland Valley
                        railroad is, for example, 40 cents, on this road it would be 25 1/2 cents, a
                        difference of 14 1/2 cents per barrel. This, allowing five bushes of wheat
                        to make a barrel, would be 3 cents per bushel on grain.</p>
                    <p>In this view, the construction of this road would be a saving of $30 on every
                        thousand bushels of wheat or corn we would have to sell, for be it
                        remembered, that tolls are not regulated by the price of wheat, but a
                        reduction in miles carried is a permanent reduction of tolls, as a
                        consequence, lands must advance in price. In this view does it not become
                        every farmer and citizen of Chambersburg, not only as a solemn duty to the
                        community, but also as a matter of solid interest and gain, to make earnest
                        labor for this, to us important enterprise. Should we not endeavor by every
                        honorable effort to secure for ourselves at least two outlets for our
                        produce and manufactures. The opportunity is now before us, let us seize it,
                        and make the interest of the county at the same time our interest.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic managers are becoming seriously alarmed at the honest
                        construction which their party leaders South are giving to the platform, and
                        beg them not speak so freely as to its real meaning. These Southern fellows
                        don't seem to know that the use of language is chiefly to conceal one's
                        thought and they go to work with the utmost freedom to explain and make
                        clear that which the Convention intentionally left obscure and doubtful. It
                        is a merit which they possess and for which they should be properly
                        credited, inasmuch as there is little else that can be said in their favor.
                        Besides we should not forget that they save the Republican journals the
                        necessity of developing the true meaning of the Democratic platform, and add
                        to their own construction of it the force of Democratic authority.</p>
                    <p>One of the most outspoken of the number was a member of the committee on
                        resolutions, and ought to be pretty good authority on the subject. His name
                        is Wade Hampton. Our farmers will recollect him as a noted fancier in good
                        horseflesh, who visited them in 1862. He was so well pleased with their
                        stock of fine draught horses that he took the whole lot and shipped them to
                        the Southern Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>When he returned from the New York Convention he spoke of its action to his
                        constituents. He said he was a member of the committee on resolutions, that
                        is, the platform. He told them that the two important features of the
                        platform were repudiation and the denunciation of the reconstruction
                        measures of Congress.--The first of these had been introduced into it by the
                        friends of Mr. Pendleton, the last by himself. Here are his own words as to
                        what occurred in the committee:</p>
                    <p>"I said I would take the resolutions if they would allow me to add but three
                        words, which you will find embodied in the platform. I added this: 'and we
                        declare that the reconstruction acts are revolutionary, unconstitutional and
                            void.'--When I proposed that, every single member of
                            the Committee, and the warmest men in it were the men of the North, came
                            forward and said that they would carry it out to the end."</p>
                    <p>Wade Hampton further said, that if the Democrats succeeded in the
                        the election, the State organizations of the South, those organized
                        under the reconstruction acts, would fall. Now how can they fall? There are
                        two ways possible, by the repeal of the reconstruction acts, and by the
                        overthrow of the Government. Wade Hampton has too much intelligence not to
                        know that so long as the Senate is Republican, which will necessarily be
                        three or four years even under Democratic rule, the reconstruction acts
                        cannot be repealed. He must mean then that these State governments shall
                        fall by force of arms when Seymour and Blair are elected. Is this what the members of the Committee, and the warmest
                            men in it were men from the North, came forward and said they would
                            carry it out to the end?</p>
                    <p>So it seems! and so would the declarations and threats of a host of other
                        Democrats and traitors both North and South compel us to believe. We do
                        believe it, and conservative Union men throughout the whole North, who have
                        been acting with the Democratic party since the war believe it too.</p>
                    <p>Hon. J. S. Carlisle, Ex-Senator from West Virginia, in a letter to the
                        Baltimore American, denounces the Democratic
                        party and its candidates for the reasons we have just assigned. During the
                        rebellion Senator Carlisle was in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the
                        war. Since its close he has labored with the Democratic party, and says, "I
                        have never been, in the strict sense of the word, a party man. My chief
                        object in public life has been the maintenance of the Union under the
                        constitution."</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the Democratic party and its candidates, he says:</p>
                    <p>I had hoped and expected that the action of the New York Convention would
                        have entitled its nominees to the support of conservative Union men. Had its
                        members pledged themselves to the maintenance of the right of local
                        self-government in the States, as secured by the Constitution, and nominated
                        as their Presidential candidate, a man of undoubted Unionism, who believed
                        in the right of the Government to protect itself and enforce its lawful
                        authority, I should have voted for its nominees. This was not done. On the
                        contrary, it is my opinion that Hendricks was defeated because he is not a
                        believer in the right of secession. The war record of Hancock defeated
                            dim. Mr. Vallandigham's patriotism nominated Seymour and
                        crushed the aspirations of the Chief Justice. The friends of the "lost
                        cause" triumphed over the Unionism of the Convention, and the strife of the
                        battle field is to be renewed, to be fought out at the ballot box. As much
                        as I am opposed to the radical legislation of the last six years, I am more
                        opposed to disunion. So long as we are one people vicious legislation may be
                        corrected, even constitutional amendments may be abolished, and
                        constitutional liberty preserved; but once divided into separate States,
                            unded different Governments, liberty and prosperity, peace
                        and good government are lost forever. Grant will receive no support from
                        Secessionists or their sympathizers; they are all to be found in the ranks
                        of the party supporting Mr. Seymour. The conservatism of Republicanism
                        nominated Grant. The radicalism of Democracy nominated Seymour.</p>

                    long needed and desired--a first-class school." The editors urge Chambersburg
                    citizens to support the school by putting their daughters "under Mr. Foster's
                    care, where they can enjoy all the advantages to be had in other schools at a
                    less expense, complete a thorough course of study, fit themselves for teaching
                    or any other position in life, and thus while benefitting themselves, will
