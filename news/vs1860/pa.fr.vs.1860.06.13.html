<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--As a Railroad spirit has been awakened since the convention in Harrisburg
                        on the 23rd ult., and a deep interest seems to pervade the public mind,
                        would it not be advisable for the citizens of Chambersburg and county of
                        Franklin to profit by the remarks made by Mr. Shriver, of New York, in the
                        aforesaid Railroad Convention, viz: "convince the New Yorkers by subscribing
                        liberally to the road and then proving that if made it would be a profitable
                        investment and all the balance of the stock necessary to make the road can
                        easily be raised in Wall street."</p>
                    <p>This we say is a common sense view of the matter--men of wealth are not
                        likely to invest their money unless they have well grounded assurances of it
                        yielding a profit. If we, as citizens of Franklin county, go on this
                        principle, it will not be either a duty or a principle with us to try and
                        convince either the capitalists of New York or Philadelphia that this road
                        would be profitable to either of them, as the interests of New York are no
                        benefit to us, but directly the reverse, by drawing the trade from the west
                        and north-west of this county and the counties of Fulton, Bedford, Somerset
                        and west of the last named entirely from us, reaching the Sasquehanna six or
                        eight miles above Harrisburg, connecting with the New York Dauphin Railroad.
                        As regards Philadelphia we are already connected with her, and if she
                        chooses to let New York take the untold wealth of Pennsylvania's western
                        counties with her, so be it, let her abide the consequences. But as regards
                        Baltimore we stand in a very different position;</p>
