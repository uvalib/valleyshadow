                    <p>A Convention of venerable and respectable old gentlemen, who are
                        constitutionally opposed to the Democratic party, met at Baltimore about the
                        middle of last week and nominated a ticket which, according to the speeches
                        made on the interesting occasion, is destined to knock all other tickets
                        into the middle of next week. Grandmother John
                        Bell, a tough and toothless old politician of Tennessee, was selected for
                        the Presidency. Bell's nomination was followed by a great deal of
                        clappering, in the course of which "all the world and the rest of mankind,"
                        (including the Japanese embassy, now hourly expected,) were pledged to the
                        nominee. This done, Hon. Edward Everett, the accomplished scholar and
                        sagacious and patriotic statesman, was insulted with an offer of the Vice
                        Presidency.</p>
                    <p>In spite of their large promises, these "Constitutional Unionists" do not
                        expect to accomplish much beyond a mere muddying of the political waters.
                        They have a slender hope that they can take one or two States from the
                        Democracy and render more doubtful an election of President by the
                    people.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--This encampment will commence on Tuesday, the 29th inst., and continue four
                        days. It promises to be well attended. Seven companies from this county will
                        certainly be present, and we learn that two companies from Cumberland
                        county, a company from Gettysburg, two from Frederick, and, perhaps, one
                        from McConnellsburg, are also expected to be in attendance. The arrangements
                        for conducting this encampment are, we understand, as complete as it is
                        possible for human forsight to make them. The Committee having charge of the
                        arrangements have carried out all matters, intrusted to them, with a degree
                        of liberality that will afford the most perfect satisfaction to visiting
                        companies, and contribute to make this encampment attractive as any ever
                        held in the State. Waynesboro is a thriving and beautiful town and the
                        well-known hospitality of its citizens, at all times, is a sure guarantee
                        that all who visit this encampment will be well treated and pass a pleasant
                        time.</p>
