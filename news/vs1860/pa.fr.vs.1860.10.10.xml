                    <p>--The second annual exhibition of the Farmers and Mechanics Industrial
                        Association of Franklin County closed on Friday last. The early day at which
                        our paper is printed, the present week, precludes us from giving the
                        extended notice it was entirely worthy to receive. We have only time and
                        space to say that it was a success in every particular connected with the
                        exhibition. The display of stock, farming implements, machinery,
                        agricultural products, household articles &amp;c., were very extensive
                        and creditable. The attendance was large--the receipts on the second day
                        alone amounting to nearly one thousand dollars. Everything connected with
                        the fair passed off pleasantly and gave the highest degree of satisfaction
                        to exhibitors and visitors.</p>
