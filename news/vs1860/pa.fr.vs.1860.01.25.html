<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Meeting at Fayetteville.</p>
                    <p>The friends of this project met in the Union School House at Fayetteville, on
                        Saturday Evening, the 21st, to consider the expediency of making a survey
                        between these points. The meeting was organized, and it was announced by the
                        president, that the speaker, Rev. W. D. C. Rodrock, who had promised to
                        address the meeting, was unavoidably absent on business.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then addressed the meeting detailing a few facts connected with
                        the history of Penna. Railroad, beginning with the surveys made by the State
                        in 1838, particularly the Southern Route, the one of most interest to the
                        people of this Valley. When this line was run, railroads had not the recent
                        improvements--iron rails, powerful locomotives, long trains, &amp;c.,
                        were then unknown, therefore, the report of this survey, does not now meet
                        the requirements of a good road. There is, however, one thing by it made
                        certain, that there is an easy railroad passage through the Cove Mountain,
                        Via. Cowens Gap, between Loudon and Burnt Cabbins. About ten years ago when
                        the western trade deserted its natural course to be carried by the Central
                        R. R., leaving the Turnpike road to melancholy quietness, the people then,
                        and since, realized the evil consequences of their supineness.--Several
                        attempts have since been made to construct this Line. In 1853 legislative
                        authorities under the name of the Chambersburg and Allegheny Co. was
                        obtaind, commissioners appointed, and meetings held along the line, but from
                        some cause these measures failed. The Pittsburg and Connelsville R. R. Co.
                        have nearly completed their road Eastward from Pittsburg to Bridgeport--some
                        20 miles west of Bedford. The Shermans Valley &amp; Broad Top and other
                        Co's. were chartered by act of 1854 and supplements since to construct a
                        road from Bridgeport, Via. Burnt Cabins to the Central R. R. The original
                        route from Burnt Cabins to the eastern cities Via. Chambersburg is shorter,
                        has easier grades, and a less number of miles to construct than any other
                        projected route.</p>
                    <p>After the Secretary concluded his remarks it was resolved that the following
                        committee be appointed to take subscriptions, for the purpose of having a
                        survey made as soon as practicable. Messrs. David Goodyear, A. J. Stevens,
                        Robert A. Renfrew, Robert Black, Jacob B. Cook, George Dull, Phares
                        Duffield, Robert F. McElroy, John Crawford of J., John Brown, H. C.
                        Greenawalt, John Baughman, William Rupert, Sam'l Dysart, John Downey,
                        Matthew McKee, and Jacob Strickler. Messrs. John Baughman and Robert A.
                        Renfrew will act as treasurers and will attend to having the survey made.</p>
                    <p>The people along the contemplated line of the road are cordially invited to
                        co- operate in the measure. On motion the meeting adjourned to meet at the
                        same place on Friday evening, Feb. 3d.</p>
                    <p>JOHN DOWNEY, President. <br>J. B. McELROY, Secretary. <br>Fayetteville,
                        Jan. 21, 1860.</p>
