<b>Slavery in Territories--The Democratic Doctrine</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the Douglas men misrepresent the Breckinridge position on
                    slavery in the territories. His platform doesn't call for Congressional
                    protection of slavery. Instead, it states that the government, according to the
                    Constitution, protects persons and property wherever the Constitution is in
                    effect. No branch of the government can confiscate property.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Douglas men continually misrepresent the Breckinridge platform by
                        asserting that it calls for Congressional protection to Slavery. It does no
                        such thing. It pledged the General Government in all its
                            branches to the protection of persons and property, whenever its
                            Constitutional power extends. It pledges its
                        protection to constitutional rights, no matter what those rights may be, and
                        there is not a single line in the platform to which a Douglas man dare enter
                        his disclaimer.</p>
                    <p>Property, recognized as such, is protected by the Constitution, and neither
                        Congressional nor Territorial enactment is needed for its protection. Should
                        any branch of any government--Federal, State, or Territorial--undertake to
                        confiscate the property of a citizen or to deprive him of his rightful
                        possession, the General Government would be found, in all its branches, to
                        intervene against the act, no matter whether the property consisted of land,
                        tenements, cattle, or slaves.</p>
                    <p>The Supreme Court of the United States has decided that:</p>
                    <p>1st. Territories are the common property of all the States.</p>
                    <p>2d. Congress cannot dispossess any one of property by the Constitution, nor
                        prohibit the citizen from taking it to and holding it in a Territory.</p>
                    <p>3d. That the Constitution recognizes slaves as property and pledges the
                        General Government to its protection.</p>
                    <p>And the National Democracy hold to the doctrine that, inasmuch as territories
                        belong to one State as much as to another, so long as they remain
                        Territories, there is no power to prevent any citizen removing to them with
                        his property and holding it therein.</p>
                    <p>When the people assume the power of making a State Constitution, then, and
                        not till then, have they the power to recognize or prohibit slavery; and
                        even then, the people have no power to manumit slaves by act of the
                        Legislature. The right of property recognized by the Constitution of the
                        United States cannot be impaired by any power; but a State may, in her
                        Constitution and laws, establish or prohibit slavery when it pleases. A
                        State may in its Constitution, prohibit slavery within its limits; but it
                        cannot dispossess the master of his slaves by manumitting them.</p>
                    <p>There is no more necessity for Congressional intervention for slavery in the
                        Territories, then there is for the possession of any property. The
                        Government is already bound to protect every citizen in person and
                        property--that law is in the Constitution itself and needs no repetition by
                        Congress or any other legislative body.</p>

<b>Well Said</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The State Sentinel answers Forney's criticism of Foster, who met with a
                    prominent Breckinridge supporter, by saying that Foster is the "only remaining
                    link that unites the once harmonious Democratic Party of Pennsylvania" and thus
                    has the right to meet with supporters of all Democratic candidates. The Erie
                    Observer quotes the State Sentinel and believes that its comments are well said.
                    The Observer believes that Forney and his lot are "engaged in an effort to
                    defeat that [Democratic unity] ticket."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are gratified to learn that the course of the Spirit meets the entire approval of those whose good opinions are
                        worth having. The Pennsylvanian, for many years
                        the leading organization of the Democracy in this State, gives us this
                        handsome endorsement. We can very well afford to put up with the spatterings
                        of such whipsters as the Times when our course
                        meets the approval of such old and reliable papers as the Pennsylvanian:</p>
                    <p>From the Daily Pennsylvanian.</p>
                    <p>The Chambersburg Valley Spirit, heretofore a very
                        zealous supporter of Judge Douglas, has withdrawn the names of Douglas and
                        Johnson from the head of its columns, and substituted those of Breckinridge
                        and Lane. In a long and well written article, explanatory of the step, the
                        various circumstances inducing it are explicitly stated, being briefly the
                        undisguised efforts, as well of Judge Douglas and Mr. Johnson, as of Forney,
                        Haldeman and other Douglas leaders, to prevent a union of the Pennsylvania
                        Democracy, and thus give the State to the Black Republicans. It is due,
                        perhaps, to the Valley Spirit, to say that it has
                        from the first earnestly advocated the union of the Democracy of the State
                        upon the Reading Electoral Ticket, and no Journal has more indignantly
                        denounced the treachery and baseness of the Forney-Haldeman conspirators. It
                        was only week before last, indeed, that the Democracy of Franklin, in mass
                        convention, made up of citizens from every township in the county, resolved
                        with entire unanimity that they would know no difference in the impending
                        struggle. But this did not suit the Douglas leaders, and Hershel V. Johnson
                        was taken to Chambersburg under the direction of Forney, Haldeman &amp;
                        Co., to denounce the union sentiment prevailing there, and to counsel, as a
                        nominee with Judge Douglas, such a course of action as can only result in
                        giving the Keystone State to the enemies of the Democracy.</p>
                    <p>The Patriot and Union, published at Harrisburg,
                        notices the course of the Spirit in the following
                        highly complimentary manner:</p>
                    <p>From the Daily Patriot and Union.</p>
                    <p>The factious course pursued by the violent and indiscreet friends of Judge
                        Douglas, in forming an irregular electoral ticket, in opposition to the one
                        nominated at Reading by the Democratic Convention, and the unmistakable
                        evidence that this plot to divide the Democratic vote of the State, for the
                        purpose of defeating the party and electing Lincoln, is encouraged by Mr.
                        Douglas himself, has had a powerful effect upon the moderate men who at the
                        beginning enlisted under his standard, but are not disposed to follow his
                        destructive counsels. One of the most marked and significant evidences of
                        the re-action against Douglas is to be found in the course of the
                        Chambersburg Valley Spirit, the old organ of the
                        Democracy of Franklin county. That paper started out in this campaign the
                        earnest advocate of Mr. Douglas, but finding that it could not support him
                        in his way, and the Democratic party at the same time, it has determined to
                        retrace its steps. The last number comes to us with the names of
                        Breckinridge and Lane floating at its mast-head, and a powerful article
                        justifying this course.</p>
                    <p>The following from a prominent and active Democrat exhibits the right spirit,
                        and that old- fashioned devotion to the interests of the party that used to
                        animate our ranks when they were united and moved on in one solid column to
                        victory. While we have a few such noble Democrats left there is hope for the
                        party:</p>
                    <p>Sept. 27, 1860</p>
                    <p>Mr. Geo. H. Mengel:</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--You have no idea of the thrill of joy
                        that went through us here when the Spirit made
                        its last appearance. Could we not get some circulars from you with your
                        editorial giving the article from where you say: "where are we to look in
                        this emergency," &amp;c., till the end of your reasons for the change. It should be headed with a few
                        appropriate remarks. I would like to have $10 worth to circulate myself, and
                        will be responsible to you for the amount. They will tell with good effect.
                        Your article is admirable and will do great execution. You need not fear the
                        result because our Country must, to make a long story short, come to one of
                        two thinkings. The establishment of the great principle of the Equality of States, or a dissolution of the Union.</p>
                    <p>Every man's wife, child, farm and pocket forbid the latter, and the other
                        will, and must prevail. Like truth, tho' crushed for a while, it will rise
                        again. The second sober thought of the people will establish it. The men who
                        take the stand you have taken will stand with the Country, when the Northern
                        and Southern agitator will both be ashamed of themselves, and when the
                        patriot will be moved to no other emotion for them than that of pity. Go on
                        with the good work, and standing upon principle as we do, let us fight them
                        to the Knife, and the Knife to the hilt. It is no odds which we cut, for
                        there is so little difference between Lincolnism and Douglasism that you
                        will be sure to cut a nigger or a mulatto any how.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>We subjoin the following letter received on Monday last. The letter requires
                        no comment--it tells its own story in its own plain way. It was not intended
                        for publication but it is so suited to the times
                        that we cannot refrain from giving it a place in our columns:</p>
                    <p>-------- Township, Sept. 29th</p>
                    <p>Mr. G.H. Mengel.</p>
                    <p>Sir:--A few weeks ago I had business in
                        Chambersburg and when there I was persuaded to stop my paper. I did so as
                        you know. I now want you to send it to me again. I have been thinking over
                        the matter very much and have never felt satisfied about it. The men who
                        coaxed me to stop the paper, which I did to oblige
                        them as they have always been friendly to me, and I thought them the
                        right kind of Democrats, wanted me to take their paper at that time, but I
                        put them off saying I would see about it the next time I came to town. I
                        have seen about it and seen their paper too, and it does not suit me, but I
                        don't want to prevent any other person from taking it if they wish to do so.
                        I have always found the Valley Spirit about right
                        in its Democracy so far as I am able to judge. I am a friend to Douglas but
                        still I feel more friendly to the Democratic party than I do to any man
                        living. I will vote a fusion ticket and no other, as that is the only way,
                        in my opinion, that we can elect a Democrat. If Mr. Douglas would rather be
                        defeated than elected in that way then I will not throw my vote away on him.
                        As long as you support fusion I can support you, on that ground we can meet
                        as Democrats, and you can have your preference and I can have mine. The more
                        I have thought on the matter the better I am convinced that you are right
                        and that I have been deceived by men from whom I expected better things.
                        What surprised me most of all was to find the men that your paper has always
                        upheld now trying to injure you. I would not do so with my neighbors, and I
                        would not like it if my neighbors would do so with me. That is not the right
                        way for Democrats to act by each other, and no good to the party will come
                        out of it.</p>
                    <p>I have told you that I never felt satisfied about stopping my paper, and I
                        don't wish you to be offended at me about it, but send it on again with the
                        three numbers that I have missed. My family also want it and are not pleased
                        because I do not take it any more.</p>
                    <p>Please send on the paper and I will make it all right with you.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>
                <br>

                    <p>--It must not be forgotten, in our political excitement, that this is the
                        week of our County Fair. The Fair commenced yesterday--the weather is fine,
                        and the prospects for a grand exhibition are very cheering. Large crowds of
                        people are here already, and others are constantly arriving. The
                        arrangements are of the most ample kind to accommodate all exhibitors in
                        every department. York, Dauphin, Cumberland, Adams, Fulton, and Washington
                        County, Md, are all well represented in Stock, Agricultural products, or
                        specimens of Mechanical skill. Our ladies too have not been backward in
                        presenting a fine display of their handywork. It is so far decidedly the
                        best and most interesting Agricultural exhibition yet held in our county.
                        Every man, woman and child in the county should turn out and not miss this
                        opportunity of witnessing such a creditable exhibition of skill and industry
                        of their own neighbors.</p>

                    <p>--We were shown a quilt, on Monday last, by P. Hamman, Esq., that is
                        decidedly a splendid article, and a most extraordinary piece of feminine
                        handywork. It was made by the mother of Mr. Hamman--a lady aged 83 years. It
                        was commenced in her 82d year and has just recently been finished. It is
                        beautiful in design and contains eight thousand seven hundred and eighty
                        four pieces, and is quilted in a stile that cannot be surpassed. The
                        stitching is very fine and regular. This beautiful article was made by this
                        aged lady without the aid of spectacles.--This quilt will be on exhibition,
                        this week, at our County Fair. Bring on your old-fogy Penelopes, our modern
