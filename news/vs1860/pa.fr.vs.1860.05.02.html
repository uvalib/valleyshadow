<b>The Abolition of Slavery</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that freeing slaves would actually hurt the North.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The abolitionists object to slavery as an element of political power. They
                        complain that the whites of the South vote for their negroes--that
                        three-fifths of all the negroes are taken into the account in adjusting the
                        ratio of Congressional representation. This, they say, gives the South more
                        political power than she is justly entitled to.</p>
                    <p>We reply that the Constitution of the United States provides for the
                        enumeration of three-fifths of all the Southern slaves, and that to attack
                        this arrangement is to attack the work of the founders of our Republic. But
                        how much better off would the North be if slavery were abolished? If the
                        Southern negroes were set free, not merely three-fifths, but all of them.
                        would be counted, as all negroes are now counted at the North.</p>
                    <p>There are about five million slaves in the country, three millions of whom
                        are taken into the account in apportioning political power among the States.
                        Set them free and the two millions who are now excluded will have to be
                        counted. At the present ratio of representation, this would give twenty more
                        members of Congress to the Southern States! Do the abolitionists wish to
                        endow the Southern States with more political power than they already
                        possess?</p>
                    <p>The rooting out of slavery would not promote Northern interests. It would
                        directly conflict with the interests of Pennsylvania, if there is any truth
                        in the claim that the interests of this State require an increased
                        tariff--for the South is opposed to an increase of the tariff, and if
                        slavery should be abolished and twenty more Representatives be added to the
                        Southern strength in Congress, anybody of sense can see that there would be
                        just so many more votes against an increase of tariff.</p>

<b>The National Convention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Acknowledges that the Valley Spirit's fears of disunity at the Convention
                    were realized, and that the outcome can not be predicted at this juncture.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the time we write, several days prior to the date of our paper, it is
                        impossible to say what will be done by the Democratic National Convention.
                        Nearly a week has been spent in organizing the Convention, settling
                        contested seats and endeavoring to frame a platform. The fears we expressed
                        in our last issue, that it would be difficult to harmonise the conflicting
                        sentiments of extreme quarters of the country, have been realized. There is
                        no disguising the fact that there is considerable danger of a disagreement
                        that will end in the withdrawal of a portion of the Convention. This
                        deplorable result ought to be avoided, and we do not despair of being able
                        to announce that it has been avoided.</p>
                    <p>If the policy of the administration upon the Lecompton question had been
                        acquiesced in by all the leading men of our party, there would have been no
                        contention in the National Convention about a platform. That policy would
                        not have made a permanent addition of one foot of slave territory to the
                        Union, but it would have prevented the demand made upon us by the extreme
                        South for a Congressional slave code. Out of the opposition to it have grown
                        all the difficulties that lie in the way of harmonious action at
                    Charleston.</p>
