<b>A Signal Instance of Lincoln's Honesty</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Courier and Enquirer relates a story about Lincoln's tenure as
                    Postmaster. When he resigned, he still had $200 of the government's money. He
                    returned it when the Postmaster General asked for it. The paper sees this as an
                    example of his honesty. The Spirit argues that Lincoln should have returned the
                    money to the government before he did. The fact that he did ultimately return it
                    is no reason for him to be president.<br>
