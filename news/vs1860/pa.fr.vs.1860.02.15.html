<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A number of property holders in the townships of Guilford and Hamilton,
                        immediately adjoining this borough, have petitioned the Town Council to
                        extend the borough lines so as to embrace them within the corporate limits
                        of the town. The petitions are so numerously signed in both districts and
                        the Council are disposed to grant the prayer of the Petitioners. In Guilford
                        township the movement meets with no opposition, but in Hamilton, we learn,
                        an attempt will be made, by a few persons, to resist the measure. It is not
                        thought, however, that their opposition will be very strenuous or thwart, in
                        any degree, the will of the majority. We feel perfectly indifferent as to
                        how this matter may terminate, and don't much care whether they come in or
                        stay out. The outsiders are alone the party benefited by the measure and if
                        they choose to resist what is evidently their own interest, we would say let
                        them remain out. We cannot see in what particular the citizens of the
                        borough are to be benefited by enlarging the borough limits. Additional
                        school accommodations will be required, and any number of new streets and
                        alleys to be laid out, made, and kept up, which will impose a pretty heavy
                        borough tax on our citizens and for which the tax accruing from the property
                        annexed will be no equivalent. Notwithstanding these disadvantages the pride
                        every citizen must feel in the progress and improvement of our town will
                        prevent them from interposing any obstacle in the way of consumating this
                        measure. But if those who will alone reap the advantages expect to be coaxed
                        in we would rather see the project abandoned, and let our Council go to work
                        and levy a tax on all persons doing a regular business within the borough no
                        matter where their place of residence may be. These outsiders have all the
                        advantages the borough affords--make their money here--have the use of our
                        streets through which to haul their wood, brick, flour, and other products,
                        and do not contribute a single cent towards improving the town or keeping up
                        repairs. Let a sufficient tax, for borough purposes, be laid on all persons
                        of this description--their occupation--work done--amount of sales made
                        within the borough--money at interest, &amp;c., and then they will be
                        brought on an equal footing with our own citizens and justice be done to all
                        parties. We believe the Council have authority to enforce such a regulation,
                        or if not, they can readily get an Act passed giving them the power.</p>
                    <p>A measure of this character would we conceive operate with equal and exact
                        justice to all, and those who live out of the borough, but enjoy all its
                        advantages, would thereby be made to contribute towards removing the burden
                        of taxation by which our citizens are now oppressed in order to make
                        improvements and keep up the repairs of the town. As we have before stated
                        we are indifferent as to the result of this movement. We have no feeling in
                        the matter one way or another. If the persons residing in the suburbs of the
                        town desire to be admitted into the borough we think they are sensible, and
                        if the Council grant their request we have no fault to find with them for
                        their action. If on the contrary the Council reject that application for
                        admission, or a majority of the outsiders oppose it, we are equally content.</p>
                    <p>We understand the Council have, at the instance of the petitioners, made
                        several surveys to determine the exact boundary of the districts desiring to
                        be admitted. The first survey made the shape of the borough a perfect
                        octagon, but to obtain this figure it took in more territory than was
                        desired, or desirable to admit. The last survey, and the one we think likely
                        to be agreed upon, commences at a point east of the property belonging to
                        Mr. Jonothan Hawk on the Baltimore turnpike and running north to a point on
                        the C. V. R. Road, keeping east of the buildings on the Ritchey farm. From
                        the Railroad the line extends to the Gate- House on the northern turnpike
                        taking in a pretty large slice of ground north east of the Saw &amp;
                        Planing Mill of Messrs. Clark, Shepler &amp; Culbertson. The Gate House
                        is left immediately outside the line. From this point the line runs west to
                        the creek and then keeps the east side of the creek running south to the
                        cemetery, including the Straw Paper Mill and buildings on the farm of J.
                        Heyser, Esq. It then runs in the rear of the Cemetery grounds, crosses the
                        Strasburg road, and takes in the residence of Geo. Eyster, Esq., on "Federal
                        Hill." From this point a straight line is run to near Gordon's Tavern on the
                        Western turnpike. The Tavern being the place for holding the elections for
                        Hamilton township is left out. From Gordon's the line takes a direct course
                        to the property of Mr. Charles Burnett on the Greencastle road, taking in,
                        in its course, Wolfstown and the several log buildings immediately south of
                        the "Seceder Grave Yard." From the Greencastle Road a straight line is run
                        to the point of starting, passing in the rear of the property of Mr. Charles
                        Hutz--now the residence of P. W. Seibert, Esq. We have endeavored to
                        describe the course of the survey, divested of all technical terms, so that
                        its points may be readily understood by all our readers.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Fayetteville group is undertaking survey for railroad linking the two

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We learn with much pleasure that the citizens of Fayetteville, and the
                        eastern side of the county generally, are becoming interested in the
                        construction of the road. Several meetings to further the object in view
                        have been held, at which Committees were appointed to take up subscriptions
                        to defray the necessary expense attending an examination and survey, of the
                        contemplated line of road. The people of Fayetteville, and neighborhood,
                        have subscribed liberally towards carrying out these preliminary measures,
                        and they ask, and expect our citizens to co-operate with them, and furnish
                        their quota of pecuniary aid, to advance the undertaking. Fayetteville has
                        already contributed about eighty dollars towards paying expenses of the
                        survey, and in a few days our citizens will be waited upon by some gentlemen
                        of this place, interested in the project, to raise fifty dollars additional
                        which will be a sufficient sum to conduct the survey in a proper manner. We
                        have not the least doubt that our citizens will subscribe a sufficient
                        amount, for this purpose, without any hesitation, and that they will enter
                        into the movement with the right spirit, and a determination to push it
                        vigorously forward. Should the weather continue favorable the survey may be
                        made within the present month, and when that part of the work is
                        accomplished an Act of Incorporation may be obtained for the road during the
                        present session of our Legislature. We are all well convinced that a more
                        favorable time than the present could not have been selected for pressing
                        this important enterprise on the attention of the public, and that they men
                        who have started the project are the very men of all others to conduct it to
                        a successful completion.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--Died at the Franklin County Alms House, on Wednesday morning last, Mary
                        Earley, aged 77 years. The subject of this obituary notice was well known
                        throughout this neighborhood. She formerly resided in this place for many
                        years, but during the later period of her life, previous to becoming an
                        inmate of our Alms House, she was provided with a home in the family of Rev.
                        Wesley Howe, at Greenvillage. In addition to the hard lot of a life of
                        poverty was super-added an existence of the most agonizing physical
                        suffering, yet, amid all her trials and tribulations, she evinced a
                        sweetness of temper, a soft dignity of manners, and a meekness of
                        disposition that readily secured her the sympathy of every christian heart.
                        She was never heard to utter a murmur at her lot, but, on the contrary,
                        endured her sufferings with a patient resignation and truly christian
                        fortitude, manifesting an humble submission to the Divine Will and a firm
                        reliance on Him who "giveth grace unto the lowly." Her remains were brought
                        to this place, on Thursday last, and interred with appropriate religious
                        services, in the burial ground of the Methodist Church. A few friends, of
                        whom she had exacted the promise, followed her body to the grave and saw it
                        decently laid to rest.--The sum total of her worldly goods--her Bible and
                        her Spectacles--she bequeathed to the former Matron of the Alms House, Mrs.
                        Shenefield, as a mark of her gratitude for friendship and kindness.</p>
