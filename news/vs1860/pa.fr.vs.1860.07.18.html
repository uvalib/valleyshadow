<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A large and highly respectable meeting of the citizens of this place
                        convened at the Court House on Thursday evening last, for the purpose of
                        getting an expression of opinion favorable to the construction of Water
                        Works. It has been a habit in this place, after every fire, to call a town
                        meeting and agitate this subject. This may have a good result in shaping
                        public opinion for the future, but for the present it has effected nothing.
                        A resolution offered at the meeting that we have Water
                            Works was passed unanimously, and another that the borough authorities build them also passed without
                        a dissenting voice. The Council were then instructed to make the necessary
                        survey and estimates for the construction of the works, and report at a
                        subsequent meeting to be called by them for that purpose. This was the sum
                        total of the business transacted by the meeting. The Borough Council, in
                        compliance with the request of the meeting, met on Monday evening last, and
                        appointed I. H. McCauly, Esq., Chief Burgess, and James King and Calvin M.
                        Duncan, Esqs., members of the council, a committee to carry out the wishes
                        of the citizens expressed at the meeting.--These gentlemen will engage the
                        services of a competent engineer and enter upon their duties at once. This
                        important matter could not have been intrusted in more judicious and
                        competent hands than those selected by the Council. Thus far, everything
                        looks favorable--what the end will be we will not undertake to predict.</p>
                    <p>We ought to have water-works and if we do not construct them in our own day,
                        and enjoy their advantages, our posterity most assuredly will. The locality
                        is most favorable for constructing the works and supplying the town, through
                        all seasons of the year, with a sufficiency of the best and purest water for
                        all public and domestic purposes. A trifling additional borough tax, for a
                        few years, will meet the expense, which no good citizen will grumble at when
                        he can enjoy the invaluable blessing of an abundance of pure and wholesome
                        water, for drinking, cooking, washing, bathing, cleansing the streets and
                        every other useful and healthy purpose to which water may be applied; and
                        last, though not least, a sufficiency to protect his property in case of
                        fire. What are dollars and cents in comparison to the comforts and security
                        derived from an abundant supply of this pure element. None but the miserable
                        hoarder of dollars will say aught against a project so conducive to the
                        health and happiness of mankind.</p>

<b>The Late Fire</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Report of the pilfering that occurred at the site of the fire at the homes
                    of Mr. Ott, Mr. Deckelmayer, and Mr. Dittman.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We regret to state, for the credit of our town, that a considerable amount
                        of pilfering took place during the progress of the late fire at the
                        residence of Mr. Ott, Deckelmayer and Dittman. Mr. Deckelmayer lost a large
                        amount of goods--barrels of Crackers, bags of nuts, boxes of figs and
                        raisins, jars of candies, and many household articles. Mr. Dittman had also
                        many articles stolen among which was an excellent gun. Mr. Ott was also a
                        sufferer in this way to a considerable amount. We now have the best evidence
                        before us that our town is infested with petty thieves and let us go to work
                        to remedy the evil in the best way we can. Could not our Fire Companies
                        detail a police force of their best and most reliable men to remove and take
                        charge of goods at the time of a fire--stand guard over them and allow non
                        to handle them but themselves. The Hook and Ladder Company might readily
                        undertake this service, as they, we understand, have a large company and
                        could best spare their men from their apparatus. The men detailed in this
                        service should wear a badge to designate them, and should be sworn in as
                        special constables and have power to make arrests of all found pilfering.</p>
                    <p>We hope some member of the company will bring this matter up at their next
                        meeting and have this desirable measure carried out.</p>

                        The vast body of rock there is fast disappearing before the force of powder.</p>
                    <p>One thing should be guarded against by the workmen. The blasts are not

                        the academy, and had the school been in session, death, in all probability,
