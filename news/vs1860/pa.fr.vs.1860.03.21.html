<b>Election</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The election in this Borough on Friday last was unusually animated so far
                        as the South Ward was concerned, in the North Ward matters were conducted
                        with more moderation. The contest for Justice among our uptown neighbors was
                        quite interesting. T. L. Fletcher was the "regular nominee" of the
                        Republican party. Mr. Samuel Reisher, not liking the manner of the
                        nomination, placed himself on the track as an independent candidate and made
                        a very creditable run--beating the "regular nominee." Mr. H. B. Davison, the
                        Democratic candidate, however, came within a few votes of beating them both
                        and was, of course, elected with the balance of the Democratic ticket in
                        that Ward. The tickets elected in the respective Wards of this borough stand
                        as follows:--North Ward--Judge: W. C. Murry; Inspectors, J. W. Fletcher and
                        W. H. Boyle; Constable, R. F. McClellan; Assessor, Samuel Etter. South
                        Ward--Judge, George Ludwig; Inspectors, A. Martin and G. W. Heagy; Justice
                        of the Peace, H. B. Davison; Constable, Geo. Bittner. If the Election
                        officers in the townships over the county, will furnish us with the names of
                        those elected, particularly the Justices and Constables, we will publish
                        them without any charge, and will feel obliged to any one who will interest
                        himself in procuring them for us.</p>

<b>Gettysburg Railroad</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A survey was conducted for a rail route between Chambersburg and
                    Gettysburg. The results were more favorable than expected.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A company of gentlemen were engaged, last week, in a survey and examination
                        of a route for the contemplated Railroad between this place and Gettysburg.
                        They have found the location for the road more favorable than was
                        anticipated. From this place to the South Mountain the road will be almost
                        straight and of very easy grades. A gap has been discovered in the Mountain
                        through which the road can pass at a grade of less than fifty feet to the
                        mile. The survey will be continued on the other side of the Mountain and it
                        is thought, from a cursory examination, that a location for the road can be
                        found as favorable as on this side. The survey will be pushed on
                        energetically and in the course of a few weeks we will have the pleasure of
                        placing the report of the Engineer before our readers.</p>
