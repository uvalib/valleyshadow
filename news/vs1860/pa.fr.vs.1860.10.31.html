<b>Letter from E. C. Evans, of Chester County</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Evans, a delegate to the national Democratic convention, states that
                    opposition to Douglas at the convention was stifled by the "unit rule." Without
                    this rule, Douglas would not have gained a majority of the delegates. He argues
                    that this unjust rule precipitated the withdrawal of many of the state

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges Democrats to support the ticket and states that a vote for the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our citizens of Foreign birth who have been inveigled into the ranks of the
                        Opposition, should not neglect to post themselves on the antecedents of the
                        company they are keeping. Let us present two propositions for their
                        reflection before their active participancy in the election now near at
                        hand. Every citizen born in a foreign land who casts his vote with the
                        Opposition, gives that much strength and permanency to a party which under a
                        new name, in violation of the spirit of the Constitution and the recognized
                        policy of the founders of the Republic, would degrade and disgrace him. Who
                        are the present leaders of the so-called Republican party, even in
                        Pennsylvania? Are they not the men who assisted in the inauguration of that
                        vilest of doctrines, Know Nothingism? Are they not the very men, Adopted
                        Citizen, let us ask you, who promulgated and urged with all the ardor of
                        their souls, what would have been in effect your absolute disfranchisement?
                        Each and every one of you must certainly remember the bitter crusade these
                        men waged against your rights. No "Tariff" then claimed their attention. No
                        appeal was then made in behalf of "Freedom." "Free Homes for Free Men" was
                        not then their rallying cry. Their sole and darling sentiment was hostility
                        to the Foreigner, and in secret conclave they swore to give it thorough and
                        effective expression.</p>
                    <p>You, Adopted Citizen in the County of Franklin, now associated with the
                        Republican party, we ask you to bring to mind the eventful years when Know
                        Nothingism was in the ascendant and marched over the land conquering and to
                        conquer, do you not recognize in the champions of this new born party these
                        same men who then poured their vials of defamation and abuse on your devoted
                        heads? Believe not that this same spirit has fled from their hearts. It
                        still remains ready at the seasonable time to burst forth in all its
                        original fury. As the serpent charms, so does this Republican party now
                        charm and caress you only to make you an auxiliary instrument to your own
                        political destruction.</p>
                    <p>And Adopted Citizen, our second proposition to which we invite your serious
                        reflection is this. When those glorious privileges guaranteed to you by the
                        Constitution, political equality, the right of suffrage, eligibility to
                        office, in a word the possession of all that constitutes you an American
                        citizen, when, we say, these great privileges were about to be torn from you
                        and the record of there [sic] existence about to be blotted out; when jeers
                        and ridicule met you at almost every step; when persecution raged, and blood
                        followed the foot prints of many of your countrymen in some of our great
                        cities, what party placed itself as a wall of fire between you and your
                        enemies? What party battled with all the ardor and hopefulness of holy and
                        patriotic purpose, for your vindication and protection? And what party
                        eventually scattered your enemies as chaff before the wind, and in its
                        almost unparalleled success proved its devotion to your interest and its
                        great mission the preservation of the Constitution and the Union? Was it not
                        the Democratic party that performed all this? Was it not that great party
                        which knowing no North, no South, no East, no West, but only a complete and
                        undissevered Union that came to your rescue? History attests the fidelity of
                        the Democratic party to the interests of the citizens of our whole country,
                        be they citizens native, or adopted. The Democratic party is not the
                        offspring of yesterday. It came not on the wings of the morning to expire
                        with the shades of the evening. For more than fifty years it has embodied
                        the great conservative, patriotic and progressive spirit of the country.
                        Under its wise rule we have grown to be one of the first nations of the
                        earth in all that constitutes prosperity, usefulness and knowledge. And it
                        is to preserve our land in unity and peace and to complete the development
                        of the great work began by our Fathers that the Democratic party was formed
                        and will continue to exist despite the storms that rise upon its path. To
                        stand by this glorious organization, we appeal to every citizen be he from
                        the North or the South, be he from lands across the sea or a native of our
                        own soil. But more especially do we call upon our adopted citizens to
                        dispassionately examine the history of our party, to note the long line of
                        patriots and statesmen that have for more than a half century led its
                        columns to battle for the whole country and to
                        observe in our greatness and prosperity the beneficent result of Democratic
                        rule. Aid this great party by your suffrages and by so doing you protect
                        your own rights and contribute to the preservation of the Constitution and
                        perpetuity of the Union.</p>

                        building was erected by the Masons about forty years ago, we believe, but
                        upon the decadence of the order, in the times of the Anti-masonic fever, it
                        was sold, and had been used, for a number of years, by the German Reformed
                        Printing office and Book Bindery. The masons purchased it in the Spring, and
                        have fitted it up in magnificent style. The Lodge Room surpasses in beauty
                        any subordinate lodge in the State. The ceiling has been gracefully arched,
                        and with the sides, has been tastefully frescoed by an experienced artist
                        from Baltimore. It is furnished in a most elegant manner; and throughout
                        reflects great credit upon the liberality of the order, and upon the
                        committee who had charge of the repairs.</p>
                    <p>District Deputy Grand Master Lamberton was present, and conducted the

                        more elegant temple, and hope they may long flourish to do honor to their
                        outer Lodge and its mysterious inner principles.</p>

                        thousands of boys belonging to worthy, respectable families who are
                        permitted night after night to select their own company and places of
                        resort, are on a certain road to ruin. Confiding parents, who believe that
                        THEIR sons are safe--that they will not associate with the vicious--will one
                        of these days have their hearts crushed, as thousands have before, by
                        learning that sons whom they regarded a proof against any evil, have from
                        very early years, on the road to ruin.</p>

<b>Now is the Time</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reminds young unmarried women that leap year, when women are allowed to do
                    the courting, is almost over. By the time the next leap years occurs, these
                    women will be old maids. They should thus make good use of the remaining year.<br>

                    <p> For the benefit of a number of young ladies we wot [sic] of we would just
                        mention that they should remember that a few more weeks will wind up leap
                        year, and then if they have not made good use of the time, their legal period to do the courting in will have passed
                        away, and before leap year comes again they will have become old maids, an
                        institution which is now-a-days dreaded as much as the itch. Girls make good
                        use of the coming few weeks in the present year. Rig up yourselves, trim
                        your sails and go out into the street and captivate whom ye can.</p>
