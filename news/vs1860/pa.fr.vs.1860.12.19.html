<b>Opinion of the Attorney General</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reply of the Attorney General to the President's request for clarification
                    of the law relating to the government's right to protect the South Carolina
                    forts from attack.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Can the Union be Saved?</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The South is totally without the power of self-protection because the
                    government is under Republican control. In order for the South to remain in the
                    Union, some means must be found that would allow the region to protect itself.
                    Mr. Roane proposes that an amendment to the Constitution be adopted "requiring
                    for the passage, now and hereafter, of any law affecting the institution of
                    slavery, a majority of votes from both the slaveholding and non-slaveholding
                    States for the time being in each branch of the Federal Legislature."<br>

<b>News of the Week</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit believes that there is no hope for conciliation on the part of
                    the North. A large group of people gathered in Philadelphia to pass resolutions
                    that expressed love for the Union, condemned the denunciation of slavery and
                    pledged to repeal laws that obstructed the operation of the Fugitive Slave Law.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Howell Cobb's Resignation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Howell Cobb resigned as Secretary of the Treasury because his sense of duty
                    to the state of Georgia required that he no longer be a member of the Cabinet.
                    The Spirit believes that this action bodes very ill because Cobb in the past had
                    always supported Union over secession. However, he argued that the South
                    couldn't stay in the Union after the Republicans gained power.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Democratic Prediction Fulfilled</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Democrats warned the nation that Lincoln's election would lead to the
                    dissolution of the Union. Their prediction is now coming true.<br>

<b>Col. McClure "Feeling His Oats"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Analyzes a speech given by Col. McClure, a possible nominee for the Senate.
                    McClure stated that he would teach the South a lesson of submission not soon to
                    be forgotten. The Spirit warns that, if a war against the South should occur,
                    southern Pennsylvania will "feel the heaviest shock of war. It is your homes
                    that will be desolated, your towns that will be pillaged and your fruitful
                    fields that will be laid waste."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Letters to the People, No. 1</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

<b>Address of Certain Southern Senators and Members of Congress</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Southern Senators believe that "all hope of relief in the Union through
                    the agency of committees, congressional legislation or constitutional amendments
                    is extinguished." As a result, they think that the South should form a
                    Confederacy.<br>
