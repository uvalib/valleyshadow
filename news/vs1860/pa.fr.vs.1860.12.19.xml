                <origin/>
                <commentary>The article is written by Mr. A. Roane, of Washington city, the author
                    of "The South in the Union or out of it."</commentary>

                <summary>The South is totally without the power of self-protection because the
                    government is under Republican control. In order for the South to remain in the
                    Union, some means must be found that would allow the region to protect itself.
                    Mr. Roane proposes that an amendment to the Constitution be adopted "requiring
                    for the passage, now and hereafter, of any law affecting the institution of
                    slavery, a majority of votes from both the slaveholding and non-slaveholding
                    States for the time being in each branch of the Federal Legislature."</summary>

                <summary>The Spirit believes that there is no hope for conciliation on the part of
                    the North. A large group of people gathered in Philadelphia to pass resolutions
                    that expressed love for the Union, condemned the denunciation of slavery and
                    pledged to repeal laws that obstructed the operation of the Fugitive Slave Law.</summary>

                <summary>Howell Cobb resigned as Secretary of the Treasury because his sense of duty
                    to the state of Georgia required that he no longer be a member of the Cabinet.
                    The Spirit believes that this action bodes very ill because Cobb in the past had
                    always supported Union over secession. However, he argued that the South
                    couldn't stay in the Union after the Republicans gained power.</summary>

                <summary>Analyzes a speech given by Col. McClure, a possible nominee for the Senate.
                    McClure stated that he would teach the South a lesson of submission not soon to
                    be forgotten. The Spirit warns that, if a war against the South should occur,
                    southern Pennsylvania will "feel the heaviest shock of war. It is your homes
                    that will be desolated, your towns that will be pillaged and your fruitful
                    fields that will be laid waste."</summary>
