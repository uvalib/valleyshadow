<b>Valuation of Franklin County</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Franklin County delegation protested to Board of Revenue Commissioners over
                    the county's valuation of taxable property.<br>(Names in announcement:   Eyster,   McLellan,   Nill,   McClure,   Rowe)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The Board of Revenue Commissioners which meet tri-ennially to determine the
                        valuation of all taxable property, in the several counties of the
                        Commonwealth, and adjust and equalize the same, had the following
                        proceedings before it while Franklin County was under consideration.</p>
                    <p>The assessed valuation returned to the Revenue Board, by the Commissioners of
                        this county, as the assessment for 1860 amounted to $11,043,877. To this sum
                        the Board added one million of dollars as the Valuation for Franklin County,
                        making the total valuation upon which the tax for the next three years would
                        be assessed $12,043,877.</p>
                    <p>This action of the Board seemed unjust to Franklin County when compared with
                        the valuation at which other counties of the Commonwealth, of greater wealth
                        and population, are rated. Mr. Eyster, County Commissioner, together with
                        Messrs. McLellan, Nill, McClure and Rowe, appeared before the Board, and by
                        their representations convinced them of their unfairness in adjusting the
                        valuation of Franklin County. The Board thereupon struck off half a million
                        of dollars leaving the actual valuation for 1860 at $11,548,877, which is a
                        reduction on the previous valuation of 1857 of $1,525,307. and consequently
                        effecting a reduction on our State Tax of $3,781.25.</p>
                    <p>We have always contended that Franklin County was rated too high, in
                        comparison with other counties, and thereby compelled to pay an unjust
                        proportion of State Tax. As the valuation now stands we are placed on a more
                        equal footing with other counties, and tax-payers should feel themselves
                        under obligations to the gentlemen through whose instrumentality the
                        reduction was effected.</p>

<b>Extension of the Borough</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Town Council agreed to extend borough lines to include portions of Guilford
                    Township.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--At a meeting of the Town Council, on Monday evening last, it was determined
                        to extend the borough lines so as to admit the portion of Guilford township
                        praying to be annexed. An Ordinance to this effect was unanimously passed by
                        the Council and will be published in the papers, of this place, the present
                        week. We described the boundary of the territory, desiring to be admitted,
                        in an article published in the Spirit, on the
                        Extension of the Borough, a few weeks ago. We extend the hand of welcome to
                        Kerrstown, Broad-Lane, Ripper's Point, Clarksville, &amp;c., and trust
                        they will deport themselves with becoming dignity since we have extended the
                        egis of our municipal authority over them. Couldn't we have some bon-fires
                        over the "consolidation?"--This triumph over Old Fogyism certainly deserves
                        some public demonstration.</p>

                        popular lecturers of the day. We are glad to find his talents and social
