<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>THE BALL IN MOTION!</p>
                    <p>In response to the call published last week, a large meeting of the Democracy
                        of the borough of Chambersburg was held at the Public House of A. J. Brand,
                        on Saturday evening, July 7th inst., for the organization of a Douglas
                        Johnson club.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was called to order by Hon. Wilson Reilly, on whose motion James
                        Nill was chosen President. On motion of Mr. Hamsher, D. W. Rowe, was
                        selected as Secretary. Judge Nill, on taking the chair, addressed the
                        meeting at length on the exigencies of the party, reviewing the action of
                        the Charleston and Baltimore Conventions.</p>
                    <p>William Kennedy, Esq., then presented the following preamble and resolutions,
                        which were unanimously adopted:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, In these troublous times in our national
                        history, it becomes the duty of every good citizen to avow his belief before
                        the world; and whereas, the Democracy of Chambersburg have assembled in in
                        council, to-night, to sustain the time honored doctrines of the party,
                        therefore, be it,</p>
                    <p>Resolved, that, as the Democratic State Convention
                        which assembled at Reading, and the National Democratic Conventions which
                        met at Charleston and Baltimore, during the present year, reaffirmed the
                        principles for which the party has battled in the past, and to which she is
                        irrevocably committed for the future, it is the duty of every Democratic
                        organization to recognize such platform as the creed of the party, and that
                        every failure to give adhesion to those principles, by individuals or
                        organizations, places those individuals and organizations outside the
                        Democratic Family.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we heartily endorse the Nominations
                        of Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois, for the Presidency, and Herschel V.
                        Johnson, of Georgia, for the Vice Presidency; recognizing in them the only
                        regular Democratic Nominees, for those high offices, no before all the
                        people, and pledging to them, one and all of us, a faithful, earnest, and
                        uncompromising support.-- We do so believing that their election, and the
                        triumph of the principles on which they stand, will give peace to the
                        country and permanency to our institutions.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in the nomination of Henry D.
                        Foster, for Governor, the Democracy have presented to the people of
                        Pennsylvania, one of their most talented, fearless, and incorruptible fellow
                        citizens. One in every way worthy the support of conservative, national men,
                        one whom it will be a duty and a privilege to sustain, and a pleasure to
                        elect.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we unhesitatingly repudiate the
                        action of a part of the Pennsylvania State Central Committee which met at
                        Philadelphia, on Monday, July 2nd, in offering a pretended compromise on the
                        electoral ticket of this State, believing it to be a cheat and a fraud on
                        the nominees of the party, and the favorites of the masses, a proposition
                        disgraceful to the proposers, and insulting to the regular organization;
                        that we desire no compromise with the enemies of the Democracy, whether they
                        be northern Republicans or southern Disunionists. Believing the ultimate aim
                        of each to be a dissolution of the Union; and that we desire to have a full
                        electoral ticket, pledged unequivocally to the support of the nominees of
                        the party, Stephen A. Douglas and Herschell V. Johnson.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That these resolutions be signed by the
                        officers of the meeting, and published in the Chambersburg Valley Spirit.</p>
                    <p>After the passage of the resolutions, Hon. Wilson Reilly, on request,
                        addressed the meeting in earnest support of Judge Douglas.</p>
                    <p>On motion, the president appointed D. W. Rowe, H. C. Keyser, and W. Kennedy,
                        Esq's, a committee to prepare a constitution for the government of the club.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Mr. Keyser, the president was requested to write out his
                        address* of this evening for publication in the Valley
                            Spirit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. B. F. Nead moved that when the meeting adjourn, it adjourn to meet at the
                        Public House of John Reilly, on Friday evening next, which was carried.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>
                    
                        
                            Attest

                            Secretary.
                        
                    
                    <p>*Judge Nill has complied with this request; his very able speech will appear

                    <p>--On Tuesday afternoon, (yesterday, after part of our paper had already been
                        printed.) a fire broke out in the residence of Mr. Samuel Ott, near the
                        corner of Maine and Washington streets, and was not arrested until it had
                        consumed four buildings in that neighborhood. The fire originated from a
                        stove on the attic of Mr. Ott's house.--A widow lady, Mrs. Rosenburg,
                        occupied the upper portion of one of Mr. Ott's houses, and had the stove
                        placed in the attic story for the purpose of cooking through the summer; in
                        this stove she had kindled a fire and left it and went down stairs, and in
                        fifteen minutes after, the whole upper part of the house was in flames.</p>
                    <p>The fire spread rapidly over the two buildings owned by Mr. Ott, which were
                        totally consumed, and to the residence and confectionary establishment of
                        Mr. Joseph Deckelmayer, and the property of Mr. John Dittman adjoining. The
                        upper portion and back building of Mr. Deckelmayer's house was burnt out and
                        the lower story &amp; other room so much damaged by fire and water as to
                        require to be re-built. The roof was destroyed on the building owned by Mr.
                        Dittman and the house otherwise very much damaged. By the noble exrrtions of
                        our firemen and citizens the flames were arrested at this point, when every
                        one at the scene of conflagration predicted the destruction of the whole
                        square of buildings.</p>
