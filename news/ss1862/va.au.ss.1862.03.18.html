<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>[From the Richmond Whig.]</p>
                    <p>Ex-Governor Smith has entitled himself to the gratitude of his countrymen, by
                        his well-timed resolution in Congress, which contemplates the summary
                        displacement of every military officer, who, under any circumstances, may be
                        found in a state of intoxication. Drunkenness in a military officer, is not
                        merely a vice, it is a crime. And if we are to measure the atrocity of
                        crimes, by the evil consequences which flow from them, it is a crime of the
                        darkest dye. The murder of an individual is, by the decalogue, and the laws
                        of all nations, classed among the highest offences of all nations, classed
                        among the highest offences of which a man may be guilty. But what is the
                        murder of an individual, compared with the wholesale slaughter of a company,
                        a regiment, or an army occasioned by the misconduct of officers, caused by
                        drunkenness? The safety and welfare, not only of men who compose the army,
                        but of the women and children, and of all who remain at home, is entrusted
                        to the officers in command of the army. The proper discharge of this trust
                        requires sleepless vigilance, untiring energy, wisdom in council, and
                        promptness in action. There is no position in which a man can be placed, in
                        which it is so necessary for him to have all his intellectual faculties, and
                        physical energies, unobscured and unimpaired by any extraneous influences.
                        The officer, then, who in the hour of danger beclouds his reason, and
                        enfeebles his strength, by intemperance, is a traitor to his country, and
                        forfeits every just claim to confidence and respect.</p>
                    <p>We trust that Gov. Smith will press his resolution with his accustomed
                        energy, and we can hardly doubt, that Congress will have the patriotism, and
                        good sense, to adopt it.</p>
                    <p>We should be pleased to see the reform pushed still further. We should like
                        to see drunkenness made a disqualification for any office, civil or
                        military. The President ought to appoint no intemperate man to office, and
                        if he does, the Senate ought promptly to reject the nomination. Now is the
                        time to introduce this wholesome reform. If it be adopted, it will do more
                        to repress intemperance, than all the Temperance Associations in the land.
                        You have only to let it be known that intemperance is an insuperable bar to
                        official preferment, and you will at once bring the vice into disrepute.</p>
                    <p>The people and the political parties of the country have much to answer for
                        in this particular. They have heretofore looked only to the party relations
                        of candidates, without regard to their moral character, or fitness for the
                        stations whey were called on to fill. Hence, many seats in our Legislative
                        Assemblies, both State and Federal, has been filled by intemperate men. The
                        old Congress was often the theatre of drunken brawls, and our own
                        Legislative halls have witnessed similar exhibitions. It is a matter of
                        public notoriety, that, within a few years past, the Senate of Virginia, on
                        several occasions, has been compelled to adjourn, at an early hour, in
                        consequence of the turbulent conduct of some of its members, superinduced by
                        intoxication. Nor has the House of Delegates been exempt from similar
                        disorders.</p>
                    <p>As the old system has passed away, we hope these evils will pass away with
                        it. We might as well expect figs from thistles, as sober legislation from
                        drunken legislators.</p>
                    <p>We call attention to this subject, at this early day, in the hope that our
                        patriotic contemporaries of the press, and the people generally, will unite
                        with us in an earnest effort to root out, effectually, this crying evil. Let
                        us all unite, heart and hand, in the effort to exclude from all public
                        offices all intemperate men. We care not where it strikes or whom it
                        strikes. At the next election let this test be made paramount to all others.
                        It matters not how shining a man's abilities may be, how extensive his
                        capacities for usefulness, we know that, if he is a drunkard, we cannot rely
                        on him. He may be unfit for service when there is the most urgent demand for
                        his assistance. Let the line be distinctly drawn, and let no intemperate man
                        be elected to Congress or the General Assembly, or any other public station.
                        The men who fill the high places of the land ought to be bright examples to
                        the masses. By electing intemperate men to office, we give dignity and
                        respectability to the vice itself.</p>
                    <p>This is the way to cut up the evil by the roots. It will not do to dodge the
                        issue by a war upon whiskey, and make the innocent farmers pay the penalty
                        of the misconduct of drunken men. It is not the whiskey that is in fault,
                        but the bad men who abuse it. Whiskey will hurt no one, if he will let it
                        alone. It is a very good thing in its place--nay, almost a necessary. The
                        abuse and not the use of it, is the evil, and those who war against it act
                        with as much reason as the boy who breaks the stone against which he stumped
                        his toe!</p>
                    <p>Let the test in all future elections then be: "Is he honest? Is he capable?
                        Is he sober? Is he faithful to the Constitution? What say our brethren of
                        the Press?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>William Whitmore, Esq.</p>
                    <p>[Published by Request.] <br>Richmond, VA. <br>March 7th, 1862. </p>
                    <p>Wm. Whitmore, Esq.: </p>
                    <p>DEAR SIR: Yours dated 27th of Feb. is just received. I am obliged not less
                        for the suggestions and facts furnished, than for the courteous manner in
                        which you convey them. You do me no more than justice in saying you "are
                        well assured of my disposition to represent the sentiments of my
                        constituents when informed of them on any mooted question." If others had
                        taken the pains you have to furnish me facts bearing on this public
                        question, they would have done their cause much more good and saved
                        themselves very profitless trouble in denouncing me for "opposing" in its
                        then shape, a bill they had never seen, and which, for aught they knew,
                        would not only fail to secure the end they desired, but would instead
                        inflict an injury on the interests of both themselves and their neighbors.</p>
                    <p>If they think to deter me from doing what my judgement [sic] dictates as a
                        representative duty, by mere "threats never to vote for me again," it is
                        simply a great mistake. Let them first convince my mind by facts and
                        arguments; and no representative can more cheerfully yield his own opinions
                        to arguments, showing that he may have been mistaken therein as to the best
                        interests of his constituents. But I can never vote for or against a bill
                        contrary to the conviction of my own judgement merely for fear of losing
                        votes for myself.</p>
                    <p>The effect of a bill is often a very different thing from what its reported
                        title would indicate. Many persons have regretted my so called opposition to
                        the anti-distillation bill on the idea that the bill would suppress
                        drunkenness in the army and the country; they
                        will be surprised to learn that its author declares in the Senate that
                            "it was not intended or expected to diminish
                            intemperance," and some of the strongest
                            temperance men oppose the bill in its present shape because it
                        will not have that effect; and in fact so far from "opposing" that, I
                        suggested an amendment tending to make it more effectual for that purpose. This illustrates the injustice of
                        condemning a representative before the effect of his course can possibly be
                        known to his very indignant constituent whose wishes he may really be
                        representing all the while! Opposition to a bill in its progress by no means
                        necessarily indicates opposition to it when perfected for passage. </p>
                    <p>One man asks if I "regard myself the representative of the hundred distillers
                        of Augusta?" Of course I do, but not more or less so than every other
                        interest of every other citizen of my country; and it is my solemn duty to
                        see that the lawful interests of any and every such citizen shall not be
                        unnecessarily and unjustly injured; and never injured in any way unless
                        satisfied that the public good requires and will be promoted by the
                        individual sacrifice. The passage of this bill on the principles it
                        contained when first presented, would, in my judgement, have opened wide the
                        door for seizure of grain yet in possession of the farmer; of bacon on hand;
                        and beef fattening for sale; of leather in the tanneries and stores; of
                        shoes, clothing, &amp;c., &amp;c., in the shops of my county. I
                        regard it a high representative duty in any such case to scrutinize closely
                        the measures proposed, and if the blow must fall for the public good, to see
                        that while the public good may be none the less promoted, yet that the
                        interests of my country-men shall suffer as little as possible from that
                        blow; and this too without reference to my private opinion as to the
                        propriety of any particular business concerned, provided only it is then
                        lawful.</p>
                    <p>It is admitted by its advocates that this particular bill will not diminish the drunkenness of the army or
                        country; but under the high prices its passage will induce, mean liquors
                        from other States will flood the land, and distillers of fruits, vegetable,
                        &amp;c. will be re-doubled all over our own State. While its passage
                            cannot increase the quantity of corn now
                        left, it may encourage the farmer from planting this spring, both because
                        this market is cut off for the present, and also for fear the Legislature
                        may pursue such policy in future and again by law reduce still lower the
                        profits of his labor. While if the price be left undisturbed by law the
                        planters of cotton and tobacco, stimulated by the high prices of corn, will
                        plant it in all their fields, and thus make it abundant and cheap in the end
                        is the only effectual mode. Natural laws regulate such matters far better
                        than hastily constituted human laws can do. </p>
                    <p>But besides opening wide the door for vicious legislation this bill will have
                            some certain effects: It at once cuts off a
                        revenue at not less than $300,000 this year, and
                        raises the taxes that much more at once on every thing else already groaning
                        with the burden; and by depriving the farmer of his only profitable crop,
                        deprive him at the same time of the means for paying this increased tax, as
                        well as the high prices, daily growing higher, for every thing he has to
                        buy. As for the distillers now working under a license for which they paid
                        the State its own price, with property in which the State has induced them
                        to invest their means, relying on the hitherto unbroken faith of the proud
                        old Commonwealth, this bill as it originally stood, providing for no
                        previous notice, but going into force immediately on its passage, would
                        subject every distiller of Augusta instantly to fines, confiscation of his
                        property and imprisonment of his person! </p>
                    <p>In the short space of this letter I can only give you the prominent
                        characteristics of this bill at the time I "opposed" it. The numbers you
                        report as in favor of "the bill" can scarcely expect me not to oppose such a
                        bill. You mean of course that they desired a bill on the subject that will
                        if possible, check intemperance in times like these, and save grain for
                        other purposes, and yet that the bill shall do no unnecessary evil or
                        injustice to our citizens lawfully engaged now in distillation. I will
                        cheerfully represent their wishes thus far, and it is what I have myself
                        desired; but this bill will be "opposed" a long while yet before it can be made available for anything but evil.
                        This bill when understood can hardly have as many
                        friends as your letter seems to suppose. The temperance men as such can find
                        no comfort from it. The farmer who has grain to sell will find no comfort
                        from it; the farmer who has grain to sell will find it only reduces the
                        price he gets, without curing the evil he abhors; the farmer who has sold
                        his grain at a price, it may be, enhanced by the distiller's demand, cannot
                        be so ungenerous as to see his neighbor deprived of a like price wherewith
                        to pay the increased tax and support the prices of living: they who live in
                        towns, and incur none of the labor of growing grain can take no pleasure in
                        seeing the farmer above ground to dust merely that they may for a short time get his products for comparatively
                        nothing; the taxes on all will be increased. As for the speculators in
                        stores of liquors on hands looking for the bill to increase its price;
                        speculators in stock-feeding looking for increased profits in proportion as
                        corn is bought lower which they have to buy &amp;c., &amp;c., when
                        they may find in this bill yet an unexpected "rod in pickle." </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile as this bill is being perfected or defeated, the people are not
                        without remedy; flour for bread is the cheapest thing in market; bacon as
                        well as whiskey, is making even at the distilleries; and the government has
                        exercised and can yet do it, the power to seize all grain while any
                        distiller may refuse to sell for the wants of the army, and may stop all
                        distilleries, and burst up all barrels of whiskey to prevent drunkenness, if
                        it sees fit, without waiting for "this bill" to
                        pass. And the people, if so universally opposed to the consumption of grain
                        in this way, have the right to refuse selling to distillers at all, and can
                        sell to the needy poor at as low a price as charity requires without waiting
                        for a "law" to require it. In the meantime accept my best wishes, and also
                        my assurance that I will continue (as I have always endeavored.) to do the
                        best I can for the general interests of my country, and if the people are
                        not satisfied let them try to find another, who, if he can't please
                        everybody, may try his turn. But I doubt if any
                        one will be found perfect until the millennial
                        legislature meets. </p>
                    <p>Yours Respectfully, <br>BOLIVAR CHRISTIAN. </p>
                    <p>P.S. As to exempting the Legislators from militia draft, that on reflection
                        will be seen simply a necessity; certainly not
                        selfishness on my part, as I have been in service ever since the first day
                        of the war except while in winter quarters, and I am now enlisted for the
                        war. If those objecting do as much the draft will not disturb them. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following, from one of our Southern exchanges, has the ring of the true
                        metal in it, and is just the spirit for the present juncture:</p>
                    <p>The South has not yet fought as it can fight, for the mistaken policy of its
                        rulers was that time the canker of waste eating up the enemy's resources,
                        and foreign intervention, would save it that trouble and sacrifice. That
                        spell is broken, thank God! Now it is fight or perish as a people--it is
                        freedom or slavery to the living generation. The true man will answer--"a
                        thousand times rather a Yankee bullet than a Yankee task-master, and if our
                        countrymen prove craven, and yield, and the bullet is escaped, voluntary
                        exile from a subjugated land shall be my doom."</p>
                    <p>The Yankees are not within a thousand years, much less sixty days, of the
                        conquest. After all our coasts are beleaguered, and our frontier towns
                        captured, we have still the heart of the Confederacy to defend in its hills
                        and fastnesses [sic]. "Italy was overrun by the Carthagenians, under
                        Hannibal, and Spain by Napoleon--perhaps the two greatest leaders in ancient
                        or modern times. Yet both were defeated, and driven back from the soil they
                        had occupied. Prussia, likewise, was overrun by France, Russia and Austria;
                        yet were they driven back by Frederick, after bloody defeats on his part,
                        leaving twenty and thirty thousand dead men on the field.</p>
                    <p>Greece, with 800,000 people, fought the Turks with thirty millions of
                        population for seven years, and at last saved its independence. We can be
                        free if we will, but it is only by arousing the whole people to arms.</p>
