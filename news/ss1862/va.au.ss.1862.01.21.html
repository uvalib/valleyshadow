<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lynchburg Republican</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Lynchburg Republican takes a hopeful view of affairs and expresses the
                        conviction that the North will be unable to prosecute the war longer than
                        the present year. With an empty treasury, a ruined credit, an enormous
                        public debt, and heavy taxation, it is impossible for her to maintain
                        hostilities of such gigantic proportions as those which the war has now
                        assumed. The Northern volunteers are not fighting from patriotism or for
                        defence, but for pay, and when they cease to get that, they will cease to be
                        soldiers. The grand army will melt away like morning mist, and
                        disorganization and mutiny be the order of the day. The people of the North,
                        too, will proclaim for peace when the tax collector goes around with his
                        drafts upon their purses for the money to foot army bills.--Direct taxation
                        at the rate of three or four hundred millions a year, is more than the
                        dollar-loving Yankee is going to stand. Their attachment to the "glorious
                        Union," and to the "Stars and Stripes," were never known to equal their love
                        of the dime. Patriotism was never known to interfere with their purse. They
                        commenced the war as a money making operation. The loss of the South is a
                        loss of two hundred millions of dollars to the Yankees, but to conquer the
                        South will cost them at least $600,000,000 per annum. This fact is just
                        beginning to break upon their astonished visions. The New York Herald says
                        that something must be done or universal panic and bankruptcy will prevail
                        in the North. "The money question is assuming an alarming shape against six
                        hundred millions of expenditure."--Thus speaks the Herald. The people will
                        soon echo the sentiment, and the administration will be left without money
                        and without friends.</p>
                    <p>But this is not all. The leading minds of the North are now satisfied that to
                        conquer the South is an impossibility. They are running up millions of debt,
                        therefore, for nothing, which will become a permanent tax upon them and
                        their posterity. The prospects of becoming involved in disastrous
                        hostilities with England and France, are imminent, and will constitute an
                        almost insuperable basis to a prolonged war. We think it highly probable,
                        however, that in view of all these impending difficulties, which throw such
                        a deep gloom over the North, the Federal authorities will make a desperate
                        effort to force our lines and achieve a series of brilliant victories, upon
                        which they can afford to retire with some degree of honor from the contest.
                        A party in a desperate strait is almost sure to resort to desperate means to
                        extricate itself. But all the South has to do is, to remain firm and
                        vigilant, and relax not a single nerve until the struggle is over.</p>

                    According to the writer, the Confederates decided to retire when they realized
                    how outnumbered they were. They were not routed, as a "Yankee account falsely
                    reported, as is usual with them."<br>

                    is in fact an "inseparable part of the Southern Confederacy," but he pleads with

                    measure, and purify this country for once and forever of its great bitterness.
