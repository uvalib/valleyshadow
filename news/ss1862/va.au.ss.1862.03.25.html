<b>Thousands Disabled</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article alleges that many thousands of people in Virginia are stricken with
                    disease. The article continues, however that the political disease of treason
                    may also be taking hold in Augusta and Rockbridge as some citizens were seeking
                    refuge behind enemy lines but are detained by Confederate pickets.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the performance of our duties as a journalist for a number of years we
                        have had to record many disasters and unfortunate casualties, but though we
                        have mentioned many that have been occasioned by cars running off the track,
                        the explosion of powder magazines, the bursting of boilers on Steamboat and
                        Railroad engines, the falling of houses, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
                        and all the "moving accidents of flood and field," yet we have never been
                        called upon to record such a number of persons disabled by any or all of
                        these agencies combined as have been caused by an occurrence which recently
                        happened in this State. The 10th of March marks an epoch in the history of
                        this State, for on that day a countless host of disabled men were evoked
                        from the bosom of this State, and it was made manifest that our good old
                        mother had a vast number of weak, enfeebled, diseased, crippled, deformed,
                        and sickly children--many shaky in the knees, weak in the back, and
                        faint-hearted. If our weakness be our strength, and our host of disabled men
                        our shield of defence, our State is indeed invincible. Some may think that
                        Gov. Letcher is guilty of treason in giving "aid and comfort to the enemy"
                        by exhibiting, by his proclamation of the 10th inst., the disabled condition
                        of our people, but the "second sober thought" will convince them that he has
                        doubtless deterred the enemy from advancing any farther into our State by
                        showing them the danger of attempting to occupy a country which is so sickly
                        as to have so many thousands of diseased and disabled citizens. If the
                        climate be so unhealthy to native citizens, they will naturally and
                        reasonably infer that it must prove fatal to unacclimated invaders, and will
                        avoid its soil as they would a house of pestilence. We would not be
                        surprised if the Governor would issue a proclamation publishing the number,
                        (if the enumeration table could furnish a number sufficiently large) of
                        disabled exempts, for the purpose of expelling the enemy from the State. We
                        think if he would do so that the enemy would do what Lincoln commanded us to
                        do--"disperse and go to their homes"--they would leave the State in
                        "double-quick," and fly from it as from a city of the plague.</p>
                    <p>Some from the counties of Rockingham and Augusta not physically, but
                        politically diseased, having, it is surmised, the plague spot of treason
                        upon their souls, in very unpatriotic and unmilitary style marched of with
                        the view of leaving "Dixie's land," where they should have taken their
                        "stand," and getting within the lines of the enemy. Before reaching the
                        lines of the enemy, however, they were taken in charge by the Confederate
                        pickets and escorted to Staunton. As their cases were so bad, as to be
                        beyond the skill of the rural disciples of Aesculapius they were sent on to
                        the Metropolis where the proper treatment adapted to such desperate cases
                        could be administered. It may be possible that they were more rash than
                        brave, and patriotic beyond the limits of prudence, were too impatient to
                        meet the enemy to await the word of command. They could not wait till they
                        reported to Gen'l Jackson and then march to the conflict, but ran to meet
                        the enemy at the nearest point.</p>

<b>The Enemy in Retreat - The Valley Safe</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<b>Free Fighters</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    of the valley to raise guerilla units of free fighters, governed by their own

<b>Perifdy of the Month</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article reports that Jeff Davis recommended that prisoners put on parole by
                    the Yankee Government be released from this obligation so as to be able to bear
                    arms for the South. This is suggested in retaliation for breaches of good faith
                    by the Federal Government.<br>

<b>Union Prisoners</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article reports that 72 persons of Augusta and Rockbridge counties were
                    trying to "work their way" into enemy lines to avoid the levy and the draft.
                    Those apprehended were members of the Tunker denomination and pacifists. The
                    article assumes their action was an effort to avoid being participants in the
                    war for either side.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday last, under charge of some of the members of the Churchville
                        Cavalry of this county, seventy-two prisoners were brought to this place,
                        and, on the next morning, sent to Richmond. These were persons who, to avoid
                        the general levy as well as the draft, were attempting to "work their way"
                        into the lines of the enemy when they were captured and brought here. The
                        majority of them were citizens of Rockingham and the others were citizens of
                        Augusta county. As most of them were members of the Tunker denomination and
                        non-combatants by profession and practice, we suppose their conduct be
                        attributable to a desire to avoid being participants in the war either on
                        one side or the other. Unless we be mistaken, if they sympathize with the
                        enemy, they are not true exponents of the great mass of the members of that
                        church. They are good and harmless citizens in times of peace, and we cannot
                        believe them to be traitors in times of war.</p>
                    <p>Col. Ashby's Cavalry captured eighteen of the same class of persons from
                        Rockingham county whilst on their way to the lines of the enemy. They had 18
                        good horses and $6,000 in gold and silver.</p>

<b>Martial Law</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article reports that many citizens have petitioned the President to declare
                    martial law in Augusta as to cease the sale of ardent spirits. The article
                    thinks this a rash desire.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A number of our citizens have petitioned the President to proclaim martial
                        law in this place, for the purpose of preventing the sale of ardent spirits,
                        and to secure the arrest of persons who are disloyal to the Confederacy, if
                        there be such in this community. We hope there is not a disloyal man amongst
                        us, but if there be, he should be placed where he would be unable to do the
                        Southern cause any injury. We do not believe there is a traitor in this
                        community.</p>
                    <p>Many who signed the petition for martial law have doubtless done so without
                        reflecting upon the character of it--they looked alone to the evils which
                        they knew it would immediately remedy, without looking to the greater evils
                        which it would inflict upon the community by the suspension of all civil law
                        and the sacrifice of all personal liberty--it suspends the writ of habeas corpus which can only be justified in cases
                        of the extremest necessity, and is a total surrender of all liberty into the
                        keeping of whoever may be appointed Provost Marshal. It would be a
                        re-enactment of the folly of the frogs in the fable when they exchanged King
                        Log for King Stork, and we would probably rue it as bitterly as they did.
                        Let the civil authorities perform their duties, and there will be no use for
                        Martial law. </p>
