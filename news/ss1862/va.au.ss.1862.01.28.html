<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Augusta (GA) Constitutionalist</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Augusta (Ga.) Constitutionalist says that the
                        Yankee scheme of Southern conquest is rapidly hastening to a denouement and to the Yankees it is a disastrous
                        one, indeed. They have already lost more than France lost by the calamitous
                        battle of Pavia; for they have lost their honor. What little prestige was left them after the Bull Run
                        catastrophe they ignominiously lost in the Mason and Slidell back down. Now,
                        the Yankee Government stands, with all its laurels won in honorable battle,
                        in the better days of the old Republic, tarnished and drooping--its
                        swaggering gait tamed down to the mincing step of the convicted
                        poltroon--its position irrevocably assigned, as morally on a par with the
                        vain-glorious little Republic of Spanish America.--Politically it will be in
                        time scarcely more powerful or influential; for the process of
                        disintegration, once begun, will not stop until what remains of the Northern
                        Confederation will end in half a dozen discordant organizations. </p>
                    <p>Now, the monster evil of a financial panic is upon the Yankee Government and
                        its people.--This is a more appalling enemy than Southern bayonets, for the
                        Yankees have shown their ability to get out of reach of the latter. But
                        there is no running away from debt and taxation. There is no escape from a
                        prostrate credit and a bankrupt Treasury. The army and navy must be
                        supported, or disbanded. The soldiers, sailors, and marines, officers and
                        men, with their myriads of adjuncts and satellites, contractors and camp
                        followers, have got to be fed and paid; and if they are not furnished with
                        Southern plunder, or pickings and stealings from the public crib, they will
                        turn upon private property of the North.</p>
                    <p>It is an ugly fix. The time is approaching when the Lincolnite dynasty will
                        be at a loss to know which most to fear--the armies of the South, or the
                        armies of the North. It will be easier to run from the one than to get rid
                        of the other.</p>
                    <p>But now is the very time for increased vigilance on the part of the South.
                        Now is the time for us to brace every nerve, and marshal every appliance for
                        the conflicts yet to come.</p>
                    <p>It would be folly to relax a muscle--to snatch a moment for repose. The
                        Yankees are in a death struggle for national honor, national safety,
                        national existence. They are infuriated, desperate, malignant. Like the
                        savage bear, or the broad antlered moose of their frozen regions, when
                        mortally wounded and at bay, they are most fierce and dangerous. At least,
                        the Yankee Government, in its extremity, may be looked to, to put forth its
                        most desperate efforts in this dying struggle. It must achieve some success, to propitiate Wall street. It must make an advance, to appease popular clamor. It
                            must display some capacity to retrieve its
                        great losses, to keep British fleets from off its coast. Even conceding, as
                        in its heart it must, that defeat and humiliation are to be its portion, the
                        opening of Southern ports to the commerce of the world, and its recognition
                        of the Southern Republic, events not to be staved off many months longer,
                        there is a necessity upon it to put forth now more Herculean efforts. It
                        must achieve something on which to retire from the contest with honor. It
                        must have something to show for the blood it has spilt and the money it has
                        squandered. Therefore, we look for more bloody work, and more "grand"
                        movements upon the Southern rebels, ere the contest flags and closes. We
                        would speak a word of caution against a false security--against looking
                        abroad for British fleets and armies to avert the coming blows.--What the
                        Yankees intend to do, they will try to do quickly. Therefore, be on the
                        alert, be vigilant--be ever ready; brave soldiers of the South, 'Once more
                        unto the breach, dear friends, once more.'</p>
