<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Nov. 30th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--I have observed in a valley paper an account of the attack upon
                        the infantry part of our regiment (Partisan Rangers) and the retreat, "in
                        good order," under command of Lieut. Col. Robt. L. Doyle during the absence
                        of Col. Imboden with the cavalry of the regiment; but I have looked in vain
                        for a detailed account of the adventures, sufferings and escapes of said
                        cavalry during these eight days march in the Alleghenies. Believing that a
                        true statement of the facts would be interesting to those who have friends
                        in the command, I have concluded to furnish the materials which you can
                        dispose of as you see proper. It is not necessary that I should state the
                        grand object of the expedition. It is enough to say that if it had not been
                        thwarted by circumstances over which our brave and indefatigable Colonel had
                        no control, it would have resulted in as much advantage to our cause and
                        inflicted a blow upon our enemies from which they would not have recovered
                        for many months.</p>
                    <p>The cavalry of the regiment, 250 strong and commanded by Col. Imboden in
                        person, left our camp on the South Fork, in Hardy county, on the evening of
                        the 7th of Nov. in a violent snow storm; horses and men in good keeping and
                        fine spirits, the latter carrying 2 day's rations of beef, bread and salt.
                        At 8 o'clock in the evening we halted at Petersburg to feed our horses,
                        carrying the unhusked corn covered with snow, from the field and preventing
                        our feet from freezing by running up and down the pike. In an hour we were
                        in the saddle and marching at a trot up the South Branch, the fall or snow
                        ceasing and the weather becoming colder every moment. At 1 o'clock on the
                        morning of the 8th we halted near the eastern base of the snow clad
                        Alleghany [sic], regaling our tired horses with corn from a neighboring
                        field, the property of one of those vile traitors, called "Union men," and
                        throwing our wearied selves upon the snow slept soundly, if not sweetly,
                        until the peep of day.--On arising, we found the snow storm had again
                        resumed operations, and the prospect on every hand looking so gloomy, that
                        our commander for a moment entertained the idea of relinquishing for the
                        present the grand idea, and turning his attention to some other point. But
                        all who know Colonel John D. Imboden are well aware that naught but
                        impossibilities turn him from his purposes. Again we are in the saddle and
                        making a short turn to the right are soon lost to view in the dense
                        undergrowth that covers the eastern side of the Alleghany Mountain. Up, up
                        stretches the long line of horses and men along the narrow path, some
                        leading, some driving their unwilling stock, with an occasional
                        heels-over-head performance by some unfortunate trooper in the cool
                        refreshing (!) snow.</p>
                    <p>Some of our valley boys not knowing the magnitude of the mountain we were
                        ascending concluded to "ride up," but after an hour's climbing in the
                        slippery path, we heard one of this class remark that as it was turning out
                        to be quite a large hill he would walk up the remainder. Two o'clock found
                        us on the top of the mountain, in the region of the fir tree the beach and
                        laurel, the snow hanging in clusters from every limb and falling over men
                        and horses until they were drenched as by a day's travel in a hard rain.</p>
                    <p>And now commenced our difficulties in earnest. The path descending the
                        mountain on the west side is the worst imaginable. Narrow, steep, rocky,
                        with roots twining and intervening in every possible direction with frequent
                        "jumping off" place from 2 to 4 feet high. It presented in that wretched
                        snow storm, to our jaded horses an almost impossible barrier. But we rolled
                        on, and near sundown stopped at a cabin in the hills where our Quarter
                        Master succeeded in procuring some corn for our stock. There we learned, as
                        the rear of the command came drudging in, that a part of the rear company
                        had turned back, the path being rendered impassible [sic] by the passage of
                        those in front of them.</p>
                    <p>After resting an hour we started about dark in the direction of the "Dry Fork
                        of Cheat River," by a narrow path that winds around the side and end of a
                        mountain, slippery, precipitous, and dangerous in the extreme. At 10 o'clock
                        at night we reached the Dry Fork, and giving our horses a little hay (there
                        was no grain) we laid down to rest for two hours.</p>
                    <p>It seemed as though we had scarce begun to slumber when the loud notes of the
                        bugle called again to horse, and in a few minutes we were threading that far
                        famed dangerous path that winds around the mountain whose base is laved by
                        the waters of the miss named [sic] Dry Fork of
                        Cheat. On our right was the steep, abrupt mountain side within reach of our
                        hands as we sat in our saddles. On our left a precipice 500 feet high, with
                        the river rolling and dashing at the bottom. It was along this path that
                        Colonel Imboden passed in August last, when one of the mules bearing a
                        mountain howitzer on his back, made a miss-step and tumbled head long over
                        the precipice, but fortunately was stopped I his rapid career about 75 feet
                        from the starting point by a fallen tree, where he was found lying on his
                        side, the cannon still strapped to his back and his imperturbable muleship
                        cropping the leaves from the bushes within his reach. How he was conducted
                        back into the path I never heard, nor have I the most distant idea unless
                        they rafted him down the river. </p>
                    <p>Along this path we continued to feel our way for 8 miles when early dawn
                        found us in a primative [sic] sort of a road leading to St. George, the
                        county seat of Tucker county.</p>
                    <p>In arriving in the vicinity of the latter place, the Colonel immediately made
                        such a disposition of his command as to surprise the town and capture the
                        garrison of 40 or 50 men stationed there. Having ordered Capt. Beall's
                        company down along the bank of the river to surprise, and, if possible,
                        capture the enemies' pickets at that point, the Col. with the main body of
                        the command surrounded the upper part of the town, when squads of the enemy
                        were seen running towards the Court House, not however without receiving a
                        few notes of recognition from Captain Beall's company as they passed. On
                        receiving information from a citizen that they had securely barricaded
                        themselves within the Court House and were determined not to surrender
                        except to the last extremity, we prepared to storm their castle, when they
                        very wisely, though somewhat to the regret of our boys, caved in and
                        surrendered their precious carcases [sic] with all equipments and
                        appurtenances into our hands. And here we regret to say it was decided in
                        council, and wisely too, that the main object of the expedition had better
                        be relinquished and we make our escape beyond the enemies' lines as soon as
                        possible. Consequently, after paroling the prisoners, who by the way were
                        nearly all Virginians, the Col. ordered a "right about" movement, and we
                        took the road again on our return. The reason for this retrograde movement
                        was found in the fact that we had been delayed by the bad weather and the
                        condition of the roads in the mountains, some 18 hours beyond the time
                        calculated for our arrival at the desired point, and in the mean time the
                        enemy at Beverly had been apprised of the expedition, and a large force had
                        moved in our rear across the mountain to the North Fork and Franklin, while
                        it was evident large parties were on the [illegible] for us at different
                        points. It now required cautious steps and a correct knowledge of the
                        mountain paths, to extricate the command from their perilous position fifty
                        miles within the enemy's lines and a wilderness of mountains intervening,
                        while the enemy were watching every known pass to intercept our return. So
                        after studying the Dry Fork some 16 miles the command crossed that stream on
                        so dark a night as ever "came down" and struck into the mountains towards
                        Beverly, threading a blind path through what appeared after the rising of
                        the moon, to be the wildest and most ragged of mountain districts. About 11
                        o'clock we halted in a clearing on the mountain top and were fortunate to
                        find corn enough for our now fast failing horses. This was on Sunday night
                        and was the first grain our horses had tasted for 30 hours, though
                        performing immense service all the time, and I regret o say it was the last
                        they received until the following Thursday! After resting two hours we again
                        started still in the direction of Beverly; and here the reader will observe
                        that the Col. had relinquished, if indeed he ever entertained the idea of
                        returning by the route we pursued on our outward trip. This day our horses
                        showed evident signs of falling in the "path of duty," and after traveling
                        some 8 or 10 miles we halted to feed our horses some hay, and ourselves some
                        beef, having had no bread since the day before. It was the intention of Col.
                        Imboden to encamp that night (Monday) at a well known place called the
                        "Upper Sinks" in Pendleton county, but the difficulties of the path, which
                        led through a dense and at all other points impenetrable forest, together
                        with the jaded and worn out condition of our horses rendered the
                        accomplishment of this object impossible and after performing a journey of 5
                        miles in 6 hours, we encamped in a small clearing in the forest, just in the
                        edge of Highland county. There we rested all night being the first night's
                        rest we had taken since leaving our now beloved camp in old Hardy. In the
                        morning our guide, becoming by this time entirely rusticated, and disdaining
                        all paths and signs of human existence, dashed into the thicket of the
                        forest, and leading our horses through jungle and over cliffs, we struggled
                        on sometimes belly deep to our horses in mire, sometimes climbing on hands
                        and feet a steep acclivity, only to slide down the opposite side in an
                        inverted position, and finally rested after our day's toil at the "Upper
                        Sinks," having accomplished the distance of 8 miles in one day.</p>
                    <p>On the following (Wednesday) morning after our usual repast of hay and beef
                        (our horses eat the former) we again took the forest regardless of roads,
                        and after toiling until high noon we made two remarkable discoveries: one,
                        that we had traveled 4 miles into the wilderness where no human foot had
                        ever preceded us, and the other, that we had reached a very large jumping
                        off place from which there was no possible exit but by the way we came.
                        Hence the command, right about, was passed along the line, and we returned
                        to our old camp in time to prepare our usual supper of hay and beef, with
                        the glorious addition of two potatoes for each man, which was unanimously
                        voted quite a treat.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday we travelled [sic] as rapidly as our crippled horses would go,
                        and as quietly as possible for we were getting near the enemy's lines, and,
                        as it proved, near their camp also, and arrived on the North Fork about
                        noon, where we procured corn for our horses, being the first they had
                        received since the previous Sunday. Toward evening we started down the Fork
                        and passing within one and a half miles of a camp of 400 Yankee and Union
                        villains who were posted there to catch us, we turned by a path into the
                        hills and crossing over to the South Branch 10 miles above Franklin came
                        upon some cap fires that 1300 of the enemy had just left. Following down the
                        river a few miles we crossed it five miles above Franklin, and striking
                        again into the mountains that divide the waters of the South Branch from
                        those of the South Fork, bade farewell to danger and bad roads, and encamped
                        at 4 o'clock on Friday morning near the head of the Fork almost exhausted
                        with incessant marching, and weak for want of food. There the command rested
                        until 12 o'clock to give the men an opportunity to buy bread of the
                        inhabitants, which they took advantage of with a will. On Friday night we
                        reached a point half way between this place and Mount Solon, and the next
                        morning landed safely at this point with the whole command except some 10 or
                        12 horses that gave out by the way, during the toilsome march of Tuesday,
                        Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
                    <p>And now let me state that considering the length of the march, the character
                        of the country traveled over, and the fact that not less than 5,000 of the
                        enemy were on the watch at different points to intercept us--our escape was
                        remarkable, wonderful! After pitying our poor horses (the word poor is applicable in every sense) that are
                        rendered unfit for service for the next 3 months, too much praise cannot be
                        awarded to the men who endured the labor, fatigue, deprivation and almost
                        starvation, of this long and dangerous march through a country of alternate
                        mountain and swamp, uninhabited and entirely destitute of roads. </p>
                    <p>I wish I had time to describe the winter scenery of these interminable
                        forests, with their giant growth of firs 4 and 5 feet through and eight or
                        ninety feet without a limb; wild cherry 3 and 4 feet through at the base,
                        the most magnificent beaches, and the broad leaved laurel 30 feet in height
                        and their stems 18 or 20 inches in circumference. But most remarkable and
                        beautiful of all is the growth of mosses which cover the ground, the rocks,
                        the trees and every other object for more than a foot in depth, spreading
                        the earth with a rich carpet, over laying fallen trees, clinging fondly to
                        the smooth bark of the gigantic monarchs of the forest, and hanging in
                        beautiful festoons from their spreading branches, ornamenting Nature in her
                        wildest form, may I not say, in her native beauty!</p>
                    <p>It was a sight to fill the soul with emotions of love for the works of Nature
                        in their original purity, and I look back upon it with a desire to return
                        again to these solitary wilds, but unfortunately for the poetic feeling, I
                        glance over my shoulder at a once fine black charger, vainly endeavoring on
                        three legs to crop the surrounding herbage and with a feeling akin to anger
                        I curse the mountains and the "cavalry trip" which has been anything but a
                        profitable one to</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Lynchburg "Virginian" says it is known that Georgia, through her
                        Governor, has interposed some obstacles to the enforcement of the
                        Conscription act. A controversy upon this subject was carried on for some
                        time between the Governor of Georgia and the President, whilst the former in
                        his message to the Legislature argued the unconstitutionality of the act.
                        The Supreme Court of that State has, however, decided against the scruples
                        of the Governor, and there is no appeal from that decision, we presume, so
                        far as Georgia is concerned. Pending the decision upon the subject, the Hon.
                        A. B. Kenan member of Congress from Georgia, delivered a patriotic address
                        in Milledgeville, in which he thus referred to the greater sacrifices
                        endured by Virginia. We hope that such considerations will serve to repress
                        the disposition that has been far too prevalent amongst our malcontented
                        brethren South, who in their moments of querulousness, complain of "having
                        to fight the battles of Virginia."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kenan said:</p>
                    <p>Georgia is the last State that ought to complain and resist this law. Georgia
                        has not yet been invaded. We have not yet suffered at our doors and in our
                        estates from the presence of a hostile foe. The battles in our defence have
                        been fought hundreds of miles away from us.--The people of Virginia have
                        lost their property, their negroes, their food, their all. Their houses,
                        their barns and fences have been burnt before their eyes, their wives and
                        children insulted and driven from home and themselves carried away captives,
                        and still they are true. You know nothing of the ravages of war. When your
                        own wives and children are driven from home without food and clothing, to
                        hide in the mountains and caves, your negroes stolen and the torch applied
                        to your premises, then your patriotism will be tested.--Can you endure that?
                        Had you not better do all you can to keep the war away from your borders? Is
                        it well for your to be squabbling about State Rights and who shall appoint
                        captains and colonels when the enemy is thundering at your doors? We have
                        had brilliant victories, and our arms have performed such deeds as history
                        has nowhere recorded. Conscription has done it for us. If this war goes on,
                        we have to whip 500,000 of the best men the enemy has got, before next
                        Spring, or they will whip us. If we whip them, Conscription will have done
                        it--without it we will fail.</p>

                    <p>Madison Court House.</p>
                    <p>November 27th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Editor of Spectator--This portion of Jackson's corps having "changed base"
                        recently, finds itself allowed a day's rest at this place, awaiting orders,
                        and ready to "descend like a wolf on the fold," whenever and wherever "Mr.
                        Burnside" may give the opportunity.</p>
                    <p>The lower Valley which we have just left will long have cause to remember our
                            friendly visit. It was doubtless the policy
                        of our Generals to leave that unfortunate section utterly unavailable to the
                        enemy for occupation for any purpose.--Hence all the railroads leading into
                        it--the Baltimore and Ohio--the Winchester and Potomac, and the Manassas
                        Gap, have been effectually destroyed. All the surplus forage and provender
                        for man and beast have been consumed by our army, which literally spread
                        itself by brigades and regiments all over the region, and subsisted off it
                        entirely. So the enemy will now find it a section hard to get in, hard to
                        stay in, and hard to get out of. The people deprived of everything else,
                        will have the only consolation of enumerating the Yankees among their
                        deprivations. </p>
                    <p>The abomination of desolation seems to have swept it; fencing is almost
                        entirely destroyed--except the stonewall--which
                        is invariably a staunch institution; houses are closed and deserted; forests
                        and even orchards are demolished for fuel, or in wantonness by the enemy;
                        bridges burnt; the once beautifully cultivated fields are scarred all over
                        with the marks of encampments, and all so changed from the fair and fruitful
                        appearance it presented when we first marched into it, as to recall the wail
                        of the song, </p>
                    <p>"Not a rose of the wilderness left on its stalk, <br>To mark where the
                        garden had been." </p>
                    <p>On the third day out, we crossed the Blue Ridge at Milan's (?) Gap, where the
                        turnpike scales tee [sic] mountain by a serpentine grade of seven miles to
                        obtain a distance of only one as the crow flies. The army was marching by
                        brigades, each brigade followed by its own artillery and wagon train; they
                        stretching for miles and miles along the turnpike, up the mountain side, and
                        far across the Page Valley to the Massanutten range. The troops and trains
                        winding the turns of the grade up the mountain were at times all in sight
                        and seemed moving in every possible direction</p>
                    <p>"In wondering mazes lost."</p>
                    <p>The soldiers were often in speaking distance of each other, though really far
                        apart, and going in opposite directions. The jests and taunts that passed
                        thus at safe distances from crag to crag served to cheer them on their
                        toilsome tramp--The lucky wearers of high shoes were urged to "come out of
                        them shoes! I know you're in thar! I see your head stickin' out." Men in big
                        overcoats were assailed with--"Overcoat, let that man out! I know you've got
                        him in thar, I see his fingers and toes workin'." Many witty and
                        contemptuous comparisons were made of this mountain passage with Hannibal's
                        and Bonaparte's boasted crossing of the Alps!"</p>
                    <p>Many of the men are yet without shoes in some of the regiments, and it is
                        most piteous to see them painfully picking their way along through frost and
                        ice. Many are without blankets, and how they stand it, is more than can be
                        imagined by those of us who are so fortunate as barely to escape freezing
                        under two blankets by lying our in these frosty nights. But "white folks"
                        don't know what they can stand until they try it.</p>
                    <p>Flour beef and salt constitute the daily diet of the troops--provided it
                        "gets up in time," but in practice it generally arrives after dark, so that
                        the men spend the night in cooking, and therefore don't need blankets to
                        sleep in--sharp practice in "Mr. Jeff Davis!" As to the eating, however, the
                        men get many luxuries from the patriotic people along the line--by paying
                        for them, e. g. honey at $1.50 per pound, butter at $1 and $1.25 per pound,
                        chickens $1 each, apples 50 cts to $1.25 per dozen, and "Apple-Jack," per
                        pint, $2.50 to $5, and scarce in demand at that. Some of the "citizens" have
                        volunteered to bring in such things, at such prices to camp; but when their
                        enterprise is found out by the Generals, they are themselves generally
                        brought up at the guard-house.</p>
                    <p>The soldiers, however, are wonderfully cheerful. They live, too, in hopes of
                        seeing an end of the war, when they will return home with renewed zest for
                        the pleasures of peace. A party near by was indulging itself to-day with a
                        "supposin peace was declared, what would you do? One said, "I'd get up right
                        here, and go across that field, over that stone fence, straight home."
                        Another said, "I could not leave immediately, as I would go through a lot of
                        ground and lofty tumbling preparatory to starting," &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c.,</p>
                    <p>Yours &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
