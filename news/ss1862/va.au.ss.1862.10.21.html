<b>Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Emphasizes the contradictions between Lincoln's issuance of the
                    Emancipation Proclamation and a speech the President gave in which he declared
                    that an executive proclamation could not have any effect in freeing the slaves.
                    The article also points out that Congress passed a resolution in February of
                    1861 asserting that Congress has no right to interfere with slavery where it
                    exists. Finally, the Bulletin quotes Lincoln's assurances that he has no
                    intention to interfere with slavery in the slaveholding states.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This distinguished and gallant cavalry officer has again astonished and
                        electrified the public by another dashing "circumbendibus" entirely around
                        the enormous army of Gen'l. McClellan Now take the map and trace the route
                        of his glorious and triumphant gallopade around the large and boastful army
                        of the enemy. He crossed near Williamsport and, going North, first passed
                        thro' Mercersburg, in Franklin county, Pennsylvania, then going North-East
                        he went to Chambersburg, the county seat of Franklin county, then going
                        South-East he went to Emmettsburg, near the Northern boundary of Frederick
                        county, Maryland, then continuing in the same direction he went to Liberty
                        in the same county, then South to New Market, also in Frederick, then in the
                        same direction to Hyattstown in Montgomery co., Maryland, then bearing
                        South-West to Barnesville in the same county, near which place he re-crossed
                        the Potomac and returned to Winchester without the loss of a single man. The
                        following is General Lee's brief despatch to the Secretary of War:</p>
                    <p>Winchester, Va., <br>October 14, 1862. </p>
                    <p>Hon. G. W. Randolph: </p>
                    <p>The cavalry expedition to Pennsylvania has returned safe. They passed through
                        Mercersburg, Chambersburg, Emmitsburg, Liberty, New Market, Hyattstown, and
                        Barnesville. The expedition crossed the Potomac above Williamsport, and
                        recrossed at White's Ford, making the entire circuit, cutting the enemy's
                        communications, destroying arms, &amp;c., and obtaining many recruits.</p>
                    <p>R. E. Lee, General.</p>
                    <p>General Stuart passed through a portion of the wealthiest part of
                        Pennsylvania. The towns in Pennsylvania through which he passed--Mercersburg
                        and Chambersburg--as before stated, are situated in Franklin, a county which
                        contains a population of more than 40,000. From the Richmond "Whig" we learn
                        that most of the country is a rich lime-stone valley, well watered. The
                        productions in 1850 were 837,000 bushels of wheat (the greatest quantity
                        produced by any county of the State, except Lancaster,) 539,976 of Indian
                        corn, 393,447 of oats, 33,591 tons of hay, 67,546 lbs butter, and 44,192 of
                        wool. The number of horses and mules in the county in 1850, [in round
                        numbers] was 9,000, neat cattle 22,000, sheep, 14,000, swine 35,000.</p>
                    <p>Chambersburg the county seat has a population of about 5,000. It is situated
                        45 miles south west of Harrisburg, and is a thriving place. The houses are
                        mostly of brick or stone, and the general appearance of the town is neat and
                        comfortable. There are manufactories of cotton, wood, flour, paper, and iron
                        in and near the town.</p>
                    <p>Mercersburg is fifteen miles south west of Chambersburg. The population is
                        about 1,400. It is the seat of Marshall College, which was founded in 1836,
                        under the direction of the German Reformed Church.</p>
                    <p>The object of this exploit we could not tell if we would, and we would not if
                        we could. It is sufficient for us to know that it was done for a
                        purpose.--What that purpose was will be developed at the proper time. In his
                        route General Stuart cut the enemy's communication, destroyed many arms and
                        a large amount of stores, and brought away 2,000 horses, without losing a
                        man.</p>
                    <p>At Chambersburg General Stuart destroyed public property to the amount of
                        $200,000, in which were 700,000 cartridges, 700 muskets, a quantity of
                        shells, powder, &amp;c. He found one car loaded with revolvers, which
                        were appropriated by his men. Private property was not taken nor destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Besides doing these things, General Stuart captured a number of prisoners,
                        fifty-one of whom arrived here on Sunday evening last, on their way to
                        Richmond.</p>
