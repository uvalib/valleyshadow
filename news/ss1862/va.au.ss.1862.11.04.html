                    <p>There is every reason to believe, from present appearances, says the
                        Lynchburg Virginian, that we shall be short of supplies for one army and
                        people next year. The short crop of when and corn for the past year, the
                        fatality that has attended the hog crop; the waste superinduced by large
                        standing waste superinduced by large standing armies; the drought which has
                        retarded the Fall operations of farmers in getting their wheat sown, and the
                        embarrassments that the agricultural portion of our citizens have suffered,
                        in consequence of the presence of the enemy, and the demand made upon them
                        by our Governments, State and Confederate, will we fear, be manifest in a
                        short supply of bread and meat next year. It believes us therefore to
                        observe the greatest frugality and economy in the use of what we have. It
                        matters not that we have a plethora of money, or that there be an abundance
                        elsewhere to supply our lack, when we are excluded from the markets of the
                        world, and are compelled to rely upon what we have within ourselves. Money
                        cannot produce one grain of corn, or increase by one pound, our quantity of
                        meat. Our supply will be limited by the circumstances that surround us, and
                        to that, whether much or little, we must contine [sic] ourselves. We cannot
                        increase it by the ordinary means of commercial intercourse. Under these
                        circumstances, we are called upon to husband our resources of bread and
                        meat, by the diminution, so far as practicable, of consumption. We should
                        stint ourselves, and those who have spread a bounteous board heretofore,
                        should, no matter what their means may be, endeavor to do with less.
                        Thousands of our gallant soldiers who were nursed in the lap of plenty, and
                        brought up in the midst of affluence, have known what it was to go for days
                        together without a meal:--and cannot we, to increase the stores that may be
                        necessary for their sustenance in the field, endure some little of their
                        patient self-denial? We can do with much less than we consume, and instead
                        of priding ourselves upon spreading an ample board, groaning with every
                        luxury, we should feel a sense of reproach for indulging in such
                        improprieties. This is no time for feasting and high carnival, but for
                        earnest self-denial, and abounding patriotism and charity. Our suffering
                        countrymen, and the dependent families they have committed to our care
                        whilst they are fighting our battles, demand that we appropriate less to
                        ourselves, and more to those who would be glad to gather the crumbs that
                        fall from many of our tables. The season, the condition of the country, the
                        wants of those to whom we have referred, and the prospect before us, all
                        call upon us, trumpet-tongued, to forego every species of luxury during the
                        existence of this war.</p>

<b>The Small Pox</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    residents to have their families vaccinated and those who live in the country to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This dangerous and loathsome disease has made its appearance in this county.
                        We have been informed that there are some cases in the neighborhood of
                        Middlebrook, and that it exists in other portions of the county. To prevent
                        its extension, every family, without exception, should have all of its
                        members vaccinated as soon as possible. Those even who have been vaccinated
                        heretofore should be vaccinated again to make "assurance doubly sure." The
                        citizens of his place are very apprehensive that it may be brought from the
                        country to the town, and we would, therefore, request our country friends to
                        be careful not to bring it here, for, as soldiers are passing daily through
                        this place to the army, it may in this way get into our army and do us more
                        harm than all the soldiers Lincoln has been able to bring into the field
                        against us. Therefore, in behalf of our common country as well as of the
                        citizens of Staunton, we appeal to our country, friends not to bring this
                        horrible disease to this place.</p>

                    nations, the value of Confederate currency will increase greatly. Reasons that
                    if this happens, the distrust of individuals in Confederate money will be proven
                    to have been unfounded.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is evidently some distrust in the public mind, of Confederate money.
                        This is one cause of the spirit of speculation and high prices, by which
                        public and private interests are injured.</p>
                    <p>We are inclined to think this distrust is without any just foundation. If we
                        secure our independence our currency will be perfectly good--if not, nothing
                        that we have will be of value.</p>
                    <p>But there is one view to which we would call the attention of the public. If
                        the rumors of intervention be tree, or if from any other cause an early
                        peace should become probable, it is evident that the eight per cent bonds
                        will be a most desirable investment. Capitalists will at once seek for them.
                        Confederate money is available to buy them at par, while Bank notes will not
                        necessarily be so. The 8 per cent bonds under a brisk demand, will go above
                        par, and Confederate notes will keep pace with them, because they are, by
                        law, convertible into 8 per cent bonds. By this process, millions upon
                        millions of dollars of Confederate notes will be withdrawn from circulation
                        and invested in bonds. A sudden contraction of the currency will be the
                        consequence, followed by a fall in prices, and a general smash in
                        speculations. On the whole we think people had better be on the look out for
                        squalls and haul in their sails before the storm comes. Prudence will also
                        dictate that men should hold on to Confederate money as it is likely to be
                        at a premium.</p>
