<b>Lincoln's Fiendish Proclamation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses a violent and disgusted reaction to Lincoln's decision to issue
                    the Emancipation Proclamation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the time our first parents were expelled from Paradise, and</p>
                    <p>"They hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, <br>Through Eden took
                        their solitary way," </p>
                    <p>there has not been as much joy in Pandemonium as at this time. The Arch-Fiend
                        in the regions of woe, "grins horribly a ghastly smile," for he and his
                        emissaries upon earth--the extreme abolitionists--have succeeded in
                        prevailing upon "Old Abe" to issue a proclamation of emancipation which will
                        send a thrill of horror through all civilized nations. He invites the
                        servile population of the South to enact the bloody scene of St. Domingo
                        throughout the limits of the Southern Confederacy.--Before he committed this
                        act of atrocity, in reply to the Committee sent by a meeting of the
                        "Christians (!) of all denominations" of Chicago, who were, at the
                        instigation of Satan, urging upon him to perpetrate it, he said that, "he
                        had been considering it night and day for some time--that he raised no
                        objection to it on legal or constitutional grounds, for as Commander-in-Chief of the army
                        and navy, in time of war, he supposed he had a right to adopt any measure which might best subdue the enemy, and
                        that he urged no objections of a moral nature in
                        view of possible consequences of insurrection and
                            massacre at the South, but viewed the matter as a practical war
                        measure to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it
                        may offer to the suppression of the rebellion." </p>
                    <p>Having no legal, constitutional, nor moral objections, he had but little
                        difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it would be a "good practical
                        war measure." In a word, the devil triumphed, and Lincoln issued his
                        proclamation, which has "crowned the pyramid of his infamies with an
                        atrocity abhorred of men, and at which even demons might shudder."</p>
                    <p>After the Committee of abolitionists from Chicago had retired, and when he
                        was in some perplexity as to the course he should adopt, Satan, his
                        potential ally, "squat like a toad at his ear," addressed him, as Milton
                        represents Death as addressing Sin within the gates of Hell, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Go whither Fate and inclination strong<br>Leads
                        thee; I shall not lag behind nor err <br>The way, thou
                            leading; such a scent I draw <br>Of carnage, prey innumerable,
                        and taste <br>The savor of death from all things there that live; <br>Nor
                        shall I to the work thou enterprises!<br>Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid."</p>
                    <p>"Facilis desgensus Averni." There is now no
                        obstruction in the downward road he is travelling, for from the position he
                        now occupies there is </p>
                    <p>"A passage broad, <br>Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell." </p>
                    <p>His astute ally knew when to approach him. He seized that time when he was
                        writhing under the mortification of a succession of defeats, and when he was
                        blinded by an intensified envenoned [sic] animosity. The fiendish
                        criminality of his act is only equaled by its folly and fertility, for it
                        will have no practical effect, as it will not emancipate a slave who would
                        not have been freed without it. His proclamation, practically, is merely</p>
                    <p>"Sound and fury, signifying nothing,"</p>
                    <p>for notwithstanding it, he must rely solely upon the strength and bravery of
                        his armies. Wherever he has had the power to do so, he has emancipated the
                        slaves heretofore, and he cannot emancipate beyond the limits of his
                        military lines. Not as many will be emancipated in future as heretofore,
                        because the owners will now remove them before the enemy can get possession.
                        He aims a deadly blow, but, like the blinded moccasin in August, he strikes
                        his envenomed fangs into himself instead of his intended victim. This
                        proclamation which exposes the criminal animus of
                        its author, will strengthen the South and weaken the North, and bring down
                        upon the Lincoln Administration the condemnation of the whole civilized
                        world. Fearing to trust even the people of the North, he at the same time,
                        issued another proclamation, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and applying the rigor of martial law to all
                        persons who may utter a word of complaint against the issue of his fiendish
                        proclamation.--They will be thrown into prison without any means of redress.
                        The Lincoln Government is now the most tyranical [sic] military despotism
                        which has ever existed upon the earth. As compared with the "blackness of
                        darkness" of Lincoln's character, those of all criminals who have "existed
                        in the tide of Time" assumed a radiance of virtue. In comparing him with
                        Butler, the tyrant of New Orleans, the Richmond Enquirer says: </p>
                    <p>"Butler has been called infamous--by common consent he is know as the Beast.
                        But Butler is a saint compared to his master. In addition to all that Butler
                        authorized, Lincoln adds butchery--even the butchery of babes! Language is
                        too poor to furnish a name suitable for such a character. Nay, the whole
                        catalogue of dishonoring epithets is not sufficient to do justice to it.
                        "Murderer" is a term of honor compared to Lincoln's crime. "Child and
                        woman-murderer" tells but part of the story.--To this is added the cowardice
                        of employing an agent. To this belongs the additional fact that the agent,
                        when unloosed, is a savage. To this is added the further fact that Lincoln
                        dooms his agent to destruction. What shall we call him? coward? assassin?
                        savage? the murderer of women and babes, and the false destroyer of his own
                        deluded allies?--Shall we consider these as all embodied in the word
                        "fiend!" and shall we call him that? Lincoln, the
                        Fiend! Let history take hold of him, and let the civilized world fling its
                        scorpion lash upon him!" </p>
