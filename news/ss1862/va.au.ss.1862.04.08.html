<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Confederate States have three distinct classes of enemies, which the
                        Memphis Appeal forcibly describes as follows. We think our home enemies are
                        worse and more detestable than the Yankees themselves:--</p>
                    <p>1. The Government and people of the United States are our enemies. But they
                        are open enemies. They meet us upon the field with arms in their hands, and
                        make war upon us. They shoot down our soldiers, burn our houses, destroy our
                        property, and steal our negroes. We know where to find and how to deal with
                        such an enemy.</p>
                    <p>2. The second class of enemies are the croakers--the long faced men of faint
                        hearts and weak nerves, who go up and down the country, seeking to impart
                        their own despondency and cowardice to all with whom they come in
                        contact.--Everything goes wrong, according to these Dismal Jemmies. The
                        government is weak and negligent; our officers are lacking in skill; and the
                        army is destitute of courage. If the government has done its duty, this or
                        that thing would not have happened. If the officers had possessed a grain of
                        foresight, they could have held this or that position against the enemy.
                        Nothing is done right, according to these gentry, and everything goes wrong.</p>
                    <p>The enemy will certainly overrun the country; the Confederate government will
                        fail; and we will all go to perdition together. If they only had charge of
                        affairs, how smoothly and successfully everything would move. Arms would be
                        procured immediately; an army would be improvised in the twinkling of an
                        eye; and the enemy--McClellan, Buell, Halleck, and all--would be driven out
                        of the country the first pleasant day that came. Napoleon would still be the
                        "little corporal" by the side of these wonderful warriors--the mighty men of
                        valor.--Weak of purpose, faint of heart, and cowardly in spirit, they would
                        destroy the confidence of every body else and abandon every thing to the
                        Federals. We would suggest to have petticoats put upon these miserable
                        creatures, and curls hung about their craven foreheads, but for the insult
                        we should thereby offer to our brave women.</p>
                    <p>3. The speculators and extortioners constitute the third class of enemies.
                        These characters operate upon the necessities of the country.--They are
                        interested in the war, insomuch as it enables them to make money. Beyond
                        this, they care but little who wins or who loses.--They set no fixed price
                        upon what they have to sell. Their price is all they can get. The purchaser
                        may be a poor man, a needy woman, a destitute soldier, or the widow of some
                        brave fellow who has fallen in battle with his feet to the foe. Still, if
                        the extortioner can grind out of her five dollars per bushel for salt, he
                        takes it; if ten dollars, he takes it; if a thousand dollars, still he would
                        take it. As between him and a Lincolnite, we have infinitely more respect
                        for the latter. The one is an open enemy, and meets you on the field; the
                        other is a secret foe who takes advantage of your necessities, and seeks to
                        undermine the cause by oppressing the people and sapping the foundations of
                        our strength.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting held at the Court-house on Saturday last, with the view to the
                        organization of a regiment or battalion of Free-Fighters for the defence of
                        the Valley, BENJ. CRAWFORD was called to the Chair, and L. Waddell, Jr.,
                        appointed Secretary. The objects of the meeting were explained by Col.
                        Kenton Harper in a few brief but highly patriotic remarks, who submit the
                        following.</p>
                    <p>Plan of Organization:</p>
                    <p>1st. The object of this organization, which is to be composed of men not
                        subject to military duty, is the defence of our rights and our homes, and is
                        intended to co-operate with and form a part of the Army of the Shenandoah..</p>
                    <p>2d. While on duty it's all be governed by strict military rules. This is
                        indispensable to its efficiency. As patriot soldiers, we consent to subject
                        ourselves to personal restraints for the day that we may be free forever.</p>
                    <p>3d. The tender of our services at any time will be for a limited period, but
                        we shall hold ourselves ready to respond promptly to any call of the General
                        commanding to meet an exigency.</p>
                    <p>4th, The companies composing the command shall consist of not less than
                        fifty, rank and file, with one Captain and three Lieutenants, and shall be
                        mounted and armed in the most effective manner with rifles or muskets. Any
                        number of men too infirm for regular duty may be attached as honorary
                        members, with the privilege of fighting in the ranks.</p>
                    <p>5th, The drill shall be that of Light Troops of Skirmishers, the men to be
                        dismounted for battle, and the horses used only to relieve the march, and to
                        pass rapidly from point to point, as the necessities of the service may
                        require.</p>
                    <p>This plan was unanimously approved; whereupon the following resolutions were
                        adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That a committee of six be appointed for each magisterial district
                        of the county, to enroll members of the organization and receive
                        subscriptions in money, and provisions, and also the loan of arms and horses
                        for the equipment of such as are not able to furnish themselves.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That it be it recommended to the committees in the different
                        districts to organize the members they may enroll into companies as rapidly
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That all monies subscribed by citizens too infirm to engage in the
                        service, and others, together with all monies arising from fines imposed,
                        shall be equitably distributed, by the Council of Administration, to be
                        appointed by the commanding officer for the relief of such members as may
                        need assistance, from sickness, or other cause, while in the service.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That when the meeting adjourns it will adjourn to meet at this
                        place on Saturday next (12th inst.,) at 2 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>Under the first resolution the following committees were appointed, and the
                        meeting adjourned to meet again on Saturday next.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A number of the citizens of Staunton, satisfied that the laws have been very
                        inefficiently administered within the Corporation, during the last year,
                        earnestly recommend to the voters the election of the following ticket. They
                        have no complaint to urge against the old officers, except that their time
                        has been so much occupied with other duties, that they could not attend to
                        the proper regulation of the Corporation. The ticket proposed, is composed
                        of men who are in no wise connected with the business of the Confederate
                        States, and can therefore give the proper attention to municipal affairs.</p>
                    <p>Should this ticket be elected, it is confidently believed there will be no
                        necessity for martial law, in Staunton, and there will be no repetition of
                        the scenes of riot, drunkenness, disorder and crime, which have ben of such
                        frequent occurrence in the last twelve months.</p>
                    <p>For Mayor--W. G. Sherrett.</p>
                    <p>Town Council--Wm. G. Campbell, George M. Cochran, A. D. Trotter, Wm. B.
                        Keyser, Robt. G. Bickle, Charles T. Cochran, George Baylor, Alex. F. Kenney,
                        John N. Hendren, David O. McGuffey, and B. J. Crawford.</p>
