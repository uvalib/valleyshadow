<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Soldiers in camp suffer from three diseases--diarrhea, rheumatism, and fever.
                        The commonest cause of diarrhea is bad water, its cure, complete rest and
                        abstinence from every kind of food except plain boiled rice. All ordinary
                        diseases will yield to this treatment in twenty four hours or less.
                        Rheumatism is usually brought on, not by getting wet but remaining in wet
                        clothes. Hard drinkers are particularly liable to bad attacks. To avoid
                        rheumatism wear flannel and keep the digestion sound. Fevers are generally
                        caught after dark in the open air. A man going out on night duty should
                        never go hungry and never stand still longer than necessary. Good food and
                        active exercise will generally keep a man well unless the air is uncommonly
                        deleterious. To cure a case of not very severe fever nothing seems so
                        efficacious as a change of air. It is said that the removal of a patient
                        only a few miles works an immediate improvement in his condition. In
                        scouting along the edge of a swamp at night, there is no danger so long as
                        the party keeps on the windward side of it.--These doctrines are laid down
                        in the writings of army surgeons, and of physicians who have given much
                        attention to the subject discussed and ought therefore to be
                    trustworthy.</p>
