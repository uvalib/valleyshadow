<b>The Conflict at Fredericksburg</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the details of the battle at Fredericksburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At five o'clock on Thursday morning last, the enemy, under the command of
                        Burnside, at Fredericksburg, attempted to lay down pontoon bridges, on which
                        to cross the Rappahannock, at three places. One at the site of this railroad
                        bridge which spanned the river at the lower end of the town; another at the
                        ford above the town, and between it and Falmouth, and the third below the
                        mouth of Deep Run, which is about three miles below the city.</p>
                    <p>The attempts at the first names points were repulsed with considerable loss
                        to the enemy, our sharpshooters and skirmishers co-operating with the
                        artillery in the affair. At the lower point, the pontooniers were protected
                        from the fire of our artillery by the river bluff, and the command of the
                        position by the enemy's guns rendered sharpshooters unavailable. At this
                        place, by six o'clock in the evening, the enemy commenced crossing.</p>
                    <p>At seven o'clock, it is supposed by the permission of Gen. Lee, the enemy
                        crossed near the railroad bridge and took possession of Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>It is said that an entire company of our troops, on picket near the river,
                        were surprised, and captured. Sharp skirmishing ensued in the streets of
                        Fredericksburg, and about eight o'clock our forces relinguished [sic] [sic]
                        the place to the enemy. During, or shortly after the skirmishing, the enemy
                        fired the Post office and the Methodist church, Bank of Virginia and all the
                        square was consumed. Citizens say there is scarcely a building in town that
                        has not been struck with one or more shells. Of the several hundred citizens
                        remaining in town, but three, women whose husbands had previously gone over
                        to the enemy, remained, and claimed the protection of the Abolitionists.</p>
                    <p>On Friday there was considerable skirmishing and quite heavy artillery
                        duelling [sic], but not general engagement.--It was well-known by the
                        officers that an engagement would take place the next day, and Friday was
                        spent in making arrangements for the bloody work. Saturday morning found our
                        forces drawn up from opposite Fredericksburg to a distance of six miles
                        eastward.--Longstreet's corps occupied the Highlands above, opposite, and
                        for a mile below the town. Jackson's corps rested on Longstreet's right and
                        extended away to the eastward, the extreme right under A. P. Hill crossing
                        the railroad at Hamilton's crossing, and stretching into the valley towards
                        the river.</p>
                    <p>At half-past eight, A. M., General Lee, attended by his staff, rode slowly
                        along the front of four lines, from west to east, and halted in the valley a
                        mile to the east of Hamilton's crossing, and half a mile in the rear of our
                        batteries on the extreme right.</p>
                    <p>In a short time after this, the action was commenced by the artillery in the
                        Stonewall Brigade. The artillery in the Stonewall Brigade. The artillery
                        firing soon became general and terrific all along the line of battle. At
                        noon the enemy advanced his infantry. As they pressed forward across the
                        Valley, Stuart's horse artillery from our extreme right opened upon them a
                        destructive enfilading fire of round shot. This fire, which annoyed them
                        sorely, was kept up in spite of six batteries which were directed against
                        the horse artillery as soon as it was unmasked. By one o'clock the Yankee
                        columns had crossed the Valley and entered the woods south of the railroad.
                        The batteries on both sides slackened their fire, and musketry at first
                        scattering, but quickly increasing to a crash and roar, sounded thro' the
                        woods. Dense volumes of smoke rose above the trees, and volley succeeded
                        volley sometimes so rapidly as to blend into a prolonged and continuous
                        roar. A. P. Hill's division sustained the first shock of battle.</p>
                    <p>The rest of Jackson's corps were in different lines of reserves. D. H. Hill's
                        division was drawn up in J. L. Marye's field, under a long hill, in the rear
                        of our line of battle.</p>
                    <p>Generals Hill and Early's troops drove the enemy from the woods and across
                        the railroad in the direction of their pontoon bridges near Deep Run. Our
                        men pursued them a mile and a half across the bottom land, and fell back
                        only when they had gotten under the shelter of their batteries. Our troops
                        then retired to the South side of the railroad. Again the enemy rallied and
                        returned to renew the contest, but were again, about five o'clock P.M.,
                        driven back. All the batterries [sic] of Jackson's corps were at this time
                        in full play, and in the approaching twilight the blaze of the guns and the
                        quick flashes of the shells were more distinctly visible. The scene all
                        along the valley was at once splendid and terrific.</p>
                    <p>The result of the fight on our right wing may be summed up briefly. We drove
                        the enemy back, killing three to one, and at night held the ground occupied
                        by the enemy's batteries in the morning. The enemy had 20,000 men engaged on
                        this wing, while altogether, from first to last, we had not more than 10,000
                        in the line of fire.</p>
                    <p>Longstreet's victory was even more complete.</p>
                    <p>He drove the enemy into the streets of Fredericksburg, killing at least five
                        to one. At dusk, the firing ceased simultaneously on both sides.</p>
                    <p>Brig. General Thomas R. R. Cobb, of Georgia, was killed by a shell on
                        Saturday. Gen. [illegible] Gregg, of South Carolina, is reported severely
                        wounded.--The Richmond Whig says: "We have heard various statements as to
                        the losses on Saturday. It is believed that ours will not exceed 500 killed,
                        and 2,500 wounded, while that of the enemy is far greater. It is currently
                        reported that the Federal General Hooker is killed." We have heard it
                        reported that the enemy's loss is from four to five times as great as ours.</p>
                    <p>The following despatch was received at the War Department at 9 o'clock, P.
                        M., Saturday:</p>
                    <p>At 9 o'clock this morning, the enemy attacked our right wing, and as the fog
                        [illegible] the battle ran along the line from [illegible] to left, until 6
                        P.M., the enemy [illegible] at all points--thanks be [illegible]. As usual,
                        we have to mourn the loss of many brave men. I expect the battle will be
                        resumed at daylight to-morrow morning.</p>
                    <p>R. E. LEE.</p>
                    <p>To General Cooper: <br>Gen. Hampton reports that he entered Dumfries and
                        captured 20 wagons with stores, and took 50 prisoners, all of which he
                        brought to the Rappahannock. Gen. Siegel is expected at Dumfries to-morrow. </p>

                    <p>A communication in the last Rockingham Register, signed "Mary," and dated
                        Staunton, December the 10th., contains the following complimentary notice of the military officers and their feminine
                        admirers of this place: </p>
                    <p>There rides an officer in Roman-like pride and consequence, flashing with
                        gold and crimson; he passes on in magnificence and self-adulation, carrying
                        with him the maiden's heart and tearful petitions for his safety. Pshaw! he
                        is in no danger, dashing about town, and the enemy off there, miles away.
                        Foolish girls, dazzled by a glittering uniform! I regret to class myself
                        among your species of God's creatures. Better go to the hospitals, and
                        there, with your gentle and soothing influence, relieve the suffering
                        invalid yearning for the delicate attentions and beloved presence of those
                        far away. This would be more like the noble mission of woman than sighing
                        after military monkeys parading before your doors, showing their find and
                        elegant persons to advantage, thinking how captivating they look, and of the
                        many hearts (not battles,) they have won, to boast of, and, you girls might

                    <p>I have been quite as fortunate as Horace Greely in discovering "intelligent
                        contrabands," and must acknowledge that I have found one or two sensible
                        mulattoes, and they tell me that if they get no better treatment at the
                        North than what they now receive from Northern soldiers, they had a thousand
                        times better remain with their masters. And it is now generally conceded by
                        every candid man, that every negro sent North will be much worse off than
                        here. All I have to say is, God help the poor helpless negroes. I detest
                        slavery, but I am frank to confess that I do not believe the negroes,
                        generally, are capable of getting a living without a master, and, if they
                        are allowed North, they must just as much be under a master as here.</p>
