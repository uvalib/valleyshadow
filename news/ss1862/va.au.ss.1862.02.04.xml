                                <transcript>
                                        <p>The County Court were engaged during last week in the
                                                examining trial of Mr. Henry J. Webster, of
                                                Columbia, Tenn., who, in November last, killed Mr.
                                                John B. Snider in the oyster saloon of Mr. John
                                                Beck, of this place. When this act was committed,
                                                and our citizens found that one of their number, who
                                                was highly esteemed, had been shot down by a soldier
                                                to whom he had offered no provocation, they were
                                                naturally indignant, and feeling that an inexcusable
                                                outrage and a horrible crime had been committed,
                                                were excited to an intense degree against the
                                                perpetrator of the act, and desired to have what
                                                they conceived to be merited punishment inflicted
                                                upon him.</p>
                                        <p>Great interest was manifested in the trial, and the Court
                                                House was nearly filled with spectators from the
                                                beginning to the conclusion of it. As the testimony
                                                was being developed, showing that the act was the
                                                result of an unfortunate accident, instead of a
                                                malicious and murderous intent, the hearts of those
                                                most excited against the prisoner began to relent,
                                                and before it was concluded their feelings of
                                                vengeance were converted into emotions of lively
                                                sympathy for the unfortunate prisoner, and, instead
                                                of desiring to see him punished, hoped that he would
                                                be discharged and set at liberty. The cause was
                                                argued on the part of the Commonwealth by Capt.
                                                Henderson M. Bell and Col. Wm. H. Harman, and, on
                                                behalf of the prisoner, by Hugh W. Sheffey, Esq.,
                                                Hon. Alex. H. H. Stuart, and Thos. J. Michie, Esq.
                                                The Commonwealth was well represented, and as strong
                                                a view as the testimony would justify was presented
                                                against the prisoner. The speeches on behalf the
                                                defence, having the advantage of testimony, were
                                                able and conclusive, and having the advantage of the
                                                strong feelings of sympathy which the character of
                                                the testimony had excited in behalf of the prisoner,
                                                were pathetic to an unusual degree, and many persons
                                                "unused to the melting mood" shed tears of sympathy
                                                profusely. The prisoner was proven to be a young man
                                                of pre-eminently good character, of a kind and
                                                humane disposition, of a mild and even temper, of
                                                good morals and pure integrity, honorable, high
                                                minded, brave and chivalrous; a dutiful son and a
                                                faithful and obedient soldier, who never disobeyed
                                                an order, and who was never absent from his post of
                                                duty; that he was Sergeant in the Company to which
                                                he belonged, and was exceedingly popular with the
                                                whole Company. When the Commonwealth had concluded
                                                the argument, and whilst the members of the Court
                                                were consulting as to the character of the decision
                                                they would announce, and when, to the Spectators,
                                                the fate of the prisoner seemed to be suspended in a
                                                doubtful balance; the profoundest silence prevailed,
                                                and the vast number of spectators seemed to be
                                                holding their breath, fearing that the next word
                                                which should break the silence would reconsign him
                                                to the prisoner's gloomy cell. When the Presiding
                                                Justice announced that the majority of the Court
                                                were in favor of <emph rend="italic"
                                                >discharging</emph> the prisoner, the pent up
                                                emotions of the sympathizers, unmindful of the
                                                impropriety and indecorum of the act, found
                                                expression in loud, repeated and heart felt cheers.
                                                An Atlaen load of oppressive dread was removed from
                                                their hearts, and, without taking time to think that
                                                they were in the presence of a Court still in
                                                session, they gave expression to their emotions of
                                                relief and pleasure by loud cheering and repeated
                                                ejaculations of gratification. </p>
                                        <p>This decision of the Court will be gratifying to the
                                                friends of the worthy deceased, as it will satisfy
                                                them that their dear friend was consigned to his
                                                untimely grave by an accident and not by the
                                                fiendish act of a murderer--that the hand which slew
                                                him was innocent of guilt, and not stained with a
                                                crime which the waters of ocean could not efface. It
                                                must be a relief to them to know that his fate,
                                                though sad and untimely, was not caused by a
                                                murderer, but by a mere accident on the part of a
                                                worthy young man who meant not the slightest ill to
                                                him. It is to be hoped that this sad affair will
                                                have the effect of causing the unfortunate
                                                instrument of it to resolve never again to put that
                                                into his mouth which will steal away his brains.</p>
                                        <p>It is hoped that he will firmly resolve <lb/>Never to
                                                lift the wine cup, though pleasure may swim

                                <summary>Outlines the provisions of the state militia bill regarding
                                        the conscription of soldiers. All men between 18 and 45 are
                                        eligible to be drafted. Men who are currently in the army
                                        are also liable to the draft. The Spectator worries that the
                                        bill will disband the present army and create a new one,
                                        which will temporarily leave the state without an army.</summary>

                                        <p>The official report of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, giving a
                                                clear and detailed account of the operations of the
                                                forces under his command from the time he went to
                                                Harper's Ferry to the conclusion of the great battle
                                                of Manassas, has been published. We have room only
                                                for a few brief extracts. In reference to the fight
                                                at Falling Waters, better known as the fight at
                                                Hainesville, in which a battalion of Col. Harper's
                                                Regiment, (the 5th) with Pendleton's Battery engaged
                                                the enemy, the report says:</p>
                                        <p>On the 2nd of July, General Patterson again crossed the
                                                Potomac. Col. Jackson, pursuant to instructions,
                                                fell back before him. In retiring he gave him a
                                                severe lesson in the affair at Falling Waters. With
                                                a battalion of the 5th Virginia Regiment (Harper's)
                                                and Pendleton's Battery of Field Artillery, he
                                                engaged the enemy's advance, skillfully taking a
                                                position where the smallness of his force was
                                                concealed, he engaged them for a considerable time,
                                                inflicted a heavy loss and retired when about to be
                                                outflanked, scarcely losing a man, but bringing off
                                                forty-five prisoners.</p>
                                        <p>In speaking of the gallant manner in which our troops
                                                conducted themselves in the battle of Manassas, Gen.
                                                Johnston says:</p>
                                        <p>The admirable character of our troops is incontestably
                                                proved by the result of this battle; especially when
                                                it is remembered that little more than six thousand
                                                men of the army of the Shenandoah, with sixteen
                                                guns, and less than two thousand of that of the
                                                Potomac, with six guns, for full five hours
                                                successfully resisted thirty-five thousand United
                                                States troops, with a powerful artillery and a
                                                superior force of regular cavalry.</p>
                                        <p>It will thus be seen that 8,000 Southern troops
                                                successfully withstood, defeated, and routed 85,000
                                                of the enemy. The importance of the junction of Gen.
                                                Johnston's forces with that of Gen. Beauregard will
                                                be appreciated when it is observed that there were
                                                three times as many of his men engaged as there were
                                                of Beauregard's. The following will show the
                                                respective losses in these commands--the army of the
                                                Potomac being that of Beauregard, and the army of
                                                the Shenandoah, that of Johnston:</p>
                                        <p>The loss of the army of the Potomac was 108 killed, 510
                                                wounded, 12 missing. That of the army of the
                                                Shenandoah was 270 killed, 979 wounded, 18 missing.</p>
                                        <p>Total killed 878</p>
                                        <p>Total wounded 1,489</p>
                                        <p>Total missing 80</p>
                                        <p>That of the enemy could not be ascertained.--It must have
                                                been between 4,000 and 5,000.--Twenty eight pieces
                                                of artillery, about 5,000 muskets, and nearly
                                                500,000 cartridges; a garrison flag and 10 colors
                                                were captured on the field or in the pursuit.
                                                Besides these we captured 64 artillery horses, with
                                                their harness, 26 wagons, and much camp equipage,
                                                clothing, and other property abandoned in their
                                                flight. * * * * * * * * *</p>
                                        <p>It will be remarked that the three Brigadier-Generals of
                                                the Army of the Shenandoah were all wounded. I have
                                                already mentioned the wound of General Smith.
                                                General Jackson, though painfully wounded early in
                                                the day, commanded his brigade to the close of the
                                                action. General Bee, after great exposure at the

                                                just as our reinforcements were coming up.</p>
                                        <p>Gen. Johnston concludes his report by assigning the
                                                following satisfactory reasons for not pushing on to
                                                Washington:</p>
                                        <p>The apparent firmness of the United States troops at
                                                Centreville who had not been engaged which checked
                                                our pursuit, the strong forces occupying the works
                                                near Georgetown, Arlington and Alexandria, the
                                                certainty, too, that General Patterson, if needed,
                                                would reach Washington, with his army of thirty
                                                thousand men sooner than we could, and the condition
                                                and inadequate means of the army in ammunition,
                                                provisions, and transportation, prevented any
                                                serious thoughts of advancing against the Capital.
                                                It is certain that the fresh troops within the works
                                                were, in number, quite sufficient for their defence;
                                                if not, Gen. Patterson's army would certainly
                                                reinforce them soon enough.</p>
