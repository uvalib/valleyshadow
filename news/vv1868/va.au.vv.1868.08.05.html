<b>Shall Virginians Vote?</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article wishes to convey the importance of the upcoming
                    election to Augusta's voters. He question: "Shall Virginia vote," is answered
                    with an unmitigated "yes." He cites Virginia's previous constitutions (1851 and
                    Alexandria) as the legal basis for electing electors for President and
                    Vice-President, but more importantly, he suggests that Virginians have a duty to
                    vote out the existing radicals and prevent more radicals from taking power.
                    Those who fail to act on this duty will suffer the wrath of God's curses.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Our answer has been, is, and will be--YES. Our duty to ourselves and to the
                        great Democratic party of the country demands imperatively that in this hour
                        of trail, Virginia's fair escutcheon be kept pure and stainless as when
                        given to us by heroic sons of the two Revolutions. When Virginians laid down
                        their arms at Appomatox, their matchless honor, bravery and
                        integrity were themes of admiration--even amid our foes. None of these did
                        they surrender to the recreant, whose quondam cognomen now heads the radical
                        ticket. Will they yield to them now?--People of the Old Dominion, the spirit
                        of Washington looks down upon us while we make our choice! The issues
                        involved are not complicated; our honor is concerned, and we cannot, must not, WILL
                        NOT hesitate! Should we fail to perform this duty, God's curses,
                        mankind's, and our own will rest upon us!</p>
                    <p> The Constitution of 1851 is undoubtedly the Constitution of Virginia. Upon
                        this point all of our best legal minds agree--although the Alexandria
                        Convention made no change in regard to the election of electors for
                        President and Vice-President--on this particular point the Constitution of
                        1851 remains intact. On this ground--if on none other, do we make out our
                        case as having a clear right--which makes it an imperative duty--to cast our
                        vote at the ensuing Presidential election. By the provisions of sec. 7,
                        chap. 7, title 3, of both the Constitution of 1851 and the Alexandria
                        Constitution, the Governor is required, "on or before the first day of
                        August, in every year in which such elections are to be held," (that is,
                        election of electors of President and Vice President) to "appoint three
                        persons in each county--in the corporation of Williamsburg--and in each
                        corporation in which wards are established, as commissioners, any two of
                        whom may act, to superintend the election," etc.--This clearly defines the
                        duty of our Governor, that is, if we have a legal Governor. In case he fails
                        to execute the law--(no doubt he will)--or if we have no legal Governor--and
                        no intelligent man would venture to affirm that we have, then again does
                        both constitutions provide for the identical emergency. By sec. 11, ch. 7,
                        title 3, of both constitutions, it is provided that "If only one of said
                        commissioners appointed to superintend any of the elections before
                        mentioned, shall attend and be willing to act, he may associate with himself
                        as a commissioner and freeholder who may be present; and if none of the
                        commissioners attend, or none shall have been
                        appointed, then any two freeholders present, and agreeing to act,
                        shall be commissioners. Any such commissioner, appointed or agreeing to act
                        as prescribed in this section, shall take the same oath, perform the same
                        duties, and be subject to the same penalties, as if he had been originally
                        appointed as commissioner."</p>
                    <p> Such is the law. The infamous bill referred to the Senate (so-called)
                        proposing to prevent us from taking any part on the coming election was
                        defeated. We are free to make our own choice. Are you For or Against, men of
                        the Valley? But no! We do not doubt you! For years did you face famine and
                        death with a fortitude that has made the name of Virginia immortal, and now
                        you will not desert the Right! Let us do our duty, and vote!--leaving to the
                        Democracy of the North their duty--counting our
                        vote! In your names we send them greeting, assuring them that
                        although the birth-place of Washington and Henry and Madison and Lee is
                        under the heel of the oppressor--that Virginia <br> "Is not dead, nor deaf,
                        nor dumb; <br>She breathes, she burns, she'll come, she'll come." </p>

<b>The Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is an appeal to readers to vote in favor of a subscription to
                    a new segment of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Although the road has many
                    opponents, the author nevertheless insists that the opposition's arguments are
                    far outweighed by the benefits the new road will bring to Augusta. For one, the
                    distance to Richmond will be shortened by a great deal, but more important,
                    investment in the new road will bring significant returns to all those who
                    subscribe. The author calls to the men of Augusta County not to stand idly by.
                    They must apply themselves and work diligently to see the railroad through;
                    otherwise, the company could take another, cheaper and shorter route. This
                    alarming admission is meant to push Augusta men into action.<br>(Names in announcement:   Stuart,   Baldwin,   Michie,   Echols)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have time and again urged the friends of the subscription of this road to
                        go to work, and canvass the county thoroughly, to discuss the subject fully
                        in private and in public in every part of the county; to answer every
                        objection of its enemies; to see every voter and convince the people of the
                        importance and propriety of voting for the subscription. We make one more
                        earnest appeal to you, to shake off your lethargy and go to work. Your wily
                        opponents are working secretly, but actively and effectively, whilst you are
                        idly and criminally sleeping in the shade.</p>
                    <p>Why was the election postponed by the last County Court? It was done in
                        opposition to the wishes and remonstrances of the friends of the road, and
                        just upon the eve of the completion of the contract with the commissioners.
                        Can any one doubt that the sole object of the postponement was to defeat the
                        subscription? We have heard, and do not doubt, that the settled purpose of
                        some of the Justices who are in favor of the subscription look to this
                        matter, and see that the election is not put off again.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature of Virginia and West Virginia have passed the most liberal
                        acts of incorporation of the purpose of organizing a company to build this
                        road, and have appointed commissioners to contract with some company to
                        build it in accordance with these acts. In November last these commissioners
                        entered into a conditional contract with the Virginia Central Railroad
                        Company, whereby they agreed to invest the Central Company with all the
                        property, rights, privileges and franchises of both States in the Covington
                        and Ohio Railroad, provided that unconditional subscriptions to the amount
                        of three and-a-half millions of dollars are made to the preferred stock of
                        the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company, by the counties and corporations
                        along its line. This subscription must be made by the first of September, or
                        the contract is void. If the subscription is obtained, the Virginia Central
                        Railroad ceases to exist, or rather, it becomes merged into the Chesapeake
                        and Ohio Railroad Company.</p>
                    <p>The counties and corporations subscribing are to give the company their
                        bonds, payable in thirty years or less--and for these bonds the company
                        gives certificates of preferred stock, and they guarantee that when the road
                        is opened to the Ohio river, that these certificates shall pay an annual
                        dividend of 8 per centum. The present stock-holders surrender all claims to
                        dividends until the new stock holders receive 8 per centum per annum, and
                        the States of Virginia and West Virginia surrender all claims to taxes
                        against the property of the Chesapeake and Ohio Company until they shall
                        declare a dividend of ten per centum per annum on their whole capital.</p>
                    <p>The bonds of the counties will be called for in installments, as they may be
                        needed in the course of the construction of the work, and the counties will
                        have to pay the interest on these installments until the road is opened to
                        the Ohio river, when the interest will be paid by the dividends. No one who
                        had taken the trouble to inform himself on this subject doubts that when
                        this road is completed that it will pay 10 or 15 per cent, dividends. If it
                        pays 10 per cent, 8 per cent of that amount will pay the interest, and the
                        other 2 per cent, set aside as a sinking fund, will pay the principle in
                        seventeen and one-third years. So that for the trifling sum of thirty or
                        forty thousand dollars, paid in three or four years, the county can receive
                        all the benefits and blessings resulting from the construction of this great
                        road, and in time enjoy the benefit of an annual income of twenty or thirty
                        thousand dollars from her dividends in the stock of this road.</p>
                    <p>But this is not all. If the road is built on this place, you are guaranteed
                        the short line from here to Richmond; if this short line is built, it will
                        practically shorten the distance about one-fourth from here to that city,
                        which will save one fourth of the freight and fare now paid by the people of
                        Augusta to the Central Railroad Company. From the last annual report of the
                        Central Company we find that very little less than $145,000 was paid for
                        freights alone, and fully as much more for passenger fare, making
                        $200,000.--If this short line had been finished, one fourth of that would
                        have been saved to the county. One fourth of $290,000 is $72,000. This
                        saving for one year is double as much as the county will have to pay in all,
                        if she makes this subscription.</p>
                    <p>If the county does not make the subscription, and the Central Railroad does
                        not build the Covington and Ohio Railroad, will the short line ever be
                        built? We answer--No! Because it won't pay to build it. The trade and travel
                        over the road will not justify the immense outlay of money necessary to
                        build a railroad from Richmond to Charlottesville.</p>
                    <p> We have heard some of the persons who oppose the subscription say, that the
                        Covington and Ohio Railroad will be built anyhow, and when it is built, the
                        short line will be built as a necessity. This is a great mistake. If the
                        Covington and Ohio Railroad is not built by the
                        Central Company, that road will never carry the immense trade and travel of
                        the West over the line. The same Company that owns the western end will own
                        a line of its own through to Richmond and the Chesapeake Bay. Much as we
                        regret to make the admission, still, after a careful examination of the map,
                        and a thorough knowledge of the topography of the country, we are forced to
                        admit that there is a shorter, cheaper, and better route from Covington to
                        Richmond and Norfolk, than the present road through Augusta county. We would
                        not call public attention to this alarming argument if we did not know that
                        the people of the West had already been casting their eyes in that
                        direction. They are only waiting now for the action of the Central Railroad
                        Company. The vote of Augusta county on the 27th of August will forever
                        decide the question of a short line from here to Richmond as well as the
                        route of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Again, we say to the friends of
                        the road, go to work with all your might until the election is over. And in
                        conclusion, we must earnestly call upon Messers. Stuart, Baldwin, Michie,
                        Echols, and all friends of the road, to make appointments and address the
                        people on this subject, before it is too late. This is the great
                        "reconstruction;" the only salvation of the State! Let us all work together,
                        for the regeneration of our dear old Mother.</p>

<b>Impeachment</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In support of President Johnson, this article illustrates the evil designs
                    of the Radical Party. The Radicals' plan, albeit "unconstitutional," is to seize
                    power by placing "usurpers" from the South in the Senate, thereby creating the
                    two-thirds majority necessary to depose the president. However, even if this
                    comes to pass, President Johnson should stand firm and defend his office. In
                    other words, the president should "resist the illegal order to abandon his

                        flagrantly unconstitutional and so palpably designed for partisan and
                        revolutionary objects. In our judgment he ought to resist the illegal order
                        to abandon his post at the helm of the Government. He is sworn not only to
                        "maintain," but to "defend" the Constitution of
                        the United States, and if he tamely suffers the Presidential office to be
                        violated by unlawful and usurped power, he fails to keep his oath. He ought
                        to refuse to give up his reins, and if the radical factions elect to use
                        force, let them shoulder the responsibility and the consequences. A great
                        many people believe this tyrannical and liberty-hating party will not cease
                        their iniquitous war upon constitutional freedom until the mailed hand of
                        the people brings them to their senses. However this may be, it is clear
                        that the friends and defenders of the Constitution have forborne and given
                        back long enough, and should now halt and take not another step to the rear.
                        A stand may as well be made on this attempt to depose the President as any
                        where else, and we trust that Andrew Johnson will vindicate his likeness to
                        Andrew Jackson, and take his stand firmly in defense of his great office and
                        of the people.</p>
