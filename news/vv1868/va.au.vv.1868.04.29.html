<b>Work of the Virginia Convention</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is divided into two parts. First, various provisions of the
                    radical constitution are presented and shown to be extremely unpopular with
                    white Virginians, particularly those which allow blacks to serve in state
                    offices and on juries. Some radical legislators admit that the inclusion of the
                    provisions, which are viewed by many as the foundations of Negro supremacy, will
                    kill the constitution. Part two is the conservative response. The fundamental
                    premise here is that the ratification of the radical constitution will hinder
                    Virginia's readmission into the Union and provide the basis for further racial
                    conflict. In the conservative mind, both races will benefit if the radicals are
                    voted down. Providence has determined that the United States was to be
                    controlled by white men, and giving black people controlling interest in the
                    nation would only lead to violence. One of the main fears expressed by this
                    article is that the US Congress will impose the radical constitution even if it
                    is not ratified. The authors have faith that this will not happen.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As Already stated by telegraph, the Virginia convention, composed mostly of
                        Northern men and foreigners, who have drifted to Virginia by the wars, of
                        native Africans, and a few native radicals, with a moderate sprinkling of
                        conservatives, which has been in session for nearly five months, concluded
                        its labors on Saturday, the 19th inst. The day before its adjournment, Gen.
                        Schofield, escorted by his staff, entered the hall of the convention, and
                        made an address from the Speaker's stand, in which he told the members
                        plainly that the extended disfranchisements and disqualifications for office
                        which they had embodied in the constitution would in his judgment, "prove
                        fatal to that instrument," and that "it is practically impossible to carry
                        on a government in Virginia predicated upon that basis." Gen. Schofield then
                        went into some explanatory details, derived from his experience in
                        administering the laws under the reconstruction acts for more than a year,
                        to establish his opinion that a sufficient number of men cannot be found in
                        the counties of Virginia capable of filling the offices who can take the
                        test oath. He used some very strong language stating that the provision, if
                        left in the constitution, would not only be opposed to the wishes of their
                        friends, but fatal to the constitution, and perhaps to themselves.</p>
                    <p>This was the first time, he declared, that he had attempted to exercise the
                        slightest influence over the actions of the convention, but he felt that it
                        was his duty now "to convey to them what he conceived to be the effect of
                        such a law, its practical bearing upon the political affairs of the country,
                        and upon the interests, if they pleased,  of the party to which they belonged." The
                        General's appeal, however, had no effect, and the provision was retained.</p>
                    <p>At the final close of the convention on the 19th, several speeches were made
                        by radical members, among them Judge Snead, who was a Union man throughout
                        the war, and declared he was "firmly persuaded that a majority of qualified
                        voters will stamp this constitution with the seal of their decided and
                        everlasting condemnation." The speaker was especially severe upon the
                        retrospective homestead provisions exempting two thousand dollars' worth of
                        property from execution, or debts antecedently or subsequently contracted.
                        Mr. Allan, another radical, a Union soldier during the war, who received but
                        one white vote when elected to the convention, denounced the constitution on
                        account of the disfranchising clause, in the most bitter terms, and said the
                        clause referred to "is of such a character as not only to secure its defeat
                        before the people, but will not receive the approval of the national
                        Congress, even in ease of its ratification here." Mr. Allan warned the
                        colored men that the only boon the constitution, if adopted, would secure to
                        them would be to have the power for a few years of rewarding ambitious men
                        with office, and leaving as a legacy to their children the hatred of every
                        white man where they live.</p>
                    <p>ADDRESS OF CONSERVATIVES</p>
                    <p>The conservative members of the convention have published a lengthy address
                        to the people of Virginia, in which they thoroughly analize the
                        various features of the constitution which the convention had propounded.</p>
                    <p>These are negro suffrage, under which no prepayment of a poll tax is required
                        as heretofore in Virginia, and paupers are not excluded; county and township
                        organizations (the latter never heard of before in Virginia) with
                        subdivision of townships into school districts and road districts creating
                        thereby in the smaller counties about sixty petty officers, and in the
                        larger about two hundred, all of which, by the operation of the test oath,
                        would, in a large majority of the counties east of the Blue Ridge, be
                        negroes or such white men as would come under their control; the refusal,
                        while universal suffrage has been given to the blacks, of "universal
                        amnesty" to the whites, by incorporating in the constitution the "iron clad"
                        oath, applicable to all officers, from Governor to surveyor of a road, and
                        which not one white man in a thousand in the State can take; the adoption of
                        a basis of representation and appointment by which, with a white majority
                        (excluding the disfranchised) of 35,000 in the State, the blacks will have a
                        majority of twenty one on joint ballot in the Legislature; the almost
                        exclusive assignment to the whites of the payment of the taxes, the
                        appropriation of large sources of revenue to schools which the property
                        owners who support them cannot enjoy the benefits of. Says the address:</p>
                    <p>"An effort was made in the committee on education, and afterward on two
                        several occasions in the convention, to procure a declaration that separate
                        public schools for the white and black children. It was voted down in every
                        case. The negroes desired mixed schools, and their white associates feared
                        to offend them."</p>
                    <p>It was finally agreed to leave the Legislature, where the blacks will have a
                        majority of twenty one to deal with it. Other features of the new instrument
                        are the excessive and retroactive homestead exemption above referred to; the
                        militia and jurors, in which no distinctions are made of race or color,
                        except that none but those who are made voters have the right to sit on
                        juries, thus excluding from juries the disfranchised white voters of the
                        State; the guarantee of equal "public privileges," which is understood to be
                        designed to secure to negroes free access to all hotels, railroad cars, and
                        other public places the abolition of the old fashioned, above board system
                        of viva voce voting in Virginia and the
                        substitution of the secret ballot. There is also a section in regard to
                        church property, the design of which is believed to be to transfer the
                        Methodist Church property in Virginia to the Northern Methodist Church. In
                        conclusion the address says:</p>
                    <p>"Such is the constitution submitted to you, fellow citizens, for your
                        ratification, and such the instrument bitterly denominated a measure of
                        reconstruction and of restoration of the Union. The constitution of Georgia,
                        which happens to be before us--objectionable as it is to Southern
                        people--provides for universal negro suffrage, but it differs from the
                        constitution offered to the people of Virginia in several important
                        respects. Not one human being is disfranchised; not one questionable oath is
                        required; the existing county organization of the State was left untouched;
                        no person is allowed to vote until he shall have paid all the tax assessed
                        against him; and the General Assembly is required to provide by law for the
                        selection of upright and intelligent persons to serve as jurors.</p>
                    <p>"It now devolves upon the white people of Virginia to pass upon this
                        instrument. By the registration of last year, from which some 15,000 whites
                        were excluded by disfranchisement, the whites had a majority in the State of
                        over 14,000. This majority, under the new registration which will take
                        place, may be increased 5,000 in the Valley alone."</p>
                    <p>"It has been said that Congress if we defeat it will put this constitution on
                        us. Then let Congress be the author of this great wrong; and let not
                        Virginia, under any menace of violence weakly be tempted to offer no
                        resistance to her ravisher. The adoption of the constitution by the people
                        of the State and the imposition of it on them by the republican party of the
                        North are two very different things, and may be followed by very different
                        results.</p>
                    <p>"It is proper, however, to remark, that it is by no means certain nor do we
                        think it probable, that Congress will impose this constitution on us if we
                        reject it. The instrument is very different in its character from that
                        contemplated by the acts of Congress; these did not profess more than the
                        purpose to provide for protection to the negro; but the constitution framed
                        leaves it necessary to provide for the protection of the white man. It has
                        been suggested that this political party in possession of the federal
                        government, preparatory to the presidential election, are anxious to have
                        the Southern States in the Union; but were it admissible to entertain the
                        hypothesis that party considerations would influence Congress in this
                        matter, Virginia might well be an exception to the Southern States in
                        general, as her vote would probably be cast against the party in question at
                        the presidential election, and indeed, must be, if the whites will only take
                        care to register, as we can command a white majority of thirty five
                        thousand.</p>
                    <p> "It is our duty, then, to act together; to avoid all divisions, to disregard
                        all cavilling objections; and to vote down the proposed
                        constitution. Judge Snead of Accomac--one of the ablest of his party, a
                        consistent Union man during the war, elected to the convention as a radical,
                        and acting with his party for three months of this session of the body--was
                        compelled, at the last moment, to declare that the constitution established
                        negro supremacy, and that, although in favor of negro
                        suffrage, he had no alternative but to vote against it at the polls.</p>
                    <p> "That the negroes of the South  establish themselves in any permanent
                        supremacy over the whites we do not, however, accept for a moment. The white
                        race of the South can never be destroyed. When the negroes are put over us
                        then at least we should put forth our strength. We shall offer such
                        inducements to white immigration that these sparsely settled States must
                        rapidly fill up.--The negroes will be overwhelmed with numbers, and it will
                        be too late to make any terms. It is perfectly evident that Providence
                        designs the territory of the United States as a theatre of a great white
                        empire, whose power and whose civilization shall exert a controlling
                        influence in the history of the future. That the three or four millions of
                        blacks here can interpose any barrier to the realization of this destiny is
                        plainly chimerical. The only question is shall the changes which impend in
                        the South be gradual or violent? With peace between the races the whites of
                        the South might be saved from much that awaits them under the radical
                        programme and the blacks, while remitted to their proper position in
                        society, would be saved from rapid extinction as a race."</p>
                    <p>In protesting against the establishment of negro supremacy, the address says
                        they plead for both races and adds:</p>
                    <p> "In conclusion, making no hypocritical professions, we affirm in sincerity
                        and in truth that the people of this State desire to be restored to the
                        Union, and cherish no purpose of disloyalty to the government; that they
                        long for the establishment of kindly relations between all the sections of
                        the country, and that they entertain no other feelings or purpose than those
                        of kindness and benevolence towards the negroes."--Balt
                            Sun.</p>

                        tomfoolery that now hampers and weighs down this great people. The issue is
                        simple: Is there to be law in this land or
                        anarchy? Come down to the work!</p>
