<b>Labor Honorable and Idleness Dishonorable</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this piece condemns the idle and lazy. Labor, he argues, must
                    be made honorable, even for rich men's sons. While there are many who are unfit
                    for hard labor due to war wounds, these men can nevertheless work in
                    intellectual pursuits. All others must turn to labor. Although Virginia is
                    desolated, the land has great potential, and the author concludes it is shameful
                    that such rich land should go to waste for want of "men to till it."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>- We copy the following from the New Orleans Picayune:</p>
                    <p>"Public sentiment is fast coming around at the South to a more just
                        appreciation, not only to the dignity of labor, but to the want of dignity
                        in idleness, whether it result from pride or laziness."</p>
                    <p>It is enough that "we should make labor honorable." When has it been held
                        dishonorable, except when a meagre number, rich men's sons, or children of
                        parvenus, who have soon sloughed off with their ill managed lavishness?</p>
                    <p>We must have something more than this. We must have work to make a man
                        respectable in society. But what if he is rich; must he work? Yes, he must;
                        because he is a man and should be useful, should set good examples, should
                        multiply the talents God has given him, and should make happy others around
                        him, not so well off, by setting them advantageously to work. But no man who
                        brags of his strength in fight or wrestle, of his agility as a jumper or a
                        dancer, should shirk work in the corn or potato field.</p>
                    <p>It is contemptible, in this day of delolation [sic] and poverty in the South
                        - when the cry of starvation goes into Congress for the benefit of whites as
                        well as negroes - that white men should haunt grog shops and street corners,
                        in city or country, or even hug the eaves of houses, when so much rich land
                        is growing up in brush and weed for the want of men to till it. They can get
                        use of it for nothing, and make a livelihood for themselves and their
                        sisters and mothers, who now, perhaps, have to support them out of scanty
                        savings or petty earnings. Have these men no shame? If they have not, let
                        the community put them to shame and spew them out as worthless!</p>
                    <p>It is not only the idle negro that curses the South; it is the idle white
                        man, too. That he curses the North also, chiefly its cities and towns, does
                        not, make it less true of him here. There are a few men, by reason of age or
                        infirmity; there are others, who being crippled or otherwise unfit for hard
                        labor, should have lighter or intellectual tasks, and who work courageously
                        and steadily in them; but a multitude of those out of employment might find
                        it easily if they were not falsely ashamed of work, or too lazy to be
                        useful.</p>
                    <p>To cure such, and to renovate and reconstruct the South, we need to make
                        idleness dishonorable!</p>

<b>What is Education?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article illustrates the various types of education. While a practical
                    education to provide an individual with knowledge "useful" for one's vocation is
                    deemed important, it is not the only education that a person should obtain. The
                    author also illustrates the importance of an education teaching the individual
                    his duties of a citizen.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The extraordinary sacrifices and exertions made by the impoverished Southern
                        people, since the war, to educate their children; our flourishing schools
                        and colleges, would seem to make this question superfluous; but, many who
                        think so, would be very much at a loss to answer it correctly. Every man is
                        a free country, wants three sorts of education: one, to fit him for his own
                        particular trade or calling, or a professional education; another, to teach
                        him his duties as a man and a citizen: his moral and political education;
                        and third, to fit him for his higher relations, as one of God's creatures,
                        designed for immortality, which is religious education.</p>
                    <p>In point of fact, that is more useful to man which tends most to his
                        happiness; a thing so plain, that it almost seems foolish to state it. Yet
                        people constantly take the word "useful" in a different sense, and mean by
                        it, not what tends most to a man's happiness, but what will get the most
                        money for him; hence, they call professional education a very "useful"
                        thing, while they grudge, as throw away, the time spent in general
                        education, whether moral or religious, more especially, if it in anyway
                        interferes with the education which enables a man to gain his livelihood,
                        and make money. Yet we might be perfect in our several trades and
                        professions and still be very ignorant, very miserable, and very wicked. -
                        In fact, we might do very well while at work, but no man can work always.</p>
                    <p>There is a time which we spend with our families - a time we spend with our
                        friends and neighbors, and a very important time which we, especially, spend
                        with ourselves. If we know not how to pass these times profitably, we must
                        be very contemptible and worthless men, be we ever so excellent as editors,
                        mechanics, lawyers, doctors, ministers, farmers, laborers, or whatever may
                        be our particular calling. Hence, it strikes us, that it is our general
                        education that enables us to pass these times well, not our professional
                        one, as is well illustrated by the ladies, who in speaking of an agreeable
                        gentleman, say "he leaves the shop at home." The education which all men
                        equally used, and that which teaches a man, in the first place, his duty to
                        God and his neighbor; which trains him to good principles and good temper;
                        to think of others and not of self. It is that education, which teaches him
                        in the next place, his duty as a citizen; to obey the laws always, but to
                        try to get them made as perfect as possible; to understand that a good and
                        just government cannot consult the interests of a particular class or
                        calling, in preference to another, but must see what is for the good of the
                        whole; that every interest, and every order of men must give and take, and
                        that if each was to insist upon having everything his own way, there could
                        be nothing but the wildest confusion or the meanest tyranny. - If the
                        greater part of all that goes wrong in life, public, or private, arise from
                        ignorance, stupidity, and bad reasoning, it should teach us to reason
                        justly, and put us on our guard against the tricks of unfair writers and
                        talkers, or the confusions of the mutton headed, and it will prove the most
                        valuable part of a man's education, a part he will derive benefit from,
                        whenever he has occasion to open his mouth to speak, or his ears to hear.</p>
                    <p>Finally, all that makes a man's mind move actively; all that gives him nobler
                        and more beautiful ideas; is a great addition to his happiness, when alone,
                        and to the pleasure others derive from his society. Therefore, it is most
                            useful to learn to love and appreciate what
                        is beautiful, whether in the works of God, or of
                        man; whether in the flowers and fields, mountains or rivers; the woods, sea
                        or sky; or in fine pictures, splendid buildings, sweet music, and all the
                        noble thoughts and glorious images of poetry. This is the sort of an
                        education, which will make a man happy, a people good, wise, and great. Give
                        this, and the ends of professional education can never be altogether lost;
                        for good sense and sound principle will ensure a man's knowing his
                        particular business; but knowledge of his business alone, can never ensure
                            them. Not only all secure knowledge and
                        goodness, the rarest and most profitable qualities, with which any man can
                        enter upon life now, but they are articles with which the market will never
                        be glutted, and of which no competition or over production will lesson the
                        value; further, the more we can succeed in manufacturing, the higher will be
                        their price, because there will be more to understand and love them. As
                        Solomon said, "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that
                        getteth understanding." "For the merchandise of it is better than the
                        merchandise of solver, and the gain of gold," and "Her ways are ways of
                        pleasantness, and all her paths are peace."</p>

<b>The Convention in Richmond</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper ridicules the constitutional convention in Richmond.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have not bored and disgusted our readers by filling the Valley Virginian
                        with reports of the Convention now being held in Richmond. We pity the
                        papers which have to do it, and we pity the Conservative gentlemen who are
                        so nobly standing their ground in it. That Convention has done nothing yet
                        worthy of notice. Any farmer, who wishes to enjoy a sight of it, can do so
                        by calling in the negroes of the neighborhood, and setting them loose--one
                        day is just like another; the same rant, the same disgusting mixture of mean
                        white and ignorant negro jabber--the same quiet dignity on the part of the
                        suffering Conservatives. We believe it best, and surely more agreeable, to
                        attend to other interests, and the thing "severally alone," and think it
                        would be good policy for the city papers too. It has been made "too much
                        of," and nothing sooner spoils a mean white man, or a negro. When the
                        "Mountain" gets through with its labors, and presents its "mouse" to the
                        people of Virginia, we expect to show what it has done in a few words. Then
                        comes the time for work, and hard work, too; until then, we should keep
                        quiet and prepare for action.</p>

                    is certain that the competition against which they will have to contend for the

                    on no such addition to their numbers, but must make up for the inequality by
                    increased efficiency. The ignorant and degraded of whatever color must always be
                    subject to superior intelligence, and it behooves the colored people to reflect

                    <p>Staunton, Va., February 18th, 1868</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor: - As I am about to take leave of your
                        town for a while, I beg leave to occupy a column in your newspaper, to
                        express my sincere regard for the citizens of Staunton, and its vicinity. I
                        have spent three agreeable years in Staunton, as the pastor of the A.M.E.
                        Church: and I can say, without exaggerating, that I have been treated with
                        all due respect imaginable, by both ladies and gentlemen - old and young -
                        and lawyers, doctors, merchants, mechanics and laborers; though a Marylander
                        by birth, and there received my education.</p>
                    <p>I have traveled since the death of my old master, both North, South, East and
                        West, but have not found any people kinder and more friendly than the people
                        in this community, in which I had the honor to reside for three years. I was
                        very much surprised indeed, about six weeks ago, in meeting with the
                        Honorable Judge Sheffey at the house of one of his former servants - who
                        then was lying at the point of death; and when I entered the room, the
                        Honorable Judge rose from his chair to speak and shake hands with me, and
                        after exchanging a few words, he went to the bedside of John Watson, his
                        former servant, and there consoled him with a few words, and then
                        affectionately bid him a farewell. I thought to myself, oh! what sympathy
                        was exhibited from the former master to the servant. I have also to record
                        another instance, where Col. J. B. Baldwin, threw open his parlor, to the
                        wedding guests of Alice Craig, a former servant, whose marriage was to be
                        celebrated at my Church, but the bad state of the weather prevented. I could
                        mention many other instances of kindness, if I had the space, but cannot
                        think of trespassing on your kindness. In fact, I have seen a good many
