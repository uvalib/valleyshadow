<b>Duty of Democrats</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the upcoming presidential election just around the corner, the author
                    of this piece expresses his concern over the future of a reunited nation. While
                    he illustrates the certain Radical victory in some states, he assures his
                    readers that the majority vote could potentially swing to the conservative
                    Democratic Party, particularly since Radical chicanery will be ineffective when
                    all sections of the country vote on the same day. This outcome, however, is
                    certainly not foreordained, but will require a concentrated effort on the part
                    of Democrats across the nation.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The election returns which though not so favorable as we had hoped for, are
                        nevertheless such as to stimulate the Democracy of the three great States
                        that have just voted to buckle on their armor afresh and make a still more
                        vigorous and determined effort to carry those States on the 3d of November
                        for Seymour and Blair. With such standard bearers, with such a cause as
                        theirs--the cause of constitutional liberty and free government in
                        America--and with the large Democratic vote cast for the several State
                        tickets, let our friends in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana rally for the
                        contest in November which will take place in all the States on the same day,
                        a circumstance in itself vastly in favor of the Democrats. That the Radical
                        success in the election on Tuesday was owing to a most lavish expenditure of
                        money, and to a large importation of voters into each of the three States,
                        no one doubts. It is not likely that funds will be at command to the extent
                        in the November election, and all the States voting on the same day, the
                        business of importing voters cannot be conducted to anything like the same
                        extent as doubtless it was in those State elections.</p>
                    <p>The returns thus far indicate that the Radicals have carried Pennsylvania by
                        a majority of from five to eight thousand; Ohio by a majority of some ten
                        thousand while Indiana has probably elected Hendricks Governor. A Democratic
                        gain or a Radical loss of one hundred votes to the county would give the
                        Democrats Indiana by a decided majority. Cannot these gains be made? With
                        proper exertions they may, and we trust that the Democrats will stand with
                        their ranks firm and unbroken, and go into the battle on 3d of November
                        determined to retrieve their fortunes and secure a final victory. Let not
                        the Democrats anywhere abate their zeal, nor tire in their efforts to rescue
                        their country from blighting mis-rule of the Jacobins, who are hurrying the
                        nation into universal bankruptcy and ruin. The country was never in such
                        danger as at this moment. It is a country worth saving, and a change of
                        Federal rulers is the only thing that can save it. If the Democrats succeed
                        in November, the Constitution and the Union will be restored and the country
                        saved. If Radicalism triumphs all will be lost. Democrats, conservatives,
                        patriots, in all the States, to the rescue. Organize, sacrifice and work as
                        becomes you with unflinching spirit and brave determination, and if you do
                        so the victory will be yours!</p>

<b>Virginia Feeling</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The recent convention in the city of Norfolk has yielded what this author
                    describes as the "Virginia feeling." In other words, the people of Norfolk have
                    moved beyond "past honor and glory" to advocate for increased manufacture, the
                    development of cities, and a growth in population. This "feeling" is the
                    catalyst for great things to come. Not only will energies and the development of
                    resources bring monetary benefits, but also it will secure Virginia's place of
                    respect in the Union, and most importantly, give Virginia a voice on a national
                    scale.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The Dispatch says.--One gratifying feature of the
                        Norfolk Convention was the outpouring of Virginia feeling that it elicited.
                        It is no objection that this feeling, under the influence of the viands and
                        excellent wines and brandies which the Norfolk people know so well how to
                        dispense, became a little uproarious at times; it was only a heartfelt
                        impulse made a little more bounding by very agreeable causes!</p>
                    <p>The main point in this demonstration, however, is that it was a presentation
                        of Virginia enthusiasm in the direction of practical utility--in the line of
                        improving the State, extending her commerce, and multiplying her
                        manufactories. This is better than relying on past honor and glory. They do
                        not stand us in stead of the power of men and money in those days, and the
                        very salvation of the State depends upon the vigorous concentration of the
                        public spirit and devotion to the increase of real prosperity and power.</p>
                    <p>With all the natural resources of the State, unless the people are true to
                        her interests and are ready even to make a present sacrifice for her and
                        their future good, we can never make her great.</p>
                    <p>Let us all endeavor to encourage this direction of public sentiment, energies
                        and resources. The reward that it will secure is invaluable. Let us build up
                        great cities and manufacturing towns which will give our farmers market at
                        home. Thus we shall have a great commerce, a greatly increased population,
                        an improved agriculture, enriched and beautiful lands immensely enhanced in
                        value, and a varied industry which will be continually adding to the wealth
                        of the State and resources of the Government. Virginia, then, will add to
                        her great fame an immense physical power which will make her respected, and
                        give her weight in the national councils that will effectually protect her
                        interests in the future.</p>
                    <p>Long live Virginia feeling!</p>

<b>Flourishing Schools in Staunton</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author illustrates the degree to which Staunton's various male and
                    female academies have expanded enrollment since the war. Thus, Staunton's
                    schools are flourishing like never before. Included is a list of academies,
                    their respective head administrators, and the number of enrollees. Implicit in
                    this article is the idea that the valley is producing more educated young people
                    than elsewhere in the "so-called" United States.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. W. A. Harris,  Mary Baldwin, Rev. R. R. H. Phillips,   Young,   May,  Pike Powers)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are glad to find the impetus given to education in our State, and that in
                        some sections at least, more scholars are offered than there is room to
                        receive. We learn that this is the case in Staunton. The correspondent of
                        the Petersburg Express writes that not only are all the female schools in
                        Staunton full, but many applicants had to be reluctantly turned off for want
                        of accommodation.--The same correspondent furnishes the following details:</p>
                    <p>The Wesleyan Female Institute, of which Rev. W.A. Harris is President, has
                        registered 70 boarding pupils, with a like number of day scholars. The
                        Augusta Female Seminary, (Presbyterian), Miss Mary Baldwin, principle, has
                        50 boarders and 50 day pupils.--The Virginia Female Institute,
                        (Episcopalian), Rev. R.R.H. Phillips, principle, refused, I understand, 40
                        pupils, for want of accommodation. The capacity of Mr. Phillips' institute,
                        before the late "unpleasantness," approximated to eighty boarders and about
                        one hundred day pupils. The Staunton Male Academy, Messrs. Young and May,
                        principles, (the latter formerly of Petersburg) have registered 47 scholars.
                        The old established school of Pike Powers, Esq., famous as a University
                        school for youths, has thirty pupils, about as many as that erudite
                        gentleman can well attend to, and do justice to his scholarly abilities. To
                        be brief with this notice is there any other town or city in the United
                        States, so-called, that had to reject pupils on account of being overflowing
