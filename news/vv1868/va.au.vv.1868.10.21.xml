                    <p>As will be seen in this issue, the wife of a poor mechanic in the city of
                        Richmond a short time ago died of starvation. It is a sad thing to have a
                        human being die from want in a Christian community, but we have no doubt
                        that ere the close of this winter there will be many a poor mortal carried
                        to his last resting place for the want of bread. It cannot be otherwise so
                        long as the Radical party have control of the Government. It was as much as
                        the poor man could do to maintain his family when the negroes were compelled
                        to work and their masters had to pay tax on them, but the poor man now is
                        taxed to perpetuate the most abominable nuisance that ever existed in this
                        or any country--the Freedmens' bureau--while the negro pays very little, if
                        any tax. We do not wonder at poor white people starving, nor will we so long
                        as the bread is taken out of their mouths and put in those of the negro, and
                        bond holder. There will, there must be a change in some way. For while our
                        sufferings are almost unbearable, those of the people of North and South
                        Carolina are a thousand times worse; depredations of the most appalling
                        character are perpetuated upon the persons of both sex, old and young. Can
                        this state of affairs be continued for any length of time? We think not, for
                        while the brave men of those States, if permitted, will be good, law-abiding
                        citizens, they are not going to submit to treatment of this kind, as
                        peacefully as the "trooly loil" would have them to.</p>
                    <p>We should not be despondent because of the partial success of Radicalism in
                        the States of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Nebraska, but work harder for
                        the success of the Democratic party. Should our people give up all hope of
                        electing the Democratic nominees, and do nothing towards aiding them, they
                        will not only act in accordance with the wishes of the Republicans but will
                        turn a deaf ear to the cries of the women and children who were committed to
                        their care by those heroic, self sacrificing men who yielded up their lives
                        on Southern battle fields.</p>

                <summary>This article calls for all citizens to support the Democratic party against
                    the radicals. If not, the author suggests, poverty stricken white southerners
                    will continue to suffer the wrath of radicals. They will continue to go hungry,
                    perhaps die in great numbers, while the radicals provide only for negroes. Doing
                    nothing is tantamount to supporting the Republicans.</summary>

                    <p> The Washington Evening Express, of the 16, instant says:--We have seen as
                        yet nothing to discourage us. The opposing statesmen must, at any rate,
                            <emph rend="italic">lean upon us.</emph> The Democratic party, true to
                        its mission, will yet save the country. Our opponents feel at this moment of
                        apparent triumph more than ever the absolute necessity of our strength and
                        help.--Of the prospects before us, it also says:</p>
                    <p> We notice with regret that the New York World suggests a change of
                        candidates, meaning probably, the nomination of Judge Chase. Not a few of
                        our friends have suspected that the World was not heartily for the
                        nominations made by the party, and its course, in pressing even now the
                        adoption of its candidates, who could not be supported by the Democratic
                        party, except for the sake of carrying the election at the expense of its
                        principles, goes far to justify the distrust commonly entertained. No
                        practical mind, upon serious reflection, could entertain a hope of rallying
                        the party for the World's candidates even if we had six months before us to
                        do the work in. The attempt in present circumstances can only be attended
                        with disaster. <emph rend="italic">Nor does the paper in this moment speak
                            for any one having the confidence of the party. Tilden, Belmont, and
                            Schell, the representative men of the party in the city of New York,
                            will discard all responsibility for this foolish freak of the
                        World</emph> --to call it by no worse a name.</p>
                    <p>And why are we called on at this time to surrender? By the World's own
                        showing we have not lost the field. By concentrating all the resources of
                        the corrupt money ring which controls the Government in the great States,
                        the Radicals may have a nominal majority in each of them. But this does not
                        decide the Presidential election. In November the battle has to be fought
                        over this whole Union. We shall then have a much fairer election than we had
                        Tuesday last. It is the duty of every earnest Democrat and Conservative to
                        press on the good work. Now is the time for a renewed vigorous charge all
                        along the line. Our friends must not for one moment mistrust the future. We
                        are the party of the people, and embody the majority of that race which
                        created the Government and upon whom alone its perpetuity depends. We must
                        continue to stand together for the sake of the country and its free
                        institutions. It will be impossible to overthrow them whilst we do so.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Lexington Gazette says of Staunton and the Stauntonians:--it really might
                        be of great service to some of our self-satisfied and over contented
                        townsmen of Lexington, to visit our enterprising little neighboring "city"
                        of Staunton--better known as the county seat of Augusta county. There is a
                        certain go-aheaditiveness about the place, the contagion of which couldn't
                        do Lexington any harm. One thing that we admire about Staunton and the
                        Staunton people, is the supreme complacency with which they pass through
                        life. Everybody in Staunton seems to be certain that Staunton is the first
                        place upon the continent, and that it is going to be the first town on the
                        planet. With what unutterable condescension do they look upon the little
                        villages of Lexington and Charlottesville. "Sir," said one of the most
                        intelligent of all the Stauntonians to a friend of ours, a few days
                        since--"Sir, we have a very prosperous town, but if Washington College and
                        the Military Institute had been located here, our city would extend to
                        Harrisonburg. Sir, they ought to have been located here." Staunton really is
                        a growing town. Its population is estimated to have increased more than
                        2,000 since the war, and its capital and enterprise have increased
                        proportionately. The secret of all this is said to be the railroad. We must
                        have a railroad too. Let our business men and farmers and mechanics make the
                        proper exertions, and we shall have one. $300,000 from Rockbridge county to
                        the Valley Railroad, and it will be made.</p>

                    Lexington no harm to adopt some Stauntonian "go-aheaditiveness."</summary>

                    <p>Now is the time of the year when those worthless, lazy vagabonds, who have
                        been lounging about all summer when there was plenty of work to do, and
                        would not, will begin to commit their thieving depredation throughout the
                        county, and it behooves the business men of this and every community, to be
                        on their watch, lest at the still hour of the night they may find themselves
                        minus their hard wrought earnings. Hardly an exchange can we pick up but we
                        read of house-breaking, robberies, &amp;c., without number, and already
                        we have had a call at their hands. On Wednesday night of last week Messrs.
                        Taylor &amp; Powell's store, on Main street, was broken into and goods
                        to the amount of several hundred dollars worth were taken therefrom, and, as
                        yet, no clue to the perpetrators. Taking into consideration the limited
                        number of police in the city--scarcely composed of a corporal's guard--it is
                        surprising that more depredations of a similar character have not taken
                        place, as it is utterly beyond the power of the police, and too great a tax
                        upon them to watch the city both day and night, and unless something is
                        done, and that soon, we may expect to hear of numerous instances of this
                        kind.</p>
                    <p>It is known that a large number of convicts from the penitentiary have lately
                        escaped from the line of the Ohio &amp; Chesapeake Railroad, as also on
                        their transit to that place, and it is doubtless true that some of them are
                        lurking in this vicinity, "seeking whom they may devour;" and lest we may be
                        devoured, we should at once take the initiatory steps to prevent it.</p>
                    <p>What we would propose to suggest is, that the business men should call a
                        meeting to hire out one or more efficient secret night-watch, and devise
                        means for that purpose, whose duty it will be to patrol the streets during
                        the night, at all hours, and see that everything is right. The sum to be
                        contributed, would be small per week to each business man, and might be the
                        means of saving them hundreds of dollars. We wait patiently to hear what
                        steps may be taken in the premises.</p>

                <summary>After a series of robberies in the Staunton business district, amounting to
                    the loss of several hundred dollars in property, the author proposes that local
                    businessmen contribute to a fund set aside to pay a night security officer. The
                    "one or more" security agents would enhance to small number of Staunton
                    policemen and work to prevent future crime in the area.</summary>

                <summary>Emma C. Booz, wife of J. W. Booz and daughter of C. D. McGhee of Bedford
                    County, died in Staunton on October 19th. She was 24 years old. "Thus early in
                    life was this young wife and mother called from earth to Heaven. Cut down like a
                    flower that had scarcely bloomed; taken from loved ones who so much needed her
                    care; deeply mysterious indeed, seems this dark dispensation of Providence to
                    surviving relatives and friends. 'Thou knowest not now, but shall know
                    hereafter,' speaks the Saviour to all earth's mourners; and though we cannot see
                    why God's hand should be so heavily laid on us, as in taking away a mother from
                    her two helpless babes; a wife from a fond husband; yet in the light of
                    Eternity, in the better land, it will be made plain. The deceased was a member
                    of the Presbyterian Church, and those who knew her best, testify to her pious
                    life, her gentle, amiable disposition; and though it was not permitted her to
                    recognize the loved faces around her bed-side, yet they can have the comfortable
                    assurance, all is well with her; she now rests in the heavenly home."</summary>
