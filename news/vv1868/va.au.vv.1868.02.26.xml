                    <p>The news from Washington indicates a storm brewing. The question is to be
                        decided very soon, perhaps, as to whether or not the Executive branch of the
                        Government, is to be abolished by Radical rule under a higher <emph
                            rend="italic">law,</emph> or that system of legislation outside of the
                        constitution, by which Radical rule in direct enmity to President Johnson,
                        is to triumph. Stirring events are crowding upon us, the result of a total
                        abandonment of constitutional restraint, by the party of power, and which
                        now holds undoubted sway at Washington, over the liberties of 30 odd
                        millions of the people who constitute the nation. We, in the former slave
                        States, have no rights only those awarded to an oppressed people, by a
                        strict military government. The screws begin to tighten and the shoe pinch,
                        the Northern people will ere decide the issue, as to what rights they are to
                        enjoy. Might is <emph rend="italic">right</emph> with the Radical Congress,
                        and the people of the <emph rend="italic">North</emph> must soon learn what
                        are their rights. The people of that section elected President Johnson, and
                        the question must be decided, is he an officer of the government, and if so,
                        is his arms to be paralyzed and the Executive office declared a nullity. The
                        people of the North, we again repeat, must decide the question. We of the
                        South should be quiet. It is a matter we can now have no hand in settling -
                        could not now if we would. Let us stand to our own affairs at home when we
                        can. We have much to do for our families and the poor, many of whom have
                        been made so by the late war. Spring is just here, our farmers must plant,
                        sow and reap, get out a big corn crop and do all they can to feed, clothe
                        and school their children, and aid in developing in every way possible, the
                        material interest of their favored country, with its exuberant soil and
                        other rare advantages, with which we are blessed as a people. A word to the
                        wise is sufficient. Our duty is plain - keep quiet and cool. The issue is a
                        plain one for the North to decide. It is a constitutional Union party on the
                        one hand, <emph rend="italic">vs</emph> Radical rule, a military despotism
                        and anarchy on the other.</p>

                <summary>This article questions the legitimacy of the Radical party in Congress. The
                    author suggests that Radicals hold unconstitutional sway over the executive, and
                    calls for the people of the North to act against those who "paralyze" the
                    executive branch. The South, on the other hand, stripped of its power, must
                    "keep quiet and cool" while the North decides the pressing questions of power
                    and legitimacy. Meanwhile, southerners must concentrate on providing for the
                    poor and doing all they can for the benefit of their children and state
                    development.</summary>

                    <p>February 22d, 1868</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Dear Virginian:</emph> - I am very much gratified to see
                        the alacrity with which the Conservative men of the State are moving in the
                        matter of organization, since our great State Convention. Everyone seems to
                        feel and to realize the fact that the destiny of the State and of republican
                        government is the question at issue. Whether we shall have a government for
                        the benefit and the securement of justice and right, both to the white man
                        and the negro, and whether that government shall be controlled by the
                        intelligence and virtue of the white race, or whether it shall be controlled
                        by the ignorance and viciousness of the negro race and the few <emph
                            rend="italic">white</emph> niggers and scalawags who are leading the
                        blacks, are the great questions involved.</p>
                    <p>The importance of a thorough organization, is only second to the preservation
                        of life itself and to our children. Let everyone then, who knows the
                        enjoyments and comforts of Liberty, and the benefit derived from an
                        impartial distribution of justice, arouse himself to action and earnestly
                        and zealously undertake the task before him. There are many who have been
                        led astray that can be brought back. I am happy to say that in this place,
                        the Head Centre and Grand Mogul of the unsophisticated Heroes of Africa, the
                        magnificent keeper of the mixed Menagerie, has become tired of his weekly
                        exhibitions, or being frightened at his shadow, or evil deeds, or through
                        shame, he has ceased to hold them, in consequence of which the Rads are
                        getting fewer and fewer, and it is to be hoped that they will continue to
                        decrease until the sight of one will be the cause of wonder and amusement.</p>
                    <p>Our little village seems to be looking "upward and onward" in every respect.
                        There are now four store houses in this place - one nearly completed and one
                        just commenced, which will increase the number to six. Lots are in great
                        demand - one quarter acre lot will sell at 8400, (city prices). As the Balt.
                        &amp; Ohio R.R. Company have tendered their assistance to the completion
                        of the M.G.R.R. to Harrisonburg, we will expect to hear the whistle of the
                        iron horse ere many months roll by. I have but little news to give you, as
                        we have no Convention nor Congress to disturb the quite of our "progressive
                        little town." - The weather is fine. The mule is "in status quo." With my
                        best wishes,</p>

                    ruling party. He asks whether it will be ruled by the intelligence and virtue of
                    the white race or by "niggers and scalawags." He calls for all lovers of liberty
                    to "arouse themselves to action" and thwart the evil design of the "Rads."</summary>
