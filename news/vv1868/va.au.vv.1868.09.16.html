<b>Shall we have Presidential Electors?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article concurs with the sentiment of a Mississippi publication
                    stating that a vote in accordance with constitutional rights will reveal a
                    Democratic majority throughout Virginia. The author notes that white southern
                    men have lost the power to exercise this right and calls on Democratic
                    "brothers" in the North to rectify this problem.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This is a question that should be deliberately considered by the Democratic
                        Central Committee of Virginia. We have urged it to act and called upon the
                        people of the States to act out. The time for being politic, or whatever you
                        chose to call it, has passed.--Action is the word now, and the voice of old
                        Virginia should be heard. Hear what a brave Mississippi paper says to the
                        people of that gallant State. It applies with equal force to Virginia.</p>
                    <p>"We should have electors in the field even now. The State is democratic and
                        the Northern Democracy should know it is a certainty. After the election her
                        votes should be counted; and when it is ascertained that the State is
                        largely democratic--which she undoubtedly will be--her vote should be handed
                        in to the electoral college with the following address to the Democracy:
                        'Gentlemen, we have voted in accordance with our constitutional right. True
                        to our country and our principles, we have given a large Democratic
                        majority. In so doing we exercised a legal right--but, so far as we are
                        concerned, we have not the power to enforce this right.--You brother
                        Democrats of the North, have the power to see us righted--to have our vote
                        counted.</p>
                    <p>Can anyone doubt the result of such an application? We, for one, do not; and
                        are in favor of trying it, not only as a chance for the restoration of our
                        constitutional rights, but to test the sincerity and 'pluck' of our Northern
                        friends, many of whom have at the masthead of their leading newspapers "A
                        free vote or a free fight."</p>

<b>The Destiny of the Negro</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is in essence an admonition directed to the black people of
                    the South. The author suggests that regardless of the upcoming election results,
                    blacks' fate will ultimately be in the hands of the white people of the state in
                    which they reside. Their power will wane once competing political factions
                    hammer out all conflicts. Thus, how blacks wield their current power will be a
                    deciding factor in blacks' future positions.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> We extract the following from an able article in the Petersburg Index upon this subject, and suggest to employers
                        the duty of reading and explaining it to the Colored people. There is no
                        dodging this serious question, and though disagreeable, we must meet it and
                        do our duty to this unfortunate race.</p>
                    <p> The Index well says: </p>
                    <p>"And now is the time, in this contest between the party of GRANT and that of
                        SEYMOUR, for the negro to determine what the attitude toward him of the
                        Democratic party shall be--whether the white people of the South are to
                        regard him as a citizen or a radical tool--a free voter, or a pack-mule
                        bearing the burdens of a domineering faction wherever bidden. And this the
                        whites should make the blacks understand.</p>
                    <p>The negroes' destiny will not be decided by the success of SEYMOUR or GRANT.
                        His status will be not secured by a republican triumph. No matter which
                        party wins the present field--a very few years of shifting issues and
                        conflicts between the interests of the whites in different sections of the
                        country, will leave the negro high and dry off the sea of national politics,
                        and his fate will remain in the hands of the people of his State. And the
                        impression which his use of power may make upon the minds of that people
                        now, is the real key to the future fate of the negro in the South."</p>

<b>The Augusta Academy of Medicine</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The old Medical Association has transformed itself into the Augusta Academy
                    of Medicine. The new organization, patterned on the American Medical
                    Association, will work to elevate "the standard of medical education," and
                    conserve "the public health." Different committees will work on key questions
                    confronting the medical community, ensuring a "wide field of inquiry."<br>
