                    Conservative Convention meeting in Richmond. "We cannot have it all our own way,

                    of a white man's ticket."</summary>

                <summary>The editors of the Valley Virginian announce a desire to include more local
                    and domestic news in an attempt to separate it from its competitors. "There are
                    three journals published in Staunton, all of them aiming at the same object.
                    Politically, their features are the same."</summary>

                    <p> The Norfolk <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> puts down the white majority
                        of Virginia at 53,000, that is, if all will enroll themselves that can
                        register, and, if after doing so, push to the polls. It says: "Our fossil
                        friends can't deny that they are to be justly charged with preventing
                        thousands of people from enrolling themselves, on account of their lack of
                        action and lukewarmness." </p>
                    <p>If every white man who is entitled to a vote would think of the shame and
                        disgrace he will entail upon his children by neglecting to bestir himself
                        and bring up new recruits to prevent the adoption of the Underwood
                        Constitution, we would be able, at least, to so modify that black scroll as
                        to make it bearable.</p>
                    <p> If the whites, with a majority of 53,000 will allow the negroes to tide over
                        them, we exclaim with the <emph rend="italic">Journal,</emph> they deserve
                        their fate.</p>

                <summary>This article explains that the white majority of Virginia voters can
                    prevent negro rule by simply acting. The author suggests that all those who do
                    nothing are a disgrace and will have to face the consequences of the Underwood
                    Constitution, should it pass because of lack of action.</summary>

                    Government. The women employed in the Treasury Department and other branches of
                    government in particular are, in the opinion of the paper, "loose characters"
                    many of whom are "paramours and mistresses of members of Congress."</summary>
