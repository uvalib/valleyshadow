                    <p> The <emph rend="italic">Irish Citizen</emph> asks--"We wonder whether any of
                        our readers will live to be old enough to see this country once more
                        governed by law and not by general orders?" </p>
                    <p> None--until shoulder-straps cease to be the insignia of power, and bayonets
                        are no longer used to put party-tools into office. A government may be
                        called free and republican as long as the voice of the majority rules and
                        opinion is left untrammeled, but when military upstarts--men who have not
                        even been know to have signalized themselves as soldiers, and who are as
                        ignorant of law as they are of the school of the soldier, are placed in
                        positions where statesmanship is required--and act the tyrant over better
                        men than themselves, then that government becomes a military oligarchy, and
                        the people, who ought to constitute the ruling power become the very
                        instruments of their own ruin. There are men now ruling the Southern States
                        who never would have been read of in the history of the irrepressible
                        struggle, had they not been placed by a higher power in a position where
                        they could domineer over a people who have yielded and yielded until they
                        are on the very verge of the pit of degradation. These armed tools of a
                        tyrannical Congress take a delight in carrying out to the letter its unholy
                        behests. A petty General whose great virtue consisted in his managing to
                        keep out of the way of the enemy's lead and steel, is armed with a little
                        brief authority and, not having had the pluck to win laurels in the field,
                        he seizes the lucky chance of becoming notorious by establishing a
                        Dictatorship over an unarmed and down-trodden people. His sword was never
                        crossed with that of a brave enemy--but it can make a great chatter in its
                        scabbard as it rattles over the pavement in times of <emph rend="italic"
                            >peace.</emph> They are the captain Bobadils of the present day; their
                            <emph rend="italic">brutum fulmen</emph> strikes the untutored black
                        with awe, while the proud, though beaten owner of the soil looks on with
                        disgust. They dictate to courts as if the law hung upon their lips--they
                        pronounce judgment as if they were born judges, they decide whether
                        Legislatures shall convene or not--they take charge of men's consciences,
                        and bond them down with an iron clad oath to think and act: In short, they
                        are the petty despots who act under the orders of mightier despots, feeling
                        perfectly secure, for there is a wall of bristling bayonets around them, and
                        their shoulder straps make them potent. Military rule is bad enough at all
                        times and every where, but when a noble, honorable and peaceable people are
                        compelled to succumb to such petty tyranny as this, there may be many of the
                        present generation who "will see this country governed by law, and not by
                        general orders." </p>

                <summary>In this article, the author illustrates the despotism of military rule. He
                    asks whether or not anyone will live to see the day when power is returned to
                    the people and "shoulder-strap rule" is no more. Not surprisingly, the author
                    critiques the virtues of those soldiers who now govern the region. Suggestions
                    of cowardice, or at least shirking duty, form the theme throughout the article.</summary>

                    <p>On Friday night last, Richard Stephenson, a colored individual of heavy
                        weight and muscular power, entered the store of Louis Rosenbaum on New
                        Street, and called for five cents worth of chewing tobacco, at the same time
                        putting down three cents for payment in full. Young Eugene Rosenbaum, who
                        was the only proprietor of the store at the time, demurred at the scanty
                        equivalent--words ensued, Stevenson called the young man hard names.--The
                        latter armed himself with an iron weight and ordered the negro out, who
                        obeyed, but stood on the pavement calling Rosenbaum all kinds of names and
                        throwing a bottle of molasses at his head. R's blood rose above fever heat,
                        and, he hurled the weight with all his might at the fellow's head, laying
                        him out almost "a lovely corpius." --Fortunately the missile did not reach a
                        vital part--he was cared for, and on Monday sued out a warrant on Rosenbaum
                        for an assault, with intent to kill. On Tuesday the case was brought up
                        before the Mayor; and to Richard's surprise, he was fined $3, and not being
                        able to pay it, he was handed over to the tender care of mine host, Geo.
                        Harlan, where he rests at the present writing. Young Rosenbaum paid the
                        costs.</p>

                    chewing tobacco. After a heated verbal exchange, Stephenson was injured in a
                    physical altercation. Charges were brought up on Rosenbaum for assault, but
                    Stephenson was fined $3.00 and subsequently jailed when unable to pay.</summary>
