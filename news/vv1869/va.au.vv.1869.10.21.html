<b>A Matter that Affects All Our Citizens</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article points to the middleman as the main contributing factor in
                    increasing prices for consumer products. Lacking a market house, producers of
                    agricultural products such as butter and eggs must first bring their products to
                    a middleman, who in turn sells to the consumer. This not only raises prices to
                    cover middleman profits, but also destroys the competitive process that the
                    author claims benefits both the buyer and seller. Since the town is growing at
                    such a rapid rate, future prosperity demands that this obstacle be removed.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If our common Council were to lay a tax of twenty-five percent on all the
                        fresh meats, vegetables, butter and poultry consumed by our people, the
                        whole community would be in an uproar. It would be regarded as intolerable
                        oppression, and every body would rise up, as one man, to relieve themselves
                        of such an onerous burthen.</p>
                    <p>Yet this very thing has been done--but done indirectly--and therefore the
                        people do not see it, though they may feel it. This is the difference
                        between direct and indirect taxation. People understand the one, but they do
                        not readily see the other.</p>
                    <p>The enquiry now comes how is this affected? We answer, by not having a market
                        house in our flourishing town. If we had a marketing house, the consumers
                        would be brought into direct communication with the producers. There would
                        be no middle men, with their profits, between them. The buyer would get his
                        supplies from first hands, and the seller would get a fair price for his
                        commodities.</p>
                    <p>But as matters now stand, all the produce of the country is brought to the
                        grocers, who buy it, and sell it to the consumer. In this way, every working
                        man in the town, pays from five to ten cents higher for every pound of
                        butter, and every dozen of eggs--and in the same proportion for other
                        country produce--that he uses, in his family. This amounts to a very large
                        tax on the mechanic and laboring man--much larger than all his other taxes
                        put together.</p>
                    <p>Is this right? Is it just to our hard working fellow citizens? It is for them
                        to say. We venture to affirm, that there is not another town of the same
                        size, in the State, which is without a market house.</p>
                    <p> The effect on the farmer and gardner is equally injurious. Now,
                        when they wish to sell their products, they must go to the grocers. The
                        competition is limited, because the buyers are few. If, on the other hand,
                        there were an open market, they would be brought face to face with the whole
                        body of consumers, and could thus have the benefit of the larger
                        competition. By getting rid of the middle men, buyers could buy cheaper, and
                        sellers could sell for far better prices, for all parties would get rid of
                        the profits of the grocer. Assuming the grocer's profit in a pound of
                        butter, or a dozen eggs, to be only 5 cents, (it is often double that
                        amount) the buyer could afford to pay to the producer two cent per pound or
                        dozen, more than he now gets from the grocer, and yet save three cents on
                        each pound or dozen. We invite the attention of our laboring men to this
                        view of the subject. Are they so enamored of taxation, that they are willing
                        to submit to this state of things? </p>
                    <p>We also respectfully invoke the interposition of our Common Council. The town
                        is growing. The only obstacle to its continued growth and prosperity is the
                        cost of living. Let us all see if that evil cannot at least be
                    diminished.</p>
