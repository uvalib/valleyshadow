<b>The New Movement</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article illustrates the fact, especially since the
                    result of the recent presidential election that African American suffrage is set
                    in stone. It is an undeniable facet of life since society organized on the
                    premise of inequality was virtually swept away at Appomattox as part of the
                    "terms of capitulation." Understanding this, the author suggests that these
                    matters be endured, that people not act on their impulses; for if they do, the
                    South may very well have to face "carpetbagger" oppression. Using the words of
                    Henry Clay, the author recommends that Virginians "make the best practical use
                    of the facts as they exist."<br>(Names in announcement:  Alexander H. H. Stuart,  John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The surrender at Appomattox Court House settled forever the question of
                        slavery in the United States. Everything since done, to consummate the
                        freedom of the negro, has been a logical and inevitable sequence from that
                        great fact; all the incapacities of the race, as equals of the whites before
                        the law, were signed away--were in effect swept out of existence, by the pen
                        in which Robert E. Lee subscribed his name to the terms of capitulation.
                        Virginia became gradually reconciled to the freedom of the negro and his
                        admission to the right of trial by jury and his perfect equality with the
                        white man as a witness in our courts; and she sanctioned these privileges
                        and rights by solemn acts of legislation. The problem of negro emancipation
                        was, however, not yet deemed complete; the right to vote and hold office, in
                        the former slave States, was considered by the friends of the negro
                        essential to his protection and safety. Upon the validity of the
                        reconstruction acts of Congress and the question whether the negro should
                        enjoy the right of suffrage, as secured to him by these acts, the last
                        presidential election in effect turned. The question was decided against the
                        views of the white men of the South and of the Democratic party; and that
                        decision, in our opinion, is irreversible and final. There is, at this time,
                        outside of the old slave States, not a corporal's guard of any party in
                        favor of trying that issue again. Congress is fixed in its determination; it
                        has the power to compel the execution of its own purpose. Gen Grant who for
                        four years from the 4th of March next, will wield the Executive power of the
                        nation, is committed to negro suffrage, as the settled policy of the
                        country, at least, as far as the South is concerned. Indeed all of the
                        Southern States except Virginia, Mississippi and Texas have already adopted
                        Constitutions based upon universal suffrage; so that, the people of the
                        three States, alone, remain to wage a hopeless contest against the fiat of the country announced in the election of
                        Gen. Grant. That the contest is in fact hopeless--that negro suffrage is
                        fixed upon us, that no reluctance or struggle of ours, can avert or get rid
                        of it, the most vehement opponents of the "new movement" do not pretend to
                        deny. They admit it as a stubborn fact under military rule; they concede
                        that Congress will see that it becomes a constitutional fact, before they
                        will release us from their grasp.</p>
                    <p> In furtherance of this idea, the Constitutional Convention which sat in
                        Richmond adopted the "Underwood" constitution for Virginia. That
                        constitution as not yet been voted on. A bill passed one house of Congress,
                        to submit it to the vote of those entitled to suffrage under the 14th
                        amendment, in May next: --the Republican committee, in Richmond, had shown
                        their opposition to the postponement of the vote; and were insisting that
                        the monstrous thing should be put to the question before the people at once;
                        serious fears were apprehended that this would be done; and then it could be
                        prevented only by prompt and prudent action. The Republican committee
                        boastfully urged that the game was in their own hands; that the constitution
                        could and should be carried--and who can deny the
                        great danger there was that such would have been the result? Consider the
                        facts for a moment:--The registration gave the whites a majority if only
                        13,000. A new registration might increase that majority to 25,000--then if
                        12,501 white persons should vote for the constitution (all the other votes
                        being cast) it would be carried. The negro vote would be cast almost as a
                        unit and to a man for the constitution; the office seekers would go for it
                        in a body--and we have painful evidence that their number is legion; the
                        whites, discouraged, worried and in despair, in view of the hopelessness of
                        the struggle, would, in many cases, make the best of their bad condition,
                        and vote for it, or stay at home; and, then, the straight-out and active
                        republican white voters in the State, constitute no mean force. In addition
                        to all these facts, the registers and conductors of elections, everywhere,
                        are republicans of the iron-clad order; and bitter experience, in other
                        communities proves how easily the secret ballot can be manipulated for a
                        party purpose, if the motive be sufficiently strong; and to hold Virginia by
                        the throat, and to enforce the bestowal upon themselves of the spoils of her
                        office, in all time to come, were surely motive enough to overcome the
                        scruples of the carpet baggers and adventurous patriots whose fate might
                        depend on forcing the count, in order to carry
                        the constitution. The honest, inauspicious, people of Virginia know little
                        of the unscrupulous hardihood, and reckless daring of the men engaged in
                        engineering the "Underwood" Constitution into the organic law of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Such being the fixed facts as to negro suffrage, and the fearful
                        possibilities as to the adoption of the "Underwood" Constitution, some of
                        the citizens of Virginia justly entitled to the confidence of her
                        conservative people, invited by a portion of the foremost men our own
                        country, met in Richmond during last month, and after due conference
                        appointed a committee to go to Washington to endeavor, if possible, to save
                        Virginia from the doom of Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas and other
                        States of the South--from the doom of perpetual vassalage to the
                        carpetbaggers and misguided negroes. The theory of their action is simply
                        this--our opponents being judges, negro suffrage is a conceded postulate in
                        working out the problem of the future government of Virginia; and whilst it
                        is against all our prejudices and our opinions of just policy, we accept it,
                        in connection with universal amnesty, as the corner stone of reconstruction
                        in our State; give us these, and strike out the hideous features of the
                        "Underwood" constitution, incident to its crushing disfranchisements and
                        others oppressive to our people, and we will advise them to accept it, as a
                        measure of peaceful adjustment and compromise; and leave the white man of
                        the old commonwealth, untrammeled and unfettered to carry on its government
                        and readjust its affairs, as they assuredly will. Doubtless, there will be
                        left, in the constitution, something objectionable to many of us; but once
                        restore confidence in the stability of government in Virginia, let the tide
                        of immigration turn towards her borders, her waste lands be taken up, her
                        mines be opened--her factories, forges, furnaces and workshops be filled
                        with busy artisans, her channels of trade and travel be completed; and
                        wealth and prosperity begin to abound, and who, with free suffrage for all,
                        and eligibility to office for all,--who, we ask, will be strong enough to
                        stand in the way of a quiet and peaceful remedy for any evils which may
                        remain in the constitution as it will be adopted?</p>
                    <p> Naturally the "new movement" is bitter to the taste of the buccaneers whose
                        coat of arms is, "the carpet-bag," and whose mouths are watering for the
                        rich repast of Virginia offices. Anything calculated to restore a cordial
                        understanding between the colored people and the Southern white men "to the
                        manor born," and to excite the two races to work together in harmony and
                        good will, is wormwood and gall to the gentry who have come from afar to
                        govern both. We are sorry to say that some of our conservative friends seem
                        for the time unfriendly to the movement, and with pardonable warmth and
                        honest impulse say, it is giving up a principle
                        to concede negro suffrage; far better, they urge to let ruin come, let
                        oppressions abound, let misgovernment wreck the Old Dominion, let Moss
                        troopers like the Clayton Militia of Arkansas, or the Brownlow soldiers of
                        Tennessee ride over the country, burn, lay waste, rob, harry and destroy;
                        far better to let the morals of public virtue of our people be invidiously
                        undermined by the ever-recurring temptation to conciliate the wretches who
                        would wield power for the sake of plunder, and to surrender honor and
                        convenience for offices and a share of the spoils--far better all these
                        terrible evils than what? we ask--than to give up
                        the principle of negro suffrage? Not a word of it; but, in short, as we
                        understand the matter--far better to endure all these untold agonies, than
                        to acknowledge as a fact that which all concede is now, and for the future
                        will continue to be, one of the fixed, unalterable principles of the
                        government? We respectfully suggest that it is never wise to act upon the
                        impulse of unreasoning prejudice, but we should remember and be guided by
                        the axiom of Henry Clay that "true Statesmanship consists in making the best
                        practical use of facts as they exist." At any rate it is due to Alexander
                        H.H. Stuart and John B. Baldwin, the trusted sons of Augusta, to wait until
                        they are heard from, to pause, in order to see what they have done, what
                        they shall propose for our action, before pronouncing judgment upon their
                        wisdom or their prudence. They and their associates have certainly arrested
                        the attention of the entire country. They have already now won for
                        themselves the respectful consideration of the nation; they have not been
                            snubbed as it was said they would be; but in
                        all quarters, they have been greeted as the heralds of pacification, and as
                        animated by the noble purpose of building up the very best practicable
                        government for Virginia upon the basis "of the facts as they exist." If they
                        succeed, the country will applaud and honor them; if they fail, Virginia
                        will thank them for their effort to make herself understood in Congress, and
                        to save her from ruin, and, then woe to the "Underwood" Constitution, as it
                        shall be swept before the power of an outraged people, and be utterly
                        defeated--and then after that
                            nous verrons!</p>

<b>A Remonstrance from Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The President of the Senate presented Saturday a remonstrance from Charles
                        King, D.D., a resident of Staunton, Va. against the removing of the
                        disabilities of rebel officers. He says: "The rumor of it creates a panic
                        among Union men. If you relieve these rebel judges we are politically
                        ruined. For God's sake interpose and prevent this. It is false to say that
                        we have not Union men to fill the principle offices, and if not, let them
                        remain vacant until they can be filled with good men from the loyal States.
                        Save me from the tender mercies of wicked, persecuting rebels. The
                        restrictive measures in the reconstruction acts and the fourteenth
                        amendment, and in our proposed constitution, are our only hope. If you can
                        hold the rebels in check until we can adopt the new constitution then, perhaps, as they bring forth fruits meet for
                        repentance, they may gradually and individually be relieved from the curse
                        of a broken and violated law, but for the present we are unwilling to make a
                        curse for them."</p>
                    <p> [There is no such man in Staunton unless he be some negro or carpet
                            bagger.]--Richmond Dispatch.</p>
                    <p> The Dispatch is right, this fellow who signs
                        himself Chas. King D.D, and who undertakes to advise Congress, is a
                        carpetbagger of the meanest kind; one who travels in the garb of religion.
                        He is the chap we had occasion to overhaul some months ago, for interfering
                        with the good Methodist of the County and who became truly indignant at us
                        for dubbing him a member of Gen. Schofield's Conference, because he tried to
                        get the military to back him up, but did not. He is a slab-sided seven
                        footer, with the countenance of a cannibal, a red-headed carpet-bagger, and
                        has a foot that reminds us of the following anecdote: An overgrown gawky
                        countryman stopped at a city hotel, on retiring asked the servant for a
                        boot-jack. One was handed him, but proved too small, then another with the
                        same fault. Bigfoot becoming enraged, exclaimed, "Sir, get me a boot-jack,
                        will you?" Waiter in disgust, replied, "mister, you had better go back to
                        the forks of the road and stick your heel in there." This must have been
                        King, the would-be pastor of all the churches in the Valley and the advisor
                        of Congress, &amp;c. Thank the Lord! He is not a resident of Staunton,
                        nor a D.D., unless, D.D. stands for Dirty Dog.</p>

<b>The Railroad will be built by Baltimore and Ohio Road</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper attacks the "fatal delusion" that investors in Baltimore will
                    build the Valley Railroad, even if Augusta fails to subscribe to its stock. The
                    editors hold that unless Valley communities assist with the cost, the price tag
                    will be too high for Baltimore or any railroad company to foot the bill.<br>

<b>How to Pay the Tax</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article bolsters other arguments in favor of building the Valley
                    Railroad by illustrating the benefits of competition. Two routes to market, says
                    the author, will inevitably work to save the farmers a great deal of money.
                    Competition will naturally drive shipping costs down and the savings will be
                    passed on to the producers, thereby providing surplus income to be used to pay
                    the taxes necessary to finance the road. Further, even if prices of the
                    mentioned commodity (flour) fluctuate, savings can be made up from numerous
                    other products shipped on the same lines.<br>

                    <p> The county tax proposed to secure the immediate building of the Valley
                        Railroad through Augusta, will be $18,000 annually until the road is
                        completed--which it is supposed will be in two years from the date of the
                        County Subscription. Before the first $18,000 is called
                            for the work is to be let to contract throughout the length of
                        the county at a cost, by the Engineer's estimate, of $1,472,362. This money
                        will be spent throughout the county; it will add to our
                            circulation an immense sum of money, where we are now suffering from
                            scarcity. IT WILL BE WORTH THE TAX TO THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTY
                        TO HAVE SO MUCH CAPITAL PUT IN CIRCULATION. Again: The Orange Company has
                        already offered to take this Valley road as fast as
                            completed, section by section, and work it, paying for it at such
                        rates as will relieve the pressure of the county tax, and make the stock at
                        once available. There is no reason why the stock of this road held by the
                        county, will not be as marketable as that of the B. &amp; O.
                        Company--perhaps like it commanding a high premium long before the county
                        bonds are payable.</p>
                    <p> And again: as fast as the Valley road approaches Staunton, a competition
                        will grow up with the Central Road, and we may expect the necessary result,
                        a reduction in the rates of toll on the Central to at least what is now
                        charged on the Baltimore and Ohio Road; which would make the cost to the
                        farmer of getting his barrel of flour to Richmond only 20cts (the through
                        rates on the B.&amp; O.) or at most 30cts, against the 60cts now charged
                        from Staunton. It is stated in the papers that last year this county raised
                        100,000 bbls. of flour for market. If so, the saving on
                            flour alone, would be $10,000, or at least $30,000, to offset
                        against the tax of $18,000, leaving in the pockets of the farmers, after
                        paying the tax, from $12,000 to $22,000 clear gain. But if the estimate of
                        the flour crop be high, the excess will be more than made up in a hundred
                        other articles of produce not taken into this estimate.</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt with any one who will study the matter, that the county
                        will pay its tax over and over every year, by the saving on the cost of
                        getting to market which will result from the competition of having two
                        routes to market, instead of being at the mercy of one monopoly.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> DEAR VIRGINIAN--We have been much surprised here to see the opposition
                        manifested in some quarters of your great county against the Valley
                        Railroad. We looked to the wealthy, enterprising, energetic and intelligent
                        county of Augusta to lead in the great improvement which is to traverse the
                        whole length, and we cannot account for her hesitancy in ranging herself
                        beside her sister counties. Especially were we astounded at a communication
                        in the last issue of the Spectator, the spirit of
                        which seems on a par with its logic. Let us
                        examine the arguments by which this writer has been influenced to oppose the
                        Road. "This is no time to incur new obligations." Pray when will the county
                        of Augusta be better able? Now is the time for
                        all the people to put forth strenuous effort to make up the losses of the
                        war. Have not the people of Augusta and Valley been acting on this principle
                        ever since the war closed? And are they not to-day in nearly as flourishing
                        a condition as they were before the war? Did not many individuals have to
                        borrow the means with which they have fenced in a field of their farms and
                        once more re-established themselves in business? Suppose each man returning
                        from the army and finding himself in debt, and without stock or facilities
                        for tilling his farm, had concluded, as this writer, that it would be better
                        to pay off old debts, could we have realized the rapid return to prosperity
                        which we see? No, the question in not as to whether our people should incur
                        new obligations, but whether the incurring of those obligations will lead to
                        a profitable increase of our wealth and prosperity.</p>
                    <p> But if this writer is wrong on this score he is no less so in regard to the
                             earning example he holds up to the people of
                        Augusta. Rockingham has sunk, he says, the $150,000 she subscribed to the
                        Manassas Gap. That is, this Manassas Gap Railroad was utterly destroyed by
                        the war; its bridges burnt and track torn up by the contending armies, and
                        all attempts at reconstruction of it rendered impossible for four years; and
                            by this means Rockingham lost her $150,000.
                        Therefore, reasons he, Augusta should not run any such risk. This is just as
                        reasonable as it would be to advise Smith against building a house, because
                        Jone's house was once burnt down. Should we be deterred from building a road
                        because, forsooth, it may be destroyed by war? You know but for this cause
                        Rockingham would have held to day her stock. But even with this loss, is
                        Rockingham the loser? Do you suppose to-day that if you were to propose to
                        her to pay up all she has put in that Railroad and take it away from her she
                        would consent? You know she would entertain the proposition. In other words,
                        she considers the $150,000 well sunk in getting
                        the road. Now there is no probability that any such thing will happen as the
                        destruction of the Valley Railroad, and, consequently, the county of Augusta
                        has nothing to fear. She has only to lend her credit and submit to a small
                        tax for a few years to secure a great work which will add millions to her
                        wealth.</p>
                    <p> Why say the road will be sold under mortgage? Is this the history of
                        railroads in our State? And will it occur in the case of a road passing
                        through the very richest portion of the State.
                        This is a mere bugbear.</p>
                    <p> The next argument is, to say the least, not generous. Mr. Garrett must build the road, we can afford to wait no
                        longer then he can, therefore let us wait. This is the substance of it.
                        Virginians are not wont to speculate upon the necessities of others, and it
                        must be confessed that it would seem more manly to bear out our portion of
                        the burden when it is acknowledged that we will have the benefit. But the
                        whole assumption is gratuitous, --Mr. Garrett is reduced to no such strait.
                        He has not one tenth of the interest in the Valley Railroad that any one of
                        the counties on its line has. And when he shall wish to connect with the
                        Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad it will not be at Staunton, or through the
                        heart of Augusta that he will want to make the connection. No, there is no
                        more groundless notion prevalent (we speak knowingly) about this Railroad
                        than that the B. &amp; O. Co., will make it anyhow. On the contrary, let
                        Augusta act in a manner worthy of her past history and her present
                        prosperity; let her seize the opportunity while it exists, let her strike
                        boldly for fortune and greatness and she will obtain it.</p>
                    <p> Pardon me if I seem in deep earnest about this matter. We feel that it is
                            the great question before our people, that it
                        concerns our prosperity even more than any changes it is our power to effect
                        in Radical policy or carpetbag constitutions. The people of Rockbridge look
                        anxiously to the vote in Augusta. No question since the war has elicited so
                        much interest among them. This is manifested by their subscription which is
                        about as much in proportion as $900,000 from Augusta would be. They wish to
                        be connected with Augusta by railroad as they are in so many other things.
                        But it will depend upon your people. We must and
                        will have a railroad. If not Staunton then to Salem or Lynchburg. Our
                        trade will go to the people who will aid us. And our votes, too, will be
                        given to men representing our interests. We cannot afford to have public
                        servants who are backward towards our vital interests.</p>

                    <p>Staunton is the victim of too much brains; in fact, it labors under a

                        big enough, strong enough and energetic enough to set our apathetic county a

                        settle within her borders, by inviting attention to the great county of

                        possessing an area larger than ancient Attica, and occupying the center of
                        the Great Valley of Virginia, filling up its widest portion, and embracing
                        the hundreds of perennial streams and fertile intervals that form the upper

                        with her sister counties.</p>
                    <p> In area, Augusta is the first county in Virginia. In the number of acres
                        under cultivation, Augusta stood fifth, following Halifax, Fauquier,
                        Pittsylvania, and Albemarle, in the order in which they are given, but in
                            cash value of its farms, it stood first among
                        the one hundred and forty-eight counties then in the State, footing up to
                        $10,977,286, while Pittsylvania summed up but $5,760,940, and Halifax
                        $6,924,479.</p>
                    <p>If we add up the three great cereals, wheat, corn and rye, the production of
                        Augusta in 1860 was 1,117,411 bushels, only surpassed by Loudoun, which had
                        1,356,708 bushels. The wheat crop of Augusta county was more than that of
                        any New England State, except, Vermont, and was one-forty-third the crop of
                        Virginia; its corn crop was more than that of California, and was
                        fifty-forth of the crop of Virginia; its rye crop was one-nineteenth, and
                        its butter one thirty-third of the production of the State, and it had
                        one-thirty-sixth of the horses.</p>

                        grass-seed, hops, flax-seed, maple sugar, and molasses, beeswax, honey, home
                        manufactures, value of slaughtered animals, &amp;c., &amp;c., of
                        Augusta, still in all those she occupied a foremost position, and will not
                        suffer in comparison with any other, and we think we may safely conclude,
                        from this statistical review of her agriculture and its results, that her
                        position was in the front rank of the one hundred counties now left to
                        Virginia, and if in 1860 Augusta had surplus products enough for 100,000
                        people, we are sure she could advantageously add that many to her present
                        population, and that nowhere would the condition of the emigrant be more
                        desirable in every particular.</p>

<b>The Coming Girl</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the author's predictions, the "coming girl" will shun the
                    frivolities of the past and combine feminine grace with a practical
                    "usefulness." The woman of the future will vote, among other things, as well as
                    take charge of duties formerly left to servants. Suffice to say, the author
                    predicts the coming girl will possess many more virtues than before.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>She will vote, will be of some use in the world, will cook her own food, will
                        earn her living, and will not die an old maid. The coming girl will not wear
                        the Grecian bend, dance the Norman, ignore all possibilities of knowing how
                        to work, will not endeavor to break the hearts of unsophisticated young men,
                        will spell correctly, understand English before she affects French, will
                        preside with equal grace at the piano and the washboard, will spin more yarn
                        for the house than for the street, will not despise her plain old mother,
                        her poor relations, or the hand of an honest worker, will wear a bonnet,
                        speak good, plain, unlisping English, will darn her own stockings, will know
                        how to make doughnuts, and will not read the New York Ledger oftener than
                        she does her Bible.</p>
                    <p>The coming girl will walk five miles a day, if need be, to keep her cheeks in
                        glow, will mind her health; her physical development and her mother, will
                        adopt a costume both sensible and conducive to comfort and health; will not
                        confound hypocrisy with politeness; will not practice lying to please,
                        instead of frankness; will have the courage to cut an unwelcome
                        acquaintance; will not think that duplicity is French refinement; that
                        assumed hospitality, where hate dwells in the heart, is better than
                        outspoken condemnation; will not confound grace of movement with silly
                        affection; will not regard it as the end of her very being to have a beau;
                        will not smile and be a villain still.</p>
                    <p>The coming girl will look not to Paris but to person for fashions; will not
                        aim to follow foolish fashion because milliners and dressmakers have decided
                        it. Duty will be her aim, and her life a living sacrifice.</p>
