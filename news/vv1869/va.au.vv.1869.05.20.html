<b>To Virginians of the Valley</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With an important election concerning the passing of the constitution on
                    the horizon, the author urges all to register and vote. The issue at stake is

                    Virginians. Schools will be integrated, and white children will bear the burden

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> A highly important election is about to take place--an election ordered by
                        the military authorities who are now our masters.--It is important, for it
                        decides our fate--whether we shall bear the burden of a constitution
                        manufactured for the purpose of debasing the white man and elevating an
                        inferior race, or, by our vote, so modify that instrument and purge it of
                        its objectionable parts, as to make it favorable. You are looked to from all
                        parts of the State; your aid is needed to crush the serpent that has twined
                        around the noble escutcheon of our once proud State. You are called upon by
                        a loud voice to register and vote--it echoes from peak to peak--it rings
                        among our rocky fastnesses--register and vote! Do not supinely fold your
                        arms and say--"Well, we take no interest in politics, we've had enough of
                        it. Our business now is to attend to our crops and make as much money as we
                        can; we cannot reach a lower state of degradation." This is the language of
                        the false and craven-hearted.--Take no interest! In the name of every thing
                        that is holy and dear to your hearts, have you no interest in the happiness
                        and honor of your children? Are they to anathematize you in after years for
                        the course your indifference brought upon them? You say you cannot reach a
                        lower state of degradation. "Lay not the flattering unction to your soul."
                        We are now under military rule; it is better that we should remain so, that
                        the Civil Government should be entirely blotted out, than to voluntarily
                        burden ourselves with heavy taxes drawn from our labor to support an army of
                        negro and carpet-bag office holders. Will you not feel the sting of reproach
                        and the blush of shame when, by your indifference, you find that you have
                        entailed upon coming generations a curse worse that the plagues of Egypt? By
                        registering your names and voting for Walker (though the dose be a bitter
                        one) you, at least, preserve the dignity of your race, and accept a
                        constitution shorn of its most objectionable parts. In our midst we have
                        several noble Institutions of learning and benevolence; they have always
                        been the pride of our honored State--The University at Charlottesville, the
                        Military Academy at Lexington, the Lunatic Asylum and the Asylum for the
                        Deaf, Dumb and Blind, located in Staunton. What will be the fate of these
                        institutions if you uphold negro supremacy by your apathy? The
                            unpurgated constitution equalizes whites and blacks--the
                        latter will demand that their offsprings have an equal chance in
                        our schools with our children, they will insist
                        upon mixing colors and massing the copper with the silver. Where's the son
                        of Virginia who will consent to sit beside one of the African race and
                        compete with him for the honors of his alma
                        mater? The fate of the Universities of North and South Carolina
                        should open your ears to this question--you should listen and ponder.
                        Asylums for lunatics--also for the deaf and blind can be provided for the
                        colored people; but, it may be remembered that the Bayee Convention
                        repeatedly refused to provide that the free schools of the State for black
                        and white should be separate.</p>
                    <p>We do not consider that Virginia, the venerable mother of States and
                        Statesmen has "at last yielded her spirit and bowed her head in silent
                        submission." She but accepts the lesser evil to avoid the greater. By her
                        vote in favor of a modified constitution and candidates who meet the
                        Conservatives half way, she but saves herself from the bitter results of
                        negro supremacy and rids herself of bayonets and military dictation. Her
                        wise men have recommended harmony--her sterling old Democratic journals have
                        yielded the field they have so long defended with unflinching bravery, and
                        now say "a half a loaf is better than none."</p>
                    <p>Should Wells with his ebony and topaz associates succeed, it will be through
                        the neglect of the white voting population of the State. On whom, then, will
                        fall the reproach of equality of races? Who will invite mongrel rule but
                        those who neglect to register and vote? Why--one Lomax, a negro carpenter of
                        Abbeville S.C., holds at once the offices of member of the House of
                        Representatives and Chairman of the delegates; pay $6 a day and
                        mileage.--County School Commissioner; pay $4 a day and mileage. Census
                        Taker; pay, $1.50 a day. Commissioner of Elections; pay, $3 a day--Total,
                        four offices and $14.50 per day with mileage! The negroes are hungry for
                        office, are making a movement which will give them the lion's share, much to
                        the discomfiture of their foreign leaders. Keep from the polls, and you
                        connive at this state of affairs--register and vote and you do your best to
                        prevent it.</p>
                    <p>Again we say, men of the Valley, answer the call of those who look to you to
                        prevent usurpation, by manfully coming forward to their aid. You know, or
                        should know the importance of your vote--Use the right, if it is yours, and
                        save the State form degradation.</p>

<b>The Wages of Labor</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Calling attention to working class issues, the author of this article urges
                    all working men to work to alter the present system of government. Government,
                    the author suggests, is where the problems of the worker originate. Although he
                    earns more for his wages than in the past, he is nevertheless worse off. The
                    worker is forced to raise his prices because market values for products needed
                    at home, as well as various duties on groceries and other essentials, have
                    increased greatly. Since the government panders to monopolies, workers should
                    unite, form free trade leagues, and work to put the "monied power" down.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> We have often noticed industrious, steady and ingenious mechanics toiling
                        from early morn until late at night  endeavoring with all their manly
                        energy to "make both ends meet," and keep their families from want. And, on
                        the other side, we have often observed men of much less merit and
                        perseverance, lazily journeying down the path of life, without care or
                        anxiety for the coming morrow--the gifts of Fortune poured into their
                        coffers without scarcely an invitation on their part. Now, there must be
                        something radically wrong, or the old saying of "Industry must prosper" is
                        not a truism. Let us enquire into it.</p>
                    <p> There is scarcely a mechanic who will not tell you that he is worse off now
                        at $4 a day than he was in ante bellum times,
                        when he received only $2 for his work. Presuming this is to be correct, it
                        behooves him to look into the cause. He has been compelled to raise the
                        price of labor because the market price of articles absolutely needed for
                        home consumption have more then doubled: The duties on groceries are so high
                        that the retailer has to throw the tax upon the consumer; the shoemaker
                        makes the same complaint; the provisions dealer cannot sell his flour and
                        meal at the old process and live, and the farmer will not part with his
                        produce until he gets the full market price, for he also has severe taxes to
                        pay. The conclusion then is, that the present system of government is wrong.
                        If the working man, the real boss and sinew of the land, will think, and
                        after thinking, act--they will find a remedy for this evil.--The day is not
                        far off when they will be able to emancipate themselves from this odious
                        system inaugurated by the monied and political leagues of this unhappy
                        country. There must be a reform; and how can that reform be brought about
                        but by the masses? The ballot box can be made to speak in thunder tones, and
                        the shoddy princes, who loll in their splendor, be made to tremble for their
                        illy-acquired power. We need no mammoth halls to hold mass-meetings in. let
                        the question be discussed by the people--the working people, not the drones of society, under the broad canopy of
                        heaven--in the work-shop, in the grocery store, in the market house--in the
                        home circle, where the dearest treasures of the poor are gathered, his wife
                        and children, aye, let the people talk of it every where.</p>
                    <p>If working men would only do their own thinking, they would soon be able to
                        better their present condition. They are too apt to listen to the talk of
                        wily politicians, who energetically plies his tongue, not for the public
                        good--but for his own aggrandizement. How often do we hear the good-natured
                        laborer say to the importuning demagogue:--"Well, all that you say may be
                        true--I don't quite understand the thing, for I never studied politics or
                        troubled myself about the affairs of the nation. I've got enough to do to
                        mind my own business without bothering myself about protective tariffs and
                        all that sort o' thing. If I give you my vote, I suppose that will satisfy
                        you?" It is possible that that very vote may bring ruin and misery upon him.
                        An army of political robbers under the name of Protectors of American
                        Industry, are undermining the best interests of the workingmen; they are
                        giving "such protection as the vulture gives the lamb; covering while
                        devouring." Working men! think for yourselves.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to perceive that a popular movement has been made at the North in
                        favor of Free Trade. It is one of the significant signs if the times--and we
                        may hope that a new era is dawning. Free Trade Leagues should be formed in
                        every part of the country, in order that the monopolies of monied power may
                        be put down and the rights of the working classes established on a firm
                        foundation.</p>
