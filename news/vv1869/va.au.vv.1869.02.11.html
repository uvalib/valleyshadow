<b>Examples Worthy of Consideration</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article uses examples of other states to show the difficulties with
                    disfranchisement. The author suggests, as do papers form other states, that the
                    "new movement" can save Virginia from the rapacious carpetbaggers. Although some
                    say that most Virginians do not support the movement, the author claims this is
                    merely the argument of Governor Wells and a few of his carpetbagger supporters.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>That influential journal, the Republican Banner, of Nashville, says:</p>
                    <p>"There is but one key to the solution of the reconstruction problem. The New
                        York Tribune has found it, and urges upon Congress its immediate
                        application. It lies in the simple, lucid comprehensive platform of
                        universal amnesty and impartial suffrage."</p>
                    <p>As Tennessee has preceded Virginia in having to endure disfranchisements,
                        negro suffrage, a State militia, and the like, her experience is worth
                        something to the people of Virginia. The counsel of her leaders and her
                        press ought to be weighed by the Old Dominion. The people of Tennessee would
                        be only too happy to day to secure relief from State disfranchisement in
                        consideration for universal suffrage.</p>
                    <p>So, too, Virginia has the advantage of Georgia's experience, both what she
                        gained in a good State constitution by conceding the demand for impartial
                        suffrage, and by what she has risked by running against the will of Congress
                        in the matter of negro eligibility to office. This experience ought to have
                        its uses for other communities in like case; We observe that the Macon
                        Telegraph--a most judicious and able paper--warmly endorses the new movement
                        in Virginia, and says that by it the authors, if they succeed, will "save
                        their State."</p>
                    <p> The meaning of this is, that the capital and industry of the people of
                        Virginia will be "saved" from the rapacious exactions of the carpet-baggers
                        who wish to eat up their substance. With a keen instinct, the latter class,
                        as soon as they heard of the "new movement," saw in it death and ruin to all
                        their schemes of oppression and plunder; they rushed to Washington,
                        carpet-bag in hand, to counteract the efforts of the committee of nine, and
                        for weeks have been working their game as well as they could. The principle
                        weapon in their armory is the persistent opposition of the "last ditch" men,
                        and their reiterated allegation that the new movement does not receive the
                        support of the Virginia people. This was the main point relied on by
                        Governor Wells to induce the Reconstruction Committee to adopt his views;
                        but it may be doubted, after all, whether, in case of his success in
                        attaining power, he will require those who have rendered him, at a critical
                        pinch, such very effective aid. National

<b>A Southern Scalawag on Carpet-Baggers</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This writer, a Virginia scalawag, suggests that carpetbaggers are the most
                    vile, base individuals in Virginia. They are concerned only with personal self
                    interest, they have duped blacks into supporting them, and will not hesitate to
                    slander a gentleman's good name for their benefit.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Hunnicutt, the Richmond chief of the Virginia scalawags, expresses his
                        opinion of carpet baggers in this fashion:</p>
                    <p>These miscreant adventurers, having no character of their own to lose, and no
                        property to tax, and no responsibilities resting on them, meanly, basely and
                        cowardly seek to build up a reputation with the colored people by lying and
                        defaming and trying to pull down the good names of gentlemen who would scorn
                        any association with them whatever. Beggars, they seek their fortunes by
                        whining and crying for office. Producing nothing, they would suck the last
                        drop of blood from the veins of every Virginian to fill their own empty
                        pockets, and then, in justification of their own base acts, would filch from
                        them that which is worth more than all the sordid wealth of the earth--their
                        fair reputation, their good name.--These ravenous, devouring wolves in
                        sheep's clothing, who go poking about throughout the country, whispering,
                        writing, publishing and circulating infamous lies and slanders against the
                        true and tried men of Virginia, merit the execration of all good men and the
                        eternal anathemas of a just and righteous God. Their sins will find them
                        out, and they will be brought to shame and infamy at last.</p>

<b>Value of Virginia Bonds</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article illustrates an important consequence of radical rule, the
                    "Bayne Constitution," and old fogeyism. Essentially, if the Committee of Nine's
                    propositions are rejected, white Virginians will fail to wrest control from
                    those promoting "negro rule." Thus, as in North Carolina, state stocks will
                    plummet.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The rise in Virginia stocks is to be attributed to the prospect of the old
                        Commonwealth being delivered from the despotism of the negro. They rose the
                        moment that it became even probable that the propositions of the Committee
                        of Nine would be accepted.</p>
                    <p>How different is the result in the case of North Carolina, whose stocks have
                        under her reconstruction exhibited a downward tendency, as well as they may,
                        when the capitalists of the country behold the reckless manner in which
                        Holden and his Radicals are running her in debt.</p>
                    <p>If such is the case in North Carolina, where the Radicals constitute a far
                        more influential and respectable class than they do in Virginia, what will
                        be infallibly the result in the latter State should Bayne's Constitution be
                        carried?</p>
                    <p> It does seem to us strange indeed that any can be found in Virginia directly
                        or indirectly concerned in maintaining the credit of the State, who are so
                        insensate as to oppose the plan of some of the old Commonwealth's most
                        patriotic and distinguished sons. If the old fogies, by the help they are
                        giving Wells and Underwood, should succeed in subjecting Virginia to the
                        negro, the bonds of the State will not be worth the paper they are printed
                        on; while if the committee succeed in their efforts, in a few months they
                        will rise to par.<br>Norfolk Journal</p>
