<b>War on the Dead</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Desirous of a peaceful "reconciliation" with former enemies, the author is
                    outraged by the shameful acts of Union soldiers toward the Confederate dead. The
                    author recounts a story of one Union lieutenant, who ordered a charge on those
                    paying their respects at Confederate graves at Arlington Cemetery. Blame is
                    affixed squarely on the shoulders of GAR Post No. 1. This article claims that
                    bitterness is only perpetuated through these types of acts. It implies that
                    southerners would never commit such heinous acts of disrespect and that all
                    animosity left over from the war is the fault of ill-mannered northerners.<br>

                    <p> The Philadelphia Press, the most rabid of the
                        Radical press, says: "All our statutes breathe ultimate pardon to the worst
                        offenders. There is no such thing in this land of love and liberty as
                        revengeful punishment." In another column of the same issue the following
                        paragraph occurs:</p>
                    <p> "The time will come when the Union soldier, with
                            [unclear] the cause of loyalty  honor to the memory of the
                        men who were brave enough to meet him in battle but it
                            is not now. Wait until the traitors both to the North and South,
                        the men who would not fight for their country, and were afraid to fight
                        against it, have passed away."</p>
                    <p> In the name of humanity, Christianity--of every kindly feeling that the
                        great God has planted in our nature, we would ask whether the nurturing of a
                        few innocent flowers over the grave of the brave enemy would endanger the
                        cause of "loyalty?" The government is pledged to peace, with the sheathing
                        of the blade came the olive branch, and with it the hope of future
                        brotherhood. Yet, why is it considered policy to keep alive a bitterness
                        that only tends to goad the conquered into acts
                        of violent retaliation? A strange mode of lulling the troubled waters. Maybe
                        the loyal "Grand Army of the Republic" fear that (to use the language of a
                        contemporary) "the primrose might turn to powder, and the heart's case might
                        bristle into a bayonet." Or do they fear that the rebel flowers might take root in a soil enriched by bones who
                        perished in defense of their homes and liberties? The coward attempts to
                        flee from his own shadow--there is a ghost in every nook and groan in every
                        peeling breeze. According to Forney's creed, it is policy to insult the
                        dead, to bayonet those who would honor the departed brave, to teach children
                        to detest a Southerner and to trample with exultation upon his lonely grave.
                        It is policy to smother all the nobler emotions of humanity, and to nurture
                        the darker and viler passions. And what is behind that policy? Why,
                        surely--to keep the feeling of hatred alive in the Northern heart, in order
                        that the dominant party may continue to rob the public crib and ride rough
                        shod over a groaning people!</p>
                    <p> At a recent gathering at the Arlington Cemetery of persons desirous of doing
                        honor to the dead by strewing flowers over their graves, the following
                        scene, as described by the New York Herald took
                        place: </p>
                    <p>"The lieutenant in command whose name is Shirley, but of which I am not
                        certain, was particularly offensive in his manner. Seeing a lady throw a
                        small bouquet on one of these (Confederate) graves that lieutenant rushed to
                        the spot, picked up the flowers, and throwing them on the ground at his
                        feet, commenced stomping on them in a manner as to attract about him a crowd
                        of wandering spectators in a very few minutes. Some of the lookers on,
                        learning the cause of the lieutenant's rage, commenced to murmur
                        disappropriation, when the lieutenant shouted out, "D-n you, get away from
                        here, every one of you, or I'll make you. Guards, come up here and disperse
                        this crowd." The lieutenant accompanied these words with angry gestures, and
                        swirling his arms about as if he intended to pitch generally into the crowd.
                        His guards answered his call but the crowd dispersed without waiting to be
                        bayoneted.</p>
                    <p> The brave "boy in blue," this Shirley should have been cashiered from the
                        service before he had time to return to his quarters. He was, however, in
                        all possibility, acting under the orders of Post No. 1, of the "Grand Army
                        of the Republic," who had the arrangement of affairs, and whose magnanimous resolutions we published in our issue
                        last week. If so, he and his gallant horse  who were ordered to charge
                        upon a crowd of women and children, deserve a leather medal for their
                        indomitable courage. What right had the lady to show sorrow for a dead rebel, and so an act of reverence which belonged
                        exclusively to the "truly loyal"? It was treason, and the valiant guard were
                        ordered to suppress it at the point of a bayonet. Shame for the age we live
                        in! shame for the Government we have been compelled to bow to--whose hired
                        minions are commanded to slaughter the innocent because one tender hearted
                        female dared to drop a flower on a brave man's
                        grave. </p>
                    <p> "Oh beauteous peace! <br> Sweet union of a state what  thou <br>
                        Give safety, strength, and glory to a people? </p>

<b>The Canvass</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article briefly outlines a recent meeting of the Executive Committee
                    of the Conservative party in Staunton. The author comments on a number of
                    speakers including Major Douglas, who endorsed the Walker ticket for Governor
                    and Walker himself. Themes of the evening's addresses included black and white

                    construction of the Valley Railroad.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Major Beverly B. Douglas, of King William County, one of the canvassers at
                        large supported by the Executive Committee of the Conservative party
                        addressed our citizens at the Court House on Saturday last. At the hour
                        appointed he was introduced by Judge H.W. Sheffey, and commenced a stirring
                        speech in behalf of the Walker ticket, and the adoption of the expurgated
                        constitution. When he announced that, though a thorough Democrat, he now
                        took pleasure in supporting Walker as the only available man for the office
                        of Governor, and he considered it the duty of all true Virginians to do the
                        same, there was a voluntary burst of applause. He advised that the whites
                        and negroes work together in pulling down the carpet baggers and scalawags
                        who were infecting their native soil. Without the white horse and the black
                        horse would pull together the wagon (VIRGINIA) would be left in the mire. On
                        the whole the address of Maj. Douglas was a good one.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion Judge Sheffey announced the presence of Gilbert C. Walker,
                        who sat by the side of A.H.H. Stuart, Esq., and was the observed of all the
                        observers; this announcement caused a general clamor on the part of the
                        audience, and when Col. Walker walked to the stand he was greeted cordially
                        by all present. Mr. Stuart introduced him. He is a fine looking man--has a
                        countenance expressive of firmness and decision mingled with benevolence and
                        good humor. If appearances do not belie, he is a gentleman every inch of
                        him. He merely stated that he would address the citizens of Augusta and
                        Staunton at length on the 28th instant, and complained of being considerably
                        bumped and thumped in his old time stages, until all speechifying had been
                        knocked out of him for the present. He said that if Col. Harman did not
                        hurry on the Valley Railroad, the citizens of Staunton ought to ride him out
                        of town on a rail--Col. Harman was seated directly opposite him at the
                    time.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The decoration of the graves of the Confederate dead in the city Cemetery
                        took place according to announcement on Saturday morning last. The weather
                        was delightful and a pleasant breeze from the West prevented the rays of the
                        sun from having too much power. The stores and places of business were all
                        closed not only through respect of the memory of the dead, but, in order
                        that every one might participate in the solemn ceremonies. From eight
                        o'clock until ten there was a continuous stream of people of all sexes, ages
                        and conditions making toward the burial ground. The
                        ladies and children predominated, and, laden with their burden of flower
                        offerings, evinced an interest in the ceremonies which was highly creditable
                        to them.--The Council of the Friends of Temperance made a handsome display
                        with their regalia and banners, led by the old Stonewall Brigade under the
                        direction of Prof. Turner, an Association, which, if they were to go into
                        good training, would prove a credit to Staunton. The pupils of the D.D.
                        &amp; B. Institute marched to the ground, accompanied by their band.
                        Most of the girls and boys bore wreaths and bouquets, which they strewed
                        over the graves. The Fire Company of this Institution turned out in uniform.
                        It is presumed that there were between three and four thousand people on the
                        ground, among them were the young ladies of the Augusta Seminary and
                        Virginia Institute, each bearing wreaths or bouquets.</p>
                    <p> The ceremony of strewing flowers over the graves commenced after a dirge had
                        been played by the Stonewall band, and a very impressive requiem sung by a
                        select choir under the direction of Dr. J.L. Brown. Grave after grave was
                        honored by the beautiful ladies and rosy cheeked children; they did not seek
                        to select any particular mound--the known and unknown were all the same to
                        them--they had all died for "the lost cause," and all were alike to be
                        honored. We heard a bright-eyed cherub say, while holding a bouquet in her
                        hand, "I want to put this on a little grave.
                        Mamma, didn't any of the boys fight? Another sung a verse of "I want to be
                        an angel," while she scattered her sweet-scented offering over the Soldier's
                        grave. "It was the only requiem the kind little creature knew, and she
                        thought, in all probability, that she was singing for the dead.</p>
