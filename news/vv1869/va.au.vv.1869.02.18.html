<b>The Present Duty of Virginia Statesmanship</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author informs his reader that, whether they may like it or not, the
                    fact remains that "negro suffrage" will be a component of reconstructed
                    Virginia. Time has come for the political classes of Virginia to acknowledge
                    this fact, accept it, and work for the best possible constitution under "the
                    existing circumstances."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> It must be apparent to every thinking mind, that a new State Government for
                        Virginia will be created in the immediate future. It is equally inevitable,
                        that the Government will be established on the basis of negro suffrage.
                        Should the Underwood Constitution, as it stands, be voted on and defeated,
                        this, while it may pospone, it will not prevent the establishment
                        of a "reconstructed" Government; nor will it prevent "negro suffrage" from
                        being incorporated into the new constitution. Many political elements will
                        influence the formation of this new government, entirely beyond the control
                        of the hitherto governing classes of Virginia. These new political elements
                        may not be legitimate, may even be revolutionary usurpation, but they are
                        fixed and unalterable political facts, powerful political influences, which
                        will certainly shape and modify the fundamental laws under which all the
                        interests of all the people of Virginia must find protection, or destruction
                        for years to come. It is now the duty of political statesmanship, to deal
                        with all the elements that will constitute the formation of the new
                        Government, not as principles, but as facts, and so to deal with these facts
                        as will secure for the people of Virginia the best constitution and the best
                        Government possible under the existing circumstances.</p>

<b>Gen. Lee's Position</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<b>The Radical Party</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article exposes the political self-interest of the white
                    southerner who has joined the Radical party. These scalawags are seen by their
                    former associates as betraying the South for the sake of office. Adding further
                    insult, the author illustrates that many of these men were once the most
                    vehement supporters of secession.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> It is a fact not to be disguised that the party is daily receiving large
                        accessions to its strength in Richmond, from those who want office--many of
                        those too who are "going over" now are men who held respectable if not high
                        stations among us. <br>Richmond Correspondence to the
                            Index.</p>
                    <p> There are men in Augusta county, we are sorry to say, who have prostituted
                        themselves by joining the Radical party, or in other words, have become
                            scalawags through choice. What a fall to be
                        sure, and what a change to come over men who, at one time, not only gloried
                        in being called rebels but were among the first to proclaim their
                        secessionist proclivities.</p>
                    <p>What is the object of all this? We answer, office. Mr.
                        Blood-and-Thunder-kill-all-the-yankees wants and office and does not care
                        how he gets it. Now we do not consider such men fit associates of the honest
                        union men, through and through, and must confess our surprise that they are
                        tolerated by them.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reproduced from the Petersburg Index illustrates the success
                    of the "new movement" in staving off the passing of the "Underwood
                    Constitution." Wells, the "truest representative" of oppressive carpetbag
                    politicians, is described as both impudent and unprincipled.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Petersburg Index says: "Whenever the measure of the late political
                        movements in Virginia shall be correctly taken--their originators and
                        participators will obtain credit for having accomplished much which is as
                        yet unacknowledged, the assailants of those who commenced and have carried
                        on the recent effort for pacification, have, without exception, lost sight
                        of one important point in stating or arguing what has been done. Let it be
                        remembered that when the Richmond Conference assembled, Congress, according
                        to the best authority, was about to order an election in Virginia--an
                        election which offered the Underwood Constitution with no alternative to
                        this people. So the Republican State Committee had announced, and to this
                        belief the Conservative Committee assembled in December. As to the result of
                        an election held at the time then proposed, and under the circumstances then
                        obtaining, there can be no doubt. We should have passed under the abominable
                        yoke of the Constitution referred to, having the additional certain
                        infliction of officers to execute its provisions who would have been chosen
                        altogether from that class from whom Virginia, and Virginians of all parties
                        and races, have most to fear--the impudent, unprincipled carpet bag element
                        of which Wells is the master-spirit and the truest representative.</p>
                    <p>This was the fate to preserve the State from which the "new movement" was
                        undertaken. And certainly some degree of success has attended the effort.
                        The election has not been had--and every day which passes is a day gained--a
                        day in which reason and interest, and the thousand natural influences which
                        will at last produce harmonious reconstruction, are at work to render more
                        improbable the fastening of an oppressive fraud upon the people of Virginia.
                        We think that in the intervals of abuse our opponents might at least do the
                        Conference and its Committee the justice to admit this much.</p>
