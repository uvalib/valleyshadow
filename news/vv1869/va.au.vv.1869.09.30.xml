                <transcript>
                    <p>Our esteemed contemporary has undertaken to read us a lecture, and at the
                        same time to make an ungenerous "fling" at our town, in consequence of an
                        editorial in a recent number of our paper, in which we spoke approvingly of
                        the nominations made elsewhere of our fellow citizens Hon. A.H.H. Stuart and
                        Hon. John B. Baldwin for the Senate of the U.S. We respectfully submit that
                        the lecture was unnecessary, and the "fling" at our people wholly uncalled
                        for. If blame attached to anybody for writing and publishing the article, it
                        rests, exclusively, at our door. We alone are responsible for it, and it
                        would seem to be unjust to seek to cast odium on a whole community, for the
                        act of an individual.</p>
                    <p> But, we maintain, that our contemporary has done an injustice. We are not
                        the first to name Messrs. Stuart and Baldwin in connection with the Senate.
                        The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph> and other papers, mentioned the
                        fact that their names were currently spoken of in connection with the office
                        of Senator, and it was in noticing this announcement that we expressed our
                        pleasure that these gentlemen seemed to enjoy the confidence and good will
                        of the people of Virginia. The idea of urging the election of <emph
                            rend="italic">both,</emph> or indeed of <emph rend="italic"
                        >either</emph> of these gentlemen, did not enter our minds. We knew, that
                        according to the usage of Virginia, it would be absurd to think of electing
                            <emph rend="italic">two</emph> Senators from any one locality--even from
                        Winchester which so long enjoyed the honor of having one! </p>
                    <p> We mentioned <emph rend="italic">both</emph> gentlemen because we regarded
                            <emph rend="italic">both</emph> as well qualified for the office, and we
                        would be perfectly satisfied with either--though we would prefer to see
                            <emph rend="italic">both </emph> fill the position--but, as out
                        contemporary remarks, <emph rend="italic"> "one at a time."</emph></p>
                    <p> We trust then, that our friend of the <emph rend="italic">Times</emph> will
                        dismiss the groundless fears of our seeking to establish a monopoly in
                        regard to the Senate. We venture to affirm, that neither of the gentlemen
                        named, will ever offend the sensibilities of the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Times,</emph> by any unseemly aspirations after that, or any other office.
                        Such has not been the course in the past, and we hazard nothing in saying,
                        that it will not be in the future. They have never thrust themselves forward
                        as candidates.--When they have filled public positions, the offices have
                        sought them. But when the safety of the State was endangered, they have not
                        been the men to hang back to ascertain how the popular current was drifting.
                        On such occasions they have been found at the post of duty, regardless of
                        the denunciation and obloquy which are sometimes meted out to those who are
                        in the advance of public opinion. </p>
                    <p>We stated in the terrible crisis through which Virginia has recently passed,
                        Messrs. Stuart and Baldwin were among the first to see the danger and among
                        the foremost to try and arrest it. Everybody knows that for long months,
                        denunciation and ridicule were the only reward which they received at the
                        hands of a large portion of the press and of the politicians of Virginia,
                        but they faltered not for a moment, until their work was accomplished. When
                        that was done, they retired to their offices, and we venture to affirm, that
                        neither of them has by act or word, indicated any wish or purpose to seek
                        any reward for the service they may have rendered to their native State.
                        Nor, do we believe, that either would allow his name to be used in
                        connection with any office, if by so doing the best interests of Virginia
                        were placed in jeopardy.</p>

                <summary>The author of this article wishes to clarify a recent accusation that
                    Staunton was attempting to monopolize Virginia's national representation by
                    electing two Stauntonians to the U.S. Senate. The author says that by offering
                    both names as Senators, that either one would ably fill the position. Quite
                    possibly both men could serve in succession, but not at the same time. This
                    article points out that both prospects are not unprincipled office seekers but
                    rather upstanding citizens who have only Virginia's best interest in mind.</summary>

                <summary>The paper endorses the Virginia Life Insurance Company. The editors assert
                    that at least $10,000, most of which goes to northern capitalists, is collected
                    in premiums each year from Augusta. It would be better to do business with a
                    local company. The "Virginia" has a capital of $125,000 and is worthy of
                    patronage.</summary>

                    <p>We have been permitted by a friend to quote the following extracts from a
                        private letter lately received from this gentleman:</p>
                    <p>"I am as you know, thoroughly disfranchised and disqualified for all official
                        preferment, either State or Federal, and have never had any idea of applying
                        for any relief from my disabilities in advance of that general amnesty which
                        some day or other, I presume, will come alike to all the people of Virginia.
                        It would, therefore, be very absurd in me to engage in any political
                        combinations at a time of such political uncertainty as that upon which we
                        have fallen. I am not in the political market as buyer or seller, nor have I
                        anything to barter. * * My politics are emphatically Virginian. If I have
                        ever forgotten for one moment to look after her rights, her interest or her
                        honor, I am not conscious of the delinquency. If I have seemed to surrender
                        any of her rights, it has been only because I had utterly lost all means and
                        all hope of maintaining them entire, and felt that the only way to save
                        anything would be to let go frankly whatever was clearly lost. If I have
                        ever conceded anything to a Radical, it was because he had it already.</p>

                <summary>This letter excerpt clarifies the political position and potential
                    candidacy of Col. John B. Baldwin. Being disfranchised and disqualified for all
                    offices, he finds it absurd that he might consider any political "engagement."
                    However, while he does not plan to enter the "political market," he nevertheless
                    points out that he is "emphatically Virginian," and thus anti-Radical. Any
                    concession, he argues, that he has ever made to the Radicals, was because
                    Virginians had already lost all means of maintaining whatever was at issue.</summary>

                <summary>Mrs. Lucretia Cox died in Staunton at the residence of her husband on
                    September 14th. She was 43 years old. "She had been for a long time in delicate
                    health, but during the summer she was attacked with the disease that slowly and
                    painfully exhausted her strength, until she fell asleep in death. For many years
                    she had lived a consistent and exemplary member of the Presbyterian Church. In
                    health she was hopeful and cheerful and her long and painful illness was borne
                    with resignation to the Divine will. She spoke of her approaching death with
                    composure and thanked her numerous friends who visited her during her illness
                    for their kind attention. She was a kind and indulgent mother, a dutiful and
                    affectionate wife, and a kind and obliging neighbor and friend."</summary>
