<b>Our Railway Connections</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article describes the attempts of the people of the Valley to have a
                    railroad built linking the entire length of the Valley to the Potomac River. At
                    first they had hoped that the people of Baltimore would fund the project out of
                    a desire for trade connections. If they do not, however, Virginians will court

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the November term of our County Court, the following cases were disposed
                        of:</p>
                    <p>Wm. Robinson, a gentleman of color, indicted for breaking into the
                        store-house of Hugh A. Glenn, was sentenced to one year's confinement in the
                        Penitentiary. The same individual was also tried for assault, with intent to
                        kill, upon J.J. Christian, and had an additional five years added to his
                        sentence, but this verdict was set aside as being excessive.</p>
                    <p> Frank Williams, of same complexion, indicted for committing rape upon one of
                        Africa's fair daughters, was tried and acquitted.
                        John Minor, also colored, against whom an indictment was found for felonious
                        breaking into the store-house of R.S. Ridgeway, was convicted, and sentenced
                        to one years imprisonment in the penitentiary; but this verdict was also set
                        aside on the account of the absence of the presiding justice when the
                        verdict was brought in. Wm. Boud and W.H. Pelton, indicted for petit
                        larceny, were convicted and sentenced to sixty days in "durance vile." </p>
                    <p>James A. Harvey qualified and gave bond as a Notary Public under commission
                        of the fate of Governor Wells; and John W. Reed qualified as Deputy
                    Sheriff.</p>
