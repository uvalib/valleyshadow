<b>The Virginia Constitution</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A group of prominent Virginians including Alexander H.H. Stuart and John
                    Baldwin, both of Staunton, has come together to propose a number of
                    modifications to the state constitution. Admitting that Negro suffrage is in
                    place, although they claim blacks are not ready for such a responsibility, the
                    men request that concessions are made for the benefit of the white voters of
                    Virginia, many of whom are currently denied access to the ballot box. Among the
                    proposed modifications, it is "suggested" that universal amnesty be applied to
                    all white voters, and the striking of several articles regarding such issues as
                    taxation for free public education.<br>(Names in announcement:  Alexander H. H. Stuart,  John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Judiciary Committee of the United States
                        Senate:
                    </p>
                    <p>On behalf of the declaration of citizens of Virginia, and in accordance with
                        the request of your committee, we beg leave respectfully to submit, in the
                        form of amendments to House bill 1,485 now under your consideration, such
                        modifications of the constitution proposed by the late convention as in our
                        opinion will, under all the circumstances, lead to its acceptance by the
                        people of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>It is due to candor to say in this connection that those who seat us here
                        expressed, as we believe, the real feelings and purpose of the people of
                        Virginia when they declared, "while the conviction of the undersigned, and,
                        as they believe, of the people of Virginia generally, remains unchanged,
                        that the freed men of the southern States, in their present uneducated
                        condition, are not prepared for the intelligent exercise of the elective
                        franchise and the performance of other duties connected with public affairs,
                        and are therefore, at this time, unsafe depositories of political power;
                        yet, in view of the verdict of public opinion in favor of their being
                        allowed to exercise the right of suffrage, as expressed in the recent
                        elections, the undersigned are prepared, and they believe the majority of
                        the people of Virginia are prepared, to surrender their opposition to its
                        incorporation into their fundamental law as an offering on the altar of
                        peace and in the hope that union and harmony may be restored on the basis of
                        universal amnesty."</p>
                    <p>Taking it then, to be established as the policy of this Government to require
                        in Virginia a constitutional recognition and enforcement of the civil and
                        political equality of all men before the law, we have in the amendments
                        proposed inserted all the provisions looking to that result which Congress
                        has heretofore deemed proper, and we have left undisturbed all the
                        provisions of the proposed constitution in any manner relating to that
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>The first modification of the proposed constitution suggested by us is to
                        strike from it all those features of disfranchisement and disqualification,
                        and all those elements of bitterness and strife, political, sectional, and
                        sectarian, which in our judgment, are wholly incompatible with good
                        government and good feeling, and tend to perpetuate alienations and
                        discords, which all good citizens must deprecate. The power of the State to
                        subject any of its citizens to disabilities for offences against the United
                        States has been seriously questioned. It seems to be conceded that for the
                        purpose of punishment no such power exists, and that disqualification and
                        disfranchisements are only admissible as measures of precaution and safety.</p>
                    <p>In this point of view it is worthy of consideration that since the close of
                        the war the people of Virginia have been living without disfranchisement or
                        disability of any kind under a government whose legislative and judicial
                        departments and whose local organizations have been in the hands of the very
                        classes whom it is sought by the proposed constitution to exclude from every
                        position of trust in the State. We claim with confidence that the result has
                        been that the supremacy of law and order has been as fully maintained, and
                        that the functions of good government have been as well performed in
                        Virginia as in any State in the Union.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that article three, section one, paragraph four, would
                        disfranchise not less than ten of fifteen thousand voters in the State,
                        including all those whom the people have been accustomed to trust in public
                        employments.</p>
                    <p>Article three, section seven, would disqualify for every position of public
                        trust not less than ninety-five out of every hundred of the white people of
                        Virginia who would otherwise be eligible, and would in connection with
                        section three of the same article extend the like disability to serve upon
                        juries.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that there is no advocate of universal negro suffrage who will
                        not agree that in its application to Virginia, at this time, it is a fearful
                        experiment, requiring for its success all the wisdom and experience that can
                        be brought to its management; and it is respectfully submitted that to
                        exclude from participation in State or local governments at this time so
                        large a proportion of those who, by experiences in public affairs, are
                        fitted to deal with this great problem would be unwise and unsafe.</p>
                    <p>We earnestly declare that, in our belief it would be wholly inconsistent with
                        domestic tranquility, public order, or the security of lives, liberty, or
                        property, of the great body of the white population of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The provision of article eleven relating to church property is an attempt to
                        reverse the settled policy of Virginia, which restricts the ownership of
                        church property in amount, and confines it strictly to the local religious
                        congregation. The purpose is to enable "ecclesiastical bodies" outside of
                        Virginia, in opposition to the legislation of the State and against its
                        judicial decisions, to take the churches of Virginia from the local
                        congregations who built them, the provision opens a controversy full of all
                        the combined bitterness of party, and sections, and sect, over every
                        Presbyterian and Methodist Church building in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The next modification suggested by us is to strike from the proposed
                        constitution, and thus leave to legislative enactment or modification, the
                        whole of the cumbrous machinery for local organization, government, and
                        police; which, in our judgment, is clearly unfitted to the condition of the
                        State, and if fixed in the constitution will be a cause of embarrassment and
                        difficulty and strife, seriously affecting the public peace and the harmony
                        and good order of society.</p>
                    <p>The population of Virginia is very sparsely and unequally distributed over
                        the territory of the State, and physical and geographical features of the
                        country are such as to render wholly impracticable any arbitrary plan of
                        sub-division for local purposes. The most we have been able to do thus far
                        is to make the counties the units of local government, and to give to the
                        county courts, composed of all the county justices, the control and
                        direction of the local government and police.</p>
                    <p>In view of the introduction into our system of so large a political element
                        so unequally distributed as the result in the complete prominence of the
                        whole white race in one section of the State, and of the colored race in
                        another section, we are very earnestly of opinion that any system of local
                        government and police engrafted upon the constitution, and placed under the
                        absolute control of limited districts, will naturally incur the distrust and
                        excite the apprehensions of the local minority, and tend to collisions
                        calculated to impair personal security and to endanger the public peace.</p>
                    <p>The same difficulties surround the subjects of local taxation and education,
                        in regard to which we are satisfied that the proposed system will be found
                        unequal and inefficient in its operation, and in its results intolerably
                        expensive and oppressive.</p>
                    <p>The solution of these difficulties which we propose is to strike the whole
                        system from the constitution and leave it to the Legislature, in which all
                        localities, interests, and classes, will be fully represented, to regulate
                        the whole subject by laws, which will be at all times open to modification
                        and improvement, such as experience may suggest or the public interest may
                        require.</p>
                    <p>The next modification proposed by us is to strike out the provision in
                        article eleven relating to homestead and other exemptions. The laws of
                        Virginia now in force provide for homestead and other exemptions,
                        prospective in their operation. The provisions of these laws are believed to
                        be not materially different from those in the proposed constitution, except
                        in regard to past indebtedness, as to which we regard the proposed provision
                        as clearly in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. The chief
                        importance which we attach to striking out this provision grows out of the
                        injurious effect upon the minds of the people, whose necessities already
                        incline them to look with favor upon any suggestion of relief from pecuniary
                        obligation.</p>
                    <p>The only remaining suggestion of modification is as to the maximum of
                        taxation for local free school purposes, in article eight, section eight.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that we made no objection to the school system proposed
                        except so far as it depends on the local organization, to which we have
                        already referred.</p>
                    <p> No objection is offered in any quarter to the establishment of a thorough
                        system of free public schools, at least as rapidly as the proposed
                        constitution requires; and although we have asked to strike out the mode of local taxation proposed we have suggested a
                        modification which avoids and diminution of the amount to be raised by taxation for public free school purposes.</p>
                    <p>In suggesting the modifications referred to we by no means wish to be
                        understood as conceding that the proposed constitution is free from what we
                        regard as important defects in other particulars, but we do not understand
                        it to be the purpose of Congress to interfere in such matters further than
                        may be required by high consideration affecting the integrity of the
                        constitution and the maintenance of justice and domestic tranquility. We
                        have, therefore, continued our objections to provisions of the proposed
                        constitution falling properly, as we believe, within the scope of such an
                        interposition.</p>
                    <p>The clauses which we ask to have stricken out from the proposed constitution
                        are different degrees of importance; but the least important, we think, will
                        be found to involve some grave public mischief or injustice. Those included
                        in our first suggestion could not but plunge our State in to civil anarchy
                        and discord, and disturb the general and growing harmony of the two races of
                        our people, if not to array them in deplorable hostility to one another.
                        They would arrest immigration, paralyze all forms of industry, destroy our
                        domestic peace and hope of prosperity, and render us a burden to the Union,
                        instead of an important addition to its resources, wealth, credit, and
                        power.</p>
                    <p>In our personal interview with the committee we called their attention to
                        provisions of the proposed constitution, and especially in that relating to
                        usury, as instances of the insertion into a constitution of matters
                        particularly proper to be left to ordinary legislation. The provisions in
                        regard to usury is one new in Virginia, and will establish a policy which,
                        whatever may be its merits, must seriously affect all the material interests
                        of our people.</p>
                    <p>It is respectfully submitted for the consideration of the committee whether a
                        measure of legislation so important, and in regard to which opinion is so
                        much divided, ought to be fixed in the constitution and so placed beyond
                        legislative control.</p>
                    <p>As to the mode of granting relief from the mischievous provisions to which we
                        have referred--to wit, by act of Congress, suggesting modifications as
                        fundamental conditions precedent--we desire to say that it has been
                        suggested as the result of an examination of the precedents found in the
                        past legislation of Congress, and upon consultation with a number of the
                        wisest and most experienced members of both Houses. In the preparation of
                        the amendments proposed to the pending bill we have endeavored fairly to
                        follow the precedents established in like cases; and we may be permitted to
                        suggest, in conclusion, that we believe it will be found that the
                        modifications proposed by us will in fact conform the proposed constitution
                        to the principles and policy of the reconstruction acts.</p>
                    <p>It is, perhaps, proper to say we, and those with whom we act, though
                        concurring, as we believe, with the people of Virginia, do not claim to be
                        authorized to speak for them.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, your obedient servants,<br>Alexander H.H. Stuart, <br> John
                        B. Baldwin, <br> Wyndham Robertson, <br> W.T. Sutherlin, <br>James

<b>The Meeting at the Court House on Monday</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                        Address of Hon. A. H. H. Stuart and Gen. John Echols to
                            their Fellow Citizens of Augusta County on the New Movement. The Court
                            House crowded to its utmost capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>We present the following as an imperfect synopsis of the remarks of Hon. A.
                        H. H. Stuart and Gen. John Echols. We had supposed that these gentlemen had
                        prepared notes of the different points they intended to discuss and had
                        hoped to obtain them, to aid us in making a fair report of the substance of
                        their speeches--on applying to them we ascertained that they had spoken
                        entirely extemporaneously and we are therefore compelled to rely on memory
                        and very imperfect memoranda in reproducing the substance of their remarks
                        on the principal topics which they discussed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. S. commenced by saying that like his friend Col. Baldwin he had been in
                        the habit of speaking to the people of Augusta, from time to time, during
                        the last 30 years on great political questions. Eight years ago he spoke to
                        them from the spot where he then stood, explaining what secession meant, and
                        admonishing them of the terrible consequences which would result from it. On
                        that occasion he had been denounced by some of the hot headed and impetuous
                        young men as an "alarmist" and a "submissionist" and some had gone so far as
                        to threaten to turn him out of the hall. But now all were prepared to
                        acknowledge that his predictions had been fulfilled to the letter.</p>
                    <p>After the surrender of Gen. Lee he had again spoken to them on the 8th of May
                        1865, counselling the abandonment of the contest and a prompt return to the
                        Union. Again he had been denounced and threatened with personal violence. In
                        a few weeks however, the passion and excitement of the hour passed away and
                        the whole community acquiesced in the wisdom of the course which he had
                        suggested.</p>
                    <p>An occasion had now occurred on which he deemed it his duty again to speak to
                        his countrymen. He knew what he had to say would not be acceptable to many,
                        but he felt that it was due to himself and the people among whom his life
                        had been spent, and who had so often honored him with their confidence to
                        speak to them frankly and freely in regard to the danger by which they were
                        surrounded.</p>
                    <p>He said that [unclear] more than a month ago it seemed to him as if the ship
                        of state was fast drifting to destruction. She was in the rapids and
                        approaching the cataract. He listened anxiously for some voice to sound the
                        alarm--he looked earnestly for some strong arm to save. He listened and he
                        looked in vain. He hoped that some note of warning would come from the
                        metropolis of the State. He hoped that the Central Executive Committee would
                        seek to avert the impending calamity but he was doomed to disappointment. He
                        then determined to raise his public voice to sound the alarm. He did so and
                        invoked the prompt action of the Executive Committee. No formal response was
                        given to his appeal, but he learned that the Committee regarded their
                        actions as purely executive--that they had power merely to carry out the
                        policy indicated in the [unclear] of 1867, and that they disclaimed all
                        right to modify or change that policy notwithstanding the change of
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The danger was imminent. The time for action was short. The House of
                        Representatives of the U. S. had passed a bill a few days before submitting
                        the Underwood Constitution to a vote of the people. Congress was to
                        reassemble on the 4th of January, and there was every reason to believe that
                        within one week after that day the Senate would pass the House bill. And Mr.
                        Stuart said he had no doubt that but for the intervention of the committee
                        of nine the bill would ere this have been passed.</p>
                    <p>The danger, Mr. Stuart repeated, was imminent. If anything was done it must
                        be done quickly. There was no time to call a convention--no time to consult
                        the people. Prompt and decided action must be taken to arrest the evil and
                        the people must be consulted afterwards. What was to be done must be done
                        within ten days, or it would be too late.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances five gentlemen who [unclear] met at his office on
                        Christmas day, talked the matter over, and concluded that the exigencies
                        were so grave and so urgent that they would on their own responsibility
                        invite about 50 gentlemen to meet them in Richmond on the 31st of December
                        to confer in regard to the condition of Virginia and decide what should and
                        could be done to save her from ruin. They according sent notes to 50
                        gentlemen--all men of character and position--in all parts of the State and
                        of all shades of opinion. Mr. Hunter, Mr. Seddon, Mr. Tucker, Mr. Conrad,
                        Mr. Janney and Mr. Flournoy--Old Democrats and Old Whigs--Secessionists and
                        Anti-Secessionists were invited. They would have gladly invited more, but
                        the time was so short that they could communicate only with those on or near
                        the rail road. The object of these notes was to induce the gentlemen to come
                        to Richmond. No invitation was sent to gentlemen residing in Richmond
                        because it was presumed they would be in the city and make known their
                        views.</p>
                    <p>On the 31st of December near 50 gentlemen met in Richmond and remained in
                        council two days. The resolutions which that conference adopted have been
                        published and need not be more particularly referred to.</p>
                    <p>The conference appointed a committee of nine to go promptly to Washington to
                        try and defeat or modify the bill there pending before the Senate. The
                        instructions to that committee were to do the best they could to promote the
                        interest of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Notice was promptly given to the committee to assemble in Washington on the
                        8th of January. They did so and at once went to work.</p>
                    <p>The opponents of what is called the 'New Movement' charge that the committee
                        are in favor of universal suffrage, and recommend that it be introduced into
                        the constitution. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is not a
                        member of the committee who is in favor of universal suffrage; on the
                        contrary every man of those was and is now opposed to it and would gladly
                        get rid of it if he could.</p>
                    <p>What are the facts? The committee found a bill which had passed the H. R.
                        pending in the Senate. That bill provided for the submission of the
                        constitution just as it came from the hands of Underwood &amp; Co. to
                        the people, for ratification or rejection. While they believed that on a
                        full and fair vote it might be voted down, they greatly feared that on such
                        a vote as we were likely to have when carpet-baggers had the handling of the
                        ballot boxes and the counting of the ballots, it was very doubtful (let the
                        vote be what it might,) whether it would not be declared to be adopted. The
                        examples of Alabama and other Southern States were not lost sight of, nor
                        had the committee forgotten that Gov. Wise was reported to have declared
                        that [unclear] [unclear] [unclear] to be done to ensure [unclear] of the
                        constitution would be [line unclear] to prevent the submission of this
                        constitution, with all its enormities to the popular vote. To this end they
                        at once went before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and invoked its
                        assistance. They asked that committee, in accordance with well established
                        precedents, to prescribe, as fundamental conditions to the admission of
                        Virginia into the Union, the striking out of a number of the obnoxious
                        clauses of the constitution. The committee were heard courteously and
                        patiently by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and they addressed to that
                        Committee a communication in writing expressive of their views. The
                        committee of nine found in the Underwood constitution many objectionable
                        provisions--but passing over minor defects, they confined their attention to
                        five.<br> 1. Universal suffrage.<br> 2. Disfranchisements and
                        test-oaths.<br> 3. County organization<br> 4. Homestead provision.<br> 5.
                        Church clauses</p>
                    <p>To these they addressed themselves, barely referring to others.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the 1st, they found the opinion of Congress unalterably fixed.
                        It was a canon of their political church, an article of their political
                        creed, nay, more, it was the widest plank in the Chicago platform. On it
                        they had won the presidential election, and it would have been quite as
                        reasonable to ask; and there would have been just as much prospect of
                        success in asking, the restoration of slavery, as in asking the abandonment
                        of universal suffrage. It was in the Underwood Constitution, and it was in
                        the Constitution of every reconstructed State of the South, and there was no
                        natural ground to believe that a victorious party in the first flash of
                        triumph would surrender the principle which had secured to them the victory.</p>
                    <p>The committee did not, then, seek to spend any time in the vain endeavor to
                        induce Congress to surrender this favorite dogma. They would have as soon
                        attempted to remove the Blue Ridge from its base, as to eradicate the idea
                        of universal suffrage from the mind of Congress. They regarded it as a fixed
                        fact--as an inevitable necessity. They could no more ignore its existence
                        than an engineer could ignore the Blue Ridge as an obstacle in his path, in
                        locating a road from Eastern Virginia to the Valley. Finding this to be the
                        condition of things the committee recognized universal suffrage as just as
                        firmly established as emancipation.</p>
                    <p>When the South was overcome by arms the abolition of slavery was the logical
                        consequence of defeat, and all acquiesced it as such. When we were
                        overwhelmed, in November, at the ballot box, negro suffrage followed, just
                        as naturally, as the legitimate result of that overthrow, and all will have
                        to acquiesce whether they will or no.</p>
                    <p>The committee of nine, seeing the position of affairs, at once accepted the
                        situation and addressed themselves to the remaining four cardinal enormities
                        in the constitution.</p>
                    <p>They said, in substance, to the committee and members of Congress, "We
                        recognize negro suffrage as irreversibly settled--we know you will not
                        depart from your well considered line of policy, and, therefore, while we do
                        not agree with you, we forbear to ask any change in that feature of the
                        constitution.</p>
                    <p>"But we do ask you to relieve us from other and oppressive provisions, which
                        are municipal in their character, and which do not interfere with any of
                        your Congressional policy." On these points the members of both houses lent
                        attentive ears and gave the committee every reason to hope for success.</p>
                    <p>Mr. S. here entered into a detailed discussion of the objectionable clauses
                        of the constitution, and showed how fatal they would be to the prosperity of
                        the State, and how indispensable it was to have them stricken out.</p>
                    <p>He also referred to the opinions of many senators and members, and also to
                        the views of Gen. Schofield and Gen. Grant in regard to those provisions,
                        and the reasons why he hoped for a successful result of the mission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart spoke with great satisfaction of the interviews the committee had
                        had with Gen. Grant, and referred to the decided opinions and broad and
                        comprehensive views of the various subjects taken by the President elect. He
                        referred to these interviews with pleasure, not only because Gen. Grant
                        favored the objects of the committee, but because the clear and intelligent
                        perception of the points involved and the charged and statesmanlike views of
                        them which he expressed, gave to the committee an assurance that Gen. Grant
                        would prove himself equal to the duties of the high office to which he had
                        been elected.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart referred to the opposition which had been made to the mission and
                        action of the "nine," and to the unjust reflections which had been made on
                        their proceedings. He adverted to the opposite sources from which criticism
                        came. Governors Wells and Wise were pulling together in the same team, and
                        the Richmond Enquirer and the Radical Journal were in full accord in opposing the
                        "Movement," and George Rye, Yankee Allen and Dr. Bayne found coadjutors even
                        in Augusta! It was an alliance of the carpet-baggers and the fire eaters
                        from which no good could come! Gov. Wise had written five letters he
                        understood in opposition, but he thought the history of the last 8 years
                        proved that Gov. Wise was not a safe counselor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart referred to the fact that a writer under the signature of
                        "Augusta," had sought to hold him up to ridicule, if not scorn, by
                        impeaching his consistency in going now in opposition to his address as
                        President of the Convention of December, 1868. Mr. Stuart denied the truth
                        of the charge. He held now to every opinion expressed by him then. He was
                        now, as then, opposed to allowing the power of the State to pass into the
                        hands of an alien and inferior race. He was now as then for making this a
                        white man's government. He had not changed in his purpose--he had only
                        changed in regard to the means of accomplishing that purpose, and that
                        change had been rendered necessary by the altered condition of the country.</p>
                    <p>In 1867 he thought, as others thought, that the constitution could be beaten.
                        But with the light now before him, he thought it extremely doubtful. Then he
                        thought the best way of securing the ascendancy of the white race was by
                        disfranchising the black. That was now found to be impossible, and the only
                        way of securing white ascendancy was by enfranchising the whites so as to
                        countervail the black vote.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. S. said if the charge of inconsistency had been true, he did not
                        hesitate to say that he would abandon the most cherished prejudices and
                        opinions, if it were necessary to save the country from ruin. In his
                        judgement, the man who would from any selfish regard to his own interests,
                        or any obstinate pride of opinion, adhere to any given line of policy, to
                        the detriment of the public welfare, had little of the true spirit of
                        patriotism in his heart.</p>
                    <p>Mr. S. said he was at a loss to account for the violent opposition which had
                        been made to the [unclear] of the nine. The constitution was to be submitted
                        in some form or other, and the only question was shall it be submitted with
                        all its defects embodied in it, or shall it be submitted with four of the
                        worst of them stricken out? The committee of nine were for the latter, while
                        the opponents were for the former. It would be for the people to decide
                        between them. For his part, if he could not get all he wanted, he would get
                        as much as he could. And until this opportunity had sprung up he really
                        thought that when the nine got four of the five worst enormities of the
                        constitution stricken out, they would be entitled to thanks for what they
                        had done, instead of reproaches--because they could not get more.</p>
                    <p>It was a singular fact too, that while the opponents criticize the
                        propositions of the nine, they offer no substitute--present no better plan.
                        Let them offer a better plan, and the nine will thank them and adopt it.
                        Until they do this, they ought to hold their peace!</p>
                    <p>But the objectors say the nine have done nothing! True! Why then complain?
                        Why not wait until something is done and then judge of it according to its
                        merits? Anything the committee may accomplish is to be submitted to the
                        people. The committee claim no power to bind anybody. The convention which
                        is to meet on the 17th of March, was called by the committee for the very
                        purpose of considering the report of the committee and of taking such action
                        as may be necessary.</p>
                    <p>But say the opponents you have no assurance of success. True again. But why
                        not wait until a fair experiment has been made. The seed must be sown before
                        the harvest can be reaped. And time must be allowed for the seed to sprout
                        and grow and bear fruit. So time must be allowed for the seed which the
                        Committee have sowed to germinate and ripen for the harvest.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart said that let the mission of the nine result as it may in other
                        respects it has at least done good in dispelling many erroneous ideas from
                        the minds of Congress in smothering asperities, imparting correct
                        information and mollifying the temper of Congress in regard to the South. He
                        had himself received the most gratifying assurance on this point from
                        distinguished Senators.</p>
                    <p>It had also had the effect of enlisting many of the ablest papers of the
                        North and West--such as the N. Y. Tribune and Times, the Boston Advertiser,
                        Chicago Tribune and other influential journals in the interests of
                        conciliation and harmony and peace.</p>
                    <p>He believed one of the greatest obstacles to the success of the mission was
                        the opposition from home stimulated by carpet-baggers and their associates.
                        The carpet-baggers proclaimed that if the nine succeeded, they would have to
                        surrender the ghost. Their vocation will be gone.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion Mr. S. said that from all he could see and learn in Washington,
                        he had reason to believe that Gen. Grant would be the President of the
                        nation, and not of a party, and that he would give the country a wise and
                        patriotic administration to which we could all accord a hearty support.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Echols said that he had been connected with and favorable to the
                        "Movement" since its inception. He desired to look at and understand the
                        condition of our State as it in reality existed. It had been hard to realize
                        the great change in our whole social system, wrought by the extinction of
                        slavery, yet a conviction of this had been forced upon us at Appomattox
                        Court House, and everyone, of every grade of political opinion, had long
                        since yielded his assent to a state of freedom from slavery, without in
                        anywise feeling that any principle had been abandoned. So to his mind it was
                        clear that it had been just as emphatically decided, by the result of the
                        late Presidential election, that in the Southern States at least the negroes
                        should have the right of suffrage and all other political privileges. The
                        question as to the political rights of the negro was, in his opinion,
                        settled, and the only open question for our consideration is, can we obtain
                        equal political rights for the white people. It will do us no good to say
                        that we deplore the enfranchisement of so large a number of ignorant and
                        uneducated people as the late slaves of Virginia. Our wishes and opinions on
                        this subject will not be regarded. But then there is a large and influential
                        part of the Republican party who express a willingness, negro suffrage being
                        secured, to grant to the white people of the State the right also to vote
                        and hold office. Will it be the part of wisdom for us to say that we will
                        continue a fruitless war upon the proposition of negro suffrage, and that if
                        we are compelled to take that, we will make no effort to avoid the other
                        terrible evils with which we are threatened, in the Underwood Constitution.
                        The efforts of the committee of "Nine" have been directed earnestly,
                        faithfully, and most ably, to the rescue of our old State from as many of
                        the perils with which she is threatened, as it is possible to avoid. For one
                        he honored them for their services in this regard, and he had no doubt that
                        hereafter a very great majority of the people of Virginia would thank
                        them--in his opinion there was something to be more dreaded than negro
                        suffrage, and that was "Carpet Bag" domination, and yet this last was
                        inevitable should the Underwood Constitution, without amendment, be forced
                        upon us. With the amendments proposed by the committee, Virginia would be
                        ruled by residents of the State, and not by
                        "Carpet Baggers," who really have no residence or interest here. He wished
                        that every man in the State could have witnessed the scene enacted before
                        the "Reconstruction" Committee of Congress last week, when Wells, the acting
                        Governor, earnestly remonstrated against the adoption of the suggestions of
                        the "Nine," and besought that the Underwood Constitution, unadulterated,
                        might be put to the vote of the people, in order that it might be fixed upon
                        them beyond a peradventure, assenting that it would not be possible to carry
                        the Constitution if amended as proposed, because a large part of the Radical
                        party of the State would then vote against it, and that all the
                        Conservatives who followed the lead of the "Richmond Examiner &amp;
                        Enquirer," would also vote against it, thus leaving the advocates of the
                        Amendments in a hopeless minority. Gen. Echols called upon his young
                        friends, who are opposing this movement, to reflect upon this division of
                        parties, and to ask themselves, Why this position of Wells? He wished, too,
                        that every man in the Commonwealth could have heard the able, eloquent and
                        impressive reply of our distinguished county man, Col. Baldwin, to the party
                        appeal of Governor Wells, and his noble defence of the people of his native
                        State from the charges of the Governor. He would also bear testimony borne
                        to the good faith and integrity of the people of Virginia by Mr. Franklin
                        Stearns, who, always a consistent Union man and Republican, is also as
                        deeply interested in the prosperity of the State as any man in it, and who
                        will not allow his allegiance to party to interfere with his devotion to the
                        true interests of Virginia. Gen. Echols concluded by saying, that for one
                        who was willing, in good faith, to give in his acceptance to the
                        propositions of the committee of "Nine," and he appealed to all, of every
                        class, to look well at the "situation," to discard all prejudice and
                        passion, and to decide, as sensible and practical men, what is best for
                        themselves and their State.</p>
                    <p>Want of space prevents our giving even a condensed report of Col. Baldwin's
                        remarks, though we hope to be able to do so in our next issue. Another
                        meeting will be held at the February court.</p>

<b>The New Movement</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

                    Baldwin, and other Virginians who propose to accept Negro suffrage as part the

                    Virginia. The Virginian admits that the "cup is bitter" and the "idea is
                    hateful." Nevertheless, the paper supports men held in such high esteem as

                    <p>We have received the following communication from a gentleman living in
                        Maryland which shows with what interest the movement is looked upon by
                        others outside of Virginia, and we commend it to the careful consideration
                        of our readers.</p>
                    <p>Easton, Md., Jan. 18th, 1869</p>
                    <p>Editor Valley Virginian: -- The Warrenton Sentinel
                        visits the action of the Hon. A.H.H. Stuart, Col. Baldwin and their compeers
                        with some very severe strictures. It charges them with assuming to speak for
                        the people of Virginia without authority, solely with a view to open to
                        themselves access to office, and sorest charge of all, with dragging the
                        honor of Virginia in the mire.</p>
                    <p> These are heavy animadversions upon gentlemen whom Virginians have been
                        taught to love and honor as Cavaliers "without fear and without reproach."
                        And who will believe them? Men do not become villains all at once. We know
                        it is said the descent into hell is rapid; but who will believe that these
                        gentlemen are engaged in the movement so much reprobated by the Sentinel, sons of Virginia, true sons will turn
                        upon the loved, their venerated mother in the hour of her dire distress and
                        rend her? No! we would cry in thunder tones, they are not vipers to sting
                        the breasts that warmed them. They are peerless gentlemen, wise statesmen,
                        true sons of the Mother of States and of Statesmen.</p>
                    <p> But while defending them we shall carefully abstain from harsh utterances
                        against our brother. We would not array Virginian against Virginian in acrid
                        controversy or passionate denunciation. We write more in sorrow than in
                        anger. But none the less firmly do we tell our contemporary that the
                        gentlemen so violently assailed are actuated by no such motives as he
                        ascribes to them. Their motives are pure and disinterested, their object a
                        vitally important one to the highest interests of Virginia, their measures
                        sagacious and practicable, the result, whether in accordance with their
                        hopes, or with the hopes of those who oppose their action, can only
                            redown to their honor and the good of the people of their
                        State. Their efforts, if crowned with success, will effect great good--if
                        defeated in their main object they will at least have convinced the people
                        of the North that Virginia is not stubbornly bent on having her own way, but
                        is willing to adapt herself to circumstances and to do the best she may,
                        "And he that does the best that circumstance allows Does well, acts nobly
                        angels could no more."</p>
                    <p> When the editor of the Sentinel expresses his
                        disgust at the idea of going to the polls with a negro he should reflect
                        that that has been the hard fate of every Southern State and that we cannot
                        hope to escape. The idea is hateful; but though as good, we are no better
                        than our sister States who have all had to pass under the yoke. The cup is
                        bitter but we must follow it; if we will not take
                        it ourselves, it will be forced upon us as medicine is given to reluctant
                        children. The question presented is shall we take the poison "straight," or
                        shall we take it with an antidote in the other hand that will render the
                        poison innocuous. The latter is the policy of Messrs. Stuart, Baldwin and
                        their colleagues representing every quarter of the State.</p>
                    <p> When the Sentinel quotes the memorable dispatch
                        of Francis I after the battle of Pavla, "all is lost save honor" he invites
                        us to follow the example of that hero. And if we recur to the history of
                        that event we shall find little to support his argument. Francis I by the
                        result of that battle was forced to treat with his conquerors, and was,
                        ready to accept terms quite as humiliating as any that we propose to accept.
                        He did not say "no, I will not voluntary give up anything, you have
                        conquered me and may take what you will; treat with you I will not." But he
                        at once like a wise Monarch proceeded to get the best terms he could, and,
                        in consequence, was, in a few years, as hard as were those terms, as
                        powerful as he had ever been.</p>
                    <p>As to Messrs. Stuart, Baldwin, and the rest arrogating to themselves
                        authority, they do not possess, we have to say, they do not claim to have
                        any authority. They tell Congress if you will do so and so, it is our
                        opinion the people of Virginia will assent to it. We may be mistaken; we are
                        not authorized, as you know, to commit them to any prescribed cause of
                        action, but it is our decided opinion that such is not the feeling of the
                        people.</p>
                    <p> In conclusion we would ask, how it will advance the cause of the Sentinel, or how it will advance the peace and
                        welfare of the people of the State of Virginia to hurl such fierce
                        philippics or cast such fool assersions upon a body of gentlemen
                        so high in the esteem of the wise and good as those engaged in the "Virginia
                        Movement," whose sublime work is the preservation of the shattered alters of
                        the household Gods of mourning Virginia.</p>

                    Republican. It calls for, in lieu of interest solely in politics, an increased
                    interest in the manufacturing potential of Virginia. This effort will advance
                    the state back to its former status among states and increase its material
                    wealth.<br>

                    <p>We entirely agree with the Lynchburg Republican, when it says:</p>
                    <p>"We cannot bring ourselves to the conclusion that "politics" is or ought to
                        be the all absorbing topic of interest. Let those who make officers, and who
                        live by office attend particularly to it. What will restore, and how shall
                        Virginia be restored to her former prosperity? How shall she be advanced to
                        a higher position than ever before? seem to us to be the most important
                        questions which can be asked now. We want ballots, but we want green backs
                        also, and many a man with the ballot in his hand, is without a dollar in his
                        pocket. We are devoted to the work, as has Virginia, and her material
                        prosperity at heart. We want to see the fields green again with wheat and
                        corn; we want to see millions of pounds of tobacco manufactured in Virginia
                        again; we want to see factories on the banks of Virginia rivers; we want to
                        see railroads built to the mines of coal. And iron, lead and gypsum; and
                        then we want to see iron foundries, smelting mills and plaster mills and all
                        kinds of manufactories, at work."</p>

                    available for the completion of the road, and a link with Staunton is not
                    necessary. Therefore, Stauntonians must act now or be left behind.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Dear Virginian:-- The hesitancy that seems to
                        exist in Augusta to subscribe to the Valley Railroad is very unaccountable
                        to our people. We cannot suppose that the people of your county can fail to
                        appreciate the advantages that must flow to them from a road passing through
                        the entire length of the county; thus doubling the market facilities of the
                        people and giving them the advantage of competing buyers for their produce.
                        Now can we imagine that the great county of Augusta is really fearful about
                        amassing the terrible responsibility of paying
                        $18,000 interest yearly for a few years, when Rockbridge, with not half the taxable property of Augusta, has
                        agreed to pay $24,000.--We are, therefore, in the dark as to the reasons
                        that influence our Augusta friends. But that they have reasons is plain, and
                        this fact is inducing us to consider the other plans proposed for giving us
                        a Railroad connection with the rest of the State. We prefer a road to
                        Staunton, but if Augusta votes a "No" of course this settles the question as
                        to that route. But as far as we are concerned it
                        does nothing more.--We are determined with an
                        earnestness and unanimity I have never seen exceeded to have a Railroad. If
                        Augusta will not unite with us, we will only have to join our fortunes with
                        some other of our neighbors. Several plans are now being extensively
                        canvassed by our people. One is to make a road to Goshen which will be
                        entirely within our own limits and will put us in connection with the
                        Chesapeake &amp; Ohio road by the shortest route. We will be thus going
                        to meet the V. road when it is pushed on from Harrisonburg via Jenning's Gap to tap the C. &amp; O. road
                        at a point making the most direct course to the Ohio. This last must be the
                        route of the Valley road, if it has to be made without the assistance of
                        Augusta, for this route will most advantageously put the Manassas road into
                        connection with the C. &amp; O. Road, and at the present will give
                        Rockbridge the least amount of road to build. Another proposed plan is to
                        connect with Lynchburg, which will really give us a more natural and easier
                        outlet to our Eastern Virginia markets, than the proposed Valley routes, and
                        will connect there by the Orange road with the Baltimore route. We are
                        assured of strong influences and assistance if we will join in pushing this
                        road; for the road from here to Lynchburg is a very important link in the
                        straight line from Richmond to Covington. A third plan before us, and one
                        argued with the prospect of immediate success, is to connect with the
                        Virginia and Tennessee road at Bonsacks or Salem. We have $200,000 already
                        subscribed by Botetourt, and Roanoke will probably give $150,000 more.
                        General Mahone is known to be ready and anxious to help us. A branch from
                        the road to Lexington will secure him the trade of these counties even if a
                        connection should afterward be made with Staunton, for there will then be a
                        break of gauge there. The distance from here to Bonsacks is but little
                        greater than to Staunton, and in this section we already have $200,000 out
                        of the $350,000 asked for outside of our own county.</p>
                    <p> You will thus see the various plans our people have under consideration.
                        They have set out to get themselves a railroad and are casting about for the
                        best means of securing it. If Augusta, with an intelligent regard for her
                        own interests, and that kindly co-operation which should exist between
                        neighbors and friends will join hands with us, then Staunton and Lexington
                        will soon be united by rail, but if she refuse from mistaken views as to her
                        interests, or from any unworthy Micawber like expectations of getting the
                        road "anyhow," then we shall regret, on the account of old ties and
                        associations, her unwise and illiberal course, and will accept some one of
                        the other propositions made to us. <br> LEXINGTON </p>
                <br>
