<b>About Those Schools</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article discusses the various religious denominations and their plans
                    to build female academies in the not too distant future. The many different
                    sects are growing and adding wealth to the community, thus funding should not be
                    a problem. The author suggests that Stauntonians disregard religious bigotry.
                    The fundamental beliefs are the same, and each sect is working toward the same
                    beneficent goals. What is important is that these schools are constructed as
                    soon as possible, even if this means putting moneymaking enterprises temporarily
                    aside. The author stresses the importance of imparting knowledge to the next
                    generation, particularly the women. Knowledge, he says, cannot be squandered.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>What do our friends of the Baptist, Lutheran and Roman Catholic persuasions
                        say about those first class female schools which intend, at no distant day,
                        to establish at Staunton!</p>
                    <p> The Baptists are one of the most numerous, wealthy and intelligent
                        denominations in the State. They have only to say the word and the thing
                        will be done. In our community, they are represented by some of the most
                        estimable citizens. Though not many years have elapsed since they
                        established a church here, they have grown rapidly in numbers, wealth and
                        influence, and now they have one of the largest and most respectable
                        congregations in our town. In Eastern Virginia, they are still more
                        potential, and from the ability of their clergy, they  always be one
                        of the most controlling denominations in the State. But the time has come
                        when they must exercise enlightened liberality and public spirit, or they
                        will allow themselves to be out-stripped in the race of well-being by other
                        denominations of less pecuniary ability. </p>
                    <p>The Lutherans are not so numerous. But they embrace a considerable portion of
                        the wealth and intellect of our community. They commenced from small
                        beginnings, and by energy and zeal, have established a congregation which is
                        steadily gaining strength and weight among our people. From what we learn,
                        they are alive to the importance of educating the rising generation. They
                        have an excellent college for males, at Salem, and all that is necessary,
                        now, is to provide a first class female school, here.</p>
                    <p>They have the ability, and we believe they have the will. The future will
                        determine that question.</p>
                    <p>The Catholics were the last, we believe, to establish a church here; and by
                        indefatigable industry, they have extended their influence over a wide
                        circle. Most of our foreign population belong to the Catholic Church. The
                        devotion of the members of that church to its peculiar faith, and mode of
                        worship, is proverbial. They are remarkable, also, for their liberality in
                        contributing to every thing that is calculated to advance the interests of
                        their church. In a worldly point of view, they are probably not as wealthy,
                        in this particular vicinage as some of the other denominations. But they can
                        command any amount of aid which they may need, from abroad, to secure a good
                        female school here. Baltimore is an Episcopal--or, we believe, an
                        Anti-Episcopal sect, and many of the most respectable and wealthy citizens
                        of that city belong to the Catholic Church. With a little industry and
                        enterprise on the part of the resident catholics, we have no doubt large
                        contributions could be obtained from that quarter.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen from what we have written, that we cherish no feeling of
                        sectarian bigotry. While we have our own preference in church matters, we
                        are willing to extend to others the same liberty which we claim for
                        ourselves. We regard the different denominations as but separate regiments
                        in the great army of Christ. There is no antagonism between them. Whilst
                        each may prefer to fight under its own peculiar flag, they are all marching
                        on under the great banner of the cross!</p>
                    <p>The only contest among the various denominations should be, which can do the
                        most good? Which can do most to repress vice, intemperance, and immorality?
                        Which can do most to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked--to minister to
                        the afflicted? Which can do most to sow the seeds of virtue and morality in
                        the young and to educate the rising generation to such way as to qualify
                        them, in afterlife, to fulfill all the high duties of christian men and
                        women?</p>
                    <p>We are persuaded that one of the most effectual means of accomplishing all
                        those great ends is by establishing good schools.</p>
                    <p> Assuming it, then, as a postulate that all denominations will concur in the
                        high estimate which we place on schools--and especially female schools, as
                        the most efficient means of promoting all the objects to which we have
                        referred, we respectfully urge them now, to lay  hold on these means.
                        Let each of the  above referred to, lose no time in laying the
                        foundation of a first-class school.--Life is short. The time in which we can
                        do good is limited. Our years are vanishing away like a dream. Our children
                        are growing up around us. It is for us to determine what is to be their
                        future career. As the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined. If we wish our
                        children to grow up virtuous and intelligent we must educate them. Knowledge
                        is better than Riches. Better give them sound instruction than untold
                        wealth. In a few years the time for doing this will have passed. If we now
                        shall devote ourselves to money getting and neglect our children, how bitter
                        will be our remorse in after life, when we see those dearer to us than
                        life--those for whom we have toiled to accumulate worthless gold, go astray
                        in the paths of dissipation, ignorance and crime! How many will have
                        occasions as their end draws near, to exclaim, oh! that I could live my life
                        over again! How different my course would be! How I would spurn from me the
                        dress of this world, and secure for my children the treasures of knowledge
                        which cannot be squandered and which are the best safeguards of virtue! </p>
                    <p> In conclusion, we beg to suggest, that now is the time to commence
                        exertions. This is the best period of the year to make contracts and secure
                        lumber and other materials for building. If the work is commenced in the
                        spring the buildings can be erected and be ready  next September. Let
                        no time be lost. </p>

<b>The Stay Law</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In this article, the author attempts to alleviate the anxiety expressed by
                    most regarding the imminent expiration of the stay law. Most believe that when
                    the law expires, all debt will come immediately due. The author suggests that
                    things are not quite as bad as assumed. He outlines a simple plan of payment,
                    illustrating that many citizens are both creditors and debtors. Thus, payment of
                    one debt will provide the means for a creditor to pay his debts. The author
                    hopes that all express patience and confidence during the upcoming years,
                    further adding that abundant harvests, cattle and hogs will only increase the
                    regions prosperity.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have every reason to believe that the Stay Law will now be extended beyond
                        the 1st day of January next. Before that day, we confidently expect Virginia
                        will be restored to her rights in the Union. When that event is
                        accomplished, the new Constitution will go into full effect, and under the
                        terms of that instrument, the Legislature is prohibited from passing any
                        stay-law.</p>
                    <p>Debtors had, therefore, better commence their preparation to meet a trial
                        which now seems to be inevitable. That many persons will be forced into
                        insolvency, is certain. But we are so inclined to think, that the
                        consequences, to the public at large, will not be so disastrous as generally
                        imagined. When people hear that there are now unsatisfied judgments in our
                        Courts, to an amount exceeding half a million of dollars, they naturally
                        suppose that more than half a million of dollars will have to be raised by
                        forced sale, to satisfy them. We are persuaded that this is a mistake, and
                        that our people generally magnify the evil that is hanging over them. Almost
                        every creditor is also a debtor, and vice versa. The chain of indebtedness
                        runs through the whole community. Thus A. owes B. and B. owes C. and C. owes
                        D. and on through the alphabet down through Z. When therefore Z. sues Y.
                        --Y. sues X. and X. sues W. and so back to the beginning at A. Judgments are
                        obtained on all these debts, and the aggregate of the judgments, presents a
                        most formidable appearance. These judgments have hitherto been stayed, and
                        the whole community has been quaking with fear of the catastrophe that will
                        follow the expiration of the stay law. We are satisfied that the evil will
                        be much less than most people apprehend. We believe that instead of having
                        to raise half a million of dollars, by forced sales, one-tenth of that sum
                        will be sufficient to pay off the entire indebtedness.</p>
                    <p>This may, at first view, seem to be paradoxical. But it is, nevertheless,
                        true. And this is our explanation of the matter.</p>
                    <p>When the property of A. who stands at the top of the list, is sold, and the
                        money applied to the payment of his debt to B--that supplies B. the means of
                        paying C. who in turn will pay D. and so on, to the end of the alphabet and
                        this the whole will be wiped out. The expiration of the stay law will,
                        therefore, not bring such wide-spread ruin as most people fear. It will lead
                        to a general settlement and adjustment of the balances. Some debtors will be
                        broken up, as would be the case independently of stay laws. Others will be
                        pressed, and put to inconvenience, but the evil has been greatly
                        over-estimated.</p>
                    <p>There will be one counterbalancing benefit, which will outweigh many of the
                        evils of the termination of the stay law. It is the restoration of
                        confidence and better feeling between man and man. The feeling of
                        uncertainty which has pervaded the public mind has created distrust on the
                        part of the creditors. Men did not know what to depend on. A vague
                        apprehension of repudiation took possession of many. Others doubted the
                        solvency of debtors. These apprehensions caused hundreds of suits to be
                        brought, which otherwise, would not have been brought.--Creditors wished to
                        fix judgment liens on the lands of debtors, so as to render their debts
                        safe, and to be in a condition to enforce them upon short notice.</p>
                    <p>All fears of repudiation, and of the ultimate safety of debts, will now be
                        dispelled, and in a majority of cases--confidence will be established on a
                        firm basis. Creditors will know that the courts are always open to them, and
                        hence there will not be the same motive to press for payment. The good
                        feeling which has always characterized our people will prompt them in all
                        cases, where they can do it safely, to extend indulgence to debtors, who
                        honestly desire and are striving to pay.</p>
                    <p>There is one class of debtors, however, who need not expect, and who really
                        are not entitled to indulgence. It is that class who could have paid, but
                        would not; who having means to pay debts which their creditor needed,
                        refused to do so, and used the money in speculative enterprises. If such men
                        are now pressed, they must remember that they brought the pressure on
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>We hope, however, that an indulgent spirit will be practiced by creditors, as
                        far as may be practicable. They must remember, that wheat, flour, and the
                        other staples, are now bringing low prices, and that the corn crop has
                        almost entirely failed. Another year will make great changes in the
                        condition of our people. An abundant harvest next summer, and a full crop of
                        corn, with the fat cattle and hogs which may be expected, will furnish the
                        means of paying a large amount of debt. Providence has blessed us beyond our
                        deserts. Let us show our gratitude by forbearance.</p>

<b>The President's Message</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Summarizing a recent message from President Grant, the author gives a
                    somewhat mixed review. While he is happy the president wants Virginia restored
                    to its place in the Union, he laments the absence of general amnesty in the
                    message. Further, the author criticizes the president's literary style and
                    argument, saying it is disjointed, contradictory and generally unworthy of
                    American statesmanship.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The anxiously expected document was received too late for publication in this
                        issue, but will be spread before our readers in the next.</p>
                    <p>We are happy to say that its recommendations in regard to Virginia are
                        satisfactory. The President urges her immediate restoration to her rights as
                        a member of the Union, and the admission of her Senators and Representatives
                        to their seat in Congress.</p>
                    <p>We regret to perceive, however, that the President has not deemed it proper
                        to make any recommendation in regard to the removal of disabilities under
                        the 14th amendment. We had hoped, from some of his antecedents, that he
                        would have taken distinct and positive ground in favor of general amnesty.
                        But we confidently expect that Congress will, at an early day, give its
                        sanction to that measure of repose and conciliation.</p>
                    <p> The message is rather shorter than usual, and in some of its recommendations
                        is vague and obscure. While we have no disposition to criticize this
                        document we are constrained to say that it is deficient in logical
                        arrangement and devoid of literary merit. Upon the whole it falls greatly
                        below the ordinary level of American State Papers. It lacks the  and
                        the graces of style by which the message of the earlier Presidents were
                        distinguished. And in different paragraphs there are propositions which are
                        apparently antagonistic, in principle, to each other. It would seem, either
                        as if it has been written in different parcels, and at different times, or
                        by different persons, and that the detached parcels had been badly joined
                        together, and hence there is a want of harmony between the various parts. A
                        careful revision of the document, by a mature mind, with a free use of the
                        adage and the Jack-plane, would have been decidedly advisable.--But we
                        apprehend there is no such master mind in the Cabinet, and hence the
                        document goes to the country in a form which will reflect no credit on our
                        government. </p>
