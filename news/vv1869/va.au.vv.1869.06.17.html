<b>Conjuring Up a Ghost</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author describes a recent scene at the Court House in which Governor
                    Wells conjures up a "ghost" of a Confederate soldier to solicit evidence of his
                    fight for "equal rights." This article condemns the "pretty tricks" of this
                    political "magician" and suggests that he might be better served to discuss the
                    issues of the day.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gov. Wells has an oily tongue, and can conjure up ghosts as well as wheedle
                        the darkies into the belief that he and his companions are the best friends
                        they have in the world. In his speech in our Court House the other day,
                        among many other very pretty tricks, the expert magician raised the ghost of
                        a departed soldier, one of the "unknown dead," --buried away off in regions
                        unknown, beneath the flowery turf, and where no "critter" but the spirit of
                        solitude brooded. "Where did you come from?" asked the conjuror. "Virginia,"
                        answered the "spirit." "What regiment did you belong to?" "The noble 21st."
                        "What company?" "Company D." And then, concentrating all his powers, as if
                        he was going to hurl a thunder bolt at the head of the defunct, he asked the
                        stumping question, "And what were you fighting for?" The ghost, no doubt
                        scratched his head, for he was in a quandary--and answered, "Equal rights,"
                        then vanished into the air. Now what all this colloquy between the orator
                        and his ghostship had to do with the main questions of the day, we are at a
                        loss to know. Would it not have been better had the Governor made some
                        allusion to his chum, Dr. Harris--and endeavored to rebut the charge against
                        his friends of an intention of scratching the "Doctor's" name form the
                        ticket instead of conjuring up ghosts?</p>

<b>Negro Rule</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper argues that black suffrage is having a negative effect on
                    Washington, D. C., and serves as a warning to Virginia's whites of what will
                    happen if they do not reassert control.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Gazette, thus writes of the effects of the recent election in
                        Washington city. It is a foreshadowing of what will be the result in
                        Richmond and other cities in Virginia should the white population by their
                        supineness give the State over to the domination of the carpet-baggers and
                        negroes:</p>
                    <p>"The blighting effects of negro rule are already felt here. House after house
                        untenanted, the lengthy bulletins of real estate agents of property for
                        sale, and a depreciation in value of thirty-three per cent as compared with
                        the prices of last year indicate very clearly the result of negro
                        domination, and are but the precursors of evils yet to come. It is truly
                        said that it does not need any warning from any quarter to prevent people
                        seeking this town as a place of residence or business. They shun it now as
                        if it were infected."</p>

<b>Wells in Staunton</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Briefly summarizing speakers' points at a recent gathering in Staunton, the
                    author suggests that speeches made by Gov. Wells and his party bolstered
                    prospects for the conservative cause. Wells's words were met with little
                    enthusiasm, and Jenkins insulted the white audience members. One speaker implied
                    "Doctor" Harris had been virtually forced on the ticket to weaken their chances.
                    Overall, the meeting "aroused the people from their apathy." This suggests that
                    many see Wells and his cohorts going down in ruins sooner rather than later.<br>(Names in announcement:  John A. Harman)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Governor Wells, accompanied by his satellites, L.H. Chandler of Norfolk, and
                        Jno. W. Jenkins of Winchester, were severally introduced to the people of
                        Staunton by Major John A. Harman, at the Courthouse on Friday last. The
                        audience presented quite a motley appearance, the gallery being occupied by
                        the ebony and topaz clan and the lower floor by all sorts of whites,
                        conservatives, democrats, moderate republicans and scalawags. Many were
                        drawn thither for the purpose of seeing what kind of an animal Wells was,
                        and to hear what he has to say about his chum Doctor Harris. They were
                        disappointed in the last desire.</p>
                    <p>Major Harman made his speech, before the introduction, and some flattering
                        allusion to the col'd population elicited applause form the gallery, which
                        was met by faint hisses from the floor.--This brought out the remark that
                        "geese and snakes can hiss and so can puppies"--which surprised the audience
                        much, they not being aware that puppies had a hissing propensity. We among
                        others, regretted seeing Major Harman in the chair--however, every one to
                        his taste.</p>
                    <p>Wells address was listened to attentively; he made scarcely an allusion to
                        the questions at issue, and there was little or no enthusiasm even among the
                        colored people. Chandler is a good speaker. He alluded to Harris and stated
                        that his (Harris') name was smuggled on the ticket by low and underhanded
                        means, evidently with the intention of injuring Wells' chances--virtually
                        repudiating the "doctor."</p>
                    <p>Jenkins was quite rampant--he absolutely drove the respectable whites out of
                        the house, his remarks were insulting to his own race. It is the general
                        opinion that the visit of Wells and his party has done the conservative
                        cause much good, it has aroused the people from their apathy, and every man
                        has now become a workingman.</p>
