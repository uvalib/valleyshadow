<b>Symptoms</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article exposes the radical press's inflammatory accusations that the
                    "rebels have gained the day on Virginia." The author indicates that this is
                    merely a "symptom" of the Radical party's ultimate demise. As the Radicals grow
                    weaker and weaker, others in the country, many of whom are former enemies, are
                    working together in peace to ratify new state constitutions that are supported
                    by the large majority of citizens. Under the banner of "All Rights for All," the
                    author optimistically forecasts that all differences will soon be settled based
                    on universal amnesty and impartial suffrage.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The signs of the times indicate a rupture in the Republican organization,
                        and one, too, that bids fair to be permanent. The recent Virginia election
                        has caused much speculation in Washington; the ultra or Radical wing of the
                        party attributing the result to fraud, bribery and intimidation, while the
                        moderate republicans claim a victory over democracy, and rejoice in the
                        belief that the old State, by her vote endorses the administration of
                        President Grant. There is evidently a change in the tone of the leading
                        Republican journals; they yield more to the South than they did before the
                        election, and the ovations made in honor of Gov. Walker show that all
                        parties are pleased, save the greedy office-seekers and miserable extremists
                        who would crush out the last spark of Southern honor. The Washington Republican seems to have come to the conclusion to
                        throw the proscriptive element of its party overboard, as is shown in the
                        admission of an article into its columns which reflects severely on Mr.
                        Hughes, one of the editors of the State Journal.
                        The article alluded to contains the following. The "leading Confederate
                        notability" is General Floyd, into whose family Mr. Hughes married.</p>
                    <p> "The discomfited organ of the Wells proconsulate is endeavoring to console
                        itself in defeat by ungenerous flings at the rebel party; but it knows full
                        well that there is not a word of truth in what it says. The principle writer
                        for that paper is an able politician who is connected by marriage with a
                        leading Confederate notability, and was himself an original secessionist.
                        Now, he desires to make amends for his former errors by proscribing his
                        former friends, and carries his Radicalism so far as to talk of those pseudo
                        Republican organs, the Tribune and Times.</p>
                    <p> In the Republican "carpet baggers," "scalawags"
                        and "Union Leagues" are denounced in unmeasured terms. Witness the
                        following:</p>
                    <p> "There are newspapers in the North devoted to the proscriptive policy of the
                        Wells clique, who labor to persuade the public that the rebels have gained
                        the day in Virginia. Unfortunately, one of your
                            colleagues of the daily press in Washington is engaged upon this
                            ungenerous and vain attempt. The proscriptive faction of Wells
                        had strained every nerve to array the colored vote in a solid phalanx. By
                        means of their secret "Union Leagues" they had generally propagated the most
                        stupendous falsehoods and actually had the unparalleled cynicism to persuade
                        that ignorant race that if the rebels gained the day they would be reduced
                        to slavery again, and in other places that their children would be taken
                        from them and bound out until the age of 21.</p>
                    <p> Symptoms of disintegration at the Radical party are still more clearly shown
                        in other quarters. The nomination of General Rosecrans for Governor of Ohio
                        has staggered even the faithful and died in the wool; there is a rattling
                        among the dry-bones, and they begin to feel that the day of reckoning is at
                        hand. The Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Gazette says: </p>
                    <p>The party is falling to pieces from rottenness and weakness, despite the
                        efforts of the leaders to keep it together. A day or two ago a portion of
                        the Radical press characterized the Walker party in Virginia as the "Rebel
                        Democracy," and proposed to invoke a partizan Congress to exclude the State
                        from the Union, and place it again under military and carpet-bag rule. We
                        now find a Radical paper using words such as these:</p>
                    <p>"Governor Wells and his friends cannot fail to give
                            Governor Walker a cordial and unshrinking support. Personal
                        differences will vanish in the presence of the great good work that lies in
                        front of the Republican party." </p>
                    <p>The patriotic aspirations of the writer of the paragraph above quoted are
                        doomed to be thwarted. When oil and water mix freely and the lion lies down
                        with the lamb, we may expect to see the party which elected Governor Walker
                        assimilate with those who supported Wells. The paragraph is significant,
                        however, as showing the avidity with which drowning men catch at straws."</p>
                    <p> The tone of the N.Y. Tribune has also become more
                        dulcet since the result of the Virginia election has been made known. The
                        olive branch is tendered in an article on the closing up of the work. It
                        reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>"The President, as we stated yesterday, decided that Mississippi shall vote
                        on her new Constitution and elect new State Officers on the forth Tuesday in
                        November and it is intimated that a still later day will be designated for
                        the kindred election in Texas. It is well not to be too precipitate in so
                        grave a matter, whereof the result is "not for a day," but for "all time;"
                        yet we could have wished it expedient that each of these States should be
                        fully reconstructed before the 1st of December; so that the President might
                        announce the gratifying fact in his Annual Message, and urge Congress to do
                        promptly its part toward perfecting once more the circle of an unbroken
                        Union. Let us have no haste likely to mar the perfection of the work; but,
                        that secured, the earliest day on which Military rule can be replaced by
                        republican self-government in the States under the dominion of the sword, is
                        the best day for the States and for the Union.</p>
                    <p>The delay that has thus far been found necessary has proved a source of
                        healing. The unprecedented majority by which Virginia voted to resume her
                        place in the Union under a Constitution which guarantees All Rights to All,
                        bids fair to be paralleled in Mississippi and Texas. The latter has framed a
                        Constitution so generous and comprehensive that the ex-Rebels will nearly
                        all vote to ratify it; and everything we hear thence leads us to anticipate
                        the elections of General A.J. Hamilton (whom they warmly support) as
                        Governor by a large majority. Mississippi will doubtless be allowed like
                        opportunities with Virginia, and will vote to strike from the proposed
                        Constitution all prescriptive and disfranchising provisions by a large
                        majority. The people of both States are more than satisfied with the action
                        of Gen. Grant in the premises; and we are quite ready to settle all
                        outstanding differences on the broad basis of Universal Amnesty with
                        Impartial Suffrage. We shall be disappointed if we are doomed to wait till
                        Washington's next birthday to congratulate our country on her perfect
                        restoration to peace and loyalty on the comprehensive basis of All Rights
                        for All.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There was no small degree of excitement on the streets yesterday, caused by a
                        rumor that three negroes had been brought into town on the charge of arson,
                        rape and other high crimes. We immediately proceeded to obtain the
                        particulars of the case, and sound out that is was a very large crow story,
                        though, as the result proved, it ended in an important discovery.</p>
                    <p>It seems that three strange negroes were observed prowling about the
                        neighborhood of Deerfield in this county, and that some of their well
                        disposed and law loving race suspected they were not of the right stripe! so
                        they armed themselves with guns and pistols and went in pursuit of the
                        "suspicious" darkies, whom they arrested with some difficulty. One of the
                        fellows, McDowell, turned state's evidence and accused the other two of
                        having committed robbery and rape. The captors believing it to be an
                        important case brought their prisoners to Staunton, where they were safely
                        locked in George Harlan's hotel. On close questioning the arrested party
                        turned out to be Jim McDowell, Lee Morrison and William Alexander, the three
                        negroes who escaped from the jail in Lexington last week. McDowell told his
                        captors that he has arrested the other two, and was anxious to bring them to
                        justice for crimes with which he charged them. He is a pretty keen fellow,
                        but that dodge failed, as the self-appointed police believed that he was as
                        bad as the rest.</p>
                    <p>The colored men who made the arrest deserve much credit for their
                        perseverance.</p>
