<b>The Year 1869</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This optimistic welcome to the New Year stresses the importance of
                    sectional reconciliation. While this has clearly not happened yet, the author
                    hopes that the incoming Grant administration will continue to widen amnesty and
                    maintain their motto, "Let us have peace." This is an imperative for a country
                    that strives to return to the prosperity of the past.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> This is the first week of the New Year and it is nothing more than right
                        that we should quietly look into the events of the past year that we might
                        derive knowledge from our experiences and as a guide during the future. As
                        that able journal the Baltimore Sun remarks,
                        there are few men to whom the retrospect of a year can afford unvarying
                        satisfaction. Either calamities which were unavoidable, vacant places around
                        the hearth, or misfortunes resulting from their own errors of judgment and
                        wrong principles of action, checker the view which they take of the past.
                        There has been no path entirely free from nettles of some kind, yet they may
                        be converted into a wholesome medicine if those who suffer from them will
                        learn hereafter to avoid the causes of such of them as might have been
                        averted by proper circumspection, and to submit with fortitude and
                        resignation to those which were inevitable. Even where a survey of the past
                        year discloses an almost broken career of prosperity yet, as we pass this
                        important point of time, we are reminded to temper our exultation by the
                        reflection that all here is transient; that there are a thousand
                        contingencies in human life which admonish the most successful to
                        moderation, and that all, the fortunate and the miserable, are alike being
                        borne onward to the common poverty of the grave.</p>
                    <p>In regard to matters of material concern, if we have not cause for
                        congratulations in the restoration of union and harmony among the States,
                        there is not at least an absolute deprivation of all hope for the future in
                        the political events of last year. The gradual widening of the terms of
                        amnesty, in successive proclamations from the President, until at last it
                        has been made universal, indicates a subsidence in the flood of sectional
                        passions opened by the late war, which we trust may be permanent. The motto
                        of the incoming President is, "Let us have peace," and if his administration
                        is in accordance with that sentiment, the year upon which we have entered
                        may advance the nation far on its way to its former prosperity. The opening
                        year presents a good opportunity for this country to start anew in a career
                        of economy, cutting down extravagant expenditures, and avoiding the source
                        of them by discarding that policy of sectional hate and persecution which
                        engenders a state of things which is supposed to render necessary expensive
                        military establishments and appliances, as well as to foster corruption and
                        fraud. In addition to this, our eyes should be kept steadily fixed upon a
                        return in all branches of practical life to the old standards of business,
                        and we should adapt ourselves to getting back to the former basis of such
                        transactions, and the resumption of specie payments. If our legislators
                        return to the capital animated by the sentiments which the Christmas
                        holidays are so well fitted to inspire, and with the desire of improvement
                        and progress which is suggested to all by the recurrence of the day, we
                        shall have reason to wish to the country, as we do to all our readers and
                        friends, a happy new year.</p>

<b>The Recent Conference</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article briefly describes a conference of gentlemen in
                    Richmond pertaining to the manner in which Virginia will reenter the Union. He
                    suggests that these men were all in favor of reforming the bonds between North
                    and South, particularly to foster peace and prosperity for both sections. Yet,
                    while the author mentions that some of the terms of reunion--negro suffrage--are
                    inevitable, he reports that the conference in Richmond came to the conclusion
                    that black people were not "ready" for such a momentous undertaking as
                    government participation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The Dispatch says of the Conference:--We publish
                        to day the resolution adopted by the most recent conference of prominent
                        gentlemen of the State held at the Exchange Hotel in Richmond. The gentlemen
                        composing this conference, the most of whose names are appended to the paper
                        they adopted, were privately requested to meet here to consider the subject
                        of the manner of the readmission of Virginia into the Union. Agreeing as to
                        the object desired to be effected by the distinguished gentlemen who set the
                        movement on foot, (Mr. Stuart, of Augusta,) they readily complied with his
                        invitation. They came to confer; and while speaking more especially for
                        themselves, they did not hesitate to state their own impression as to the
                        opinions of their fellow-citizens. The representations of these gentlemen
                        are altogether reliable--while their proceedings were entirely frank,
                        unselfish, and patriotic. </p>
                    <p>The committee appointed by the conference is a good one. It certainly should
                        not provoke a feeling of suspicion or unkindness from the dominant party.
                        They are all frank and practical and patriotic gentlemen--as much devoted to
                        the restoration of national concord and prosperity as any man who lives
                        north of Mason and Dixon's line.</p>
                    <p>The paper prepared by these gentlemen is unobjectionable in its main
                        particulars to all persons who properly view the exigency in which we are
                        placed. Negro suffrage is plainly inevitable, and longer opposition would be
                        vain. While admitting this fact, the paper declares a truth in asserting
                        that the people of Virginia do not think the negro yet prepared for the
                        exercise of the franchise, and that it should not have been conferred on him
                        until he had opportunities and time to fit himself for this responsible
                        relation to the Government. This frank statement should entitle those who
                        make it to the general respect of the party in power. That party must know
                        that the people of Virginia entertain this opinion, and must place much more
                        trust in their professions when they boldly avow it than if they
                        hypocritically espoused the opposite opinion.</p>

<b>Extension of the Stay Law</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is a verbatim reproduction of General Schofield's General
                    orders No. 24, issued from Richmond in March 1868. The orders concern the
                    relationship between debtors and creditors especially when property is
                    concerned. It allows for hearings to commence that will determine the duration
                    of time a forced sale of property shall be suspended while financial
                    arrangements are worked out. The orders, which were initially set to expire on
                    January 1st, 1869, have been extended until July of the same year to allow for
                    further compromises to be negotiated.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the benefit of the "Valley Virginian," we give the following general
                        order extending the stay law, issued by General Stoneman:</p>
                    <p>Headquarters 1st Military District Sate of Va., Richmond, Va., December 22,
                        1868.--In view of the pecuniary distress and difficulties which must
                        necessarily ensue throughout this military district upon the termination of
                        the stay law on the first of January next, and in the absence of any
                        Legislature or body competent to devise the appropriate remedy, therefore,
                        it is ordered;</p>
                    <p>1. That the stay of executions against personal property, so far only as the
                        same exists under laws now in force, and which by the provisions thereof
                        expires on the said first day of January, 1869, shall be and is hereby
                        extended until the first day of July, 1869, and, if on or before the said
                        last named day the debtor shall have paid all the interest then due and
                        owing thereon, such execution shall be further stayed until the orders from
                        these or superior headquarters.</p>
                    <p>2. If, during the existence of this order, and debtor shall be eloigning any
                        property, which, but for the existence of this order, would be liable to
                        said execution, or shall dispose, or attempt to dispose of the same, to the
                        prejudice of his creditor, it shall be lawful and right for a creditor to
                        apply to any Circuit Court, or to any judge thereof in vacation, giving
                        reasonable notice of such application to the debtor, and said court or judge
                        thereof in vacation, upon the statement under oath of the parties, and such
                        legal evidence as they may adduce, may take an order to the clerk to issue
                        said execution for the entire debt, interest and cost, or else dismiss such
                        application, with costs to either party, as to the said court or judge shall
                        seem right.</p>
                    <p>3. General orders No. 24, March 12th, 1868, are hereby continued in force,
                        and the military commissions and circuit judges entrusted with their
                        execution are enjoined to observe and give effect to the same.</p>
                    <p>4. It is intended by this order that whilst affording relief to the debtor
                        not to impair the rights of the creditor, but to preserve and enforce the
                        same by subjecting the whole personal estate which is now exempt by the stay
                        law to the lien of the creditor's execution, and at the same time enforce a
                        prompt payment of a part of the debt, and an early payment of the remainder.</p>
                    <p> By command of General Stoneman. <br> S.F. Chalpin,<br>Assistant Adjutant
                        General</p>
                    <p>The following is General orders No. 24, of March 12th, 1868, referred to
                        above:</p>
                    <p> "Headquarters, 1st Military District, State of Va., Richmond, Va., March
                        12th, 1868.--Sale of property under deeds of trust, when every civil remedy
                        has been exhausted, will be suspended by the operation of this order in all
                        cases where such sale would result in a ruinous and unnecessary sacrifice of
                        property, or where the payment of interest when due, and of the principle in
                        a reasonable time, can be secured without such sacrifice; and also in cases
                        where such sale would leave a family of persons non
                            compos or infirm, without means of support.</p>
                    <p>"2. In any case coming within the above conditions the grantor may apply by
                        petition in writing in duplicate, under oath, to the military commissioner
                        or circuit judge having jurisdiction of the place in which the property
                        encumbered is located, setting forth a statement of all charges,
                        encumbrances or liens relating to the property, and the material facts
                        relied upon to support the petition. If the judge or commissioner be of
                        opinion that the facts set forth are sufficient to sustain the petition, he
                        will endorse such opinion on the duplicate petition, and cause one copy
                        thereof to be served upon the trustee; where upon the trustee shall suspend
                        the sale, and it shall remain suspended until the said opinion or
                        commissioner shall be withdrawn, or the grantor shall give his consent in
                        writing to its discharge, or an order shall be made by the commanding
                        general authorizing the sale.</p>
                    <p>"3. If it be demanded by the trustees or beneficiaries or other parties in
                        interest, the judge or commissioner will hear all parties by evidence and
                        counsel, and upon the facts as proved at such hearing will affirm or
                        withdraw his previous opinion, or suggest to the parties such terms of
                        compromise as to him shall seem equitable and just. But either party may
                        appeal from such final action of a judge or commissioner to the commanding
                        general, give notice of his appeal in writing to the judge or commissioner,
                        who will inform the other parties in interest, and in case of appeal by the
                        grantor or parties claiming under him, the sale shall remain suspended until
                        the decision of the commanding general is made known. All such appeals shall
                        be accompanied with a copy of the original petition, with the opinion of the
                        judge or commissioner, of the record of facts proved before him.</p>
                    <p>"4. Reasonable expenses for clerical labor connected with the hearing may be
                        directed to the judge or commissioner, to be paid by either or both parties,
                        as shall seem to him just. In case of appeal, the expenses of such clerical
                        work connected with the appeal shall be paid or secured by the applicant.</p>
                    <p>"5. It is the purpose of the commanding general hereafter as heretofore, not
                        to interfere with the operations of the State laws as administered by the
                        civil tribunals, except where the remedies thereby afforded are inadequate
                        to secure to individuals substantial justice. It is expected that, in
                        general, cases of the class referred to in this order will be settled by
                        mutual concession and compromise between the parties, in accordance with the
                        principles herein set forth, and that the orders of the commanding general
                        will be required only in an exceptional case</p>
                    <p>"By command of Brev. Maj. Gen. Schofield.<br>"S.F. Chalpin,<br>"Assistant
                        Adjutant General.</p>

                    enhance the money already put forward by Rockbridge County. Together, these
                    counties can greatly contribute to providing the means by which the region can
                    overcome the "difficulties" set before it.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. M. G. Harman)</blockquote>

                    <p>The following letter is from General R.E. Lee, to Col. M.G. Harman, President
                        of the Valley Railroad:</p>
                    <p>Lexington, Va., Dec. 18, 1868, <br>Dear Colonel:</p>
                    <p>I am glad to learn from your letter of the 15th, that the prospects for the
                        early construction of the railroad from Harrisonburg to Salem, are so
                        favorable. It is a work of great importance to the fertile region through
                        which it will pass. Besides enabling the farmer to send to market their
                        staple crops with greater ease and profit, it will render valuable many
                        products of the farm, orchard, and garden, which now, for want of proper
                        facilities, cannot reach a market, and in addition will greatly enhance the
                        value of the farm itself. It will also open the rich mining interests of the
                        upper part of the Valley, and will afford an avenue by which capital and
                        labor may be introduced for the development of manufactures. The almost
                        unanimous vote of Rockbridge county, to subscribe four hundred thousand
                        dollars to the road, proves the importance in the eyes of its citizens. If
                        the rich county of Augusta will give an equal sum, and the counties of
                        Roanoke and Botetourt each half that amount, it ought to inspire the early
                        construction of the road. Railroads have become essential to the growth and
                        prosperity of a country. Any section beyond their reach and influence is
                        looked upon as cut off from the rest of the community. They are a necessity
                        now as common roads were a generation ago.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the advantages which will flow from this railroad, when
                        completed, will more than compensate our people for all the money they may
                        spend in its construction, and will justify its energetic prosecution in the
                        face of all difficulties by which we are surrounded. The greater our
                        difficulties, the greater the necessity for continued effort to overcome
                        them. They are not insurmountable, and will surely yield before prudence and
                        energy.</p>
                    <p> With my earnest wishes for the speedy completion of the road, I am very
                        respectfully, and truly yours, R.E. Lee.<br> Col. M.G. Harman, President
                        Valley Railroad.</p>
