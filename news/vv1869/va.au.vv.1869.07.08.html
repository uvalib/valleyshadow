<b>The Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Having been absent for some time, the issue of the Valley railroad
                    reappears in this article compelling Virginians of Augusta County to subscribe
                    to the road. Discussion of this most momentous fundraising has been
                    overshadowed, says the author, because of the recent elections to the Federal
                    and State Legislatures. Now that that is over, adverse feelings can be put aside
                    and the issue of future prosperity can be once again addressed. As always, the
                    paper recommends support of the road's construction. Pointing out that the road
                    will connect the Valley to vital economic centers, the author urges subscription
                    for the sake of the region's future. Further, united work towards the road's
                    construction has the added benefit of possibly smoothing down some feathers
                    ruffled by the recent political contest.<br>

                    <p>Now that the strife and confusion of the campaign are over, and farmers,
                        mechanics and professional men have returned to their usual avocations, let
                        us hold calm and familiar communion with our readers as of old, and discuss
                        questions of importance to the prosperity of the State which has just passed
                        through a tremendous struggle for its existence as a member of the Federal
                        Union. We shall now see whether the men who have been chosen to represent us
                        in the National and State Legislatures, and who profess to be such warm
                        friends to the interests of the State, among which internal improvement
                        stands foremost, will adhere to their oft-repeated promises to build up new
                        structures, repair the old ones and smooth down the rough places which the
                        iron heel of war has made. We have a prospect of soon being freed from
                        military despotism; a rule which ever stops the progress of Improvement in
                        every branch; our social relations will be restored and with them confidence
                        between man and his fellow man.</p>
                    <p> The late uncertainty of our position has been one of the great causes of the
                        trouble in raising capital for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, and has
                        also had no little influence on the subscriptions to the Valley
                        Railroad.--The Baltimore Gazette, in an editorial
                        article of some length, says: </p>
                    <p>"So far, the principle subscriptions to the latter have been from the
                        counties and towns along the route, amounting, in the aggregate, to
                        $700,000. One of the conditions of the ordinance recently passed by our City
                        Council, voting aid to the road, was that this subscription should be
                        increased to $1,000,000, either by the municipal corporations themselves or
                        by their citizens, not an unreasonable demand for a road which will cost
                        nearly five millions, and which is to pass through a country now without
                        railway communication, for 113 miles, developing its resources, and in many
                        parts, at least doubling the value of property.</p>
                    <p>In addition to that there is to be a further stock subscription of
                        $1,200,000, after which the company, having a solid capital of $3,200,000,
                        including the subscription of Baltimore city for $1,000,000, has the
                        privilege of raising the balance of the required capital by the issue and
                        sale of its bonds. The question is, "where is this $1,200,000 to come from?
                        Is this road, which forms the great connecting link on the New Orleans
                        route, of sufficient importance to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to
                        warrant that company in making such an investment? Is it probable that its
                        effect upon the trade and prosperity of this city will be so marked that aid
                        can be expected form our capitalists? Is it likely that the benefits to be
                        derived by our Bremen Steamship Company from the opening of this road will
                        be so decided as to make it their interest to subscribe? Does the
                        development which will soon be given to the iron trade of the Valley, by the
                        introduction of coal from the Kanawha and the Cumberland regions promise to
                        afford sufficient attraction, for capitalists and to insure pecuniary aid to
                        this road on their part?</p>
                    <p>To all of these questions we unhesitatingly answer, yes! The Valley Road is,
                        for the country between Baltimore and New Orleans, simply a great national
                        road. It must eventually become, in all probability, the most important
                        branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Taking Winchester, as its
                        commencement, which virtually is, it passes through a region far more
                        fertile and destined to be, within a few years after the restoration of
                        political order, far more populous than any other district, of anything like
                        the same length, through which the main stem of any other branch of our
                        great road passes. It is a road which must not only sustain itself, by its
                        way traffic, but which by striking for distance and rich regions, must plant
                        its roots, in accordance with the great policy which has marked the whole of
                        Mr. Garrett's railroad career, in new and untouched soil. It must make
                        Baltimore the seaport for more grain and more tobacco and more cotton. It
                        must make it the most available point on the Atlantic coast for an immense
                        agricultural country. It must open up vast fields, uncultivated for want of
                        labor, to the German immigrants, who now crowd the steamships, which make
                        this their American harbor. It must tend to develop the exhaustless beds of
                        iron ore, which fill portions of the Valley of Virginia, and of which the
                        great fields of Pennsylvania, so terribly overworked, are said by geologists
                        to be but the outcroppings. Already large iron men from the North, looking
                        forward to future operations, have made purchase along and near the line of
                        the road, and the day will come when districts, now almost desolate, will be
                        alive with the blast of huge furnaces and the busy hum of men, and will
                        resound with the clanging stroke of the huge steam hammer.</p>
                    <p>Can anyone doubt for a moment what is going to be the effect of the building
                        of this road on the interests which we have referred to? Can anyone doubt as
                        to who would reap a rich reward from the subscription required? The city of
                        Baltimore, as far as the amount of its subscription is concerned, has acted
                        a liberal part, and it proposes to give its aid in a shape which will allow
                        it to be used as a credit. In other words, it authorizes the Company, so
                        soon as it is satisfied that the whole money can be procured, to make this,
                        together with other stock subscriptions, a second lien, thus allowing the
                        issue of the first mortgage bonds, and thereby virtually securing the
                        raising of money to complete the road, after the stock is once subscribed.</p>
                    <p>It remains now to be seen, where the other subscriptions are to come from.
                        The Valley of Virginia, still suffering from the effects of a disastrous
                        war, will do all that can be reasonably expected of it. The city of
                        Baltimore will do its part. If after this, parties who are most directly
                        interested will not come forward and take stock, and see that their money is
                        properly appropriated and economically expended, how can they expect to
                        secure the construction of the road? If they will not help themselves, have
                        they any right to ask assistance from other sources? We can only hope that
                        the restoration of civil order in Virginia will speedily remove the feeling
                        of distrust which has checked the operations of capitalists, and that the
                        required subscription will be before long an accomplished fact.</p>

                    <p>Much to the credit of Staunton, the election on Tuesday last, which everybody
                        presumed would be an exciting one, went off with perfect quiet. Good humor
                        seemed to prevail between the opposing parties--a stray joke now and then
                        would create a peal of laughter at the expense of one or the other, but no
                        harsh bickering or angry words were bandied.--The colored people also
                        behaved well, some of them, it is said, fought under the motto, "vote early
                        and vote often," and took passage on the excursion train of "Monkey Chunk
                        Railroad," but, otherwise they came up to the scratch. All this good order
                        is attributable to the closing of the bar-rooms, by which means King Whiskey
                        was perfectly powerless, and his agents Riot and Tumult had nothing to do.
