                    <p>Messrs. Peyton &amp;amp; Jordan are making extensive additions to the
                        Virginia Hotel, and enlarging their facilities for accommodating the
                        visitors and travelers who generally flock to the mountains in the summer
                        season. They are now erecting a building connected with the main Hotel by a
                        porch containing between 20 and 30 rooms, each with a fire place in it, and
                        to be lighted with gas. This will make the Virginia one of the most
                        commodious, as it is one of the best kept Hotels in the State.</p>
                    <p>The American Hotel, kept by our friend, S. B. Brown, Esq., is also undergoing
                        renovation and preparation is being made to meet the demands of the vast
                        patronage which finds its way here in the months now approaching. Staunton,
                        now, as she has always been is marked for the superiority of her hotels, and
                        the comfort which the wary traveler receives on arriving here and finding
                        such excellent accommodations.</p>

                    <p>Slavery in the Territories.</p>
                    <p>Freqent allusion is made, in the discussion of the question of Congressional
                        power over the Territories, to the action of the <emph rend="italic"
                        >people</emph> of New Mexico, through their Legislature, upon the subject of
                        slavery. A law was enacted, protecting the right of property in slaves, and
                        attaching severe penalties to the violation thereof. It is but just that the
                        history of the origin of that law should be made known, as we have on
                        several occasions seen the facts in the premises greatly distorted, and an
                        erroneous phase given to the circumstances which originated the Territorial
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The writer of this article was at the time of the passage of the law,
                        residing in New Mexico, discharging the duties of a Federal office.
                        Immediately after the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case,
                        we received a letter from a Missouri U. S. Senator, and one from the
                        delegate in Congress, and a like one was written by a Mississippi U. S.
                        Senator to the present Secretary of New Mexico, suggesting the propriety of
                        having passed by the Territorial Legislature a law for the protection of
                        slave property. It was argued that such Territorial action would be simply
                        in accordance with the Dred Scott decision, and giving practical application
                        to the principle it adjudicated. After considerable reflection and
                        consultation, the bill, which passed the Legislature with but one dissenting
                        voice, was drawn up, submitted to the assembly, and became a law.</p>
                    <p>It is well known that there are not over twenty negro slaves in the whole
                        Territory of New Mexico. The law, then, it is apparent, was created merely
                        to assert the principle which had been recognised [sic] by the highest
                        judicial tribunal known to the country. Its assertion was of no practical
                        benefit or pertinency to the <emph rend="italic">people</emph> of New
                        Mexico, for <emph rend="italic">they</emph> never had the question presented
                        to them. It was simply to show that the Territorial Legislature had the
                        power to pass such a law; and if the power to pass, then, also, to defeat
                        the bill. Hence, if it was deemed important by Senators to have a law passed
                        by the Territorial Legislature of New Mexico, conveying the idea of
                        protection to slave property, doe not this fact argue that the refusal to
                        pass such law would be considered tantamount to a want of protection? The
                        whole question reasoning logically and legitimately from the circumstances
                        of the case) of slavery in the Territory, is left to the will of the
                        Territorial Legislature, or the people. We are satisfied that the idea of
                        the Senator who addressed us on the subject was in accordance with this
                        conclusion, and that it was deemed an essential point, in order to
                        illustrate the practical effect of the Dred Scott decision, to have this law
                        prohibiting slavery, passed by the Legislature of New Mexico.</p>
                    <p>The converse of the action of the New Mexican Legislature was seen in the
                        passage of an act both in the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska unfriendly
                        to slavery. Here they legislated on the subject, exercising the same degree
                        of power, but for a different purpose than was used in New Mexico. In both
                        instances it was a practical declaration of <emph rend="italic"
                        >"Popular</emph> Sovereignty"--not <emph rend="italic">"Squatter</emph>
                        Sovereignty"--and an illustration of the doctrine of non intervention by
                        Congress. We so understood it at the time the New Mexican law was passed,
                        and it was so intended we should understand it by the Senators who
                        interested themselves in the matter--they seeking to give significance to
                        the theory embraced in the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
                    <p>We are well aware that with many persons a version is given to this question
                        of slavery in the Territories, and justified by a process of metaphysical
                        and theoretical argument at variance with the <emph rend="italic"
                        >practical</emph> view of it. It is not a difficult or laborious task to
                        mystify and confuse the mind by this mode of discussing the subject. But
                        this end, when attained, as it must be, sooner or later, is narrowed down to
                        one of two points--the <emph rend="italic">people of a Territory, if they
                            want slavery,will have it, and if they do not want it, they will not
                            have it.</emph> It is sheer folly to exhaust time and create dissension
                        in the ranks of the Democratic party, by a discussion of the abstract right
                        involved, for it is a plain proposition if the owner of a slave knows that a
                        majority of the people of a Territory are unfriendly to slavery, that slave
                        owner will not jeopard [sic] his property by placing it in an insecure
                        relation. Wherever slavery is profitable, there slavery will go, and where
                        it is not profitable, that principale of self interest which controls every
                        community, will not let it go. We have never given an abolitionist the
                        credit of being governed by conscientious principle in the advocacy of his
                        peculiar view on the subject of slavery. We believe, if it could be
                        demonstrated to the satisfaction of the people of New England, that their
                        manufactories could be operated five cents on the hand cheaper by employing
                        negro slave labor, than they can by white or free labor, there would be no
                        time lost in introducing this species of servitude into their midst. It was
                        only when the people of the North--bordering as they did on the ports where
                        the hordes of foreign immigrants landed--found that slave labor law was
                        unprofitable, that they sold their slaves and passed laws prohibiting the
                        existence of slavery among them. They did this as an act of economy, because
                        they were satisfied by mathematical certainty, that foreign white labor was
                        cheaper than negro slave labor. It was a practical question, and not
                        theoretical. It was a matter of dollars and cents, and not conscience; and
                        thus it will ever be. It may suit the purpose of noisy politicians to rant
                        about the abstract right of slaveholders in the common Territories, but when
                        the great <emph rend="italic">fact</emph> is to be approached, as to the
                            <emph rend="italic">existence</emph> or <emph rend="italic"
                            >non-existence</emph> of slavery, will pass laws protecting it; and if
                        they do not want it, they will pass no such laws, and this action will
                        decide the controversy; for slavery will go there or not, just in accordance
                        with the character of the legislation effecting it.</p>
                    <p>We believe slavery is the best condition for the negro--morally, socially and
                        politically; but if we were to ascertain that it was not pecuniarily
                        advantageous for us to own negroes, we would be far from retaining them. The
                        South does not maintain and foster slavery because of any moral
                        compunctions; nor does the North oppose it from any such considerations. It
                        is a question of finance, and the community which finds it profitable will
                        have it and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>We have given these views relative to the question of slavery in the
                        Territories, knowing that many of our own party will dissent from, and
                        endeavor to controvert them by a resort to metaphysical reasoning and
                        assumptions in theory. We have not, nor do we mean to treat the subject in a
                        hair splitting manner. We put the plain, practical interrogatory, "Will not
                        the <emph rend="italic">people</emph> of the Territory eventually decide
                        whether they will or will not have slavery?" If so, is not the whole range
                        of argument and thought touching upon the tangible practical issue, embraced
                        in the term "popular sovereignty"--the sovereignty of the people in
                        determining what local laws they will pass regulating their own domestic
                        institutions? </p>

                    <p>Virginia a Unit.</p>
                    <p>We presume there is no doubt of the vote of Virginia at Charleston being cast
                        as a unit. Such has been her universal policy, and it is this that has given
                        her the influence she has heretofore exercised in National Conventions.
                        Whether the vote be cast for Hunter, Wise, or some other Southern man, and
                        this it will be at first, let it be cast as a unit. And after that, should a
                        Southern man not be selected, let the vote be cast for that Northern man who
                        can best secure the triumph of the Democratic party in November next.</p>
