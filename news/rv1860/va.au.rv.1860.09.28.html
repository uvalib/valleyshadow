<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Directs readers' attention to the letter from "Long Glade," printed
                    elsewhere in the paper. The Vindicator agrees with Long Glade's position.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Persecution of Stephen A. Douglas</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to the article from the "New York Day Book" that attacked
                    Douglas (published in the previous issue of the Vindicator). It refutes the
                    charges that Douglas is in league with the Republicans.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Judicial Protection of Slavery in the Territories</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Seeks to elucidate the different positions of Breckinridge and Douglas on
                    the question of slavery in the Territories. Douglas supports judicial protection
                    of slavery, while Breckinridge asserts "an independent power in Congress to move
                    for the protection of slavery in the Territories." The Vindicator argues that
                    the latter position is very dangerous since Congress is dominated by
                    Republicans.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Discussion on Monday</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Col. J.W. Massie, Breckinridge elector for the 11th District debated with
                    Mr. Liggett, Douglas elector for the 11th District, in Staunton. Mr. Massie
                    stated that the candidates of the Bell and Everett party held views that were
                    "unsafe to the interests of the 'peculiar institution,' and should not receive
                    the support of the people of Virginia." After their debate, the Augusta
                    Democrats disagreed on the question of whether to support a single Electoral
                    ticket, which would give Virginia's electoral votes to the Democratic candidate
                    that received the largest popular vote.<br>(Names in announcement: Esq. M.G. Harman, Capt. W.S.H. Baylor, Capt. W.S. Abney,  T.J. Mobile, Col. John L. Peyton,  S.M. Yost)</blockquote>
<b>Breckinridge Club</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

<b>To the State Central Committee of the Douglas and Breckinridge Democratic
                    Party of Va.</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Jacob Baylor, a Breckinridge supporter, proposed that the two wings of the
                    Democratic party come to some agreement in order to defeat Bell and Everett. His
                    compromise calls for both Breckinridge and Douglas supporters to withdraw 15 of
                    the present electors and form a common electoral ticket. This ticket will give
                    the entire electoral vote of Virginia to whichever Democrat gains the most
                    popular votes.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>For the Vindicator</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Long Meadows" disagrees with the proposal put forward by Jacob Baylor for
                    a united Democratic electoral ticket. He argues that such a ticket could harm
                    Douglas because it would drive away "some of the conservative and devoted
                    friends of this Union." The Breckinridge supporters have caused the Democratic
                    party a great deal of trouble--"Long Meadows" argues that "They have sown to the
                    wind--now let them reap the whirlwind."<br>
