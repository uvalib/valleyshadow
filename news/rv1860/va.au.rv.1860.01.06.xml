                    <p>For the Vindicator</p>
                    <p>At a meeting held in the village of Mt. Solon, in Augusta county, Va., on the
                       <date value="1859-12-15"> 15th of December, 1859</date>:</p>
                    <p>On motion, Dr. James T. Clarke was called to the Chair and Geo. M. Miller
                        appointed Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The object of the meeting being briefly explained, the following preamble and
                        resolutions were submitted by Mr. Jno. A. Garrett and unanimously adopted by
                        those assembled:</p>
                    <p>WHERAS, the North, by repeated acts of aggression, contumely and oppression
                        exercised towards us, but more particularly by the late unparalleled outrage
                        enacted at Harper's Ferry by a murderous band of their fanatical emissaries,
                        has at length aroused us to a sense of the great wrong and injury we are
                        constantly sustaining at their hands; therefore,</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That mindful of former offenses, and in view of further aggression
                        upon the rights and liberties of the South, it is the duty of every
                        community to prepare to defend themselves, their families, and their
                        firesides, from similar invasions or further insult, in any way, shape or
                        form, at the hands of the North.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we, citizens of Mt. Solon, do forthwith proceed to organize a
                        volunteer company, to be called the ----------, to be composed of members
                        over the age of 17 years and under 50 years.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we petition to the Governor of this Commonwealth to provide us
                        with the necessary arms and accoutrements to equip said company, as soon as
                        we shall have obtained the requisite complement of members.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we view the late foray at Harper's Ferry, and its subsequent
                        developments, with unfeigned astonishment and the deepest indignation. That
                        the infamous treachery and ingratitude of the North has been fully revealed,
                        and it is full time that the South should manifest its displeasure in some
                        spirited and practical manner.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we heartily co-operate with the seal and enthusiasm manifested
                        by the different companies formed in this and other counties since the late
                        outrage, and most cordially commend the independent, vigilant and fearless
                        course pursued by our spirited and patriotic Governor towards its
                        perpetrators, their aiders, advisers and abettors.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That D. N. Van Lear, Geo. M. Miller and Jno. A. Garrett be and are
                        hereby appointed a Committee to obtain names of persons who wish to become
                        members of this company, and to draft the necessary Constitution and By-Laws
                        for the government of the same.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the Secretary transmit a copy of these proceedings to the
                        Staunton papers for publication.</p>
                    
                </transcript>
                <trailer>(Signed,) GEO. M. MILLER, Sec'y.</trailer>

                    finds it "on the whole a very respectable State paper." However, the editor
                    protests the "mild and light manner in which the Harper's Ferry raid is
                    treated."</summary>
