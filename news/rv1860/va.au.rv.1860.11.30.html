<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Virginia and South Carolina</p>
                    <p>The spirit of cringing subserviency to the behests of the Cotton States
                        manifested by a few of the Democratic press, is totally at variance with the
                        sentiments of the people of Virginia. We were much surprised, and no little
                        fretted at a suggestion in the Alexandria Sentinel a few days ago, to the
                        effect that the State should go to South Carolina, "apologise" for not
                        yielding to her proposition for a Southern Convention last Winter, and
                        implead her to counsel with us now.---The idea of Virginia apologising to
                        South Carolina or any other State for doing that which she believed to be
                        right, is a proposition so ridiculous in itself and so suggestive of a
                        spirit of conscious inferiority, that we can hardly think our able
                        contemporary meant that which his language conveys. We are one of those who
                        believe Virginia did what was precisely right in refusing a conference with
                        the Southern States on that particular occasion, and under those peculiar
                        circumstances. John Brown had invaded Virginia, violated her laws and
                        insulted her sovereignty. Virginia believed she could vindicate her violated
                        laws, and defend her honor by her own inherent agencies. While she treated
                        the commissioner South Carolina was pleased to send with the courtesy and
                        dignity due his mission, she respectfully declined the aid of her sister
                        States in that emergency, believing that she knew her rights and knowing
                        dared maintain them. This she did most triumphantly in bringing the chief
                        offender and his confederates to a speedy trial and a just and significant
                        punishment. John Brown and his party were hung, the violated law was
                        satisfied, and the honor of the State vindicated. Virginia then saw, as she
                        now sees, a remedy within the Union for the defense of her constitutional
                        rights and the maintenance of her sovereign character unimpaired. Whilst the
                        tender of South Carolina on that occasion was doubtless designed in the
                        spirit of sisterly affection, still we cannot dismiss from our mind that it
                        had the appearance of an insult, or of a covert attempt to take advantage of
                        the excited state of public sentiment to carry out her purposes of
                        dissolution. Virginia acted with that dignity, character and
                        self-reliance--that proud sense of self-reliance, which rises above the
                        craven sensation of danger when honor and right are at stake--which have
                        ever distinguished her. She would have been untrue to herself--false to her
                        sons, her honor and her history, had she listened to any offers of aid in
                        that hour of her trial. It seems to us, therefore, that any allusions
                        adverse to and condemnatory of the action of the State on that occasion are
                        unjust, and made without due reflection. It is enough for such outlawed and
                        revolutionary sheets as the Charleston Mercury to pour their streams of
                        foul-mouthed abuse on her, without the press within her own limits taunting
                        her with the insulting suggestion of apologising
                        to South Carolina! Shame on the thought.</p>
                    <p>South Carolina and her confederates of the Cotton States in their scheme of
                        precipitating a revolution, meet with but little sympathy in Virginia. In
                        her character as a Sovereign State, nothing, we believe, is farther from her
                        purpose than to affiliate and coalesce with them in their reckless and
                        criminal purpose to break up, without sufficient cause, this, the greatest
                        and best government the world has ever seen.</p>
