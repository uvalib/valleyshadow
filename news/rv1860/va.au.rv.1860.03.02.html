<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Non-Intercourse With the North.</p>
                    <p>There is a bill now pending before the Legislature of Virginia, which
                        provides for a special license to sell of a stated class of goods, seeking
                        to include in that class all the leading articles of consumption which may
                        be most profitably manufactured in this State or imported into it directly
                        from foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>In a most able speech, (which we regret very much our inability to publish in
                        the Vindicator,) delivered by Mr. James Barbour, of Culpeper, before the
                        House of Delegates on the 10th of February, the purpose and certain effects
                        of this bill are elaborately set forth.</p>
                    <p>In that speech we find some very interesting statistics, to some of which we
                        will briefly allude. It is stated, on the authority of reliable documents,
                        that the factories of Massachusetts alone give employment to 96,000 male
                        laborers and 69,000 female laborers; that the annual amount paid to these
                        laborers is $89,700,000, and that the annual value of the fabrics
                        manufactured is $150,000,000; almost the whole of which needs a home market,
                        and the most of which a Southern market. Now, the
                        first question which presents itself to every mind on consideration of these
                        facts, is, what would be the effect on Massachusetts were the market for the
                        proceeds of this immense amount of labor suddenly withdrawn? We do not
                        hesitate to assert that the whole industrial system of New England would be
                        completely prostituted if the Southern market should be closed against their
                        manufactures. And when those hundreds of thousands of laborers who receive
                        employment in the Northern factories--manufacturing fabrics for Southern
                        consumption--see the Southern market closed against Northern manufactures--
                        when they see trade prostrated, and their labor no longer needed--when they
                        begin to feel the effects of that fanaticism which has been the bane and
                        curse of this Union--they will commence to enquire, "why this war of
                        sections?" "why this intermeddling of the free States into the affairs of
                        the slave States?"--and the succeeding elections will register a terrible
                        and effective rebuke to the corrupt fanaticism which is hurrying the country
                        to the brink of destruction.</p>
                    <p>Again: The Auditor's report shows that Virginia alone affords a market for
                        the manufactures of the of the Northern States amounting to $40,000,000; and
                        history tells us that the closing of the ports of the United States against
                        the commerce of Great Britain, when that commerce only amounted to
                        sixty-five millions of dollars annually, prostrated the whole industrial
                        interests of England. It is legitimate to argue from this that the trade of
                        the North would receive an almost fatal blow by the closing of the market of
                        this State alone against her manufactures, even though the other Southern
                        States refused to co-operate with her in this most wise movement.</p>
                    <p>It is a fact beyond doubt that the trade of the North--in other words, that
                        the North--is at the mercy of the South; and if each of the Southern
                        Legislatures would pass some such prohibitory bill that as that now pending
                        before the Virginia Legislature, we would soon see the State Governments of
                        the North forced into a conservative policy by the suffering capitalists and
                        starving laborers of the free States.</p>
