<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our Position.</p>
                    <p>The present aspect of the Democratic party, split in twain as it is, and
                        presenting to the American people the unparalleled fact in its history of
                        having two candidates for the Presidency, is painful to every friend of the
                        old organization. But there is no time like that when clouds of adversity
                        hang thickly over us, so fitting for us firmly, decidedly and proudly to
                        stand forth in the support and defense of that which we deem to be right.
                        Friendship and devotion are but mockery and hypocrisy if they do not shine
                        the brighter when the hour of need arrives. If there is a principle, it is
                        worth fighting for, and the more determined and steady that contest is made,
                        in that proportion is its virtue developed.</p>
                    <p>Thus believing, we this week hoist the names of STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS, of
                        Illinois, and HERSCHEL V. JOHNSON, of Georgia, as our candidates for the
                        Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States, having been, in our
                        opinion, nominated by the regularly organized National Convention of the
                        Democratic party. Our devotion is to the party and not the men.</p>
                    <p>In taking this position we are actuated by a conscientious conviction, and a
                        sense of honor, which we hold to be sacred. To violate these would justly
                        subject us to the scorn and loathing of every honorable man, even though his
                        convictions of political duty were different from our own. And in the course
                        of this canvass we confidently expect to demonstrate, to every candid mind,
                        that we are right. We expect clearly to prove that the position assigned us
                        by the District Convention, held at Harrisonburg on the 9th of April last,
                        is that upon which our ticket stands, and which this District has
                        endorsed--not only this, but the position the States herself assumed through
                        the election of a majority of her delegates to Charleston--the position, in
                        fact, upon which the Democratic party of the United States stands by virtue
                        of solemn and honorable compact.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the questions which legitimately present themselves in this
                        canvass, we intend to be governed by a spirit of candor and fair dealing,
                        which is the natural off-spring of a conviction of right. We shall not
                        assail the motives of those of the Democratic party who now differ with us,
                        nor attack the character of the candidates of their choice. We mean
                        carefully to abstain from any line of animadversion which might lead to a
                        further breach in our ranks, or encourage and cultivate a feeling of
                        individual hostility. We will write our honest convictions, deduced from
                        fair and correct bases, in courteous and becoming terms, thus endeavoring to
                        perpetuate the kindly feelings which have existed between party friends with
                        whom we have stood shoulder to shoulder heretofore in crossing swords with a
                        common enemy. A more painful and sever task was never imposed by a sense of
                        duty, but we shall march to the work with a firm and steady step.</p>
                    <p>Having thus indicated the line of policy we shall pursue, it only remains for
                        us in this connection to tender most cheerfully to those of our Democratic
                        friends who may differ with us, the free use of the columns of the
                        Vindicator for fair and legitimate discussion. We want the whole Democratic
                        party to have a hearing, and publishing a Democratic paper, we will
                        cordially yield it as a medium through which those who desire to address the
                        public, can do so. We ask the same tolerance for our convictions and views
                        that we extend to others, and when the battle is fought and the victory won,
                        we will yield as quietly and as gracefully to the will of the majority as
                        any other man.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Suggestion</p>
                    <p>In the present distracted and divided condition of the Democratic party, any
                        plan, it seems to us, which can so harmonize its elements as to concentrate
                        them in the result, ought, as a matter of State pride and Democratic
                        devotion, to be adopted. The Alexandria Sentinel, in that spirit of
                        conciliation and conservatism which ever marks its counsels, has suggested
                        the principle of the true solution of the difficulty in the State. The
                        Rockingham Register has adopted it, as have other papers. We, ourselves,
                        receive the principle of a single Electoral Ticket, with the understanding
                        that if Douglas receives more Electoral votes outside of Virginia than
                        Breckinridge, the vote of Virginia be cast for him, and if Breckinridge
                        receives more Electoral votes outside of Virginia than Douglas, then the
                        vote be cast for him. This would secure the Electoral
                            vote of Virginia for a Democratic candidate for the Presidency.
                        This proposition it seems to us contains a simple solution of all the
                        difficulties which present themselves in Virginia, and will enable us,
                        instead of waging a fratricidal warfare, to direct our blows against a
                        common enemy. The destiny of the Virginia Democracy is the same--its efforts
                        should harmonize in the accomplishment of that destiny--and, if we should,
                        as we now do, differ as to the means to be employed, let us so control our
                        action that it may result in maintaining our Democratic ascendancy.</p>
