                    Charleston, the disunionists insisted that the nominee could only win when he

                    Charleston, they changed the rule in their "Bolters" conference. There, they
                    stated that the nominee had to receive two-thirds of the vote of the states
                    present and voting at the conference. The Enquirer criticizes them for this

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>State Convention.</p>
                    <p>The State Executive Committee met in Richmond on the evening of the 10th and
                        by a vote of five to four, determined to call a Convention to meet in Charlottesville on
                        the 16th of August. We look upon this step as the most unwise and suicidal,
                        and calculated to still widen the breach that already exists in the
                        Democratic party. The friends of Judge Douglas and the regular Democracy,
                        could not of course, think of going into a Convention, the object of whose
                        assembling is to commit them to the support of candidates who represent a
                        fragmentary and disorganizing portion of the Democratic party of Virginia.
                        In addition to this, it is perfectly apparent to the most partially informed
                        that a State Convention composed of the friends of the two Democratic
                        candidates for the Presidency, with passions inflamed as they are and will
                        continue to be, could result in no other way but strife, contention and
                        disruption. We never will go into a Convention with men in whose political
                        integrity we have no confidence.--The leaders of this movement we believe to
                        be composed in part of such men. We desire to unite on one electoral ticket,
                        but it must be done upon fair, equal and honorable terms. Otherwise, the
                        seceders must take the responsibility of defeating the Democratic party of
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>We dislike very much to differ with many of our personal and political
                        friends-- men who are too proud to resort to the subtle tricks of the
                        political tradesman--who scorn to vacillate for a temporary advantage, and
                        who esteem their convictions of right above place and preferment. Such we
                        found the friends of Gov. Wise to be both at Charleston and Baltimore, and
                        we would enter this contest with more satisfaction to ourself were we
                        fighting side by side with these men, to whom we could look with confidence
                        to stand firm in the right. But we will, we fear, have to be separated, for
                        the friends of Douglas and Johnson, and the National Democracy, will never,
                        never, submit to be dragooned and bucked and gagged by the tricksters and
                        wire-pullers who have of late years controlled the State Conventions of
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Had the Executive Committee fallen upon a plan of reconciliation such as we
                        suggested last week, we would cheerfully have agreed to it. But the majority
                        ignored all propositions tending to settle the difficulties in the party,
                        and nothing is left for us now to do, but to proceed at once to organize the
                        National Democracy, and marching forth in the right, to fight the battle
                        through, and either fall or triumph in defense of the honor and integrity of
                        the National Democratic party, and their candidates, DOUGLAS and
                    JOHNSON.</p>

                        introduced a new chapter into the Discipline upon the subject of slavery,
                        which is contrary to the civil laws of our country, and to the wishes of our
                        people in the border Conferences; and, whereas, other charges have signified
                        their unwillingness to submit to it, and have expressed a desire to hold a
                        Convention and take steps to separate from the Northern portion of the
                        Church: Therefore</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we, the official members of Augusta Circuit, hereby enter our
                        solemn protest against, and repudiate the sentiments in the new chapter,

                    <p>Rosolved, That we believe the time has come for us to separate from a church
                        which has now become thoroughly abolitionized.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we approve of holding a Convention previous to the next annual
