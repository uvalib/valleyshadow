                    <p>The Black Republican flag at Ocoquan, Prince William, has been cut down. It
                        took 50 or 100 gallant militia of that ancient county to accomplish the job.
                        The pole, it is true, was a defiant insult to the South, but is it not a far

                        to live in Virginia, than it is to raise a pole with a piece of canvas

                    <p>The Politicians and the People.</p>
                    <p>The politicians of the country who have undertaken to manage the great
                        Democratic party and introduce new tests of party fealty, will be taught a
                        lesson in the Presidential campaign which will prevent them hereafter from
                        assuming to act and think for those who are the real guardians of American
                        liberty--the American people. They will be taught that the Democratic creed
                        is limited by lines which cannot be transgressed at pleasure by the madness
                        of fanaticism or the hatred and jealousy of ambitious aspirants, and
                        unscrupulous office holders.--They will be taught, that public spoils and
                        public plunder, whilst they may govern the action and control the sentiments
                        of unworthy officials and policemen, have no power to influence the opinions
                        of the patriotic public.</p>
                    <p>That most miserable conjunction of Yankee excitability and administrative
                        power, introduced on the one hand for the purpose of precipitating a
                        revolution of the "cotton States," and, on the other, to serve the
                        vindictive malice of James Buchanan against his
                        superior in patriotism and intellect, will fall to pieces beneath the
                        rod of public indignation, and the Democratic numbers, free from the
                        contaminating influence of disunion furor or
                        political jugglery, will still bear aloft in triumph the banner of national
                        patriotism, every fold radiant with the light of liberty and hope.</p>
                    <p>The great Democratic party and this glorious Union will survive unharmed the
                        shock of fanatical assault and malicious revenge. The despotic reign of
                        Buchanan will come to an inglorious end, the desperate madness of William L.
                        Yancey will be broken against the walls of Southern conservatism, and the
                        fiendish schemes of Black Republican treason crushed beneath the power of
                        popular will, whilst fresh in its pristine beauty and purity as the
                        immutable principle of justice from which it springs, Democratic faith and Democratic
                        influence will continue to inspire the hearts and control the
                        destinies of the American people.</p>
                    <p>The reign and rule of trading politicians is over.
                        The people--the true depository of all power in a republican
                        government--will exercise their authority for the protection of free
                        institutions and their own safety by the triumphant election of STEPHEN A.
                        DOUGLAS to the Presidency.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Charlottesville Jeffersonian complained that people stop in Staunton
                    and eat dinner or spend the night when they ride the Central Railroad instead of
                    going to Charlottesville. The Vindicator chides them for complaining about

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Charlottesville Jeffersonian is trying to hatch a complaint against
                        Staunton, and takes as a pretext the fact that the passengers on the Central
                        Road dine at this place going west, and remain here all night going east,
                        greatly to the annoyance of the Hotel Keepers in Charlottesville. We are
                        surprised at Uncle Alec. Does he not know that Charlottesville is nothing
                        more than a respectable turn-out as compared with Staunton. Nature has done
                        more for the City of Staunton, than for the hamlet of Charlottesville,
                        located near the University. If Charlottesville were here and Staunton where
                        Charlottesville is, then this apparent favoritism would not strike our
                        friend so forcibly. Be charitable, friend, Alex. Dont "kick against the
                        pricks," for you cannot alter the nature of the case. The Central company
                        are doing the best they can, and it does not become our venerable
                        contemporary to complain.</p>
