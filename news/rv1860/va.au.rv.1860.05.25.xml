                <commentary>"The following letter was written in response to a call from the
                    citizens of Macon, Ga., for the views of Mr. Stephens in the present condition
                    of our political affairs. Its calm, clear able vindication of the doctrine of
                    non-intervention and consequent repudiation of the policy of changing the
                    platform of the Democratic party are very appropriate at this time. Hence we

                <summary>The Vindicator lays before its readers the address of the delegates who
                    withdrew from the Charleston Convention. The paper sees this address as
                    "evidence of a design on the part of a Senate caucus to attempt to stifle the
                    voice and suppress the thoughts of the people, by usurping the functions of the
                    Democratic National Convention." The document is reprinted in column 7.</summary>

                    <p>Chicago Convention.</p>
                    <p>The Chicago Convention brought its labors to a close on the 18th inst., by
                        the nomination of Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, as their candidate for the
                        Presidency, and Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, as the candidate for Vice
                        President. The first ballot stood: Seward 178, Lincoln 102, Bates 51,
                        Cameron 50, McLean 12, Wade S. Dayton 14. There being no choice, a second
                        ballot was had, as follows: Steward 184 1/2; Lincoln 181 1/2 - scattering
                        38. Whole number of votes 404; necessary to a choice 203. The third ballot
                        was then had, and a general stampede of all the forces opposed to Seward
                        took place in favor of Lincoln. It resulted, Lincoln 228; Seward 181.
                        Lincoln was therefore declared the nominee. The result is said to have been
                        brought about by the Pennsylvania friends of Cameron. Seward's friends were
                        much disappointed, and received the result with ill-concealed disgust. Those
                        opposed to Seward manifested the wildest enthusiasm at the announcement, and
                        Chicago, a few moments afterwards, was the scene of one continued outburst
                        of gladness and delight. Cannons were fired, bonfires lighted up and every
                        demonstration of excessive joy given.</p>
                    <p>Hannibal Hamlin, now U. S. Senator from Maine, was then nominated for Vice
                        President, on the second ballot, his principal competitor being Cassius M.
                        Clay, of Ky.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln is a Kentuckian by birth. He formerly acted with the old Whig
                        party, but upon its dissolution, became identified with the Black
                        Republicans. In 1858 he was chosen by that party as the opponent of Judge
                        Douglas for the Senate. After one of the most exciting and embittered
                        contests ever waged in this country, the friends of Mr. Douglas succeeded in
                        securing the election of a majority of the Legislature, and he was chosen U.
                        S. Senator.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hamlin up to 1854 acted with the Democratic party, but left that
                        organization on the Kansas-Nebraska question--he opposing the repeal of the
                        Missouri Compromise line. Since that time he has been fully associated with
                        the Black Republican party.</p>
                    <p>Taking this ticket in all its bearings we conceive it to be not only
                        plausible, but very formidable. Mr. Lincoln is a man of remarkable personal
                        popularity, and could not have been defeated in 1858 in Illinois by any
                        other man than Judge Douglas. His popularity extends throughout all the
                        Northwestern States, and unless the Baltimore Convention nominates Judge
                        Douglas, the sixty-six electoral votes of the Northwest will doubtless be
                        cast for Mr. Lincoln. As the condition of parties now stands, there is no
                        hope for the Democracy, save in the nomination of Judge Douglas. This we
                        conceive to be an evident fact. There is no use in trying to conceal it.
                        People may talk about one man saving the party, and hoot at the ideas as
                        much as they please, but to our mind there is no man now living who can save
                        the Democratic party at this time from defeat by the Black Republicans, but
                        Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. The plainer this matter is understood the
                        better. We either have to nominate Douglas at Baltimore, or Abraham Lincoln
                        will be the next President of the United States.</p>

                <summary>The Republican Convention, held at Chicago, nominated Abraham Lincoln and
                    Hannibal Hamlin. Lincoln is a formidable candidate, according to the Vindicator.
                    Only the nomination of Judge Douglas by the Democrats can prevent Lincoln's
                    election.</summary>

                    <p>Insurance Company.</p>
                    <p>While the public spirit of our citizens is aroused, we think it opportune to
                        suggest the expediency of forming an Insurance Company, both for life and
                        property, in this county. A large amount is paid out of this county annually
                        to Northern Corporations for the insurance of life and property, which could
                        just as well be retained among us. We merely throw out the suggestion at
                        this time for the consideration of our business men, with the promise,
                        hereafter to notice the idea more fully. Cannot the people of Augusta
                        organize an Insurance Company?</p>

                        immediately over their Confection Store. Ladies and Gentlemen will find
                        their room an agreeable resort in the evenings and during the day to partake
                        of Cream and Cake.</p>
                    <p>J. B. Antonio also has elegantly arranged his Saloon, and has also on hand

                        committals to jail, &amp;c. It was quite a busy day.</p>
                    <p>Two gentlemen took offense at each other, retired to a selected spot, pulled
                        off their coats, one knocked the other down six times, and then they walked
                        off and took a drink together. This was all done in a quiet way, there being
                        but one person present, and not five words passed between them.</p>
