				<head>The Relief Bill</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The bill for the relief of the citizens of Chambersburg who lost their
						property by the burning of the town on the 30th day of July, 1864, is now
						the law of the State. It appropriates $500,000 to be distributed <emph
							rend="italic">pro rata</emph> among the sufferers. The claims are to be
						adjudicated by three appraisers appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of
						Dauphin county, who are not to be residents of Franklin county, and who are
						allowed sixty days in which to perform the duties of their appointment. On
						the claims thus ascertained the distribution is to be made. The property of
						corporations such as the Court House, Franklin Hall and Bank building, is
						excluded from the benefits of the bill. All exorbitant claims, bearing on
						their face evidence of fraud, are to be rejected entirely by the board of
						appraisers. This is a just provision and should serve as a warning to
						persons who may feel disposed to augment their claims above that of their
							<emph rend="italic">actual</emph> loss. </p>
					<p>The bill passed the Senate on Wednesday last, and was signed by the Governor
						on Thursday morning. It had passed the House the week previous, as our
						readers are aware. We regret to say that some Senators who had promised to
						support the bill, grew weak in the knees before it was brought to a final
						vote. It is really surprising to find how little imbued with the spirit of
						justice some men are towards their fellows. This is a measure so
						pre-eminently just and right that it seems to us passing strange that <emph
							rend="italic">any</emph> man should hesitate for a moment of giving it
						support. Those Senators and Representatives who <emph rend="italic"
						>did</emph> stand by us in the hour of calamity and distress deserve well of
						this community, and their kind services in our behalf, we doubt not, will be
						ever gratefully remembered. </p>
					<p>Without disparaging in the least the services of other members of the
						Legislature who supported our cause, we think the gratitude of our people is
						especially due to the Hon. Heister Clymer, of Berks. He has nobly and
						manfully stood by as us through ever phase of this controversy. From first
						to last he was ever found faithfully and consistently by our side, giving
						his voice and the might of his great influence in favor of indemnity to the
						despoiled people of the border. On the final passage of this bill in the
						Senate last Wednesday, when Senators were giving various reasons for their
						votes, Mr. Clymer sent a thrill through every generous heart in the Senate
						chamber by uttering the following brief sentence, in his usual earnest,
						nervous tone of voice: "Mr. Speaker--I vote for this bill <emph
							rend="italic">because it is</emph> RIGHT." </p>
					<p>The following is the final vote on the bill in each House:</p>

				<head>The Situation</head>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt>"The course of the present Congress is a practical insult to every man who
					took up arms to defend the Federal Government during the last war."</excerpt>
				<transcript>
					<p>A Republican Senator in Congress remarked to us a few days ago, that he
						considered the county in a more critical situation now than the first year
						of the rebellion. His remark was based on the revolutionary course of the
						radicals, who are now striving to their utmost to effect an entire change in
						our Republican system of Government, and the great danger of a collision
						with the French on the Rio Grande frontier. A foreign war at this time would
						be most unfortunate. In a financial point of view we are not in a condition
						to go to war with anybody, and physically we are not much better off. For
						the present our people, at least those who would be of any service to us in
						the field, have had a surfeit of bloodshed, and care not to embark in war
						for some time to come. Again, Congress is doing al it can to alienate the
						South from us, when a little generous legislation would bind the Southern
						people to the Union with hooks of steel. Suppose a war with France should
						come, and two or three hundred thousand Frenchmen be landed in the South, in
						the midst of a population we are doing our best to make hostile to us, might
						we not find a wolf scratching out our own vitals?</p>
					<p>The course of the present congress is a practical insult to every man who
						took up arms to defend the Federal Government during the last war. That body
						announced that the war was only to be carried on to prevent a division of
						the Union. Now, when it is over, and the South are fairly on their knees
						begging to be restored to their suspended rights, Congress tells them that
						they are aliens--that the Union was divided notwithstanding the rebellion
						was put down, and that they are no longer in the Union. What an insult to
						the army! If the position of Congress be made the policy of the government
						it presents the strangest conditions of things the world ever saw. It
						ignores every pretended principle the war was fought for, and practically
						makes no point of contest the most stupendous lie ever invented. <emph
							rend="italic">The army thought, acted, fought upon and for, a
						lie.</emph> Congress is now trying to do by peaceful means, and by this we
						mean corrupt and unconstitutional legislation, what all the power of the
						South in four years of war failed to accomplish--divide the Union and change
						out whole system of government. Whether they can succeeded the people will
						determine. </p>
					<p>The government of the county is now controlled and managed by irresponsible
						and corrupt Committees. Stevens' Committee of fifteen is as much <emph
							rend="italic">Directory</emph> as that which had the control of France
						during part of her revolutionary period. Its birth had not even the
						respectability of Congress, if that body can now make anything respectable.
						It was begotten in a caucus, where the most important measures of government
						are now originated. The Rump Congress governs without the President. The
						Constitution makes him part of the legislative power of the government, but
						as he would be, a clog to the plans of the revolutionary Directory they get
						along without him. This may be a convenient arrangement for wicked men, but
						one whereby the country will suffer. The conspirators against the life of
						the nation desire to make everything pay tribute to New England and her
						ideas. </p>
					<p>One of their favorite projects is to turn over to the negro all the benefits
						of the war. He is suddenly to be clothed with all the privileges of American
						citizenship, without understanding more of its duties than an oyster knows
						of the fashions. But he is good enough to control white voters and place all
						power in the hands of the Directory. The greatest outrage of the century was
						giving the negroes of the District of Columbia the right to vote, against
						the <emph rend="italic">expressed</emph> will of the people. It violates the
						great American doctrine, that the will of the constituent should govern the
						representative. When Congress acts for the district the members are as much
						the representatives of its people as they are at other times of their
						immediate constituents in the States. This bill in relation to the District
						is only and opening wedge; it will soon be extended to the States, and negro
						suffrage will be crowded down the throats of the people wherever the
						authority of the Directory can reach. When this is done we will have a
						strong consolidation, instead of a republican form of government. </p>
					<p>Part of their plan is to amend the Constitution of the United States in such
						manner that it will not resemble in matter or form the instrument made by
						our fathers. It will be in a worse condition than the knife which had two
						new blades and three new handles. Seventy-one amendments have already been
						proposed, of which sixty-eight are to benefit the negro in some way or
						others. If they shall be adopted ours may well be called a black man's
						government. One of the changes is to give Congress entire political control
						over all the States, which makes them but provinces to the central power at
						Washington.</p>
					<p>There is but one thing that can save the country at this crisis--the firmness
						and honesty of Andrew Jackson. Let him throw himself into the breach and
						rescue the republic; then appeal to the people as did Andrew Jackson when he
						slew the money-headed monster, and our life upon it he will be sustained.
						The people of this country will never consent that the fruits of a war which
						was waged to save the Union, shall be used by bad men to destroy it.</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>In a debate in the Rump Senate, on the 23rd ult., upon the question of the
						extension of the powers of this Bureau, Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, said:</p>
					<p>"I shall enter into no computation of the cost which the country has already
						incurred in the support of that bureau. One thing we know, that hundreds of
						thousands of the negro race have been supported out of the Treasury of the
						United States, and the white people of this country are taxed to pay that
						expense. For the first time in the history of the country has the thing
						occurred that the great mass of the people have been taxed to support in
						idleness a class of people too lazy and too worthless to support themselves.
						Look around at these galleries at any time in the day, and you can see the
						beneficiaries of this bureau crowding your galleries and listening to the
						debates of this body. How many of the honest, hardworking white young men of
						this country are there who can afford to come to the city of Washington and
						sit day after day, week after week, and month after month, listening to your
						deliberations? They can not afford to do it; but, under the protective care
						of this Freedmen's bureau, your galleries can be crowded every day with
						negroes, listening to your deliberations, doing nothing to support
						themselves, but being supported out of the taxes levied upon the white
						people of the country."</p>

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>For the VALLEY SPIRIT,</p>
					<p>MESSERS. EDITORS:--Our citizens have all a right to congratulate themselves,
						for the generous favor done by our States Legislature in making an
						appropriation to the sufferers by the fire. "A friend in need is a friend
						indeed." Such to our poor burned up town has been the present Legislature.
						All thanks to every member of that body, who supported and sided in the
						passage of the Relief Bill.</p>
					<p>That our Bill is beyond all peradventure, a fixed fact, no one can doubt,
						and, for a dead certainty, each one of us can count upon pocketing, in a
						very short his pro portionate share. The Bill provides that the
						commissioners to adjust the claims, shall complete their work within sixty
						days. And as the commissioners will be appointed on the twenty-sixth inst.,
						we will in all probability, receive our money sometime during the month of
						April. Among other provisions in the Bill, there is one, to which we desire
						more especially, at this time, to call the attention of our citizens who
						claim some of the benefits thereof. It is that clause or provision, which
						refers to the manner of getting up, and preparing the bills of articles lost
						and destroyed; or rather to the safeguards and restrictions of the same,
						against those who might feel disposed to swell their claims above and beyond
						the actual losses. The provision reads as follows: "That if it shall be
						established that any person shall present a false statement in part or in
						whole for property either not possessed or not destroyed, or in excess of
						just valuation with the intent to defraud, the petition of such person shall
						be dismissed without any allowances whatever.</p>
