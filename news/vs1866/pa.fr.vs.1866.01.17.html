</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Much has been said by radical journals and radical politicians about the
						rebellious spirit which they say still exists in the South. And these
						charges are repeated over and over again in the face of the most
						indisputable testimony of their falsity. President Johnson says that the
						Southern people have done much better than under the circumstances "could
						reasonable have been expected;" and General Grant informs us that from his
						intercourse with leading Southern men he believes that the mass of the
						people have accepted the situation "in good faith." Evidence from such high
						and respectable sources we might reasonable suppose would be conclusive, but
						not so. Senator Sumner has a scrap-book, in which he has collected
						innumerable letters from a class of men, not natives to the South, but
						Yankees from New England who are just now prowling through the South for no
						good purpose, and when Senator Cowan no doubt truly denominates as "cotton
						thieves." The huge assertions of the creatures are set up against the
						official testimony of the President and Lieutenant General. [unclear] could
						surely go further.</p>
					<p>These charges and the [unclear] as to the temper and spirit of the Southern
						people, are circulated by the radical leaders, not because they believe them
						themselves, or have the good of the country at heart, but because they have
						a political purpose in view, to succeed in which it is necessary to deceive
						the county as to the true condition of things. They well know that the
						complete restoration of the Union will be certain political destruction to
						them and their party. Having been mainly instrumental in bringing the late
						terrible civil war upon the country, they are not yet satisfied with the
						ruin and desolation which they have already created. Their thirst for blood
						is not yet satisfied, their cry for vengeance not yet appeased. The horrors
						of the last four years they wish to see continue, in order that they and
						their party may continue to fatten on the spoils. Such is their insatiate
						lust for power, that rather than give up their hold they would be willing to
						see, not only the South, but the whole country sunk into irretrievable
						bankruptcy and ruin.</p>
					<p>The Southern people have thus far refused to gratify these bloody Jacobins by
						affording them an opportunity for more blood and spoliation, but, like
						sensible people, have accepted the situation in "good faith." They doubtless
						ardently desired to the South remain sullen and morose, their armies break
						up into guerrilla bands and carry on a desultory warfare for an indefinite
						period. And why? The reason is obvious. It would have afforded them an
						excellent pretext for putting in force their pet scheme for holding the
						lately rebellious States for years, under military rule as subjugated
						provinces, deprived of all political rights. Being disappointed by the
						cheerful acquiescence of the Southern people in the results of the war, they
						have resorted to falsehood to accomplish their purposes. A pretext they
						wanted and a pretext they must have. If the
						Southern people did not furnish it, it must be had through paid emissaries
						sent South to misrepresent the people. </p>
					<p>The grace and manly dignity with which the South met the final defeat of
						their arms commends itself to the enlightened judgment of mankind. After
						fighting with a bravory and heroism unequalled in the annals of warfare,
						when further resistance became hopeless, they surrendered to their fate with
						scarcely a murmur, and addressed themselves promptly and energetically to
						the work of reorganizing the suspended functions of their State governments
						with a view of a speedy restoration to the Federal Union. In this work their
						ablest and best men took a leading and conspicuous part. The people have
						become reconciled, and we might say gratified with the change. They have
						renewed their allegiance in good faith, and express and earnest desire for
						the speedy re-establishment of the old order of things, more firmly
						convinced than ever that their permanent safety and prosperity lies within
						the Union, and in a faithful obedience to the Constitution and laws of the
						country.</p>
					<p>We have no fears of the South when such men as Robert E. Lee, Joseph E.
						Johnson and Wade Hampton throw the weight of their mighty influence in favor
						of the permanent restoration of the former constitutional relations with the
						old Union, and against any and every species of violence and disorder. These
						men were among the most prominent and active participants in the rebellion,
						yet when defeat came they were among the first to frankly acknowledge the
						fact with all its consequences. But they did not stop here. They advised
						their followers to do likewise. And the present promising and hopeful aspect
						of Southern affairs, is greatly owing to the influence exerted in the right
						direction by men such as these. They fought bravely in defence of a cause
							they doubtless believed to be right.
						Distinguished as they were for skill and valor on the field of battle, their
						names derive a new lustre and their character a more brilliant hue from
						their noble and patriotic conduct in the hour of
						defeat. The names of Sumner, Stevens &amp; Co., will not stand as fair
						in history as theirs.</p>

<b>The President and the Partizans</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports from the Chicago Tribune and other Republican journals indicate
					that relations between the President and "his party" have reached a new low. The
					President, it appears, has suspended all Congressional nominations for office,
					in direct contrast to Republican expectations. To the article's author, the
					Republicans' astonishment seems strange since Johnson, as they well-knew, "was
					always a Democrat," and was selected by them precisely because of that fact.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Journal of Commerce</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Judging form the course pursued by the Chicago Tribune and some other organs of the Republicans, the situation of
						things at Washington is very hazy from heir point of view. The Chicago paper
						states that Mr. Johnson has issued orders to the various departments,
						suspending all appointments to office on the nomination of members of
						congress, and this is interpreted to mean that the President means to
						withhold official patronage from those who withhold support form his policy.
						Thereupon it is argued vehemently that the party which elected Mr. Johnson
						is entitled to the offices, that he his bound to give them to Republicans,
						that he is a traitor to the party if he do otherwise, and much more of the
						same sort. All which is arrant nonsense, of course. We have seen no
						indications, as yet, of any intention on the part of President Johnson to
						leave the Republicans. A single proof is enough, namely, that Mr. Stanton
						remains in office. If they leave him, that is quite another thing; but it is
						certainly true that he has rewarded with high office, quite recently, men
						who were active in carrying such States as new Jersey against the Democrats,
						and we have not heard of a solitary Democratic appointment made by him ,
						notwithstanding the vary earnest support given to his policy by Democratic
						conventions and speakers in all parts of the country. There is no need, as
						yet, of such frantic demonstrations on the part of the Chicago radicals. </p>
					<p>But if the President should pursue the course thus marked out by those who
						fear it, where is the ground of blame? This is a question worth asking, for
						it involves an inportant principle. There is no pretence that anything in
						the Baltimore platform, or in any former utterance of the Republican party,
						is isolated by the restoration policy of the President. What then? Why, this
						absurd and outrageous claim is put forward, namely, that a President elected
						by a party is bound to obey the will of that party in all new questions
						arising after his election. Could anything be more ridiculous? And yet this
						is the precise dogma now put forth by the Republican politicians in all
						parts of the country. They insist that an elected President must go with his
						party. if they want to introduce new social systems, if they want to tack on
						negro suffrage as a new plank in their party platform, if they want to
						insist on disunion except on conditions wholly undreamed of in 1864, they
						maintain that Mr. Johnson must follow their lead, accept and carry out all
						their new ideas, and be, in short, he mere machine of the party will for all
						purposes. When he sees the party drifting away from him, and refuses to
						follow them in their mad career, they charge him with treason to the party.
						If he declines to appoint crazy men to office they grow indignant. What a
						miserable automaton, or worse, what a tool of political gamblers, would a
						President become if this claim were allowed, and its practical results
						permitted!</p>
					<p>If Mr. Johnson were desirous of giving a broad hint to these gentlemen, he
						has the opportunity in the vacant collectorship of New York. The selection
						of a well-known Democrat, esteemed among our merchants, for that office,
						would be a sounding intimation that the President thought the Republicans
						deserting the platform of patriotism and the Democrats rallying to his
						support upon it. If that appointment to a vacant office operated as a bugle
						call to bring back those who are deserting, he would doubtless thereafter
						make his choice of officers among the Republicans who elected him. If they
						did not heed he call then [unclear] a few radicals, as a broader hint to
						opponents of his policy, say a Chicago postmaster and a Boston collector,
						and teach one or two more compleuous officers with his wand. Whenever he
						succeeded in bringing the Republicans to his standing place, as Union men,
						then he could give them offices and agenda to their content. But they are
						very [unclear] as the reward of electing him, whatever their course with
						regard to him now.</p>
					<p>The fact really is, that Mr. Johnson never was a member of their party, was
						always a Democrat, was selected by them because he was a Democrat, and,
						strange as it may appear, his policy is now closely and sincerely sustained
						by the entire strength of the Democratic party.</p>
					<p>Our advice to the partisans who are in such anxiety about offices is, to go
						back to Mr. Johnson, and take back the Republican party bodily with them, if
						they can. Now is the time. The Democrats, though sustaining his policy, do
						not adopt Mr. Johnson as in any sense their leader, nor will they so long as
						he retains Mr. Stanton and like men in office. But if the radicals are not
						wise in time, the President will be compelled to send Mr. Stanton et id omne genus adrift, and invite the cordial
						support of the Democracy. Then it will be too late for any hungry radical to
						save any share of the spoils.--</p>
