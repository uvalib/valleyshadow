<b>Nomination of Hon. J. McDowall Sharpe</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    J. McDowall Sharpe to represent the district in the upcoming Congressional

                    <p>The Democratic Conference for this District met at the Public House of John
                        McIlvain, in Fulton county, on Thursday last, and nominated for Congress our
                        talented townsmen, Hon. J. McDowell Sharpe, on the twenty-sixth ballot, as
                        will be seen by reference to the proceedings in another column. This
                        nomination will cause the true-hearted Democracy of the district to rejoice.
                        It will inspire them at once with confidence of success and renewed
                        enthusiasm in the good cause.</p>
                    <p>It is unnecessary for us to speak of the eminent abilities of Mr. Sharpe as a
                        lawyer and legislator--thee are well known to every man, woman and child in
                        this part of the State. His name is a very tower of strength and the
                        citizens of this county particularly will rally to his support, irrespective
                        of party, in a manner that will strike terror in the ranks of the foes of
                        the Republic. His triumphant election is already assured.</p>
                    <p>The conference was entirely harmonious and the members thereof parted in the
                        best humor, fully determined to go home and work until election day for the
                        success of the nominee.</p>
                    <p>General Coffroth was presented at the conference, and added greatly, by his
                        admirable social qualities, to the enjoyment and entertainment of the
                        delegation. Though defeated he vowed to work on faithfully for his
                        successful competitor as if he himself were the candidate.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In no other state, observes the editor, is the ascent of the
                    "Conservatives" into power of more importance than in Pennsylvania. Situated
                    midway between the North and the South, Pennsylvania's future prosperity is
                    dependent on the restoration of the Union, a prospect that appears to be a
                    distant possibility if left in the hands of the Republicans.<br>

                    <p>There is no State more deeply interested in the success of the Conservative
                        movement which, is now agitating the country than Pennsylvania. The Radicals
                        are openly hostile to all the best interests of this State. Their policy, if
                        engrafted upon the government, would act in direct opposition to the growth,
                        progress and development of the leading features which distinguish the
                        wealth and industry, trade, commerce and business of the Commonwealth.
                        Located as Pennsylvania is, between the North an South, and enriched with
                        natural products necessary for her neighbors on both sides, it is highly
                        important for her capitalists, merchants, manufacturers, and business men of
                        all classes, that the people should be a unit, and the States act together
                        in peace and harmony. Any policy calculated to widen the breach between that
                        unfortunately has divided the sections is hurtful to the interests of this
                        State, and the party supporting such a policy is a foe to her people and
                        their business hopes and prospects.</p>
                    <p>The Radical party of the country is simply a congregation of men bound
                        together by a hatred of democratic idea of government, and greed for
                        political honors and emoluments. Not one of their leaders has ever
                        enunciated a new idea that was not intended to degrade the States, enslave
                        the people, and change the form of our government from a republic to a
                        despotism. They are essentially sectional in al their aims and purposes. In
                        all the measures proposed by them this is the central idea. If a tariff is
                        to be adjusted, one section must be benefited at the expense of the balance
                        of the nation, and the same selfish principle forms the basis of all action
                        of this, now dominant faction. The whole country is never once considered.
                        The people of all the sections, as one people, are never legislated for or
                        thought of. The wise and statesmanlike platform of action adopted by the men
                        who framed this government, has been abandoned by the leaders of the
                        Radicals and they have substituted a theory at variance with the
                        Constitution. and a course of action the fruits of which can be seen in the
                        disordered state of affairs in the nation and the prostration of all the
                        material interests of the people. Sectionalism has ruled instead of the
                        broad, catholic ideas of the fathers of republicanism in the New World, and
                        efforts are now making to continue This course as the settled policy of the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic and Conservative elements of the nation are arrayed against
                        this suicidal attempt. The Convention which assembled in our city on the
                        14th of the present month is intended to consolidate all who are willing to
                        labor for the overthrow of Radicalism, and an immediate restoration of the
                        States to their proper constitutional relations with the general government.
                        Full delegations will be present from the Democratic and Conservative
                        parties of this State, and from all the States. Wise, prudent and patriotic
                        men will be commissioned to meet their brethren and consult together on the
                        affairs of the nation at this critical period of its existence. The starting
                        point in the coming political contest in this State will be that gathering
                        of patriots. Men long separated will then meet, and by word and deed inspire
                        the masses with fresh hope for the future. The nation will see light from
                        behind the dark cloud of sectional hate and partisan malice, and animated by
                        a returning desire for the old days of national unity, constitutional
                        protection, and individual freedom and prosperity, will engage in the
                        political battle with a spirit which must insure success.</p>
                    <p>As Pennsylvania has been foremost in her advocacy of a union of the people
                        for the sake of the Union, much will be expected of her in the coming fight.
                        No small or unworthy motives, no mean or personal considerations, must be
                        suffered to dampen the ardor or relax the efforts of a single man in the
                        approaching campaign.--The platform is an elevated one, and men must bring
                        up their aspirations to a level with the objects to be attained, the ends to
                        be achieved. As this State has so much to gain by a defeat of the Radicals,
                        so much to lose by a continuance in power of the faction which is ruling and
                        ruining the nation, her conservative people should determine to win in the
                        struggle which will take place in October. It is for the Union, and the
                        Constitution, and the prosperity of the whole nation, and this platform is
                        strong enough to hold all the patriots of the State and nation until victory
                        shall crown their efforts.--Age</p>

<b>The Radical Plot</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite the fact that the report on the recent riot in New Orleans failed
                    to expose "the infernal designs" of the Radicals who inaugurated it, the writer
                    strives to draw attention to the current state of affairs in the South. Across
                    the region, he reports, blacks have organized themselves into militias and are
                    drilling "under the very noses, if not with the direct connivance or approval,
                    of our military authorities."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It was to be hoped that the thorough sifting of the recent Radical riot at
                        New Orleans, and the exposure of the infernal designs of those who
                        inaugurated it, in and out of Congress, would not only have been more than
                        enough to open the eyes of our people to the dangers upon which we are
                        rapidly drifting, but would have so filled the plotters with dismay as to
                        make any further attempt of the kind impossible.</p>
                    <p>We are sorry to say that the tidings which daily reach us, through our
                        Southern exchanges, are by no means satisfactory in this particular. From
                        them we learn of an apparently well understood and organized arming and drilling of the black population, under
                        the very noses, if not with the direct connivance or approval, of our
                        military authorities located among them. The Richmond papers have, for
                        months past, teemed with complaints of this character, and yet the evil
                        seems to have been daily growing in magnitude and importance. They
                        distinctly charge that numbers of black men--sometimes as many as five
                        hundred--are in the habit of nightly meeting in the neighborhood of the
                        city, fully armed and regularly mustered and drilled; that these dangerous
                        and lawless military meetings are attended by white men, chiefly from the
                        North, who are conspicuous for nothing but their intense hatred toward
                        Southern whites that the negroes, emboldened by the possession of arms and
                        by the countenance they receive in responsible quarters, are daily becoming
                        most unruly and defiant in their demeanor; and that all these things are
                        occurring with the full knowledge, if not the approbation of Major General
                        Terry. </p>
                    <p>Now, we have a few pertinent questions to ask: For what purpose are these
                        negroes armed, mustered, and drilled? They do not belong to the militia;
                        they are of no legally organized and volunteer force; they are in no danger
                        from the whites. Why then, should they meet? why should white officers of
                        the federal army take any part in such proceedings? and where do the negroes
                        get their arms from? It is idle to talk of any necessity for such dangerous and revolutionary demonstrations, for
                        there is no city in the Union, of its size, which can show a more orderly,
                        peaceably disposed population than the City of Richmond. In proof of this we
                        have only to look at the records of her police courts during the past year. </p>
                    <p>There is but one explanation of this disgraceful manifestation of Radical
                        intervention in Richmond, and that it is, a willful purpose of goading the
                        people into such demonstrations of feeling as shall lead to the further
                        extension of military power and of Radical rule over them. Unable to make
                        them swerve one iota from the loyal position they have voluntarily and
                        honorably accepted as the result of their defeat, the Radicals hope, by
                        violently thrusting the negroes against them, and by subjecting them to
                        injuries and insolence beyond manhood to endure--by such diabolical means
                        they hope to lash the people into some furious act of self-defence. Will our
                        authorities at Washington permit these infernal machinations to continue?
                        Will they stand quietly by and see Radical emissaries of New England
                        deluging our Southern cities with blood--giving over the lives of innocent
                        women and children of our own race to the savage fury of an African mob, and
                        bringing home the horrors of St. Domingo to every Southern homestead? Major
                        General Terry should be at once required to show by what authority these
                        armed African vagabonds are parading nightly the streets of Richmond; and if
                        he either unable or unwilling to peremptorily stop their proceedings, his
                        place should be occupied by some other officer more capable of protecting
                        the lives and property of those under his control.</p>
                    <p>Although we are not aware that the blacks have yet entirely ceased their
                        unlawful gatherings, it is but fair to say that the following order was
                        recently promulgated:</p>
                    <p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VA.,</p>
                    <p>RICHMOND, Va., July 30, General Orders No 41.</p>
                    <p>Militarily organizations, or associations for the purpose of drill or
                        military instruction other than militia companies or regiments which have
                        been, or may be hereafter, organized by or under the authority of his
                        Excellency the Governor of this State, will not be permitted in this
                        department during the existence of martial law.</p>
                    <p>By order of Maj. Gen. A. H. TERRY. Official: Chas. H. Graves. A. A. G.</p>
                    <p>We earnestly hope that this is directed as much against the blacks as the whites,
                        and shall watch eagerly the working of this order. We are justified in
                        making this invidious allusion to his estimate of the two races, because it
                        was well known that while General Terry has permitted hundreds of these
                        armed Africans, for months past, to assemble and drill without any
                        molestation, any squad of only a dozen white, armed Southerners, meeting for
                        such a purpose would instantly have been dispersed as dangerous to the peace
                        of the community.--New York World. </p>

<b>Local and Personal--The Republican County Convention</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Recounts the proceedings of the Republican County Convention of August 7th,
                    which the article concedes had a large turnout.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. F. S. Stumbaugh,   Taylor,   McDowell, Maj. John L. Ritchie,   Detrich)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Stevens, Sumner and Philips men met in the Court House in this place, on
                        Tuesday the 7th inst., for the purpose of nominating a County ticket to be defeated at the coming election. The
                        attendance of the delegates was large, every district having been thoroughly
                        stirred up by the several candidates for the Court House offices. The
                        Convention appeared to be composed of a different set of men from those
                        usually attending on similar occasions. We failed to notice in the crowd the
                        twelve or fifteen old fellows with thatched polls, who formerly "ran the
                        machine" and but one solitary wig could be
                        observed ornamenting the head of our amiable friend from the Fayetteville
                        district. We were pleased to observe this evidence of an intention on part
                        of the party to discarded false hair and go it in
                        the future on the natural wool. </p>
                    <p>After the organization had been effected and some preliminary business
                        disposed of, a delegate moved to proceed to the nomination of a candidate
                        for Prothonotary and general nomination for that office were being made when
                        a delegate from Mont Alto Furnace--ex-Colonel of the 158th Regiment of
                        drafted men, broke in upon the order of business by moving that Col. F. S.
                        Stumbaugh be nominated for assembly by acclamation. The motion, although out
                        of order, was entertained by the president and the hero of Shiloh was
                        nominated accordingly. We noticed several delegates choking considerably but
                        they were compelled to swallow the dose, or raise a row, and they finally
                        gulped it down. This little dodge was prompted by an ex-Horse contractor,
                        who feared from mutterings in certain quarters, that thee would be an
                        attempt made to leave Frederick out in the cold, in consequence of the
                        obnoxious private legislation in which he engaged last session.</p>
                    <p>The nomination for Prothonotary was soon disposed of. The thing had been "set
                        up" by the politicians in town, and overboard went Taylor; kicked out as
                        remorsely as if here were not of the least consequence to the party.
                        McDowell had waited patiently for the place nine long years--McDowell must
                        have something and McDowell was placed in position to be slaughtered next
                        October.</p>
                    <p>Considerable of rupuss was raised in the Convention when nominating a
                        candidate for Clerk of the Courts. In addition to the candidates for that
                        office announced in the papers, the Mercersburg delegation presented the
                        name Maj. John L. Ritchie the nominations were closed and the call of
                        districts was being proceeded with, when a gentleman from Antrim objected to
                        Major Ritchie's being voted for he not having been previously a candidate,
                        and called upon the gentleman nominating him to withdraw his name which
                        modest request was peremptorily refused. After some time spent in caucusing,
                        the gentleman from Antrim moved that Major Ritchie's name be withdrawn which motion prevailed and the gallant Major was
                        summarily kicked out of the Convention. Mitchell with his crutches, and
                        Detrich with his armless sleeve, were soon made to walk the plank, and a
                        young able-bodied man got the position. </p>
                    <p>The balance of the ticket was nominated with but little difficulty and the
                        Convention adjourned, with the gloomy shadow of approaching defeat depicted
                        in the countenances of its members.</p>
                    <p>We cannot close without condoling with our Mercersburg friends. They
                        presented three candidates for the different offices, one of whom was kicked
                        out of the Convention, and the others badly beaten. Alas! How are the mighty
                        fallen! Mercersburg with its two hundred majority can no longer command the
                        nomination of one of its citizens for a little county office. How are you,
                        Gibraltar?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The August sessions of the several courts of this county commenced on Monday
                        last. The attendance of suitors, witnesses and spectators is very large, and
                        an immense amount of business will claim the attention of the court. The
                        cases on the criminal docket number 120--a greater number of which are suits
                        and cross-suits brought by "American citizens of African descent." So great
                        is the crowd of negroes about the doors and in the halls of the Court House
                        that ingress and egress is effected with difficulty. A delightful perfume
                        pervades the temple of justice, and "the coming man," swelling with the
                        prospect of his growing importance, struts and swaggers among the "white
                        trash" exhaling the sweet aroma peculiar to his nature and invoking
                        blessings upon the heads of his "loyal" friends. By all means give him the
                        right to vote! Up to the time of our going to press but few cases have been
                        tried. We will give a full report of the proceedings in our next.</p>
