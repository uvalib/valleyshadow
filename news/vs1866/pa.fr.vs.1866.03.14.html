<b>The Campaign</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After offering a warm review of the Democratic Convention held in
					Harrisburg on March 5th, the editor urges fellow Democrats to organize
					themselves since victory "will not be achieved if proper efforts are not made to
					secure it. The foes of free government must be met boldly on every stump."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Gubernatorial campaign has opened. The Democratic Convention which met at
						Harrisburg, on the 5th instant, did its work faithfully and well. The
						candidate presented and the platform adopted, meet the cordial approval of
						the entire Democracy of the States, and we feel assured will receive a
						responsive echo in the breast of every conservative, union-loving, citizen
						of whatever party. The resolutions adopted by the Convention are brief and
						pointed, setting forth in clear and concise language the faith of the
						Democratic party and leave no room for doubt or difference of
						interpretation.</p>
					<p>The candidate presented for the suffrages of the people--Hon. Hiester Clymer,
						is a gentleman of the highest personal worth, acknowledged ability, and
						untarnished integrity. His career in the Senate of the State during the past
						five years reflects the highest credit on his patriotism and devotion to the
						interests of the people. No spot of corruption stains his garments. The
						political hucksters who infest our legislature halls never dared to approach
						him with their infamous schemes, and if elected o the high position for
						which he has been named, we have every assurance that Public affairs will be
						directed with an ability, a statesmanship, and an honesty of purpose which
						will develop a new path of glory and prosperity to our noble old State.</p>
					<p>The platform and the candidate are both unexceptionable, in every respect, it
						therefore becomes the duty of the Democracy to go to work to secure their
						triumphant success at the polls. Let there be no delay in the work of
						organization, but organize at once. Victory ill not be achieved if proper
						efforts are not made to secure it. We must labor for it. We must go into the
						contest with our whole hearts and with a full determination to do our whole
						duty. The day of quiet campaigns has passed away.
						The situation of our beloved country is critical. Rebellion in arms, it is
						true, has been overthrown and lies prostrate in the dust, but a more
						dangerous enemy than even secession, is now actively at work--more dangerous
						because insiduously clothed in the garb of patriotism and "loyalty". The
						triumvirate--Stevens, Philips and Sumner, whom the President in his speech
						on the 22d of February, denominates as traitors, have obtained complete
						control of the Radical majority of Congress. They hold these false
						representatives of the people in their thrall, as the mere puppets to
						register the decrees of the infamous Committee of fifteen and obey the
						behests of their masters. Shall these things be? Shall the President be
						check-mated in his wise an conciliatory policy for the restoration of the
						Southern States, by these fanatical rule-or-rain enemies of a white man's
						government? Shall these men be permitted to change the government of our
						fathers--from a free Democratic Republic to a centralized despotism? Shall
						the rights of Sovereign States be entirely blotted out or held at the mere
						caprice of the central power? </p>
					<p>These are potent questions. Questions which are forcing themselves upon the
						people.</p>
					<p>The statesmanlike policy of Andrew Johnson commends itself to the support of
						every lover of his country--every true Democrat. He is entitled to the
						support of all such, in his efforts to restore the Union of these States
						under the Constitution handed down to us by Jefferson, Franklin and the
						fathers of the Republic. Strengthen his hands in his conflict with the fist
						of liberty. ORGANIZE, citizens, as once in every township and School
						District. The great questions of the day must be met on the arena of
						discussion. THERE MUST BE NO MORE QUIET CAMPAIGNS! The foes of free
						government must be met boldly on every stamp. Decrees and sound Democratic
						newspapers must be circulated. They are powerful engines of success, and
						they must be used with energy and pervasiveness.</p>
					<p>The campaign must be an aggressive one. We must charge home upon the
						enemy--change upon them their radicalities; their conspiracies against civil
						liberty. Bring to the recollection of an injured and insulted people, the
						outrages perpetrated upon them by Provost Marshals and other military
						satraps, instigated by partisan spite and personal malice.</p>
					<p>The campaign has opened. Every Democrat must go in to win. Let there be no
						accretion of hostilities; no truce; no resting upon our arms from now until
						victory perches upon our banners on the second Tuesday of October next. Let
						then every Democrat go to work for the success of his party--the party of
						the white man. Our country, an imperiled Constitution, a jeopardized Union
						and the very existence of civil liberty, all demand it. Let there be no
						delay but ORGANIZE a once.</p>

<b>The Platform of the Disunionists</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Commenting on the Republicans' platform, the article notes that divisions
					within the party's ranks were glossed over in an effort to minimize the chasm
					separating the two sides. This was done, it claims, to ensure the continued
					loyalty of conservative members of the party, who would surely bolt if the
					platform reflected the true spirit of the current leadership and its opposition
					to Johnson.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The platform of the Republican State Convention is a piece of mechanism which
						it behooves honest men to study well. It is a bundle of
						contradictions--contradictions so glaring that the people of Pennsylvania
						cannot be deceived by them. We have no doubt that the resolutions were drawn
						with the greatest care for the express purpose of bewildering the unthinking
						and verdant of the Republican party. The fact of a split between the leaders
						of the party and the President has become so well known, that it was feared
						some of the honest, conservative members of the party might be drawn off to
						the support of the Democratic candidate for Governor, as the true exponent
						of the President's Reconstruction policy. Hence it becomes necessary, while
						preparing a nateous pill for the President, to coat it with sugar so as to
						make it palatable to the President's friends. Open denunciations of the
						President would have alienated the constitution-loving men of the Republican
						party form the support of the Republican candidate. While, therefore, some
						of the leaders of that party would have preferred to make open war with the
						President, the more shrewd and wary counseled a seeming endorsement of the President to hood-wink the conservatives,
						and an enthusiastic encomium upon "the Union men in Congress" to excite the
						enthusiasm and stimulate the energies of the Radicals. </p>
					<p>We content ourselves to-day with a few remarks upon the upon the platform of
						our opponents, but shall no doubt have occasion to refer to it frequently
						during the progress of the campaign.</p>
					<p>The Convention in these resolutions compliments Andrew Johnson for the
						earnest words which he has uttered in denunciation of treason and
						traitors--for the loyalty which he exhibited throughout the rebellion, and
						they would have the unthinking believe by implications, that they are still
						his friends, but they fail to say a single, frank, open word of
						commendation, of his course since he has filled the Executive chair of the
						nation. His Reconstruction policy which is the great issue before the
						country to-day is not mentioned. They were afraid to condemn it openly--they were not inclined to
							endorse it. On the contrary they land to the skies the notion of
						"the Union members of Congress"--for what? Because under the lead of
						Thaddeus Stevens they have been attempting, as the President has so justly
						remarked, to subvert the liberties of the country. What folly to think that
						the people cannot see this deception! The masses of the people have good,
						plain common sense, and, to use the worn-out expression of the Senior of the
							Repository any "average fool" can see that
						there is an irrepressible conflict between "the Union men in Congress" and
						the President. There can be no blending of their hostile theories--there can
						be no compromise--either the President's view is right, or it is wrong. The
						States are either in the Union for all purposes, or they are out of it for
						all purposes. </p>
					<p>They, the friends of the President! The Lord save him from such friends. Why
						in the same platform they condemn the course of Senator Cowan, and request
						him to resign. Why? For what? In what has he offended? Because he is a
						supporter of the Constitution of the United States. Because he is the President's especial friend. Because rather
						than acknowledge the heresy of secession, under the lash of the Republican
						party whip, he chose to join the President an the true Constitution-loving
						men of the county in on grand, noble effort to restore and preserve the
						union of the States. Because he refused to renounce the dignity of his
						manhood and fall down and worship the negro God which the radicals have set
						up. Let not the conservative men of the country be deceived. NO MAN CAN BE A
						FRIEND OF ANDREW JOHNSON, AND DENOUNCE EDGAR A. COWAN.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We give below the resolutions adopted by the Democratic State Convention at
						its recent session and the speech of Hon. Hiester Clymer before that body.
						We commend them to the careful perusal of every conservative union-loving
						citizen of the State, in the full belief that the positions therein assumed
						will meet their entire approval and hearty endorsement at the ballot box.</p>
					<p>The Democracy of the Pennsylvania in Convention met, recognizing a crisis in
						the affairs of the republic, and esteeming the immediate restoration of the
						Union paramount to all other issues, do resolve</p>
					<p>First. That the states whereof the people were lately in rebellion, are
						integral parts of the Union, and are entitled to representation in Congress
						by men duly elected who bear true faith to the Constitution and laws and in
						order to vindicate the maxim that "taxation without representation" is
						tyranny, such representatives should be forthwith admitted.</p>
					<p>Second. That the faith of the republic is pledged to the payment of the
						national debt and Congress shall pass all laws necessary for that purpose.</p>
					<p>Third. That we owe obedience to the Constitution of the United States,
						including the amendment prohibiting slavery, and under its provision will
						accord those emancipated all their rights of person and property.</p>
					<p>Fourth. That each States has the exclusive right to regulate the
						qualification of its own citizens.</p>
					<p>Fifth. That the white race alone is entitled to the control of the government
						of the republic and we are unwilling to grant to negroes the right to vote.</p>
					<p>Sixth. That the bold enunciation of the principles of the Constitution and
						the policy of restoration contained in the recent annual and Freedmen's
						Bureau veto messages of President Johnson entitles him to the confidence and
						support of all who respect the Constitution and love their country.</p>
					<p>Seventh. That the nation owes to the brave men of our army and navy a debt of
						lasting gratitude for the heroic services in defense of the Constitution and
						the Union; and that while we cherish with a tender affection the memory of
						the fallen, we pledge to their widows and orphans the nation's care and
						protection.</p>
					<p>Eighth. That we urge upon Congress the duty of equalizing the bounties of our
						soldiers and sailors.</p>
					<p>
						Speech of Hon. Hiester Clymer.
					</p>
					<p>To you, my honored friend, Mr. President; to you, gentlemen of the
						Convention, and through you to the Democracy of Pennsylvania, I return my
						profound thanks for the honor you have done me. I feel that it comes laden
						with vast responsibilities; that to discharge them properly demands faith,
						courage, hope--firm reliance upon the enduring principles of our creed and
						unyielding devotion to the rights and liberties of the people. He who would
						lead you to success should stand unawed by the presence of usurped power;
						uninfluenced by the blandishments of patronage. He should be the stern
						advocate of civil liberty, the bold defender of constitutional right and
						privilege, the uncompromising opponent of official and legislative
						corruption, the hearty supporter of all that tends to promote the welfare
						and happiness of our whole people to develop the boundless resources of this
						State and advance her material and social prosperity. Then, too, he should
						stand the avowed and undoubted champion of the Union of these States, in its
						original purity, ready and willing, if need be, to sacrifice life itself, in
						defending it from the assaults of all enemies, be they Southern rebels or
						Northern disunionists, be they bad, bold men who have dared bare the sword
						and proclaim their treason by deeds, or the dastardly miscreants who, under
						the garb of loyalty and guise of friendship, would undermine and destroy it.</p>
					<p>These I humbly conceive should be among the elements in the composition of
						him who would lead you in the impending civil contest. I am painfully
						conscious of my own inability to approach this standard of personal and
						political excellence. But if the desire to do right may in some measure
						compensate for the lack of ability to achieve it, if a sincere purpose to be
						guided in every act by the supreme law of the land, and in all things to be
						governed by the views and teachings of the sainted heroes and patriots who
						framed it, may challenge the confidence and support of the good men of this
						Commonwealth, then to them and their verdict to I appeal with unshaken
						confidence; and through you, gentlemen of the Convention, who represent such
						goodly numbers of them, I make that appeal. Tell them I know no higher law
						than the Constitution, of which Jefferson and Madison were the founders,
						Jackson the defender, Webster the expounder, and of which Johnson is the
						upholder! Tell them that I know no other standard of political action than
						equal and exact justice to all, special privileges to none; that I have no
						other political creed than that given to us by Washington and Jefferson;
						that I believe in the social superiority and will ever maintain the
						political supremacy of the white race; that I worship at no political altar
						whose foundations are not based upon the sacred Union of these immortal
						States! Tell them in advance for me of its peril, and conjure them by the
						love of past memories, by the blood and carnage of our evil strife, by the
						dangers of the present, and by all the hopes of the future, to rally to the
						support of him, who in this crisis of our country's fate, by a mysterious
						Providence of God, has been entrusted with the helm of State! To them he has
						appealed in terms of patriotic devotion to his whole country. Above the wild
						storm of prejudice, fanaticism and treason now raging in the National
						Capital, clear and loud are heard the words of the First Andrew, re-echoed
						and defiantly re-asserted by the Second, "The Federal
							Union, it must be preserved!" They are the watchwords of
						political safety. They embody the holiest aspiration of every true patriot,
						and afford a platform broad and strong enough for good men of all parties,
						no matter how wide their differences of opinion may heretofore have been. </p>
					<p>Let us dedicate ourselves to this great purpose, with unselfish and unshaken
						faith, that its accomplishment will be its greatest reward. Let us go forth,
						bearing aloft the banner of our country, emblazoned with the words--"The
						Constitution," "The Federal Union!" Let us appeal to the whole people--from
						the Northern border to the Maryland line, from our inland sea to the
						Delaware--and if public virtue be not dead, if patriotism be not extinct, if
						devotion to principle still lives, if treason (thought intent it may be) is
						till abhorred, then indeed, in October next, will victory--thrice blessed
						victory--crown our efforts, bringing with it a constitution preserved, a
						Union restored, a land redeemed from the madness of folly which no threaten
						to destroy it.</p>
					<p>That is some measure I may be of assistance in producing such results, I
						humbly pray. Upon you, gentlemen, and those whom you represent, I shall lean
						for support and guidance, and appealing to the God of our fathers to prosper
						us in all our efforts for the redemption and salvation of our country, I may
						not doubt that triumphant success will surely crown our labors.

					<p>Gen Geary and the other candidates were then invited to address the

					<p>Mr. Marshall, of Pittsburg, was called upon. He said that he had met Gen.

					<p>Political Excitement--Meeting of the Democratic and Republican
						Conventions--Geary's Letter &amp;c.</p>
					<p>HARRISBURG, March 10, 1866</p>
					<p>This has truly been a week of excitement in this city. Convention of both the
						great political parties of the day assembled here to put in nomination
						candidates for the gubernatorial chair of Pennsylvania, bringing with them
						hundreds of political adherents whose business it was to urge upon the
						respective Conventions their particular favorites
						for nomination. The Hotels were crowded to overflowing, and landlords
						generally made a good thing of it. </p>
					<p>The Democratic Convention came off first in point of time, and, though
						largely attended by outsiders, was as orderly, harmonious and well-educated
						a Convention as ever assembled in the State. The utmost harmony and good
						feeling was manifested on every hand. Though there was no resort had to
						extraneous measures to get up an artificial or fictitious enthusiasm, a
						custom so extremely practiced by the Republican during the last five years
						and again attempted by them at their Convention this week, there was a
						deep-felt interest manifested by the many Democrats present from all parts
						of the States in the deliberations of the Convention, and an earnest
						enthusiasm springing up from the heart in behalf of the good old cause of
						Democracy, that showed most unmistakably that the party is awake o the
						living issues of the day and intend to prosecute the campaign this week
						inaugurated to a glorious and triumphant victory. Every one seemed to feel
						that the approaching political contest in Pennsylvania was greater in its
						consequences to the future welfare of the country than any that ever
						proceeded it --that it was a contest of right against wrong, of law against
						usurpation, of an administration of the Government on the principles of the
						Constitution, against the revolutionary and destructive measure of Thad
						Stevens' &amp; Co. Felling thus, the delegates to the Convention, the
						chosen representatives to the Democracy of the State, went to work like true
						men and patriots, as they were, laid down a platform of principles, brief,
						but to the point, recognizing the restoration of the Union of these States
						as the first great object to be desired by all true friends of the country,
						and placed thereon a man as candidate an standard bearer whose great
						abilities as a statesman and high private and personal character command the
						unbounded respect, not only of his own party but also that of his opponents.
						No man within the limits of this broad commonwealth enjoys a fairer fame, in
						all the attributes that go to make up a good and great man, than Hiester
						Clymer. Of such a man the Democracy may well feel proud. With such a
						candidate, standing on a platform of undying principles such as were
						unanimously passed by the Convention, their complete and overwhelming
						success on the second Tuesday of October next is already assured.</p>
					<p>The discord in the Republican Convention two days later was in striking
						contrast with the harmony and good feeling which characterized the
						deliberations of the Democratic Convention. The fight commenced early on
						Tuesday morning, the day before the Convention met, in skirmished on the
						streets and in the hotels between the Geary men and Ketchum men, resulting
						in numerous bloody noses and bruised heads. A motley crowd of roughs and
						bruisers from Philabelphia had been brought here by Geary and his friends to
						show through their loud talking and fighting propensities superinduced by
						the free indulgence in the use of bad whiskey, how immensely popular he was
						with the masses. That all this fuss and clamor was paid for, the
						unsuspecting delegates from the rural districts, of course were supposed not
						to know anything about. The Ketchum forces were led by such men as A. K.
						McClure, of Franklin, and Wm. B. Mann, of Philadelphia. They made a vigorous
						but unsuccessful charge on the Geary forces on Tuesday afternoon, by
						scattering the following letter of Gen Geary to Samuel Maguire, Esq., in
						printed slips through the city by the thousand. This was to prove that he
						could not be trusted as a Republican, having no later than lust August
						claimed to be a "life-long Democrat, without a prefix or an affix." Here is
						the letter as circulated by the Ketchum men:</p>
					<p>GEN. GEARY'S LETTER.</p>
					<p>
						To S. Maguire, Esq., a leading Copperhead of
							Philadelphia, who wrote to him to know if he would accept a nomination
							from the Democratic party.
					</p>
					<p>His fidelity to party is such that he can conscientiously accept a nomination: for
						Governor from that party. </p>
					<p>His following the flag has not caused any entanglements inconsistent with
						fidelity to the Democratic party.</p>
					<p>NEW CUMBERLAND, CUMB. CO., PA.,</p>
					<p>August 14, 1865.</p>
					<p>S---- M----, Esq.,--Dear sir:- Having been absent
						and just returned, I have the honor to find your two letters, viz: That of
						the 26th ult. Covering your excellent letter of S---- J----, and that of the
						3d inst. from Conneisville. The subject matter of both, and the letter
						enclosed, has been carefully noted, and for the fraternal manner of its
						presentation I feel deeply indebted to you. </p>
					<p>I feel assured you will bear me testimony, that I have never personally
						aspired to the honor of the Chief Magistracy of the State of Pennsylvania
						for which position you have the kindness to indicate my name; and, further,
						that when it has been a subject of conversation, that I have instinctively
						shrunk from the responsibilities it involves upon its possessor. I have
						never been an aspirant for that honorable position. I never have, directly
						or indirectly, given my consent to any person or party to use my name for i.
						Therefore, I am perfectly free from any entangling
							alliances on the subject, and frankly say to you, that if the
						nomination and election were laid at my feel, I would still feel my
						inability to fill so high a position with that exalted capacity and
						sparkling intellect which is so eminently desired in the Executive chair.
							Impressed with the considerations to which I have
							just glanced, to which I may super-add, the WEALTH with which it seems
							necessary for the candidate to possess is not mine, I must, therefore,
							AT PRESENT decline to be considered a candidate.</p>
					<p>I have been a life-long Democrat, and I am still a Democrat in the truest and
						most ample construction of the word and meaning of the term, without any
						prefix or affix whatever, maintaining all the immutable truths which
						underlie the superstructure of our form of Government, in all their length
						and breadth, heighth and depth--not as mere abstractions, but as active and
						positive vitalities, invigorated by the greatest intensity of patriotism.</p>
					<p>Again thanking you for your many kind expressions, I have the honor to be

					<p>P. S. Enclosed is Mr. Jenkins letter. Come and see me soon.</p>
					<p>There is no doubt of the genuineness of the above letter, as any number of
						witnesses could be produced, if necessary, who saw the original in
						manuscript, and who will swear to is being a correct copy. But in this case
						it would not answer its purpose. The old Winnebago Chief, Simon Cameron, had
						the Convention too well packed and set up, for Ketchum, McClure &amp;
						Co., to carry, even with so powerful a weapon as the above letter. Early on
						Tuesday evening they gave up the contest as hopeless and virtually abandoned
						the field. The friends of Ketchum were exceedingly bitter towards Geary, and
						many of them went home declaring their purpose openly to vote for Clymer.</p>
					<p>The Convention from all accounts was as discordant inside as the preliminary
						contest outside, but not being in the convention during its sittings, I am
						unable to give you a correct report of its doings and I shall therefore not
						attempt it. But of one thing you may rest assured, that the doom of the
						Republican party is sealed. It is hopelessly demoralized and cannot survive
						the crushing defeat it is destined to receive at the next election.</p>

					<p>HARRISBURG, Feb. 28.</p>
					<p>Arrangements are being made through the exertions of Gov. Curtin for the
						visit to Harrisburg, while the Legislature is in session, of two of the
						schools for orphan children established by the State. The object is to show
						the members to good use of which the appropriation are applied, and the
						manner in which the children are clothed, maintained and educated.</p>
					<p>Pennsylvania is the only State thus far which has actually assumed the care
						of the children of her dead soldiers, and two thousand of these are now in
						the schools. They are distributed among the following institutions;
						Bridesburg, Germantown and Northern Homes, St. John and Pittsburg Catholic
						Home, Allegheny Home for Friendless and Allegheny Orphans Home, Pittsburgh
						Church Home, Lancaster Children's Home and Orphans Aylum, Loysville, (Perry
						county) School, Eman's Orphan Home and York Children's Home. The cost per
						pupil is about $150 per annum (exclusive of clothing). The children receive
						the religious training of their parents, are uniformly clothed, and
						physically exercised in a manner most conducive to health.</p>
					<p>Governor Curtin, who has originated and perfected the entire scheme, in his
						last annual message recommended an appropriation to sustain the schools, and
						this the Legislature will, of course grant on the principle that the honor
						of the commonwealth is pledged to continue an appropriation which is "to
						bless the little ones, provide them with the comfortable homes, instead of
						leaving them in want and destitution, to fall victims to vice and
					crime."</p>
