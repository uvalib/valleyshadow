<b>Reports From The Departments</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contains copies of the annual reports submitted by the members
                    of the President's Cabinet, including the Secretary of War.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Report of General Commanding Army. Since the report of 1865 the volunteer
                        force has been almost entirely replaced by the regular army. It is necessary
                        to keep a military force in all the lately rebellious States to protect life
                        and property against those who acknowledge no law but force, but this class
                        is much smaller than could have been expected after such a conflict; and the
                        condition f the South at present warrants the hope that the troops may soon
                        be spared for the Territories.</p>
                    <p>With the expiration of the rebellion, Indian hostilities have diminished.
                        With a frontier constantly extending and encroaching upon the hunting
                        grounds of the Indian, hostilities, opposition at least, frequently occur.
                        To meet this, and to protect the emigrant on his way to the mountain
                        territories, troops have been distributed to give the best protection with
                        the means at hand. Few places are occupied by more than two, and many by but
                        a single company. These troops are generally badly sheltered, and are
                        supplied at great cost.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Grant suggests for the consideration of Congress the propriety of
                        transferring the Indian Bureau from the Interior to the War Department, and
                        the abolition of Indian agencies, with the exception of a limited number of
                        inspectors. The reason for this change seems to me both obvious and
                        satisfactory. It would result in greater economy of expenditure, and
                        diminution of conflict between the Indian and white races.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Gen. Sherman, in his report as Commander of the Division of the
                        Missouri, gives interesting details of the management of the hostile Indian
                        tribes in the Far West.</p>
                    <p>Major General pope says in his report from Fort Union, New Mexico, that all
                        of the powerful and populous tribes which once inhabited the northwest, but
                        a few hundreds of hopeless stragglers remain.--Of the history of the white
                        settlers, the pioneers of emigration in the great States of the Northwest,
                        it is unnecessary to speak. Such a record of nameless horrors, of gross
                        inhumanity to whites and Indians, and of lavish and wasteful expenditure of
                        public money cannot at this day be read without astonishment and
                        indignation. Such a process of extermination of both Indians and white men
                        has never before been permitted to go on under the eyes of a Christian
                        people, and it will long remain a reproach to this Government. Feeble, worn
                        out and dispirited as we find them to-day, these wretched remnants of the
                        powerful tribes once famous in our history cannot yet be left in peace. Some
                        of them have already been removed to the Indian country west of Arkansas,
                        and the remainder will soon follow, and it is hoped that they may be there
                        permitted to die in peace and their names and tribe be forgotten. It is
                        recommended that the Indians be removed to some reservation where they can
                        be humanely provided for.</p>
                    <p>Major General Halleck, commanding the Division of the Pacific, reports that
                        the Indian hostilities have been mostly confined to that portion of Oregon
                        and Idaho surrounding the valley of Mauler Lake. Hostilities will not
                        entirely cease till these Indians are killed or captured.</p>
                    <p>In Northwestern California the Indians have been generally quiet, and the
                        posts at Camps Wright, Gaston, and Lincoln, are kept up on account of the
                        Indian reservations in the vicinity of each.</p>
                    <p>The District of Southern California was discontinued last March. The post at
                        San Diego has been broken up, and that at Drum barracks and Wilmington
                        depot, on the execution of orders recently issued, will be reduced to a
                        regimental quartermaster and a squad of fifteen men.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Gen. Meade reports the details of his seizure of Fenian arms and
                        equipments at Eastport and elsewhere, and of his visit to points whence
                        invasions of Canada were suspected.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Gen. Sheridan, commanding Department of the Gulf, gives particulars of
                        his command, the principal points of which are already known.</p>
                    <p>Maj. Gen. G. H. Thomas, commanding Department of the Tennessee, gives the
                        military history of his Department; and dwells on the management of the
                        freedmen, their condition and improvement, and on the crops. He also refers
                        to the proposed national cemeteries near Vicksburg and Natchez.</p>
                    <p>According to the report of Maj. Gen. Sickles, commanding Department of South
                        Carolina, on the 1st of January, 1866, comprised 352 officers and 7,056
                        enlisted men. By the muster out of volunteer organizations this force was
                        reduced on the 1st of June last, when the Department of South Carolina was
                        discontinued, to 200 officers and 2,973 enlisted men.</p>
                    <p>Depots for recruits for the 40th United States Infantry have been established
                        at Smithville, North Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina. Enlistmens
                        are going on satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>In the condition of the colored population the most gratifying progress has
                        been observed. The Act of Emancipation has been ratified constitutionally by
                        the spontaneous consent of these States. The Legislature of South Carolina
                        has recognized the civil rights of freedom as defined by the Civil Rights
                        bill. In North and South Carolina the courts are open to freedmen for the
                        protection of person and property. In South Carolina they are competent to
                        testify in all cases, without disqualification on account of color, interest, or relation to this subject matter. Their
                        dwellings, schools, churches and societies are generally unmolested and
                        secure. They are free to cultivate the soil for themselves, or to engage in
                        any lawful calling, or to hire for wages as they may choose. </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the following general observations are suggested by a review
                        of the operation and condition of affairs during the year in this
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>The military occupation of the territory by the detachments garrisoning posts
                        embracing one or more counties has restored order, afforded security for
                        person and property, and encouraged the resumption of agricultural,
                        industrial, and commercial employments.</p>
                    <p>The material prosperity of these States injured almost irreparably by the
                        war, seems likely to be restored through emancipation. Although some time
                        more must elapse before their productions will be equal in quantity to the
                        product before the war, the increased value of the stables raised will soon
                        make up the equivalent. Capital, enterprise, and population are coming from
                        the North. With these will be provided increased facilities for culture,
                        manufactures, and trade. Remarkable success has rewarded many diligent and
                        judicious planters, who have paid liberal wages in cash and treated their
                        laborers kindly.--Evidence accumulates to prove the general disposition of
                        the negroes to work voluntarily and faithfully for wages, or for themselves
                        as tenants and small proprietors.--Education, the enjoyment of their
                        earnings, the security of family ties, the possession of civil rights, and
                        the practice of Divine worship are exerting their salutary influence upon
                        the conduct, intelligence, and thrift of the freed people. The tow races,
                        alienated by war and suddenly separated by emancipation, are becoming
                        gradually reconciled.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) U. S. GRANT, General.</p>

<b>The Impending Radical Revolution--First Act In The Drama</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contains a copy of the bill introduced by Thad Stevens to establish civil
                    government in North Carolina. The article desribes the bill as the "first step

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"On last Thursday, Thad Stevens introduced into the National House of
                    Representatives a bill for the overthrow of the State government of North
                    Carolina. It is the first step in the Radical programme of revolution. It will
                    be well for the country if the people awake to the perils ahead before it is too
                    late. If they continue to dream on, as they have been doing, they can prepare
                    themselves for worse times than they have yet seen. Encouraged in the past by a
                    too credulous and deluded people, the Radical leaders are preparing to launch
                    the ship of state anew amid the scene of anarchy, confusion and blood, the
                    horrors of which no man can foretell. Will the people be now warned? The
                    following is a copy of Mr. Steven's bill:"<br>

                        resume its former relations as one of the constituents of the American
                        Union.</p>

                        the United States of America, did rebel against the government of the United
                        States and on the said 20th of May and thereafter, did voluntarily set aside
                        and destroy the organized constitutional government of the said State, and
                        engage with others in armed hostilities and warfare to maintain their said

                        subordinate military officers from executing the details of civil
                        regulations in the several and widely separated localities in the district,
                        did, under forms and rules by him prescribed, authorize certain citizens of
                        the district to assume the execution of said purpose of preservation of
                        peace and order, under the protection and sanction of the military

                        upon their taking and subscribing before the Judge of the District Court of
                        North Carolina, or some other officer of the United States authorized to
                        administer oaths, the following oath, to wit:</p>
                    <p>"I do solemnly swear on the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God (or affirm as the

                        been offered me; that in the said 4th day of March, 1864, and at all times
                        thereafter, I was opposed to the continuance of the rebellion, to the
                        establishment of the so-styled confederate government, and voluntarily gave
                        no aid or encouraged [UNCLEAR] thereto, but earnestly desired the success of
                        the Union, and the suppression of all armed resistance to the government of
                        the United States, and that I will henceforth faithfully support the
                        Constitution of the united States and the Union of States thereunder."</p>
                    <p>And no person shall be allowed to act as delegate to the said convention, or
                        hold any office or appointment thereunder, until he shall have taken and
                        subscribed to the above oath in the manner and form as above provided.</p>
                    <p>SEC. 4. That it shall be the duty of the Judge of the District Court, or
                        other officer, before whom such path is prepared to be taken, when he may
                        suspect that it is about to be taken falsely by any person, to put to such
                        person any question under oath, and to bear any other evidence which may
                        tend to satisfy him as to the propriety of administering it; and should any
                        person falsely take the oath, shall be indicted and prosecuted in the
                        Circuit Court of the United States, held in the district in which the
                        offence may be committed for the crime of perjury, and upon conviction
                        thereof shall be sentenced to, and receive such punishment as now attaches
                        to the crime of perjury; and in the trial of such indictment no person shall
                        be qualified to sit upon the jury until he shall have taken the said oath,
                        and the court, may require any juryman to take it unless he shall swear that
                        he cannot truthfully do so.</p>
                    <p>SEC. 5. That it shall be the duty of the President of the United States to
                        direct and require the United States Marshal for the District of North
                        Carolina to appoint for each country in said district one deputy marshal,
                        and the deputy marshal so appointed shall each in his respective county
                        appoint keepers and inspectors of polls, and other necessary assistants; and
                        on the first day of March, 1867, the said deputy marshals shall each open
                        the polls in their respective counties for the election of delegates to the
                        said convention, at such places, and shall conduct the election, and give
                        certificates of election under such rules and regulations (except as herein
                        or otherwise provided) as were prescribed for the election of the members of
                        the House of Commons of the State of North Carolina immediately previous to
                        the 20th day of May, 1861; and any person who shall be appointed deputy
                        marshal, or inspector, or keeper of the polls, as aforesaid, and who shall
                        refuse or neglect to perform the duties required of him under this act,
                        shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof before the
                        United States Circuit Court, held in the District of North Carolina, shall
                        be fined such sum, or imprisoned such time, as the Court, in its discretion,
                        may fix.</p>
                    <p>SEC. 6. That the said deputy marshals, keepers, and inspectors of polls, and
                        other necessary assistants, shall receive the sum of five dollars per day
                        for every day they may be engaged in the discharge of their duties under
                        this act, to be ascertained and paid by the United States marshal of the
                        district, under the order of the district judge; and the United States
                        marshal in addition to his present salary and fees shall receive such
                        compensation for the discharge of his duties under this act as Congress may
                        hereafter allow, and the Treasurer of the United States shall pay to the
                        United States marshal of said district, upon the order or requisition of
                        said judge, out of any moneys in the Treasury, and not otherwise
                        appropriated, such sums of money, from time to time, as may be necessary for
                        carrying out the forgoing provision.</p>
                    <p>SEC. 7. That the present organization set upon, under martial law by the
                        military power of the president, and all officers in said District charged
                        with the execution of civil regulation therein, except the regular officers
                        of the United States, shall cease to be such, and their functions and powers
                        shall terminate at such time as may be provided by the said Convention, with
                        the recognition and approval of Congress by the State Constitution and civil
                        government provided for and sought to be established under this act.</p>
                    <p>SEC. 8. That the President of the United States is hereby authorized, and it
                        shall be his duty, to so dispose and employ the military and naval forces of
                        the United States from time to time in such places as to enforce the prompt
                        and efficient execution of the provisions of this act, and to preserve
                        peace, order and obedience to the United States in said district, formerly

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A few Radicals in North Carolina have finally prepared a plan for a State
                        government to suit their purposes, and it has been presented to the House by
                        Mr. Stevens.--The plan proposes a convention of "loyal citizens of the
                        district formerly composing the State of North Carolina," to assemble at
                        Raleigh, for the purpose of initiating this governmental movement. In the
                        election of delegates to that convention all male resident citizens of the
                        State of the age of twenty-one years shall be allowed to vote, without
                        distinction of race or color, who can read and write or may own in fee real
                        estate of the assessed value of one hundred dollars or more, provided they
                        can take the following oath or affirmation:</p>
                    <p>I do solemnly swear on the Holy Evangelist of the Almighty God (or affirm as
                        the case may be) that on the 4th day of March 1863, and at all times
                        thereafter, I would willingly have complied with the requirements of the
                        proclamation of the President of the United States, issued on the 8th day of
                        December, 1863, had a safe opportunity of doing so been offered to me. That
                        on the said 4th day of March, 1864, and at all time there after, I was
                        opposed to the continuance of the rebellion and to the establishment of the
                        so-called Confederate government, and voluntarily gave no aid or
                        encouragement thereto; but earnestly desired the success of the Union and
                        the suppression of all armed resistance to the government of the United
                        States, and that I will henceforth faithfully support the Constitution of
                        the United States and the Union of the States thereunder.</p>
                    <p>The elections are to be conducted by officers appointed by the United States
                        Marshal for " the District of North Carolina," and any person thus appointed
                        is to be punished with fine and imprisonment if he neglects or refuses to
                        act. The bill also provides that the present State government of North
                        Carolina shall cease so soon as Congress shall recognized the new
                        organization and that it shall be the duty of the President of the United
                        States to dispose and employ the military and naval forces of the United
                        States, from time to time, and in such places, as to enforce the prompt and
                        efficient execution of the provisions of this act, and to preserve peace,
                        order, and obedience to the laws of the United States in the said district,
                        formerly comprising the State of North Carolina.</p>
                    <p>These are the main provisions of a bill intended to destroy a sovereign State
                        of this Union, and erect upon its ruins an organization to further the
                        interested purposes of a sectional political party. The State of North
                        Carolina has at this time a State government as legal, constitutional, and
                        legitimate as that enjoyed by the people of Pennsylvania. When North
                        Carolina commenced restoring the State to its full and proper constitutional
                        relations with the Federal Government, she laid the foundations deep and
                        permanent. Her people distinctly repudiated and abandoned the right of
                        secession, the language of the Convention being that the ordinance of
                        secession "is now" and at all times "hath been null and void." Mr. Lincoln,
                        in his letter to Mr. Stanley, spoke of the State of North Carolina as a
                        "State," and expressed a desire to see her represented in Congress at an
                        early date.--Since that time the Constitution of the State has been
                        remodeled; members of the Senate and House of Representatives have been
                        elected; a Governor chosen and installed; courts opened, and all the
                        machinery of a State government put in full and complete operation. The
                        people of North Carolina, the depositories of all power in a republican form
                        of government, have thus indicated their desire to continue as a State of
                        the Union under the Constitution and the laws passed in obedience to that
                        instrument, their decision is final. It can only be nullified and made
                        inoperative by usurped power, supported by force.</p>
                    <p>One feature in this revolutionary movement in North Carolina is deserving of
                        notice. The few men in that State acting as the tools of Sumner and Stevens
                        in the new State plot, do not pretend that any of their rights have been
                        interfered with. They do not allege that the majority of the people are
                        deprived of power by an usurping minority, as is the case in the nation at
                        this time. They nowhere declare that the ballot has been taken out of their
                        possession or that the ballot box has been closed against them. None of
                        these things are alleged.--On the contrary an acknowledged minority of the
                        people of a State petition Congress to break up a State organization, and so
                        reorganize it as to place the few in power and keep them there. More than
                        this, the same minority ask Congress to fix, change, and determine the
                        depositories of political power in a States; to load the elective franchise
                        with oaths intended, not to consolidate the Union of the States under the
                        Constitution, but to bind the majority as captives to a sectional
                        organization, and this the Radicals propose to do by the bill offered in the
                        House by Mr. Stevens.</p>
                    <p>But, are there not serious obstacles in the way of this revolutionary
                        movement? How is Congress to destroy a state government like that of North
                        Carolina? Is it competent for Congress, even if they had denied
                        representatives to Pennsylvania to deprive Governor Curtin of his office, to
                        hurl from the bench the Judges of the Supreme Court, to nail up the doors of
                        the House of Representatives, and to destroy at one blow all the visible
                        signs of State power and authority? That could only be done by force. And
                        what force has Congress, or how can they marshal and command it? The case of
                        Pennsylvania is that of North Carolina. Congress has prevented the
                        Representatives of that State from taking their places in the Legislature of
                        the nation. This is a usurpation of power, an outrage upon the rights of a
                        State and a people. But because they have done the lesser, does it follow as
                        a matter either of law or logic that they can do the greater wrong? It is
                        one thing to say that a State shall not be represented; it is quite another
                        to invade a State and break up its State existence. The latter requires
                        power that Congress cannot enforce, no matter how boldly they may claim and
                        assume its possession.</p>
                    <p>Under his oath of office the President of the United States is required to
                        "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States," and
                        to "protect each of the States against invasion." That being his sworn duty
                        under the Supreme law of the nation, how can Congress impose upon him the
                        duty to so "dispose and employ the military forces of the United States from
                        time to time, and in such places, as to enforce the prompt and efficient
                        execution of an act which violates the provisions of the Constitution, and
                        invades the constitutionally guaranteed and protected rights of a State? It
                        is clear that Congress has no right to instruct the Chief Magistrate to
                        violate either his oath of office or the Constitution of the United States,
                        and hence the passage of the revolutionary bill of Mr. Stevens is one thing,
                        its enforcement is another. The suggestion that this is a plot upon which to
                        base an impeachment of the President is not wanting in some of the elements
                        of plausibility. But let each day meet its own responsibilities. At present
                        the duty of patriots is to show the people the full scope and meaning of
                        each measure proposed by the radical revolutionists. We have anatomized the
                        North Carolina plot; its defenders and advocates can push on in their march
                        of treason and revolution if they will. The people will apply a remedy at
                            last.--Age</p>
