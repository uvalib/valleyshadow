<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Pennsylvania will be the first of the great Middle and Western States to take
						position on the issue that has been thrust so boldly on the country. Her
						voice in the October election will be potent, one way or the other, in
						deciding the question of Union or disunion. The November elections will be
						directly affected by that in the Keystone State. It is for this reason that
						such efforts are making by the Radicals. They are getting up all the noisy
						enthusiasm, in their power. What they may lack in greenbacks this year they
						are making up in fireworks, music, and cannon; which accounts for Geary's
						saying that a meagre little out-door meeting, where a half-pounder was
						firing every two or three minutes, and that "their cannon put him in good humor with mankind." The leaders are
						working with the energy of desperation, for they know that if they lose the
						election in Pennsylvania their rule is at an end in Congress.--Stevens and
						Forney are sleepless. They get up a so-styled "Southern Union" Convention in
						Philadelphia to-day, and a Pittsburgh "Soldiers and Sailors" Convention
						to-morrow; both pitiful imitations of the grand National Union Convention of
						August 14, and the noble Soldiers and Sailors' Cleveland Convention of the
						17th inst. It is a heavy battle that is being fought for the Union in
						Pennsylvania, but we must recollect that Gettysburg is in that State, and
						there the soldiers of the Union taught the voters how to turn back the tide
						of disunionists from whatever direction it set in. </p>
					<p>The Conservatives, who take their stand on the broad constitutional platform
						of the National Union Convention, have much to do before they can claim the
						victory, but they realize what momentous issues are involved and what
						far-reaching consequences hang on the result. They have the loftiest
						suggestion of patriotism to inspire them. The noblest desires which men can
						entertain for their country now calling loudly on them for help, are present
						with them as constant counselors. It is a question whether ten States shall
						be kept under the feet of a government that will have learned by such an act
						to practice usurpation and tyranny. It is a question of peace or a renewal
						of destructive war with watered fields and smoking cities and towns to mark
						its course. It is whether, after having beaten down sedition, we are to
						organize the entire government anew, not for the purpose of protecting
						defending and perpetuating Union but to inflict vindictive penalties, to
						convert sovereign States into waste provinces, to hold a third of the
						population of the country in civil and social bondage, and to establish a
						centralized power from which all the checks and balances that entered into
						its creation are absolutely taken away. It is, in fine, a question of
						restored fraternity and prosperity, or of continued alienation, certain
						bankruptcy, and a total overthrow of our republican system.</p>
					<p>The spirit of the sound and timely advice given by the Post is just that which animates the anti-Radical party in the
						Old Keystone State. They know the honor of meeting and checking the advance
						of that hitherto invincible party, the Radicals, which is marching with the
						torches to light anew the flames of sectional discord in the nation, is
						theirs. And they will succeed.--The old Democratic party is fairly aroused,
						and their Conservative allies are ready for the contest. The young, ardent,
						and patriotic leader of the Union forces, Hiester Clymer, is infusing new
						life, energy and determination into the combined army, and in all parts of
						the State the notes of preparation and the tones of encouragement are heard.
						The struggle is a despotic one, but the friends of constitutional liberty
						and a restored Union will place Pennsylvania back again in her old place as
						the Keystone of the Federal Arch, and by doing so cheer and encourage the
						Union party in her sister States in their conflict with the revolutionary,
						disunion party of the country. </p>

					<p>The Radical Party in National Convention Declare for Negro Suffrage.</p>
					<p>He who, in face of the proceedings of the Philadelphia Republican Convention
						of last week an the meetings connected therewith still continue to mislead
						the people into the belief that negro suffrage is not an issue in the coming
						contest, must have but little regard for his own reputation. The negro Fred
						Douglass and several others of the same color were delegates to that
						convention. Douglass marched arm in arm with Theodore Tilton, of the Independent, and was lustily cheered along the line
						of the procession as was also Gen. Geary. Douglass had the distinguished
						honor of being introduced at the League House. The Press informs us that "loud calls were made for Mr. Frederick
						Douglass, who was introduced amidst great applause." Douglass said: </p>
					<p>The question, then comes to us, shall the presence of this vast black
						population in our midst be made a blessing to themselves a blessing to us,
						and a blessing to the whole country, or a curse to themselves, a curse to
						us, and a curse to the whole country?--Statesmanship has but one answer. It
						was given this morning from the eloquent lips of Senator Yates. Philanthropy
						has but one answer, and it is given from a thousand pulpits and a thousand
						platforms today. It is this: A thorough and complete incorporation of this
						whole black element into the American body politic--[cries of
						"good!"]--anything less than this will prove an utter failure, in my
						judgement--with a right to the jury-box, the witness box, and the
						ballot-box--[applause.]</p>
					<p>We are also informed by the Press that "when the
						speaker had concluded he was shaken by the hand by a large number of the
						delegates." </p>
					<p>Mr. James M. Scovel, another delegate to the Convention said:</p>
					<p>"We say to the white man, who shouted for the Constitution while he spit upon
						it, disfranchise the black man if you dare!--Make
						him three-fifths of a man as you did before slavery died: but, so help us
						God, you shall never deem the black man no man at
						all--without vote or voice in the policies which control him--and then ask
						to vote for him while your tender mercy is
						breathing of murder and slaughter at New Orleans and Memphis." </p>
					<p>Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, offered a series of resolutions in the convention
						"expressing the belief that there could be no permanent peace without
						universal suffrage."</p>
					<p>Mr. Lascar of Missouri, offered a resolution declaring "that there never will
						or never can be reconstruction without the political
							equality of the whites and blacks." </p>
					<p>Col. C. E. Moss, of Missouri, offered a resolution that in the opinion of
						this Convention the plan of reconstruction, as proposed by Congress, is
						defective in not providing for the enfranchisement of all loyal citizens,
						without regard to color, and earnestly requesting Congress, at its next
						session, to remove that defect by suitable measures of legislation.</p>
					<p>A number of delegates offered resolutions in favor of universal suffrage,
						which were applauded.</p>
					<p>Mr. Trop of Virginia, offered the following, which was applauded:</p>
					<p>Resolved, That the elective franchise is a natural
						right, and ought to be guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States
						to all its citizens. </p>
					<p>Mr. Kelsey, of Washington, D. C., offered the following, which was
						vociferously applauded:</p>
					<p>Resolved, That this is the hour for the
						declaration and maintenance of principle versus
						policy, and that impartial suffrage is the sign in which
							we must conquer. </p>
					<p>Mr. Conway of Kansas, offered a resolution declaring that the President of
						the United States deserves the condemnation of the loyal men of the South,
						in sending out his late commissioners. Steedman and Fullerton, for the
						purpose of destroying the confidence of the country in the Freedman's
						Bureau, by means of false reports, so tempered as to sustain his own policy;
						that this Convention do most cordially endorse the action of the Freedman's
						Bureau, believing that the said Bureau is necessary to the welfare of all
						classes in the South, until it can be dispensed with by
							the ballot, in the hands of all loyal men, regardless of color. </p>
					<p>Mr. Moss addressed the Convention in favor of universal suffrage, as the only
						safe basis of reconstruction. It has been said that this policy would hurt
						the Northern elections. He did not think so. It would at any rate
						reconstruct ten Southern States so as to give the political power to loyal
						men, and send twenty Senators to Congress like Mr. Durant, of Louisiana.
						[Applause.] It was surely not the intention of this Convention to endorse
						the provisional governments of Andrew Johnson. If not, he did not see why
						this resolution should be opposed. It was well known that the white refugees
						from the South were universally in favor of equal suffrage. If white men did not help the negroes in the South, the
							time would soon come when the negroes would take the matter into their
							own hands, and when they did God help the rebels. [Applause.] How
						many more New Orleans riots would it take to set the whole South in a flame?
						Not many, he thought. He believed there were five or six hundred thousand
						men in this country who were not going to trifle much longer on this
						question. They were led by such men as Philips.--Equality to all men was promised in the call for this Convention, and
							it would be hypocrisy to go home without declaring in favor of
						it. </p>
					<p>Miss Anna Dickinson, Gen. Geary and Fred Douglas were invited by a
						complementary resolution, to seats on the platform. Miss Dickinson said:</p>
					<p>What was to be gained, she asked, by deferring action upon negro suffrage?
						Nothing! while everything was to be lost by a vacillating conciliatory
						course. The people even of Maryland and Kentucky would say that the Union Republican party was devoted to negro
						suffrage, even though its representatives could not see that the
						policy of justice is always the most profitable and just. </p>
					<p>Next following her, came Fred. Douglass, speaking in this strain:</p>
					<p>A stranger would believe that you intended to give equal
							and exact justice to men of my complexion. If you mean anything
						by equal justice or equal protection you mean that Frederick Douglass shall
						have an equal right with every other citizen to protect his liberty.
						[Applause.] You do mean it. [Applause.] Why, then, in God's name, do you not
						come out and express your convictions? [Great Applause.] I have talked to
						men from the South, and they have said, "It will come; don't hasten it; let
						us get out of the well and we will attend to you." [Laughter and great
						applause.] </p>
					<p>Geary took a front seat with Douglass and "gentle Anne," but failed to "come
						to time" in a speech, having left his manuscript at home. He doubtless felt
						that his presence there in so prominent a post of honor sufficiently
						manifested his assent to the doctrines of negro suffrage and negro equality.</p>
					<p>Parson Brownlow gave utterance to these disgusting remarks:</p>
					<p>Some gentlemen, not through any unkind feeling toward me, but through a
						mistaken appreciation of my motives, have said that we were afraid of the
						negro suffrage question and sought to dodge it. Why, I should feel disgraced
						now and forever, if I felt doubtful on any subject of national concern. I
						never was claimed on both sides of any question, and never intend to
						be.--While I am satisfied with what has been done, I am
							the advocate of negro suffrage and of impartial suffrage. [Great
						applause, including 'three cheers for Brownlow.'] I would sooner be elected
						to any office under heaven by loyal negroes than by disloyal white men.
						[Applause.] I would sooner associate in private life wite a loyal negro than
						with a disloyal white man. I would sooner be buried in a negro grave yard
						than in a rebel grave yard. [Applause.] If I have after
							death to go either to hell or heaven, I shall prefer to go with loyal
							negroes to hell than with traitors to heaven. </p>
					<p>Mr. Calvin Pepper, of Virginia, said that "the fate of the loyal South
						depended upon universal suffrage. He denied the right of a State to
						disfranchise any portion of its citizens." Mr. Williams "was on the broad
						platform of universal suffrage." General B. F. Butler declared:</p>
					<p>"Had the negro not been armed, the result would have been quite diffrent. We
						armed him with the musket when he was fit to use it; shall we not arm him with the ballot? There is a prejudice
						against the negro on the question of labor. Then the labor-saving machinery
						was introduced into England, the laboring classes rose and destroyed it,
						because they thought it would take away the work that brought them bread. </p>
					<p>Suppose we were only looking for expediency. The States must come back. We
						want a loyal constituency in those States. Where will they come from? As a matter of self-protection, as a matter of economy,
							the negro must have a vote." </p>
					<p>And to cap the climax, the report fo the Committee on unreconstructed States,
						which was adopted just before the adjournment declares as follows:</p>
					<p>"We affirm that the loyalists of the South look to Congress with affectionate
						gratitude and confidence as the only means to save them from persecution,
						exile and death itself. And we also declare that there can be no security
						for us or our children--there can be no safety for the country agaisnt the
						fell spirit of slavery now organized in the form of serfdom, unless the
						government, by national and appropriate legislation enforced by national
						authority, shall confer on every citizen of the States of the American
						birth-right of impartial suffrage and equality before
							the law. This is the one all-sufficient remedy. This is our great
						need and pressing necessity." </p>
					<p>The official report of the proceedings in forms us that "the paragraph in
						reference to universal suffrage was enthusiastically cheered," and it was
						finally adopted, amidst great applause, by an immense majority.</p>
					<p>In view of these declarations, intelligent men can no longer doubt that negro
						suffrage and negro equality is an issue in the
						coming election. John W. Geary walked in the same procession with Fred.
						Douglass and shared with him the applause of the radical bystanders. He sat
						side by side with him, by resolution of the Convention, in a position
						assigned to distinguished visitors. He wa present and listened without a
						disssenting word to his harangue in favor of the complete equality of the
						races, and doubtless joined in the "great applause," and was one of those
						who "shook the orator by the hand."--Carlisle
						Vounteer.</p>

					<p>They mean that Congress shall enforce Negro Equality.</p>
					<p>The Republican party of Pennsylvania declare tht the proposed amendments to
						the Constitution, as presented by Congress, constitute their platform. Their
						grand effort in the campaign now progressing has been to induce the masses
						of this State to believe that it is for their interest to vote to keep the
						Southern State out of the Union until these amendments are ratified and
						adopted by them.</p>
					<p>What is proposed to be done by these amendments? What do they mean in plain
						English? What will be the effect of their adoption. These are questions now
						being asked by the masses. Here in Pennsylvania an attempt has been made to
						deceive the people. Republican orators and newspapers have interpreted the
						wrongly.--They have denied that that they mean negro suffrage and negro
						equality.</p>
					<p>Fortunately all such assertions have been proved to be naked lies by the very
						highest Republican authority. The National Republican Committee has issued
						an address to the American people. We presume it will be published by every
						republican newspaper in the State. If it is, the masses will have no longer
						any difficulty in determinng the exact meaning, purpose and intent of the
						proposed amendments. They are definded by this, the highest Republican
						authority known, in the following language:</p>
					<p>1.ALL PERSONS BORN OR NATURALIZED IN THIS COUNTRY ARE HENCEFORTH CITIZENS OF
						THE UNITED STATES, AND SHALL ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS EVERMORE; AND
						NO STATE SHALL HVAE POWER TO CONTRAVENE THIS MOST RIGHTEOUS AND NECESSARY
						PROVISION.</p>
					<p>2. WHILE THE STATES CLAIM AND EXERCISE THE POWER OF DENYING ELECTIVE
						FRANCHISE OT A PART OF THEIR PEOPLE THE WEIGHT OF EACH STATE IN THE UNION
						SHALL BE MEASURED BY AND BASED UPON ITS ENFRANCHISED POPULATION. IF ANY
						STATE SHALL CHOOSE, FOR NO CRIME, TO DENY POLITICAL RIGHTS TO ANY RACE OR
						CASTE, IT MUST NO LONGER COUNT THAT RACE OR CASTE AS A A BAISS OF POLTIICAL
						POWER IN THE UNION.</p>
					<p>CONGRESS SHALL HAVE POWER TO ENFORCE THESE GUARANTEES BY APPROPRIATE
						LEGISLATION.</p>
					<p>Such in plain English and in the exact language of the Republican National
						Committee, are the proposed amendments to the Cosntittuion of the United
						Stats.</p>
					<p>The first declares that "all persons born or naturalized
							in this country are henceforth citizens of the United States, AND
						SHALL ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS EVERMORE." </p>
					<p>The other clauses impose penalties on any State which does not immediately
						confer upon negroes "all rights of citizens for
						evermore." </p>
					<p>Such are these amendments as compressed into a nut shell by the highest
						authority known to the Republican party</p>
					<p>Are they sufficiently plain now? Do the people need more light? Can any man
						deny that negro suffrage is an issue in the present campaign in
						Pennsylvania, and that the Radical leaders are resolved to force the people
						to accept the odious doctrine of entire and perfect negro equality?</p>
					<p>The result of the elections in Vermont and Maine has emboldened the radical
						leaders. They have thrown off the last of their disguise and now plainly
						avow their real intentions.</p>
					<p>They beleive they have the power by menas of fraud and corruption to carry
						the election in Pennsylvania. They rely upon the passions and prejudices of
						those who have heretofore acted with theim, and expect them to vote blindly
						for Geary and the entire radical ticket. In this they will be disappointed.
						The great mass of the citiznes of the State are Conservative. The white men
						of Pennsylvania will not vote to maek the negro their equal, and to confer
						teh power on Congress to enforce such an odious condition. Multitudes have
						already repudiated these infamous fanatics, and now that they have
						completely thrown off the mask, the desertions from their ranks will be more
						numerous than ever.</p>
					<p>This authoritative statement of their designs comes in good in good time. Let
						it be spread broadcast among the people, and the result will be such a
						rebuke to the Radicals as was never administered to any political
							party.--Lancaster Intelligencer.</p>
