<b>African and the Africans</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After announcing the publication of Dr. Livingston's new book on his
                    adventures in Africa, the article uses the occasion to deprecate blacks, and
                    their place in American society. Unlike all "other races [that] have advanced in
                    one or another degree," it claims, "the African of the nineteenth century after
                    Christ is the precise counterpart of his ancestor three thousand years ago."<br>

<b>Thaddeus Stevens</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a stinging attack, the editorial casts Senator Thaddeus Stevens as an
                    "infidel" who will stop at nothing to force his agenda, the debasement of
                    whites, particularly southerners and members of the working class, on the
                    American people.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Passage of the Amendment</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Led by Thad Stevens, who, the article reports, closed the debate over the
                    issue with the "most vindictive fiendish and brutal speech, perhaps ever made in
                    a deliberative body," Republicans approved the Constitutional Amendment drafted
                    by the Reconstruction Committee.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Colorado</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Congress' acceptance of Colorado's bid to become a state is strictly a
                    Republican ploy to ensure them a veto-proof two-third majority in Congress,
                    contends the article. To justify the claim, it mentions that the territory is
                    composed of a substantial number of non-whites, the "real population" totaling
                    only 15,000, which is "half the minimum prescribed by the Constitution for a
                    single representative."<br>

<b>An Item for White Men</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Outraged by Congress' decision to appropriate $11 million for the
                    Freedmen's Bureau, the writer exhorts white men to show their displeasure at the
                    polls next election.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Secretary Stanton's Position</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported that Secretary Stanton's stand on the President's
                    reconstruction policies has left many Republican's baffled. Stanton, who has
                    publicly thrown his support behind Johnson, believes that "the party which dared
                    to stand in the way of an absolute and immediate Union, in all its integrity,
                    would be ground to powder," according to the piece.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Railroad Question</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A copy of an address given by Hiester Clymer, Democratic gubernatorial
                    nominee, regarding his position on railway legislation, which, he believes,
                    should promote a system uninhibited by any hindrances.<br>
