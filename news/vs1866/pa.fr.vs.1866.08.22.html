<b>The Great Convention</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial provides a glowing review of the proceedings at the National
                    Union Convention in Philadelphia, and proclaims the assembly a "turning point in
                    the destin[y] of the nation."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We surrender most of our space to-day to the proceedings of the Great
                        National Union Convention held in Philadelphia, last week. We are quite
                        certain that we can do the great cause of the restoration of the Union and
                        the Constitution no better service than by giving these proceedings at
                        length. That our readers will peruse them with enthusiastic delight and be
                        inspired thereby with renewed hope and confidence in the future permanence
                        and welfare of the Republic, we have no doubt,</p>
                    <p>This Convention was the great event of the age in which we live, and will be
                        regarded by future generations as one of the remarkable epochs in our
                        country's history--the turning point in the doctrines of the nation. It is
                        the first public exhibition of that great reaction in the public sentiment
                        of the country, which is destined to sweep down that baleful spirit of
                        sectionalism and fanaticism--the cause of all our woes and the troubles in
                        the past--and to bring back the government to the principles of the
                        Constitution and a genuine spirit of nationality.</p>
                    <p>To say tat the Convention was a grand success but feebly expresses the
                        reality.--Its like was never before witnessed in this or any other country,
                        when it is taken into account the size, standing and ability of its members,
                        and the harmony of its deliberations. Composed of over twelve hundred
                        delegates, coming from every section, State and Territory in the union,
                        representing all the varied interests and sympathies incident to their
                        respective localities, and yet, not a ripple at any time appeared upon the
                        surface to mar the peace of the convention. This grand fact disappointed
                        most agreeably many of the friends of the Convention while it made its
                        enemies rage with chagrin and disappointment. The last hope of the Radicals
                        was that the Convention would fail to harmonize and "and break up into a
                        row." But the complete unanimity and perfect harmony which prevailed
                        throughout the entire deliberations of the convention, have knocked the last
                        prop from under the radical structure, and down it will come in Pennsylvania
                        on the second Tuesday of October, with a crash that will sound through, and
                        be re-echoed by every State in a restored American Union. No wonder then
                        that Forney raves and Greelly howls. They see the hand-writing on the wall
                        and well know that their doom is fixed. This movement is from the
                        people--the honest, uncorrupted and unpurchasable people, who love the
                        Constitution and Union of our fathers--and they
                        have fully determined, by overwhelming majorities in the fall elections, to
                        notify these radical revolutionists in and out of Congress that their "time
                        has come." </p>
                    <p>It is useless to refer to the incidents of the Convention, as these are fully
                        set forth in the regular proceedings. We are, however, tempted to allude to
                        the entrance of the Massachusetts and South Carolina delegations, arm in
                        arm, into the "Wigwam" on the first day. The effect of this incident was
                        overpowering, and the excitement which ensued beggars all description. The
                        vast concourse of people assembled, with one glorious, patriotic impulse
                        instantly sprung to their feet, and sent up cheer after cheer, to give
                        expression to the joy that swelled every bosom. Tears of joyful emotion were
                        seen filling the eyes and trickling down the cheeks of hundreds of men
                        unused to weep. The moral grandeur of this incident, we think, must stand
                        without a parallel for all time. A Major General in the Federal Army and a
                        Senator in the late Confederate Senate, walking arm in arm into a National
                        Convention speaks more eloquently in favor of immediate peace and re-union
                        than all the platitudes that could be written from now until the end of
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Without saying anything further we will let the proceedings speak for
                        themselves. Read them everyone, and carefully study their overshadowing
                        significance; endeavor to catch the inspiration of this great movement and
                        work ardently, earnestly and faithfully in behalf of the great cause until
                        the laurels of victory crown your labors with success in a restored Union
                        and a perfect Nationality.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the largest and most enthusiastic Democratic County meetings it has
                        ever been our fortune to witness, assembled in the Court House on the
                        evening of Tuesday the 14th inst. Although the meeting was an impromptu
                        affair and the bills announcing if had been posted but a few hours, the
                        large hall was completely filled long before the hour of meeting. The
                        assemblage was called to order at 8 o'clock by D. K. Wunderlich, Esq.,
                        President of the Democratic Club, who named the following gentlemen as
                        officers of the meeting: President, John Armstrong, of Chambersburg; Vice
                        Presidents, Samuel Holliday, of Fannett; Rev. Wesly Howe, Greene; William
                        Boyd, Montgomery; William Bossert, of Hamilton; Conrad Plasterer, of
                        Southampton; Adam Kissecker, of Chambersburg; Jacob C. Snyder, of Guilford;
                        and Capt. Christian Pisle, of Chambersburg; Secretaries, Joseph Douglas, of
                        Waynesboro, and Jacob R. Smith, of Antrim, all of which gentlemen were
                        unanimously elected, and took their seats.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the organization was perfected loud cries of Brewer! Brewer!
                        Brewer!! were heard in various parts of the hall, in response to which Mr.
                        Brewer appeared and addressed the assembled Democracy in words of thrilling
                        eloquence which excited the vast audience to the highest pitch of
                        enthusiasm. After Mr. Brewer had concluded Hon. J. McDowell Sharpe, our
                        candidate for Congress, appeared in obedience to the call of the meeting,
                        and enchained its attention for more than an hour in an able, logical, and
                        eloquent speech. At the conclusion of Mr. Sharpe's speech, Hon. C. M.
                        Duncan, Senator, duly elected, but who was defrauded out of his seat by a
                        dishonest radical Senate, was loudly called for and responded in an able and
                        stirring address.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was characterized by an enthusiasm rarely witnessed in County
                        meetings, and which will make itself felt in the approaching battle at the
                        Polls, with the friends of Negro Suffrage and Negro equality.</p>

<b>Who Are The Disunionists</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Regardless of their claims to the contrary, the Radicals, says the
                    editorial, are the true cause of the continued sectional conflict. As proof, the
                    editorial points to the recent events in Philadelphia as an example of the
                    excellent rapport that exists between northerners and southerners who adhere to
                    the same basic principles, such as the sanctity of the Constitution and the
                    notion that the U.S. is white man's country.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Geary and Negro Voting</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite their attempts to convince voters otherwise, Geary and the
                    Republicans are proponents of black suffrage, contends the article. In fact,
                    should Geary win the gubernatorial election, the journal warns, his "assent will
                    be given to every negro measure enacted" in order to use the black vote to
                    defeat the political ambitions of the state's white man's party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Geary says in one of his "speeches" that "negro suffrage is not now a question," but he don't say how he is on that
                        question. All his organs--with a few exceptions--declare, also, that "negro
                        suffrage is not now a question," but why? Because
                        there is no amendment striking the word "white" out of the Constitution of
                        Pennsylvania to be voted upon at the coming election. That is their only
                        reason; but, notwithstanding, negro suffrage is
                        an issue before the people. Should the Gearyites succeed in quietly electing
                        a majority of the Legislature, at the coming election, one of the first acts
                        of next winter will be the passage of an amendment to enable negroes to
                        vote.--There is no doubt whatsoever of this. And if Geary shall occupy the
                        Governor's chair his assent will be given to every negro measure enacted.
                        Besides this negro suffrage has become a national question, through the
                        persistent agitation of the party to which Geary is attached. Seeing that
                        political power is departing from them, their greatest efforts are being
                        made to force negro suffrage at the South through amendments to the
                        Constitution, and by means of irresponsible and revolutionary conventions,
                        such as that which met at New Orleans on the 30th ult. The leaders of the
                        Geary party want the negro vote to maintain supremacy at Washington. Geary,
                        therefore, dare not deny that negro suffrage is the question at the South
                        and that he is in favor of it. Negro suffrage and equality at the South mean
                        negro suffrage and equality in Pennsylvania. Hence he who favors one is
                        committed to the other. Geary is upon a negro platform.</p>

<b>The National Issue</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the end of the war, says the editor, the passion and prejudice that
                    prevented calm and dispassionate discussion from taking place has been removed.
                    Yet while this bar may have been eliminated, a new, potentially more dangerous
                    issue has arisen, pitting Democrats and Conservatives against Radicals, who, he
                    claims, seek to establish a new form of government rather than restore the Old

                        the new bill just passed by Congress, and the War Department has issued an
                        order referring the act to a military commission composed of Generals Canby
                        and Buchanan, and Surgeon Gen. Barnes. These officers are to prescribe rules
                        and regulations to carry out the provisions of the law. The Second Auditor
                        of the Treasury, also with reference to this act, has issued instructions
                        that soldiers, in making application to his office for the additional
                        bounty, must use the same application heretofore used for arrears of pay and
                        bounty. The number of previous settlements of bounty, should always be
                        given, and it should be stated in each case that the "application is made to
                        recover the additional bounty provided by the 12th and 13th sections of an
                        act of Congress, chapter 178, approved July 28, 1866."</p>
