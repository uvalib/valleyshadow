					<p>DEAR EAGLE-the colored citizens have come to grief in Connecticut. He may

						says he can't vote.</p>
					<p>I sympathize with Sambo, at the same time I congratulate Connecticut.</p>
					<p>Which shows my impartiality.</p>
					<p>I have no prejudice against citizens of African descent.</p>
					<p>American citizens can have any descent they like.</p>
					<p>As to color it is a matter of taste.</p>
					<p>Some may prefer 'Wearing the Green.'</p>
					<p>Some may prefer black.</p>
					<p>For my part give me the Red, White and Blue.</p>
					<p>Some people base their objection to the African on the 'scent' rather than
						the 'descent.'</p>
					<p>Sambo may not be as fragrant as the Egyptian Lotus, which Cleopatra is
						understood to have perfumed her handkerchief with, when she went down to the
						Nile to meet Mr. Anthony.</p>
					<p>(N. B.-I have this from the artist who executed Hooley's drop curtain.)</p>
					<p>But this is a free country and everybody has a right to select his own
						perfume.</p>
					<p>I object to being led by the African, politically or otherwise.</p>
					<p>I insist on giving the African fair play.</p>
					<p>Being a man, and somebody's brother, he has a right to self government.</p>
					<p>Let him go off somewhere and govern himself.</p>
					<p>He needn't be particular where he goes to, so long as he goes. There are some
						countries where his complexion is fashionable; where he can lay off in
						perpetual sunshine, and the inhabitants are not troubled with tailors bills.</p>
					<p>If he has set his mind on the ballot-box he can go to Massachusetts, where
						his superiority to the white man is recognised.</p>
					<p>Particularly in war time, when the privilege of doing all the fighting will
						be cheerfully accorded to him.</p>
					<p>But should the African depart; what would become of the republican party?</p>
					<p>No. 9 Court street would soon be advertised to let to a small family without
						children.</p>
					<p>Boss Gale would have to turn his attention to some honest pursuit for a
						living.</p>
					<p>Brother Tilton would have to hire a handcart and peddle the proceeds of his
						tin wedding.</p>
					<p>Plymouth Church would probably be turned into a religious edifice.</p>
					<p>Commissioner Spooner would dry up, and make an interesting fossil for a glass
						case in the Historical Society's collection.</p>
					<p>Just think, my boy, what would have been the consequence if Nah has signed
						the pledge before he cam out of the Ark; or his son Ham knew better than to
						laugh at the tight old navigator, because he forgot to draw on the bed
						clothes when we went to sleep off his drunk.</p>
					<p>Then there would have been no colored persons-and no republican party. No
						rebellion. No drafts.</p>
					<p>No National debt.</p>
					<p>No Income tax.</p>
					<p>This shows the necessity of encouraging the Temperance movement.</p>
					<p>I wonder Gough never used the African as a frightful example of the ultimate
						result of intemperance.</p>
					<p>He can use this illustration in his next lecture.</p>

<b>Why Brevet Brigadier Baker Was Degraded</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>

<b>Negro Equality</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Soon, the editorial announces, voters in Pennsylvania will be called upon
					to determine whether to grant blacks the ballot, a prospect it finds "most
					obnoxious." Though the editor contends that most whites are firmly against this

					current Republicans hold for the Democrats.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The issue is soon to be made in Pennsylvania. The white man of our old
						Commonwealth will soon be called upon to say whether or not the negro shall
						enjoy all the rights of citizenship. Political equality without regard to
						color will soon be the rallying cry of the Radicals. A vigorous effort will
						be made to infuse this sentiment into the minds of the masses. Wherever the
						word white occurs in our State Constitution, as conferring rights on the
						Anglo-Saxon race which are denied to the Africans, it is to be stricken out.</p>
					<p>Will you, can you, believe it, laboring men of Franklin county, that a
						systematic effort is about being made to force
						negro equality upon you? And yet such is the feat. Under the lash of the
						party whip it is contemplated to force this most obnoxious measure upon the
						white freeman of the country. It is believed by the Radical leaders that,
						rather than see the Democratic party successful at the ballot box, you will
						swallow any dose which they can administer. They know that many men were
						never in sympathy with the Republican party vote for its men and its
						measures because of antagonisms to their old opponents. There is an intense
						feeling of hatred in the breasts of some men towards the Democratic party
						simply because they harbor the recollections of the numerous defeats which
						they have suffered at its hands in the past, as old line Whigs. Such men can
						be counted on to support any men or any measure hostile to democratic
						principles. This is certainly a weakness, but all Republican leaders know
						that it is this blind hostility to the Democratic party, together with "the
						cohesive power of public plunder" which holds the discordant elements of
						their party together, and it is this hostility that these same leaders will
						appeal to carry out their odious measures. </p>
					<p>Many an honest farmer will vote for negro suffrage for no other reason than
						that his Democratic neighbor votes against it. But while this will
						undoubtedly be the case in numerous instances, there are some honest
						conservative Republicans who cannot, and will not swallow the dose. They
						will refuse to obey the behests of their party leaders when it come to this.
						They will assert their independence of party trammels and show their scorn
						for the men who seek o degrade their manhood and place them upon the level
						with the negro. In our own county, we know many good men in the Republican
						ranks-mechanics, working men and farmers, who will never bow the knee to the
						black God which the Rump Congress is setting up for worship in the land.
						Senator Cowan-of whom Pennsylvania may well feel proud, has raised his voice
						in the Senate in denunciation of the negro-equality proposition, and will,
						without doubt, throw the strength of his great intellect into the scale
						against the obnoxious measure.</p>
					<p>The effort to force it upon the District of Columbia, which has repudiated it
						by and overwhelming vote, means to us to be one of the greatest and most
						outrageous acts of arbitrary power, but we trust that if even the Senate
						should pass the measure the President will arrest the monstrous iniquity by
						interposing the Executive veto, and thus save the country from the crime of
						forcing upon the inhabitants of the District a measure which they have
						rejected by almost a unanimous vote.</p>
					<p>Stand up for your race, Andrew Johnson! Stand up for the honor of your
						country--follow the teachings of the fathers of American liberty, let the
						principles of your youth and those of the founders of this white man's
						government stomata you! Assert the broad truth, and maintain it, that the
						government shall be administered, in the future as in the past, by white men
						, for the benefit of white men. Then the PEOPLE will rally around you from
						every part of this great country and from ever party and creed, and all true
						lovers of the white race, and of the government as our fathers made it, will
						delight to do you honor.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We hope no Republican in Pennsylvania will profess to be astonished when he
						finds the party with which he has acted preparing to confer the right of
						suffrage upon the negroes in this State. When every Republican member of
						Congress form this State votes to give the hordes of negroes who cluster in
						thick masses around the city of Washington the same right to vote that white
						men have had in the past, how can any one one of them refuse to advocate the
						same thing at home? We are not at all surprised to find the Harrisburg Telegraph rejoicing at the unanimity with which the
						Republican Congressmen from this State acted. We expect before many days
						elapse to see it and other Republican journals join in the effort which is
						even now being made to force negro suffrage upon the people of this State.
						The Pittsburg Commercial, one of the largest,
						most widely circulated, able and influential Republican papers in the State,
						calls upon the Legislature now in session to move in this matter at once. It
						says: </p>
					<p>While the vote in the House of Representative conferring unlimited suffrage
						on the colored men in the District of Columbia is fresh in the mind, we take
						occasion to remind the particular advocates of the principle that there are
						in Pennsylvania several thousand intelligent bus disfranchised negroes. Many
						of them enlisted into the army, fought will, and have returned home, where
						they are living orderly but disfranchised citizens--if, under this
						disability, they can be so called. The zeal Mr. Kelley has shown in carrying
						through his bill will long be quoted in his favor. Has he not the
						influence--have not the other Pennsylvania members, who favored the bill,
						the influence--to produce a movement in the Legislature to enfranchise the
						"intelligent, tax-paying, returned soldier colored population of
						Pennsylvania? We count confidently on somebody moving our Legislature. Let
						us back up or representatives with prompt action. The Union majority in
						congress have marked out the way--let us march boldly in it.</p>
					<p>That is plain talk. There is one thing, however, to commend about it. It is
						honest talk. It speaks out the real sentiments, and boldly lays bare to the
						world the designs of the leaders of the Republican party in Pennsylvania.
						They are in favor of conferring the right of suffrage upon the negroes here
						as well as elsewhere. Now that they have put themselves in a position where
						they can no longer deny their real sentiments we may expect them to act and
						to act boldly. Nothing but a fear of defeat in the campaign of next fall
						will prevent the Legislature form taking the necessary steps toward striking
						the word white from the Constitution of
						Pennsylvania. They may refuse to take the initiatory steps during the
						present winter; but so surely as they are not defeated in the coming
						campaign they will be emboldened to do what they would willingly do now if
						they did not fear that they would be repudiated by the masses. </p>
					<p>One thing at least is settled. The Republican party are fully committed to
						the doctrine of negro suffrage, and they will confer upon them that right
						without restriction, unless the white men of the country rise up in their
						might to prevent the perpetration of that most infamous outrage upon their
						rights and their race. If the white men of Pennsylvania would save
						themselves from the degradation and disgrace of negro suffrage and negro
						equality, they must take a bold stand for their rights, and at act once with
						decision.</p>

					<p>Correspondence of the VALLEY SPIRIT.</p>
					<p>HARRISBURG, February 3, 1866.</p>
					<p>The Governor's message was read in both Houses of the Legislature on Tuesday,
						and the usual number of copies ordered to be printed, for the use of the
						members. He makes a brief allusion to the burning of Chambersburg and
						suggests a further appropriation for the relief of her citizens, though in
						much less positive terms than was desired by the friends of relief. His
						animadversions on the course of the late national administration towards
						this State, are somewhat severe. He shows pretty conclusively that "our
						martyred father" simply lied when he promised
						that the State should be reimbursed for expenses incurred in calling out and
						equipping the militia of the State for the defence of the border in 1863. To
						hold the word on promise to the ear and break it to the hope seems to have
						been the policy of the War Department towards the State of Pennsylvania
						during the entire war. </p>
					<p>The great sensation of the week here was the discussion of the negro suffrage
						question in the Senate. The resolutions favoring negro suffrage in the
						District of Columbia, as stated in my last, were made the special order for
						Wednesday of this week. The discussion was opened by Mr. Landon, of
						Bradford, the author of the resolutions, in a lengthy and eloquent speech in
						favor of unqualified negro suffrage, not only in the District of Columbia,
						but throughout the entire country. He frankly admitted that the District of
						Columbia bill was merely the entering wedge to its introduction in the other
						States, and particularly the States lately in rebellion. His candor in this
						particular is commendable, destructive and ruinous as is the doctrine his
						advocates. His speech was conceded to have been the ablest made on that side
						of the question. He was followed on the Republican side by Messrs. White,
						Lowry, Bigham, Brown and Hall, and on the Democratic side by Messrs.
						Donavon, Clymer Wallace, Beardsloe, Latta and Hopkins, Republicans and
						Democrats speaking alternatively.</p>
					<p>The discussion created a great deal of interest among the outsiders, drawing
						large crowds to the Senate chamber at every session during its continuance.
						Every available space in the hall was constantly crowded. The sympathies of
						the masses on this great question were unmistakably indicated by the
						frequent outbursts of applause which greeted the Democratic speakers from
						the galleries. The Republican speakers were seldom applauded, and then but
						feebly. The Radicals found out before the discussion ended that they had a
						bigger elephant on their hands than they could manage. The terrible vollies
						of hot shot poured into their camp from the Democratic side made them squirm
						like wounded serpents. Hence on Thursday evening before the meeting of the
						senate to continue the discussion, they held a caucus at which it was
						decided by a majority of one vote to send the ill-timed measure back to the
						Committee of Federal Relations, there to sleep the sleep that knows no
						waking. It is said that Landon, of Bradford, delivered a most terrible
						invective in the caucus against the weak-kneed Republicans who failed to
						stand up to the resolutions, charging them with cowardice, and as being
						miserable tricklers, which they certainly are. When the vote was
						subsequently taken in the Senate on the motion to re-commit, old Lowry was
						found to be the only man among them who had the courage and manhood to vote
						against the dictation of the caucus. Even the brave Landon "caved in." "What
						a fall was that, my countrymen!"</p>
					<p>The eloquent and pungent speech of Hiaster Clymer fell like a bomb-shell
						among the disconcerted negro-suffrageites. His cutting home-thrusts made the
						radicals wince and put them to an exceedingly ban humor. Unable to answer
						his arguments, they nevertheless growled most terribly. It was indeed
						piteous to see the wounded birds flutter as they were repeatedly struck buy
						the sharp arrows from the bow of this skillful marksman. The speech of Mr.
						Clymer on this occasion was indeed a masterly effort, and created a most
						profound sensation. That of Mr. Wallace, who followed in the evening, was
						scarcely less powerful. It was probably owing to the effect of these tow
						great speeches, more than to anything else, that alarmed the radicals and
						caused them to back down by sending their resolution back to the committee.
						But it is too late; the issue has been made, clearly and distinctly, and the
						pole of Pennsylvania will hold them responsible at the next election for the
						degrading doctrine of negro suffrage and negro equality, so boldly avowed
						and enunciated by them in this discussion.</p>
					<p>The approaching contest for Governor is beginning to loom up. Prominent
						politicians of both parties now here are busy laying their ropes for the
						March Conventions. On the Democratic side the contest seems to be narrowing
						down to Clymer and Cass, with the chances in favor of Clymer. On the
						Republican side the most prominent candidates are Geary, Morehead and
						Ketchum. Cameron is said to be in favor of Geary. If that be so, he'll win. Cessna seems to be literally without
						friends. Poor "Dad!" </p>
					<p>The bill for the relief of Chambersburg was reported by the committee on
						Wednesday, with a favorable recommendation. The chances seem to be in favor
						of its passage as reported, but it might still be unsafe yet to make a
						positive prediction to that effect. The only difficulty, if any exists, is
						in the House. The Senate is said to be all right on the question. It is
						expected to come up regularly on the calendar about Thursday of next week,
						when its strength can be more certainly ascertained.</p>
					<p>Both Houses adjourned over yesterday, the House untill Monday evening and the
						senate untill Tuesday morning.</p>

<b>Minority Report Upon the McConaughy--Duncan Contested Election</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

					Senate, which was given the task of determining the victor in the disputed
					election between Calvin Duncan and David McConaughy.<br>(Names in announcement:  Calvin Duncan,  David McConaughy)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>
						To the Honorable the Speaker and Members of the Senate
							of Pennsylvania:
					</p>
					<p>The undersigned respectfully begs leave to present the following minority
						report from the committee of the Senate elected to try the contested
						election case form the Nineteenth Senatorial District, between Calvin M.
						Duncan, the sitting member, and David McConaughy the contestant.</p>
					<p>The petition complaining of an undue election and false return of Calvin M.
						Duncan, contained fifteen distinct averments. The first, second, third,
						fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth alleged
						about fifty votes to have been cast for Mr. Duncan which were illegal on
						account of the non-residence, non-assessment, and alienage of the voters.
						The eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth averments of the petition
						complained of one hundred and forty-one votes cast for the sitting member,
						which were illegal under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved the
						3rd day of March, 1865, entitled "An act to amend the several acts
						heretofore passed to provide for the enrolling and calling out of the nation
						forces and for other purposes."</p>
					<p>The answer of Mr. Duncan denied and traversed the allegations contained in
						the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, thirteenth, fourteenth and
						fifteenth averments of the complaint, and demurred to the eighth, ninth,
						tenth, eleventh and twelfth averments. He also set forth in his answer over
						eighty illegal votes of non-residents, non-taxpayers and aliens which had
						been cast and counted for Mr. McConaughy. In addition to this he alleged
						that over fifty deserters had cast their ballots for the contestant. In
						order to avoid a tedious and protracted investigation into questions of fact
						by the committee, Mr. Duncan agreed to rest his right to the seat entirely
						upon the legality of the "deserter vote," as it was called. This contestant,
						with apparently great reluctance, and after a full day's deliberation,
						accepted the proposition, and in that shape, the case came before the
						committee.</p>
					<p>There were three distinct classes of persons who were charged by complaint to
						have been disfranchised by the act of Congress of the third day of March,
						1865. 1st. Those persons who had gone beyond the jurisdiction of the provost
						martial of the 16th district, or beyond the limits of the United States, to
						avoid a draft duly ordered; and this class is said to contain forty-eight
						votes. 2d. Those who having been actually mustered into the military
						therefore; and this class was alleged to contain twenty-one votes. 3d. Those
						who having been duly drafted into the military service of the United states,
						had neglected or refused to report to be mustered into the army; and this
						class is alleged to contain seventy-two votes. There was no allegation in
						the complaint that the forty-eight persons who had gone beyond the
						jurisdiction of the said provost martial, or beyond the limits of the United
						States, had done so after the passage of the act of Congress. Indeed it
						could not be pretended with any degree of condor that they did so, because
						it was well known that no draft was ordered by the President of the United
						States after that date.. An examination of the language of the act of
						Congress will satisfy every intelligent mind that it is plainly and
						undoubtedly prospective, so far as it speaks of this class of offenders. Its
						words are: "And all persons who shall hereafter
						desert the military or naval service, and all persons, who being duly
						enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of a district in which he is
						enrolled, or go beyond the limits of the United States with intent to avoid
						any draft into the military or naval service duly ordered, shall be liable
						to the penalties of this section." It is manifest from this language that
						Congress did not intend to disfranchise those
						persons who had departed from the districts in which they were enrolled
						prior to the 3d of March, 1865. They could not have chosen more distinct or
						unequivocal words to make the act prospective. This class of voters were
						therefore qualified electors within the meaning of Congress, and the
						contestant made but a feeble attempt at denying the legality of their
						ballots. </p>
					<p>In regard to the twenty-one persons who were alleged in the petition to have
						been in actual military service and to have deserted therefrom, it is not
						worth while to discuss the legality of those votes, because of Mr. Duncan's
						majority, numbering twenty-five, and this class numbering only twenty-one,
						these ballots, even if illegal, did not and could not change the result of
						the election.</p>
					<p>The question, therefore, which the undersigned proposes to discuss, is
						narrowed down tot he simple proposition--whether persons who were duly drafted into the military service of the United States, and failed to report to he
						provost material, are disfranchised by the act of Congress. The petitioner
						alleged that there were seventy-two such persons who had voted for Mr.
						Duncan in the counties of Adams and Franklin. The answer admitted that
						seventy-two persons had voted for Mr. Duncan, and that prior to the day of
						election and before the passage of the act of Congress, they had been duly
						drafted into the military service and had failed to repot to the provost
						material, and that upon the records of his office they were set down as
						deserters. But the answer wholly denied that they thereby became
						disqualified to to exercise the right of suffrage in Pennsylvaniy. </p>
					<p>The undersigned believes the legal position of the answer in this behalf to
						be well sustained for the following reasons:</p>
					<p>1st. it is incompetent for Congress, under the Federal Constitution, to
						impart, either directly or indirectly, the right of suffrage in the State.</p>
					<p>2d. The act of Congress is ex post facto, and
						therefore violates the Federal Constitution. </p>
					<p>3d. The act proposes to inflict and impose pains and penalties upon offenders
						before and without a trial and conviction by due process
							of law, and therefore is in direct antagonism to the "bill of
						rights." </p>
					<p>Time will not allow a full discussion of these positions, but in order to put
						the case fairly on the record the undersigned, will give his reasons briefly
						in support of each of these propositions.</p>
					<p>No one will doubt that before the Federal Constitution was adopted and the
						Union was formed, all governmental power was in the States. By the adoption of the Constitution a division was
						made of this power and certain portions of it were delegated to the United
						States, the residuum remaining in the States,
						except so far as it was extinguished by express
						prohibitions upon the States. Thus the Constitution of the United States
						declares: "Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor
						prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
						to the people?" We have thus the Constitutional fact, that States are to
						exist concurrently with the Federal Government, having certain powers beyond
						the control of the United States, for they or the people are expressly
						declared to the possessed of all powers not delegated to the Federal
						Government, or expressly prohibited to them. It will also be admitted, that
						whilst the United States are absolutelysoverign
						over all subjects delegated to them, yet their jurisdiction being
						derivative, is necessarily limited. We have then
						these two constitutional facts: 1st. States are to exist concurrently with
						the United States, having a class of subjects exclusively within their
						dominionand beyond the reach of Federal power. </p>
					<p>Second. The Federal Government is to exist concurrently with the States
						having an absolute and sovereign control over all matters delegated to it. </p>
					<p>The theory of our Government is imperium in
						imperio.</p>
					<p>[The report then proceeds to cite the powers of Congress, quoting form the
						Constitution.]</p>
					<p>This is the chart of powers granted by the States to the Federal Government,
						and besides those therein enumerated, and undersigned knows of no others.</p>
					<p>[The report then cites the prohibitions upon the States.]</p>
					<p>It will thus be observed that outside and beyond the powers delegated by the
						Federal Government at prohibited to the States, there is a large class of
						subjects which relate to the domestic economy and policy of the people, over
						which the States are expressly admitted, by the Constitution of the United
						States, to have absolute jurisdiction and complete control. In searching for
						the domains Federal and State jurisdiction respectively, we must not forget
						the rules of interpretation, which have been applied by all distinguished
						jurists to the Federal and State Constitutions.</p>
					<p>[The report then defines the relative powers of the State and Federal
						legislatures, confining the regulation of the right of suffrage to the State
						authorities alone, and it belongs exclusively to the State legislation.]
						This right varies in almost all the States, and yet who ever supposed that
						Congress would interfere to change the rile adopted by the people in regard
						to it? Why, then, attempt to control it here?</p>
					<p>We know that in these latter days an opinion has grown up that Congress have
						the right to prescribe the qualifications of the electors in the seceded
						States. But this notion is based solely upon the dogma that these States are
						out of the Union, and are to be treated as conquered provinces. The very
						basis of this doctrine is pregnant with the affirmation that it has no
						existence in or application to a State that never seceded. Is there any one
						so bold as to assert that Congress has the constitutional power to declare
						that non but negroes shall be allowed to vote in Pennsylvania, or that no
						white man shall be allowed to vote here until he has attained the age of 30
						years?</p>
					<p>President Johnson has recently, on more than one occasion, declared, in most
						emphatic terms, that the whole theory of our government surrenders this
						entire object of right of suffrage to the exclusive and absolute control of
						the States. No statesman of any character has ever questioned it since the
						earlier days of the Republic.</p>
					<p>The report pronounces the act of Congress disfranchising deserters as in the
						nature of a bill of attainder or an ex post facto
						law, which is prohibited by the Constitution, because it changes the
						punishment and inflicts a greater one than the law annexed to the crime when
						committed, alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less or
						different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of
						the offence. The act itself declares "that in addition
							to the other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion from the
						military or naval service," &amp;c. </p>
					<p>Article 5 of the amendments to the Constitution declares that "no person
						shall be held to answer for a capital or infamous crime unless on a
						presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the
						land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of
						war or public danger. Nor shall any person be subject, for the same offence,
						to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled, in any
						criminal case, to be a witness against himself; nor be
							deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of
						law." </p>
					<p>[The report also quotes the 6th article.]</p>
					<p>Our forefathers regarded these provisions as important bulwarks against the
						oppression of power, and therefore incorporated them into the organic law.
						It was among the worst acts of infamy of the last Congress to pass a law
						which totally tore down and scattered to the winds all these safeguards of
						life, liberty and property. It is contended, in this case, that congress
						meant that the failure of a drafted man to obey a drat notice and report to
						a provost marshal, was and shall be disfranchised in consequence thereof,
						before and without the ascertainment of his guild by any court, civil or
						military. If such be the true construction of the act, (and we confess it
						looks as though it were,) then the stamp act and the duty upon tea which
						brought on the American revolution were respectable enactments in comparison
						with this specimen of the enlightened jurisprudence of the last Congress. *
						* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
					<p>Upon the argument of the case before the committee, the counsel for the
						sitting member read a clear and forcible opinion of Judge King, recently
						delivered in the contested election case for District Attorney in Franklin
						county, in which exactly the same questions were raised and decided. The
						high legal attainments, pure character and fervent loyalty of Judge King,
						entitles his opinion to great weight and respect. He held that deserters
						could not be disfranchised under the act of Congress, until they had been
						tried and convicted by due process of law. </p>
					<p>In the committee, the counsel for the sitting member proposed to rest this
						question with the Attorney General of the State; which was not allowed.</p>
					<p>If additional reasons were needed to convince the undersigned that he was
						right in not signing the majority report, they are to be found in the facts;
						1st, That after the sitting member had proposed to rest the whole case upon
						the legality of the "deserter vote," the contestant at first wholly refused
						to accept the issue thus tendered; and it was only after twenty-four hours
						of deliberation that he felt safe in trusting his own
							legal question to a committee composed of six member belonging to
						his party. 2d, Although the sitting member repeatedly declared his
						willingness to have the committee take the opinion of the Attorney General,
						yet the contestant has often, by his frequent silence, admitted that he was
							afraid of the light that great lawyer might
						cast upon the case. </p>
					<p>It will be observed that in the foregoing report the undersigned has quoted
						largely from the Constitution of the United States. His only excuse for
						doing so is, that in these latter days that sacred instrument has been
						almost worn away by the fierce and ceaseless attritions of newly discovered war powers and fine spun pleas of
							military necessity. The undersigned is not ashamed of the
						Constitution of his country; for it is a power with truth for the redemption
						and salvation of the oppressed and enslaved citizens from the usurpations of
						tyranny and the chains of fanaticism. </p>
					<p>Respectfully submitted by</p>
					<p>DAVID B. MONTGOMERY.</p>
