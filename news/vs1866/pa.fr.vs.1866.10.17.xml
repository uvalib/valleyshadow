                    <p>It would be useless to disguise that we feel considerably disappointed at
                        that result of the recent election. We confidently expected it to be
                        otherwise. But the unscrupulousness of our opponents and the corrupt means
                        to which they reacted again proved successful and disappointed our sanguine
                        hopes.</p>
                    <p>In this county Geary's majority is 193, carrying with it the whole Republican
                        county ticket. Sharpe is defeated in the district by 633. Col. Stumbaugh
                        runs behidd his ticket in this county something over 100 votes, leading Col.
                        McAllen, his competitor, 86 in the county. He and Shaman are both re-elected
                        however, Perry giving about 100 against ur. The returns from the State are
                        not all in yet, but the indications are that the majority for Geary will be
                        something less than 15,000.</p>
                    <p>It is never a profitable business after an election is over, to speculate as
                        to the causes which probably led to the result, but they are so apparent in
                        this case that we may be pardoned for glancing at them. We had never known
                        the Republican leaders to be so desperate and unscrupulous as they were
                        prior to this election. No falsehood was too great to utter if they thought
                        a vote could be gained for their party. It is admitted by all that it was
                        the large vote that defeated us in this county. The increased Republican
                        vote was secured mainly by the circulation among a certain class of people
                        of the most unmitigated falsehoods. These people, many of whom are owners of
                        United States securities, were told that if the Democratic party succeeded
                        the rebel debt would be assumed and these securities would depreciate and
                        perhaps become entirely worthless. That any portion of our citizens should
                        believe such stuff is almost incredible, and speaks very poorly for their
                        intelligence, but it is nevertheless true that very many who have not
                        heretofore been in the habit of voting, were driven to the polls by such
                        means. If the mad spirit of radicalism should succeed, as we fear it will,
                        in precipitating another war upon the country, we hope these pocket patriots
                        will have a happy time with their "bonds."</p>
                    <p>In addition to this wholesale lying of the Republican leaders, the corrupt
                        use of money and [UNCLEAR] foreign voters in certain districts aided largely
                        in our defeat. In this town votes were openly and shamelessly purchased at
                        prices ranging from five to twenty dollars. In other districts the same
                        means were used to corrupt the people in order to ensure a party triumph.
                        Where money failed, threats and intimidation were resorted to, such as rich
                        land owners threatening to turn of their poor tenants if they had failed to
                        vote the Republican ticket. Minors were suborned to commit perjury in order
                        to get in their votes, strangers were [UNCLEAR] in some districts and almost
                        every species of villany and [UNCLEAR] was practiced to secure a Republican
                        victory. Men voted the Republican ticket in this borough whom nobody knew
                        except those who brought them here to vote, and who left early the next
                        morning, perhaps never to return. In Green township, we are informed by
                        citizens of that township who have had every opportunity to know every voter
                        in that township, that men were brought to the polls to vote whose faces had
                        never been seen there before, and who had no known residence in the
                        district. And this , from the accounts we have, was the case elsewhere
                        throughout the county. And what is true of Franklin county is doubtless true
                        of the States generally. By such [UNCLEAR] and fraudulent [UNCLEAR] did our
                        opponents, and the opponents of peace and Union, succeed in gaining a
                        temporary triumphs in this State.</p>
                    <p>But these things cannot always continue. The party, sooner, or later, will
                        break down of its own corruption. The principle of the Democratic party must
                        ultimately prevail, or else free government will be a failure. The one
                        cannot long exist without the other. All the party has to do is to keep up
                        its organization and prepare for the next contest. We feel assured that time
                        in the end will vindicate the justice of its cause and give [UNCLEAR] to the
                        grand old historic party of the country.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party, notwithstanding its defeat, has no [UNCLEAR] for
                        despondency. It cast more votes on Tuesday a week for Hiester Clymer than
                        were ever before cast in this state for a candidate for Governor. This shows
                        the extraordinary vitality of the party. Nothing but the immense vote polled
                        and the desperate means resorted to by its opponents could have defeated it.
                        Under ordinary circumstances it would have been triumphantly successful. A
                        party that can poll over 4,100 votes in the county, and 300,000 in the
                        State, is far from being dead. It has exhibited a power and vitality which
                        even its enemies will respect.</p>
                    <p>If the result of this election were nothing more than the defeat of the
                        Democratic party, we should have but few regrets, but when we consider its
                        probable effect on the future of our beloved country, we confess that our
                        mind is filled with forebodings of evil. We hesitate to tear aside the
                        curtain which hides the future from our gaze. It makes us shudder to think
                        of the horrors, disasters and ruin which radicalism may have yet in store
                        for us as a people.</p>
                    <p>The Lancaster <emph rend="italic">Intelligencer</emph> truly says: "The
                        people were fully and faithfully warned against the infamous schemes of the
                        bold bad men who are now in the [UNCLEAR] throughout the North. They have
                        allowed themselves to be duped and deluded into the support of the [UNCLEAR]
                        which must affect disastrously all the best interests of this nation. That
                        they will reap the reward of their folly we verily believe, but with that
                        conviction is mingled the sad assurance that the nation must suffer for the
                        foolishness of those who refused to heed the warnings of history, and the
                        earnest entreaties of the wisest and purest statesmen of the land. </p>
                    <p>The future of this country is shrouded into gloom, and God alone knows how we
                        shall escape the perils which now beset us.--There is no reason to believe
                        that the Radicals will exhibit more moderation or decency in the future than
                        they have displayed in the past. The Conservative men of the nation are the
                        nation's hope, and they stand ready to do all that men can do to avert the
                        evil which threatens. It is their duty to stand by the right, and they will
                        do so as firmly in the future as they have in all the past."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The necessity of adopting a national policy that will at once re-establish
                        the old order of things in the Southern States, is strikingly apparent when
                        the industrial intrests and capacities of that section of the nation are
                        carefully considered. Independent of the cotton, rice, sugar, tobacco,
                        pitch, tar and turpentine that are furnished from the late revolted States,
                        they have admirable facilities for manufactories. Before the war the
                        attention of certain capitalists in Georgia and Alabama had been turned to
                        the question of manufacturing in those States and some cotton mills had been
                        erected and put in operation there. Of course, the war put a stop to all
                        enterprise of that kind, but now the matter is again agitated; and Governor
                        Patton of Alabama, has written a letter to the manufacturing companies in
                        that State and Georgia which is full of important facts and suggestions.
                        Although the local application of the Governor's letter is intended for his
                        own State still general conclusions are for the most part as applicable to
                        the people of Mississippi and to large portions of Louisiana and Texas.</p>
                    <p>After a full and minute survey of the general situation and future prospects
                        of Alabama with respect to labor, Governor Patton declares that it will not
                        be wise or expedient for the people to depend upon immigration to supply the
                        deficiency occasioned by the diminution of black agricultural labor. He
                        thinks it will be necessary for an indefinite period to rely mainly upon the
                        growth and cultivation of cotton in negro hands, no matter how diminished
                        the numbers may be by recent occurrences. The Governor urges the use of all
                        the laborers in the State. Those not available for that cultivation of
                        cotton, he says, may be turned to good account in the local manufacturing of
                        cotton goods after the raw material has been produced. The additional value
                        which may thus be imparted to cotton seems almost fabulous. But the results
                        attainable are matters of statistical certainty. The value of cotton can
                        thus be doubled, at the lowest calculation. The process is thus stated by
                        Governor Patton:</p>
                    <p>It may be stated as a general proposition and at the same time a simple one
                        that upon an average, one yard of cotton goods is worth as much as a pound
                        of raw material. The number of yards produced from a single pound, depends,
                        of course, upon the quality of the manufactured article. For instance, from
                        one pound of cotton, you make four yards of what is known, in mercantile
                        parlance, as four quarter brown muslin. These four yards would be worth
                        eighty cents; and thus we see that the process of manufacturing has added
                        sixty cents to the value of one pound of cotton. Taking this quality of
                        goods as a taste of calculation, we can plainly see how the value of a given
                        amount of raw material may be increased in value, until the finer article, a
                        single pound may be made to yield several dollars. But we [UNCLEAR] and
                        simple inducements for manufacturing enterprises by referring to the
                        plainest and simplest articles that can be made. We double the value of
                        cotton by converting into yarns, or common osnaburgs. Hence, we may take our
                        two hundred and fifty thousand bales worth twenty-five millions of dollars,
                        and if we manufacture nothing but the most ordinary articles, we may
                        increase its value to fifty millions; that is as much as [UNCLEAR] realized
                        from our former crop of one million bales.</p>
                    <p>The Governor argues that is the policy of the people living in the cotton
                        growing region of the South to swell by every [UNCLEAR] in their power the
                        ultimate value of that production. To do this in the most through and
                        remunerative manner, they must combine manufacturing with planting, and thus
                        reap a profit from both. What the extent of these profits may be under a
                        proper system, can be seen in the following statement made by Governor
                        Patton:</p>
                    <p>There are at Lowell ten large manufacturing establishments, all of which are
                        chartered corporations. The aggregate capital invested in these ten mills is
                        thirteen millions of dollars. The amount of cotton consumed is one hundred
                        thousand bales; the number of yards produced, (exclusive of yarns,)
                        something over a hundred millions and the number of operatives twelve
                        thousand. The operative are mostly women and girls. It would require at
                        least thirty thousand field laborers to raise this amount of cotton, and yet
                        it is converted into yarn and cloths by twelve thousand operatives. The
                        process of manufacturing the cotton as we have seen, will double its value,
                        even if nothing but the plainest and commonest articles be made; and yet
                        this process requires thirty thousand hands in the field to furnish the raw
                        material.</p>
                    <p>These are plain and positive figures, taken from sources of undoubted
                        reliability. It will be seen at once that the dividends paid upon these
                        Lowell mills must be highly remunerative. I have before me a comparative
                        list of the dividends recently declared for several of the incorporated
                        factories at Lowell, and elsewhere in the North, and they range from twenty
                        to forty per cent. per annum. It would, perhaps, be save to place the
                        average at thirty per cent., thus showing that the annual profits equal
                        nearly one-third of the capital invested. No dividend which I have seen
                        reported is as low as the legal interest of Alabama. Statistics such as
                        these tell their own story.--They are safe and unerring guides to all who
                        may seek to ascertain the profits of manufacturing and sure they afford
                        ample encouragement for Southern enterprise of this character.</p>
                    <p>The natural advantage for manufacturing which exist in the South are then
                        presented in a plain and forcible manner. One of these is a difference of
                        climate, which relieves the Southern manufacturer of large expense for the
                        creation of an artificial temperature necessary for the successful running
                        of machinery and the comfort of the operatives. In regard to water and fuel,
                        the South is favored by nature in a remarkable degree. But the most
                        prominent of all the advantages possessed by the South in the business of
                        manufacturing, Governor Patton finds in the fact, that she produces all the
                        raw material needed for that purpose on the spot. The greatness of this
                        advantage may be judged from the difference of not less than about ten cents
                        a pound in the price of cotton at Montgomery, Selma, or some other interior
                        town, and the prices at New York or Liverpool. According to Governor
                        Patton's reasoning, indeed, it would appear as unreasonable hereafter for
                        the South to send her cotton for manufacture to New England, as for England
                        to export all her iron, her flax, or her wool for the same purpose, ignoring
                        Sheffield, Birmingham, Manchester, or other seats of local manufacture, or
                        for France in like manner to ignore Lyons and other of her great
                        manufacturing towns by exporting all her raw silk.</p>
                    <p>Those who look at our country as a unit and recognize the fact that by
                        stimulating, in a just and proper manner, the productions and labor of one
                        section, the whole is benefited, will be interested in this letter of
                        Governor Patton, and his manly effort to build up an important branch of
                        national development and wealth in the Southern States. It may be premature
                        to think of the South as sending the inner articles of cotton manufactures
                        to England, or China, or Japan, at this time, or within the next five years.
                        But within that time, if they act upon the suggestions of Governor Patton,
                        they can supply Mexico, the West Indies, the South American States, and even
                        Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Baltimore with cotton goods, such as are
                        needed and will command a ready sale at paying prices for the manufacturer.
                        This is the first point to be reached, and Governor Patton has shown that it
                        is clearly within the range of possibility. This distinguished gentleman
                        deserves credit for his efforts to bluid up the material resources of the
                        South, and if the Radical politicians will cease their wicked attempts to
                        destroy the nation, Northern capital will soon flow in that direction to aid
                        in building manufactories and putting them in operation.--<emph
