                <summary>Ignoring the President's wishes, as well as his veto, Congress passed the
                    Civil Rights Bill, which, says the editorial, is a clear example of the
                    Radicals' absolute disregard for the people's desires. In addition to
                    criticizing the legislative body for its agenda, the piece also disputes the
                    constitutionality of its actions since representatives from the former rebel
                    states have not been seated, and their votes would have reversed the outcome.</summary>

                    Repository suggesting that the onus is on the southern states for their present
                    predicament. Had the former Confederates "accepted the issues of the war in good
                    faith," the Republican journal argues, "they might have been represented in

                    finally made public its report, which, the article states, has been criticized
                    not only by Democrats, but by a significant portion of the Republican Party as
                    well. The writer points out that even former supporters, such as Secretary
                    Stanton, have turned their backs on the Committee since it released its
                    recommendations.</summary>
