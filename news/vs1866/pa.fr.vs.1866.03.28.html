<b>An Old-Fashioned President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A celebratory piece focusing on Johnson's refusal to acquiesce to the
                    demands of the Radicals in Congress.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Practice vs. Profession</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite the Republicans' claims to the contrary, it is the Democrats, says
                    the editorial, who best represent the interests of the soldiers. As proof, the
                    writer points to the resolutions passed at the Democratic State Convention and a
                    measure recently introduced in Congress by Gen. Coffroth, of the Sixteenth
                    District, which would "equalize the bounties of all soldiers and sailors who
                    were mustered into the service" during the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Now and Then</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial argues that the Republicans' restoration policy is
                    hypocritical because it contradicts the line touted by them throughout the
                    conflict, that the states in rebellion had no right to leave the Union. Since
                    the war's end, however, they have repudiated their position by refusing to
                    readmit the Southern states.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Retraction</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After noting that the Harrisburg Telegraph made "a characteristically mean
                    and mendacious attack on John Gilmore," the clerk entrusted with the task of
                    distributing the Relief Fund to the people of Chambersburg, the Spirit goes on
                    to criticize the Republican journal further for its failure to take
                    responsibility for the slanderous assault, charging that it chose instead to
                    place the blame on the actions of one of its correspondents.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>John Cessna</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since leaving the Democratic Party, the article gleefully reports, John
                    Cessna's political fortunes have continued to sag. Although he was named
                    chairman of the Republican State Central Committee shortly after the switch, he
                    has seen his position decline precipitously since then. First losing his bid for
                    the party's gubernatorial nomination and then unable to regain his former post,
                    the Spirit revels in his misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lancaster Intelligencer</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial asserts that the testimony before the Reconstruction
                    Committee of Congress has been purposely misrepresented by the majority of the
                    committee to reflect its anti-Southern bias.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Brigadier General Geary</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a scathing report on Gen. Geary, the article asserts that the Republican
                    candidate for Governor is a "literary thief" and barely literate.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York World</blockquote>
<b>They Will Vote As They Fought</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article alleges that returning soldiers will undoubtedly cast their
                    ballots for the Democrats in the upcoming election because they understand that
                    it is the only way to "restore and preserve" the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Patriot &amp; Union</blockquote>
<b>The Blessings of Freedom to the Negro</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the number of reports detailing the deteriorating conditions of the
                    ex-slaves growing, Radicals, the piece declares, should seek ways to provide
                    blacks with bread instead of fighting to grant them suffrage.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>After the Soldiers</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Republicans have nominated Gen. Geary to represent their party in the
                    upcoming gubernatorial election, a decision the article claims is a blatant and
                    disingenuous attempt to woo the returning soldiers' vote.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Sunday Mercury</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column )<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Referring to the decision by Congress to apportion $20 million per year for
                    the freedmen, the brief piece notes that the same body has yet to "appropriate
                    one cent to the equalization and payment of bounties due white soldiers."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Geary Platform</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The brief article states that Gen. Geary fully supports Thaddeus Stevens'
                    agenda, including black suffrage, the Freedmen's Bureau, and "Disunion."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter to the Spirit's editor accusing the Repository's Washington
                    correspondent of negligence in his coverage of events in the capitol.<br>
